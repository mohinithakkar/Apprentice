at bedford school my father be a solicitor at hitchin and much esteem in the county of hertford he be also agent for many of the county family with whom he be in friendly intercourse my mother be the daughter of the respect clerk of the peace for bedfordshire a position of good influence which might be and be occasionally of great assistance to a young man commence he career at the bar to I it be of no importance whatever my father have a large family son and daughter of whom only two be live i mention this as a explanation of my early position when straiten circumstance compel a most rigid economy during no part of my educational career either at school or in the inn of court to which i belong have i anything but a small allowance from my father my life at home be as little worth tell as that of any other in the same social position and i pass it by merely state that after proper preparation i be pack off to bedford school for a few year my life there would have be a uninteresting blank but for a little circumstance which will presently be relate it be the custom then at this very excellent foundation to give mainly a classical education and doubtless i attain a very fair proficiency in my study have i cultivate they however with the same assiduity as i do many of my pursuit in after-life i might have attain some eminence as a professor of the dead language and arrive at the dignity of one of the master of bedford however if i have any ambition at that time it be not to become a professor of dead language but to see what i could make of my own it be of no interest to any one that i have great number of peg-top and marble or learn to be a pretty good swimmer in the ouse there be a greater swim prepare for I in after-life and that be the only reason for my refer to it in the year 1830 bedford schoolhouse occupy the whole of one side of st paul 's square which face the high street from that part of the building you command a view of the square and the beautiful country around the sleepy old bridge span the still more sleepy river over which lay the quiet road lead to the little village of willshampstead and it come along through the old square where the schoolhouse be it be market day in bedford and there be the usual concourse of buyer and seller tramp and country people in they Sunday gear farmer and they wife with itinerant vender of every saleable and unsaleable article from far and near i be in the upper schoolroom with another boy and look out of the window have a opportunity of watch all that take place for a considerable space there be a good deal of merriment to divert we attention for there be clown and merry-andrew pass along the highroad with singlestick player punch and judy show and other public amuser every one know that the smallest event in the country will cause a good deal of excitement even if it be so small a occurrence as a runaway horse there be however no runaway horse to-day but suddenly a great silence come over the people and a sullen gloom that make a great despondency in my mind without my know why public solemnity affect even the youngest of we at all event it affect I presently -- and deeply be the event impress on my mind after seventy year of a busy life full of almost every conceivable event -- i see emerge from a bystreet that lead from bedford jail and come along through the square and near the window where i be stand a common farm cart draw by a horse which be lead by a labor man as i be above the crowd on the first floor i could see there be a layer of straw in the cart at the bottom and above it tumble into a rough heap as though carelessly throw in a quantity of the same and i could see also from all the surround circumstance especially the pallid face of the crowd that there be something sad about it all the horse move slowly along at almost a snail 's pace while behind walk a poor sad couple with they head bow down and each with a hand on the tail-board of the cart they be evidently overwhelm with grief happily we have no such procession now even justice itself have be humanize to some extent and the law 's cruel severity mitigate the cart contain the rude shell into which have be lay the body of this poor man and woman 's only son _ a youth of seventeen hang that morning at bedford jail for set fire to a stack of corn _ he be now be convey to the village of willshampstead six mile from bedford there to be lay in the little churchyard where in he childhood he have play he be the son of very respectable labor people of willshampstead have be mislead into commit what be more a boyish freak than a crime and be hang that be all the authority could do for he and they do it this be the remotest and the saddest reminiscence of my life and the only sad one i mean to relate if i can avoid it but year afterwards when i become a judge this picture photograph on my mind as it be give I many a lesson which i believe be turn to good account on the judicial bench it be mainly useful in impress on my mind the great consideration of the surround circumstance of every crime the _ degree _ of guilt in the criminal and the difference in the degree of the same kind of offence about this i shall say something hereafter i remain at this school until i have acquire all the learn my father think necessary for my future position as he intend it to be and much more than i think necessary unless i be to get my living by teach latin and greek in due course i be article to my worthy uncle the clerk of the peace and have i possess my present experience should have know that it be a diplomatic move of the most profound policy to enable I if anything happen to he to succeed to that important dignity have i be ambitious of wealth there be other office which my uncle hold to the great satisfaction of the county as well as he own these would naturally descend to I and i should have be in a position of great prominence in the county with a very respectable income but i hate the drudgery of a attorney 's office in six month i see enough of its documentary evidence to convince I that i hate it from my heart and that nothing on earth would induce I to become a solicitor i take good care meek as i be to show this determination to my friend it be my only chance of escape but while remain there it be my duty to work however hateful the task and i do so even this to I most odious business have its advantage in after-life i attend one morning with my uncle the petty session of hertford where no doubt i be suppose to enlarge my knowledge of session practice it certainly do so for i know nothing and receive a lesson which be not only my earliest recollection but my first experience in _ advocacy _ at this hertford petty sessional division the chairman be a somewhat pompous clergyman but very devoted to he duty he be strict in he application of the law when he know it but it be fortunate for some delinquent although unfortunate for other that he do not always possess sufficient knowledge to act independently of he clerk 's opinion while the clerk 's opinion do not always depend upon he knowledge of law a impudent vagabond be bring up before this clergyman charge with a violent and unprovoked assault on a man in a public-house he be say to have go into the room where the prosecutor be and to have take up he jug of ale and appropriate the contents to he own use without the owner 's consent the prosecutor annoy at the outrage rise and be immediately knock down by the interloper and in fall cut he head there be to my untutored mind no defense but the accuse be a man of remarkable cunning and not a little ingenuity he know the magistrate well and he special weakness which be vanity by he knowledge the man completely outwit he adversary and shift the charge from himself on to the prosecutor 's shoulder the curious thing be he cross-examine the reverend chairman instead of the witness which i think a master-stroke of policy if not advocacy you know this public-house sir he ask the reverend gentleman nod i put it to yourself sir as a gentleman : how would you have like it if another man have come to you house and drunk you beer there be no necessity to give a answer to this question it answer itself the reverend gentleman would not have like it and see this the accuse continue -- well you honor this here man come and take my beer ` halloa jack ' i ses ` no more o ' that ' ` no ' he say ` there be no more it be all go ' ` stop a bit say i ` that wu not do nuther ' ` that wu not do ' he say ` wool that do ' and he up with the jug and hit I a smack in the mouth and down i go clean on the floor he then fall atop of I and right on the pot he hold in he hand which break with he fall bein ' a earthenware jug and cut he head and ` sarve he right ' i hope you honor 'll say and the proof of which statement be sir that there be the cut o ' that jug on he forehead plainly visible for anybody to see at this present moment now sir what next for there be summat else ` jack ' say i ` i 'll summon you for this assault ' ` yes ' he say ` and so 'll i i 'll have ee afore he worship mr knox ' ` afore he worship mr knox ' say i ` and why not afore he worship the rev mr hull he be the gentleman for my money -- a real gentleman as 'll hear reason and do justice atween man and man ' ` what ' say jack with a oath that i be not go to repeat afore a clergyman -- ` what ' he say ' a d -- d old dromedary like that ' ` dromedary sir ' mean you worship do anybody ever hear such wile word against a clergyman let alone a magistrate sir and he then have the cheek to come here and ask you to believe he ` old dromedary ' say he -- ' a d -- d old dromedary ' mr hull the reverend chairman be naturally very indignant not that he mind on he own account as he say -- that be of no consequence -- but a man who could use such foul language be not to be believe on he oath he therefore dismiss the summons and order the prosecutor to pay the cost i think both my father and uncle still nurse the idea that i be to become the good old-fashioned county attorney for they perpetually ring in my ear the praise of we bench and we chairman out bench be by far the biggest thing in hertfordshire except when a couple of notable come down to contest the heavy-weight championship or some other noble prize for myself i can truly say i have no ambition at this time beyond earn my bread for i pretty well know i have to trust entirely to my own exertion the fortunate have many friend and it be just the fortunate who be best without they i have none and desire none if they be to advise I against my inclination my term be now expire for i loyally pursued my study to the bitter end my mind be make up ambition or no ambition for the bar or the stage like most young man i love act and quite believe i would succeed my passion for the stage be encourage by a old schoolfellow of my father 's when he be at rugby for whom i have as a boy a great admiration i forget whether in after-life i retain it for we drift apart and we divergent way continue they course without we meeting again any worse decision so far as my friend be concern could not be conceive they both remonstrate solemnly and be deeply touch with what they see be my impending ruin especially the ruin of they hope in vain however do they attempt to persuade I my mind be as fix as the mind of two-and-twenty can be have warn I in term of severity they now address I in the language of affection and ask how i could be so headstrong and foolish as to attempt the bar at which it be clear that i could only succeed after work about twenty year as a special pleader they next set before I as a terrible warning my uncle another brother of my father 's who have go to the bar and i will not say never have any practice for i believe he practice a good deal on the norfolk broad and once have a brief at session concern the irremovability of a pauper which he conduct much to the satisfaction of the pauper although i believe the solicitor never give he another brief however we family trio could not go on for ever quarrel and at last they make a compromise with I much to my satisfaction my father undertake to allow I a hundred a year for five year and after that time it be to cease automatically whether i sink or swim with this solemn proviso however for the soothing of he conscience : that if i sink _ my fate be to be upon my own head _ i agree also to that part of the business and accept the term start for london chapter ii in my uncle 's office i ought to mention in speaking of my ancestor that i have a very worthy godfather who be half-brother to my father he be connect with a family of great respectability at royston in cambridgeshire and inherit from they a moderate-sized land estate a portion of this property be a little farm situate at _ brampton _ in huntingdonshire from which village i take the title i now enjoy the farm be leave however to my aunt for life who live to a good old age as most life-tenant do whom you expect to succeed and i get nothing until it be of no use to I when i come into possession i be make a very fair income at the bar and the probability be my aunt do I unconsciously the greatest kindness she could in keep I out of it so long so much for my ancestor about the rest of they i know nothing except a anecdote or two there be one more event in my boyhood which i will mention because it be historic i assist my father on my little pony in proclaim william iv on he accession to the throne and i mention it with the more pride because have be create a peer of the realm by she late gracious majesty queen victorium i be qualify to assist as a member of the privy council at the accession of he present most gracious majesty and have the honor to hear he announce himself as _ king edward of england _ by the title of _ edward the seventh _ arrive in london full of good advice and abundance of warning as to the fate that await I i enter as a pupil the chamber of a famous special pleader of that time whose name be frederick thompson this be in the year 1841 i have the right to say i work very hard there for several month and study with all my might nor be the study distasteful i be learn something which would be useful to I in after-life moreover be endow with pluck and energy i want to show that my uncle -- for the godfather warn I as well -- and my father be false prophet so i give myself up entirely to the acquisition of knowledge this be absolutely necessary if i be to make anything of my future career sink or swim my father say be the alternative so i be resolve to keep my head above water if possible after be at thompson 's my allotted period i next go to mr george butt a very able and learn man who afterwards become a queen 's counsel but never a advocate i acquire while with he a good deal of knowledge that be invaluable become he favorite pupil and be in due course entrust with papers of great responsibility so that in time it come to pass that mr butt would send off my opinion without any correction these be small thing to talk of now but they be great then and the foundation of what to I be great thing to come although i little suspect any of they at that time and as i look back over that long stretch of year i have the satisfaction of feeling that i do not enter upon my precarious career without do my utmost to fit myself for it in those early day of the century prize-fight be very common in england the noble art of self-defence be patronize by the greatest in the land society love a prize-fight and always go to see it as society go to any other fashionable function magistrate go and even clerical member of that August body as magistrate it may have be they duty to discountenance but as county gentleman it be they privilege to support the noble champion of the art especially when they have they money on the event the magistrate if they presence be ever discover say they go to prevent a breach of the peace but if they be unable to effect this laudable object they look on quietly so as to prevent any one commit a breach of the peace on themselves they individual head be worth something it be to one of these exhibition of valor between _ owen swift _ and _ brighton bill _ that a reverend and sport magistrate take my brother john a nice good schoolboy in a tall hat he think it be the right thing that the boy should _ see the world _ i thought also that what be good for john as prescribe by he clerical adviser would not be bad for I so i go as well there be a great crowd of course but i keep my eye on john 's tall chimney-pot hat know that while i see that i should not lose john presently there be a stir for brighton bill have land a tremendous blow on the cheek of owen swift and while we be applaud as be the custom at prize-fight and public dinner a cunning pickpocket standing immediately behind john push the tall chimney-pot hat tightly down over the boy 's eye he little hand which have be in he pocket go up in a moment to raise he hat so that he might see the world the big object he have come to see and immediately in go two other hand and out come the savings of john 's life -- two precious half-crown which he have show to I with great pride that very morning when he see the world again the rogue have disappear the famous place for these pugilistic encounter or one of the famous place be a spot call noon 's folly which be within a very few mile of royston where the county of cambridge suffolk essex and hertfordshire meet or most of they that be the scene of many a stiff encounter and although of course there be both magisterial and police interference when the knowledge reach they that a fight be about to take place within they particular jurisdiction by some singular misadventure the knowledge never reach they until they worship be return from the battle all be over before any _ official _ communication be make \* \* \* \* \* i be enter of the middle temple on April 16 1839 and remain with mr butt until i have keep sufficient term to qualify I to take out a licence to plead on my own account which i do at the earliest possible date this be a great step in my career although of course the licence do not enable I to plead in court as i be not call to the bar if work come i should now be in a fair way to attain independence but the prospect be by no means flattering it be in fact all but hopeless while the position of a special pleader be not my ambition the lookout in fact be anything but encourage from the fifth floor of _ no 3 elm court _ -- i mean prospectively it be a region not inaccessible of course but it look on to a landscape of chimney-pot not one of which be likely to attract attorney it be cheap and lonely dull and miserable -- a melancholy altitude beyond the world and its companionship have i be of a melancholy disposition i might have go mad for hope surely never come to a fifth floor but there i sit day by day week by week and month by month wait for the knock that never come hope for the business that might never come hundred of time do i listen with vain expectation to the footstep on the stair below -- footstep of attorney and clerk messenger and office-boy i know they all and that be all i know of they down below at the bottom flight they tramp and there they mostly stop the ground floor be evidently the best for business but some come higher to the first floor that be a good position there be plenty of footstep and i could tell they be the footstep of client a few come a little higher still and then my hope rise with the footstep now some one have come up to the third floor : he stop alas there be the knock one single hard knock : it be a junior clerk the sound come all too soon for I and i turn from my own door to my little den and look out of my window up into the sky from whence it seem i might just as well expect a brief as from the region below this be not quite true on another occasion some bold adventurer ascend with asthmatical energy to the _ fourth floor _ and i think as i hear he wheeze he would never have breath enough to get down again and wonder if the good-natured attorney keep these wheezy old gentleman out of charity but it be rare indeed that the climber unless it be the rent collector reach that floor the fifth landing be too remote for the postman for i never get a letter -- at least so it seem and no squirrel watch from the topmost bough of the tallest pine could be more lonely than i at last i think a step have pass even the fourth landing and be approach mine but i would not think too fast and damp my hope a little on purpose lest they should burn too brightly and too fast i be not mistake : there _ be _ a footstep on my landing and i listen for the one heavy knock it seem to I i wait about a hour and a half judge by the palpitation of my heart and wish the man have knock as vigorously but i be reward : the knocker fall and as my boy be away with the toothache i open the door myself he be the same wheezy man i have hear below some time before and i really seem to have like asthmatical people ever since -- except when i become a judge and they disturb I in court papers that be enough to say to any one who understand the situation you may be sure i give they my best attention that they be finish promptly and as i hope in the best style if i have require any additional incentive to keep I to my daily task of watch this would have be sufficient but i want none i know that my whole future depend upon it and there i be from ten in the morning till ten at night my first fee be small but it be the biggest fee i ever have it be 10s 6d i be only a special pleader and with some papers we fee be even less we only have to _ draw _ pleading not to open they in court -- that come after you be call to the bar draw they mean really draw the point of the case for counsel and open they mean a gabble epitome of they to the jury which no jury in this world ever yet understand or ever will this little matter be the forerunner of other and by little and little i steadily go on earn a few shilling now and a few shilling then but best of all become know little by little here and there i be aware that some knowledge of the world would be necessary for I when i once get into it by way of business as a advocate so i come to the conclusion that it would be well to commence that branch of study as soon as i close the other for the day -- or rather for the night i have not far to go to school only to the haymarket and its delightful purlieus and there be the best teacher to be find in the world and the most recondite study for all these i keep as the great politician say a open mind and learn a great deal which stand I in good stead in after-life it be not necessary i suppose in write these reminiscence to describe all i saw -- at least i hope not manners have so change since that time that people who have no imagination would not believe I and those who have would imagine i be exaggerate so i must skip this portion of my youthful study merely say that i see nearly if not _ quite _ all the life which be to be see in london and i be sure i be not exaggerate when i say that that would nearly fill a octavo volume of itself there be so much to be see in london as a dear old lady i use to drink tea with once tell I but she do not know more than i for she have never see the night-houses gambling hell and other place of amusement that at that time be open all night long nor have she see the ghastly face of the morning i attribute my escape the consequence of all these allurement to the beautiful influence which my mother in early life exercise over I as i attribute my knowledge of they to the removal of the restraint with which my earlier year have be curb my mother die before i come to london but undoubtedly she influence be with I although i break loose as a matter of course from all paternal control but i be never a man about town to be that you must have plenty of money or none at all and in either case you be a object to avoid i have nevertheless a great many pleasure that a young man from the country can enjoy i love horse-racing cricket and the prize-ring it be not because pugilism be a fashionable amusement in those day that i attend a set-to occasionally i go on my own account not to ape people in the fashionable world and enjoy it on my own account not because they like it but because i do my rent at this time of my entrance into the fashionable world be # 12 a year my laundress perhaps a little less she earn it by come up the stair but she be a good old soul i remember she long year after and always with gratitude for she many kindness in those gloomy day she name be hannem of course i have to buy the necessary book for my professional use coal and other thing and after pay all these i have to live on the narrow margin of my # 100 a year this recollection be very please i never get into debt and never want but i have to be frugal and avoid every unnecessary expense but the time at last come when i be no longer to rest on my lonely perch at the top of elm court i have keep my term and be duly call to the bar of the middle temple on may 3 1843 just fifty year after when i be a judge and almost the senior bencher of my inn we illustrious sovereign then prince of wale who be also a bencher of the middle temple favor we with he presence at dinner and do I the honor to propose my health in a gracious speech on return thanks for this kindness i tell the crowded audience of my _ jubilee _ and point out the spot where fifty year before i have hold my call party chapter iii second year -- thesiger and platt -- my first brief in my second year i make fifty pound the sweetest fifty pound i ever make i have no longer any weary wait for there be no weariness in it and i confess at this time my sole idea and i may add my only ambition be to relieve myself of all obligation to my father if i could accomplish this i should have vindicate the step i have take and my father would have no further right whatever reason he might think he have to complain my third year come and then to my great joy finding that i be earn more than the hundred pound he allow I i write and inform he with all proper expression of gratitude that i should no longer need he assistance and from that time i never have a single farthing that i do not earn i be sure i be prouder of that than of my peerage for i experience for the first time the joyous pride of independence there be no fruit of labor so sweet as that but i no sooner begin to obtain a little success than my rival and other try to deprive I of the merit of it if merit there be -- oh of course he father and uncle be both solicitor in the county while one of the local newspaper year after be good enough to publish a paragraph which state that i owe all my success to my father 's office this of course do not need contradiction a occasional small brief from hitchin be the beginning and the end of my father 's influence while session practice be not the practice i hope to finish my career with although i have little hope of eminence certainly if i have i should have know that eminence could not come from hitchin i choose the home circuit and do not leave it till i be make a judge it be impossible to forget the kindness i receive from its member throughout my whole career there be a brotherly feeling amongst we which make life very pleasant there be several celebrated man on the home circuit when i join amongst they be thesiger and platt this be long before the former become attorney-general which take place in 1858 he afterwards be lord chancellor and take he title from the little county town where probably he obtain he start in the career which end so brilliantly platt become a baron of the exchequer thesiger be a first-rate advocate and i need not say be at all time scrupulously fair he have a high sense of honor and be replete with a quiet subtle humor which seem to come upon you unaware and like all true humor derive no little of its pleasure from its surprise in addition to he ability thesiger be ever kind-hearted and gentle especially in he manner towards junior i know that he sympathize with they and help they whenever he have a opportunity it do not fall to my lot to hold many briefs with he but i be glad to say that i have some because i shall not forget the kindness and instruction i receive from he platt be a advocate of a different stamp he also be kind and in every way worthy of grateful remembrance he love to amuse especially the junior bar and more particularly in court he be a good natural punster and endowed with a lively wit the circuit be never dull when platt be present but there be one trait in he character as a advocate that judge always profess to disapprove of -- he love popular applause and he singularly bold and curious mode of cross-examination sometimes bring he both rebuke and hearty laughter from the most austere of judge he deal with a witness as though the witness be putty mould he into any grotesque form that suit he humor no evidence could preserve its original shape after platt have do with it he have a coax manner so much so that a witness would often be lead to say what he never intend and what afterwards he could not believe he have utter thesiger who be he constant opponent be sometimes irritated with platt 's manner and on the occasion i be about to mention fairly lose he temper it be in a action for nuisance before tindal chief justice of the common plea at croydon assize thesiger be for the plaintiff who complain of a nuisance cause by the bad smell that emanate from a certain tank on the defendant 's premise and call a very respectable but ignorant labor man to prove he case the witness give a description of the tank not picturesque but doubtless true and into this tank all kind of refuse seem to have be throw so that the vilest of foul stench be emit platt begin he cross-examination of poor hodge by ask he in he most coaxing manner to describe the character and nature of the various stench have hodge be scientific or if he have have a little common sense he would have simply answer _ bad _ character and _ ill _ - nature but he improve on this simplicity and say -- some on 'em smell summat _ like paint _ this be quite sufficient for platt come now say he that be a very sensible answer you be aware as a man of undoubted intelligence that there be various color of paint have this smell any _ particular color _ think you wall i dunnow sir do not answer hurriedly take you time we only want to get at the truth now what color do you say this smell belong to wall i do not raightly know sir i see but what do you say to _ yellow _ have it a yellow smell think you wall sir i doa not think ur wus yaller nuther no sir not quite yaller i think it be moore of a blue like a blue smell we all know a blue smell when we see it of course i need not say the laughter be go on in peal much to platt 's delight tindal be simply in a ecstasy but do all he could to suppress he enjoyment of the scene then platt resume -- you think it be more of a blue smell like now let I ask you there be many kind of blue smell from the smell of a blue peter which be salt to that of the sky which depend upon the weather be it dark or -- a kind of sky-blue sir more like you scarf up go hodge 's hand to see if he could feel the color yes say he that be more like -- zummut like you scarf yes sir then he be ask as to a variety of solid and liquid and the man shake he head intimate that he could go a deuce of a way but that there be bound even to human knowledge then platt question he on less abstruse topic and to all of he question he keep answer -- yes my lord be fish remnant ask platt sometimes throw into this reservoir of filth such as old cod ' head with goggle eye yes my lord _ rarus nante in gurgite vasto _ yes my lord thesiger could stand it no longer he have be writhe while the court have be roar with laughter which all the usher in the universe could not suppress my lord my lord there must be some limit even to cross-examination by my friend do you lordship think it be fair to suggest a classical quotation to a respectable but illiterate labourer tindal who could not keep he countenance -- and no man who witness the scene could -- say -- it all depend mr thesiger whether this man understand latin whereupon platt immediately turn to the witness and say -- now my man attend : _ rarus nante in gurgite vasto _ you understand that do you not yes my lord answer the witness stroke he chin tindal try all he could to suppress he laughter say : mr thesiger the witness say he understand the quotation and as you have no evidence to the contrary i do not see how i can help you of course there be a renewal of the general laughter but thesiger in he reply turn it on platt this be my first appearance on circuit and my first lesson from a great advocate in the art of caricature \* \* \* \* \* no man at the bar can forget the joy of he first brief -- that wonderful oblong packet of white papers tie with the mysterious pink tape which he fourth share of the diminutive clerk bring he mark with the important i gua i speak not to stall-fed junior who have not to wait till they merit be discover and who know that whosoever may watch and wait and hope or despair they shall have enough all blessing go with they i never envy they they heritage they be bear to briefs as the spark fly upwards i tell my experience to those who will understand and appreciate every word i say -- to man who have to make they way in the world by they own exertion and live on they own labor or die of disappointment there be one consolation even for the wretched waiter on solicitor ' favor and that be that the man who have never have to work they way seldom rise to eminence or to any position but respectable mediocrity they never know hope and will never know what it be to despair or to nibble the short herbage of the common where poorer creature browse a father never look on he firstborn with more pleasure than a barrister on he first brief if the tower gun be announce the birth of a heir to the throne he would not look up to ask what be that it be the turning-point of my life for have there be no first brief pretty soon i should have think my kind relation ' prediction be about to be verify but i should never have return home there be still the stage leave on which i hope to act my part strange to say my first brief like almost everything in my life have a little touch of humor in it i be instruct to defend a man at hertford session for steal a wheelbarrow and unfortunately the wheelbarrow be find on he more unfortunate still -- for i might have make a good speech on the subject of the _ animus furandus _ -- the man not only tell the policeman he steal it but plead guilty before the magistrate i be therefore in the miserable condition of one doom to failure take what line i pleased there be nothing to be say by way of defense but i learn a lesson never to be forget be a little too conscientious i tell my client the attorney that in the circumstance i must return the brief inasmuch as there be no defense for the unhappy prisoner the attorney seem to admire my principle and instead of take offence smile in a good-natured manner and say it be no doubt a difficult task he have impose on I and he would exchange the brief for another he keep he word and by-and-by return with a much easier case -- a prosecution where the man plead guilty it be a grand triumph and i be much pleased those be early day to begin pick and choose briefs for no man can do that unless he be much more want by client than in want of they but i learn the secret in after life of a great deal of its success i be however a little chagrined when i see the mistake i have make rodwell be leader of the session and ought to have be far above a guinea brief judge then of my surprise when i see that same brief a few minute after accept by that great man -- the brief i have refuse because there be nothing to be say on the prisoner 's behalf my curiosity be excite to see what rodwell would do with it and what defense he would set up it be soon gratified he simply admit the prisoner 's guilt and hope the chairman who be lord salisbury would deal leniently with he i could have do that quite as well myself and pocket the guinea from that moment i resolve never to turn a case away because it be hopeless i subjoin a copy of my first brief for the prosecution it must be remember that in those day the gallows be a very popular institution they punish severely even trivial offence and this case would have be consider a very serious one while a sentence of seven year ' transportation be almost as good as a acquittal _ hert no 10 _ michaelma session 1844 regina _

apprehension various account exam before j -- j -- propy find mr steven -rcb- mr johnson -rcb- witness i make a rule throughout my professional life to note my case with the greatest care chapter iv at the old bailey in the old time it be a vast space to look back over sixty year of labor and yet there seem hardly a scene or a event of any consequence that be not reproduce in my mind with a vividness that astonish I in my earlier visit to she majesty 's court of justice my principal business be to study the queen 's counsel and serjeant and they be worthy the attention i bestow on they they all belong to different school of advocacy and some know very little about it i go to the old bailey a den of infamy in those time not conceivable now and i verily believe that no future time will produce its like -- at least i hope not its association be enough to strike a chill of horror into you it be the very cesspool for the offscouring of humanity i have no taste for criminal practice in those day except as a means of learn the art of advocacy in these case preside over by a judge who know he work the rule of evidence be strictly observe and you will learn more in six month of practical advocacy than in ten year elsewhere the criminal court be the best school in which to learn you work of cross-examination and examination-in-chief while the court of equity be probably the worst but i shall not dwell on my struggle in connection with the old bailey at that early period of my life what will be more interesting perhaps be some curious arrangement which they have for the conduct of business and the entertainment of the judge these be a too much neglect part of we history and when refer to in reminiscence be generally refer to as matter for jocularity they exercise however a serious influence on the mind and feeling of the people as well as they manners more so than a hundred subject with which the historian or the novelist sometimes deal in all case of unusual gravity three judge sit together offence that would now be treat as not even deserving of a day 's imprisonment in many case be then invariably punish with death it be not therefore so much the nature of the offence as the importance of it in the eye of the judge that cause three of they to sit together and try the criminal they sit till five o'clock right through and then go to a sumptuous dinner provide by the lord mayor and alderman they drink everybody 's health but they own thoroughly relieve they mind from the horror of the court and have indulge in much festive wit sometimes at a alderman 's expense and often at they own return into court in solemn procession they gravity undisturbed by anything that have previously take place and look the picture of contentment and virtue another dinner be provide by the sheriff this be for the recorder common serjeant and other who take they seat when they lordship have arise i ought to mention one important dignitary -- namely the chaplain of newgate -- whose fortunate position give he the advantage over most person : for he _ dine at both these dinner _ and assist in the circulation of the wit from one party to another so that what my lord chief justice have make the table roar with at five o'clock the recorder and the common serjeant roar with at six and be able to retail at they family table at a later period of the evening it be in that way so many good thing have come down to the present day the reverend gentleman allude to of course attend the court in robe and he only but solemn function be to say aman when the sentence of death be pronounce by the judge there be curious old story too about my lord and old port at that time which be not of my own reminiscence and therefore i shall do no more than mention they in order to pass on to what i hear and see myself the first thing that strike I in the after-dinner trial be the extreme rapidity with which the proceedings be conduct as judge and counsel be exhilarate the business be proportionately accelerate but of all the man i have the pleasure of meeting on these occasion the one who give I the best idea of rapidity in a after-dinner case be mirehouse let I illustrate it by a trial which i hear jone be the name of the prisoner he offence be that of pick pocket entail of course a punishment correspond in severity with the barbarity of the time it be not a plea of guilty when perhaps a little more inquiry might have be necessary it be a case in which the prisoner solemnly declare he be not guilty and therefore have a right to be try the accuse have hold up he hand and the jury have solemnly swear to hearken to the evidence and to well and truly try and true deliverance make etc the witness for the prosecution climb into the box which be like a pulpit and before he have time to look round and see where the voice come from he be examine as follow by the prosecute counsel : -- i think you be walk up ludgate hill on Thursday 25th about half-past two in the afternoon and suddenly feel a tug at you pocket and miss you handkerchief which the constable now produce be that it yes sir i suppose you have nothing to ask he say the judge next witness constable stand up be you follow the prosecutor on the occasion when he be rob on ludgate hill and do you see the prisoner put he hand into the prosecutor 's pocket and take this handkerchief out of it yes sir judge to prisoner : nothing to say i suppose then to the jury : gentleman i suppose you have no doubt i have none jury : guilty my lord as though to oblige he lordship judge to prisoner : jone we have meet before -- we shall not meet again for some time -- seven year ' transportation next case time : two minute fifty-three seconds perhaps this case be a high example of expedition because it be not always that a learn counsel could put he question so neatly but it may be take that these after-dinner trial do not occupy on the average more than _ four minute _ each chapter v mr justice maule of course in those day there be judge of the utmost strictness as there be now who insist that the rule of evidence should be rigidly adhere to i may mention one whose ability be of a remarkable order and whose memory be still fresh in the mind of many of my contemporary -- i mean mr justice maule he asthmatic cough be the most interesting and amusing cough i ever hear especially when he be say anything more than usually humorous which be not infrequently he be a man of great wit sound sense and a curious humor such as i never hear in any other man he possess too a particularly keen apprehension to those who have any real ability he be the most pleasant of judge but he have little love for mediocrity no man ever be endowed with a greater abhorrence of hypocrisy i learn a great deal in watch he and note he observation one day a very sad case be be try it be that of a man for kill a infant and it be propose by the prosecution to call as a witness a little brother of the murder child the boy 's capacity to give evidence however be somewhat doubt by the counsel for the crown john clark and it do honor to he sense of fairness have ask the little boy a question or two as to the meaning of a oath he say he have some doubt as to whether the witness should be admit to give evidence as he do not seem to understand the nature of a oath and the boy be otherwise deficient in religious knowledge he be ask the usual sensible question which st thoma aquina himself would have be puzzle to answer and be a mere child of seven -- or at most eight -- year of age without any kind of education be unable to state what the exact nature of a oath be have fail in this he be next ask what when they die become of people who tell lie if he know that it be a good deal more than i do say maule attend to I say the crown counsel do you know that it be wicked to tell lie yes sir the boy answer i do not think say the counsel for the prosecution it would be safe to swear he my lord he do not seem to know anything about religion at all -- you can stand down stop a minute my boy say maule let I ask you a question or two you have be ask about a future state -- at least i presume that be at the bottom of the gentleman 's question i should like to know what you have be teach to believe what will become of _ you _ my little boy when you die if you be so wicked as to tell a lie _ hell fire _ answer the boy with great promptitude and boldness right say maule now let we go a little further do you mean to say boy that you would go to hell fire for tell _ any _ lie _ hell fire _ sir say the boy emphatically as though it be something to look forward to rather than shun take time my boy say maule do not answer hurriedly think it over suppose now you be accuse of steal a apple how would that be in the next world think you _ hell fire _ my lord very good indeed now let we suppose that you be disobedient to you parent or to one of they what would happen in that case _ hell fire _ my lord exactly very good indeed now let I take another instance and suppose that you be send for the milk in the morning and take _ just a little sip _ while you be carry it home how would that be as regard you future state _ hell fire _ repeat the boy upon this clark suggest that the lad 's absolute ignorance of the nature of a oath and divine thing render it imprudent to call he i do not know about that say maule he seem to I to be very sound and most divine will tell you he be right he do not seem to be competent say the counsel i beg you pardon return the judge i think he be a very good little boy he think that for every wilful fault he will go to hell fire and he be very likely while he believe that doctrine to be most strict in he observance of truth if you and i believe that such would be the penalty for every act of misconduct we commit we should be better man than we be let the boy be swear on one occasion before maule i have to defend a man for murder it be a terribly difficult case because there be no defense except the usual one of insanity the court adjourn for lunch and woollet -lrb- who be my junior -rrb- and i go to consultation i be oppress with the difficulty of my task and ask woollet what he think i could do oh say he in he sanguine way make a hell of a speech you 'll pull he through all right let 'em have it i 'll give they as much burning eloquence as i can manage say i in my youthful ardor but what be the use of word against fact we must really stand by the defense of insanity it be all that be left call the clergyman say woollet he 'll help we all he can with that resolution we return to court i make my speech for the defense follow woollet 's advice as nearly as practicable and really blaze away i think the jury believe there be a good deal in what i say for they seem a very discerning body and a good deal incline to logic especially as there be a mixture of passion in it we then call the clergyman of the village where the prisoner live he say he have be vicar for thirty-four year and that up to very recently a few day before the murder the prisoner have be a regular attendant at he church he be a married man with a wife and two little child one seven and the other nine do the wife attend you ministration too ask maule not so regularly suddenly continue the vicar after suppress he emotion without any apparent cause the man become _ a sabbath-breaker _ and absent himself from church this evidence rather puzzle I for i could not understand its purport maule in the meantime be watch it with the keenest interest and no little curiosity he be not a great believer in the defense of insanity -- except occasionally that of the solicitor who set it up -- and consequently watch the vicar with scrutinize intensity have you finish with you witness mr woollet he lordship inquire yes my lord maule then take he in hand and after look at he steadfastly for about a minute say -- you say sir that you have be vicar of this parish for _ four-and-thirty year _ yes my lord and during that time i dare say you have regularly perform the service of the church yes my lord do you have week-day service as well every Tuesday my lord and do you preach you own sermon with a occasional homily of the church you own sermon or discourse with a occasional homily and be this poor man a regular attendant at all you service during the whole time you have be vicar until he kill he wife my lord that follow -- i mean up to the time of this sabbath-breaking you speak of he regularly attend you ministration and then kill he wife exactly my lord never miss the sermon discourse or homily of the church Sunday or week-day that be so my lord do you write you own sermon may i ask oh yes my lord maule carefully write down all that we witness say and i begin to think the defense of insanity stand on very fair grounds especially when i perceive that maule be make some arithmetical calculation but you never could tell by he manner which way he be go and therefore we have to wait for he next observation which be to this effect : -- you have give yourself sir a very excellent character and doubtless by you long service in the village have richly deserve it you have no doubt also win the affection of all you parishioner probably that of the bishop of you diocese by you incomparable devotion to you parochial duty the result however of you indefatigable exertion so far as this unhappy man be concerned come to this -- he lordship then turn and address he observation on the result to I this gentleman mr hawkin have write with he own pen and preach or read with he own voice to this unhappy prisoner about _ one hundred and four Sunday sermon or discourse with a occasional homily every year _ there be a irresistible sense of the ludicrous as maule utter or rather growl these word in a slow enunciation and a asthmatical tone he pause as if wonder at the magnitude of he calculation and then commence again more slowly and solemnly than before these say he add to the week-day service -- make -- exactly _ one hundred and fifty-six sermon discourse and homily for the year _ -lrb- then he stare at I ask with he eye what i thought of it -rrb- these again be continue over a space of time comprise as the reverend gentleman tell we no less than _ thirty-four year _ give we a grand total of _ five thousand three hundred and four sermon discourse or homily _ during this unhappy man 's life maule 's eye be now rivet on the clergyman as though he be a accessory to the murder five thousand three hundred and four he repeat by the same person however respectable and beloved as a pastor he might be be what few of we could have go through unless we be endow with as much strength of mind as power of endurance i be go to ask you sir do the idea ever strike you when you talk of this unhappy be suddenly leave you ministration and turn sabbath-breaker that after thirty-four year he might want a little change would it not be reasonable to suppose that the man might think he have have enough of it it might my lord and would not that in you judgment instead of show that he be insane prove that he be _ a very sensible man _ the vicar do not quite assent to this and as he would not dissent from the learn judge say nothing and continue maule that he be perfectly sane although he murder he wife all this be very clever not to say facetious on the part of the learn judge but as i have yet to address the jury i be resolve to take the other view of the effect of the vicar 's sermon and i do so i work maule 's quarry i think with some little effect : for after all he most strenuous exertion to secure a conviction the jury believe probably that no man 's mind could stand the ordeal and further that any doubt they might have after see the two child of the prisoner in court dress in little black frock and sob bitterly while i be address they would be give in the prisoner 's favor which it be this incident in my life be not finish on the same evening i be dine at the country house of a mr hardcastle and near I sit a old inhabitant of the village where the tragedy have be commit you make a touching speech mr hawkin say the old inhabitant well i answer it be the best thing i could do in the circumstance yes he say but i do not think you would have paint the little home in such glowing color if you have see what i see last week when i be drive past the cottage no no i think you would have tone down a bit what be it i ask why say the old inhabitant the little child who sob so violently in court this morning and to whom you make such pathetic reference be play on a ash-heap near they cottage and they have a poor cat with a string round its neck swing backwards and forwards and as they do so they sing -- this be the way poor daddy will go this be the way poor daddy will go ' such mr hawkin be they excessive grief yes but it get the verdict chapter vi a incident on the road to newmarket my first visit to newmarket heath have one or two little incident which may be interesting although of no great importance the newmarket of to-day be not quite the same newmarket that it be then : many thing connect with it have change and above all its frequenter have change and if thing be not what they seem they do not seem to I at all event to be what they be in my day sixty year be a long space of time to traverse but i do so with a very vivid recollection of my old friend charley wright it be on a bright October morning when we set out and glad enough be i to leave the court at westminster and the court of the temple -- glad enough to break loose from the thraldom of nothing to do and get away into the beautiful country charley and i be always great friend we have see so much together especially of what be call the world which i use in a different sense from that in which we be now to seek adventure we have see so much of its good and evil its light and shades and have so many memory in common that they form the groundwork of a lasting friendship he be the only son of a almost too indulgent father who be the very best example of a old english gentleman of he day you could ever meet he also have see a good deal of life and be not unfamiliar with any of its varied aspect he be intellectual and genial and dispense he hospitality with the most winning courtesy to I he be all kindness and i have a grateful feeling of delight in be able in these few word to record my affectionate reverence for he memory it be at he house in pall mall that i meet john leech and percival leigh but i digress as my mind go back to these early date and unless i break away charley and i will not reach newmarket in time for the first race it happen that when we make this memorable visit i have a uncle living at the priory at royston which be some five-and-twenty mile from newmarket where the big handicap i think the cesarewitch be to be run the follow day or the next -- i forget which but a interesting episode interrupt we journey to the heath to we surprise and no little to we delight there be to be a important meeting of the fancy to witness a great prize-fight between jack brassy and ben caunt ben caunt be the greatest prize-fighter both in stature and bulk as well as in strength i ever see he look what he be -- then or soon after -- the champion of the world brassy too be well make and seem every whit the man to meet caunt the two indeed be equally well make in form and shape and as smooth cut as marble statue when they strip for action the advertisement have announce that the contest be to come off at or as near thereto as circumstance permit -lrb- circumstance here mean the police -rrb- the village of little bury near saffron walden at the little inn of the village some of the magnate of the ring be to assemble on the morning of the fight for a early breakfast to which charley and i have the good fortune to be invite by jack brassy 's second peter crawley another note pugilist of he day it be different weather from that we enjoy in the early morning for the rain be now pour down in torrent and we have a drive of no less than fifteen mile before we to the scene of action vehicle be few and horse fewer nothing be to be have for love or money as it seem but there be at last find one man who if he have little love for the prize-ring have much reverence for the golden coin that support it he be a quaker he have a old gig and i think a still older horse both of which i hire for the journey -- the quaker of course pretend that he have no idea of any meeting of the fancy whatever nor do i suppose he would know what that term imply if ever any man in the world do what young man be always tell by good people to do -- namely to persevere -- i be sure we do charley and i with the quaker 's horse whether he suspect the mission on which we be bent or be consider the danger of such a scene to he moral i could not ascertain but never do any animal show a greater reluctance to go anywhere except to he quiet home you happiness at these great gathering depend entirely upon the distance or proximity of the police if they be pretty near the landlord of the inn would hesitate about serve you and if he do would charge a far higher price in consequence of the suppose increase risk he would never encourage a breach of the peace in defiance of the county magistrate who be the authority to renew he licence at brewster session so much then if the officer of justice be _ near _ if they happen to be absent -- which as i have say occasionally occur when a big thing be to come off -- there be then a dominant feeling of social equality which you could never see manifest so strongly in any other place a gentleman would think nothing of put he finger into you pocket and abstract you money and if you have the hardihood to resent the intrusion would think less of put he fist into you eye we be by no means certain as i learn that we fight would come off after all for it appear the magistrate have give strict and specific instruction to the police that no combat be to take place in the county of essex consequently the party whose duty it be to make preparation have flee from that respectable county and go away towards six mile bottom just in one of the corner of cambridgeshire as if the intention be that the don of the university should have a look in constable sleep more soundly in cambridgeshire than in essex moreover the essex magistrate would themselves have a moral right to witness the fight if it do not take place in they county thus we set out for the rendezvous charley soon discover that we steed be not accustom to the whip for instead of urge he forward it produce the contrary effect however we get along by slow degree and when we come up with the crowd -- oh such a scene i have never witness in my life nor could have conceive it possible anywhere on this earth or anywhere out of that abyss the full description of which you will find in paradise lose it be a procession of the blackguardism of all age and of all country under heaven the sex be apparently in equal number and in equal degree of ugliness and ferocity there be face flat for want of nose and mouth ghastly for want of tooth face scar bruise batter into every shape but what might be call human there be fighting-man of every species and variety -- man whose profession it be to fight and other whose brutal nature it be there be woman fighter too more deadly and dangerous than the man because they add cruelty to they ferocity innumerable woman there be who have lose the very nature of womanhood and whose mouth be the mere outlet of oath and filthy language they shrill clamor deafen we ear and subdue the deep voice of the man whom they chaff reviled shriek at yell at and swear at by way of _ fun _ amidst this turbulent rabble ride several member of the peerage and even ministerial supporter of the noble art exchange with the low wretch i have mention a word or two of chaff or a occasional laugh at the grotesque wit and humor which be never absent from a english crowd as we approach the famous scene to which every one be look with the most intense anticipation the crowd grow almost frenzied with expectancy and yet the utmost good-humour prevail in this spirit we arrive at bourne bridge and thence to the place of encounter be no great distance it be a little field behind a public-house every face be now white with excitement except the face of the combatant they be firm set as iron itself train to physical endurance they be equally so in nerve and coolness of temperament and could not have seem more excited than if they be go to dinner instead of to one of the most terrible encounter i ever witness to those who have never see a exhibition of this kind it be quite amazing to observe with what rapidity the rope be fix and the ring form nor be the man less prompt into the ring they step with they supporter or seconds and in almost a instant the principal have shake hand and be face each other in what well might be deadly conflict there be illustrious member of all class assemble there member probably of all profession man who afterwards as i know become great in history politics law literature and religion for it be a very great fight and attract all sort and condition from all place and position nothing since that fight except tom sayer and the benicium boy have attract so goodly and so fashionable a audience and so fierce a assembly of blackguard but in the time of the latter battle the decadence of the ring be manifest and be the outcome of what be doubtless a increase civilization at the time of which i be now speak the prize ring be one of we fashionable sport support by the wealthy of all class and be suppose to contribute to the manliness of we race consequently we distinguished warrior as well as the member of we most gentle profession love a good old-fashioned english set-to and nobody as a rule be the worse for it although my poor brother jack never recover he half-crown we have be advise to take we cushion from the gig to sit upon because the straw round the ring be sodden with the heavy rain and i need not say we find it be a very wise precaution the straw have be place round the ring for the benefit of the _ lite _ who occupy front seat the fight now begin and i must repeat i never see anything like it both pugilist be of the heaviest fighting weight caunt be a real giant ugly as could be by the frequent battering he have receive in the face he head be like a bull-dog 's and so be he courage whilst he strength must have be that of a very samson but if it be it do not reside in he hair for that be short and close as a mouse 's back at first i think brassy have the best of it he be more active be less ponderous and land some very ugly one cut right into the flesh although caunt do not appear to mind it in the least brassy however do not follow up he advantage as i think he ought to have do and in my opinion dread the enormous power and force of he opponent in the event of he get home with the usual fluctuation of a great battle the contest go on until nearly a _ hundred round _ be fight lasting as many minute but no decisive effect be as yet observable after this however brassy could not come up to time the event therefore be declare in caunt 's favor and he opponent be carry off the field on a hurdle into the public-house where i afterwards see he in bed thus terminate the great fight of the day but not thus my day 's adventure the sport be all that the most enthusiastic supporter of the ring could desire it no doubt have its barbarous aspect regard from a humanitarian point of view but it be not so demoralizing as the spectacle of some poor creature risk he neck in a performance for which the spectator pay he sixpence and the whole excitement consist in the knowledge that the actor may be dash to piece before he eye it be time now to leave the scene so charley and i go to look for we gig -lrb- evidence of gentility from the time of thurtell and hunt 's trial for the murder of mr weare -rrb- alas we respectability be go -- i mean the gig in vindication of the wisdom and foresight of charley and myself i should like to mention that we have entrust that valuable evidence of we status to the keep of a worthy stranger dress in a old red jacket and a pair of corduroy trousers fasten with a wisp of hay below the knee when we arrive at the spot where he promise to wait we come he be go the horse and gig too nor could any inquiry ascertain they whereabouts whether this incident be a judgment on the quaker as wright suggest or one of the inevitable incident attendant on a prize-fight i be not in a position to say but we think it serve the quaker right for let we a horse that would not go until the gentleman in the red jacket relieve we of any further trouble on that account mistake be so common amongst thief that one can never tell how the horse get away but if i be put on my oath know the proclivity of the animal i should say that he be back out of the field we be now as it seem the most deplorable object in creation : without friend and without a gig wet through shelterless amidst a crowd of drunken loathsome outcast of society with only one solitary comfort between we -- a pipe which charley enjoy and i loathe drink be always quarrelsome or affectionate generally the one first and the other after when the tear dry oath begin and we soon find that the quarrelsome stage of the company have be reach amidst all this excitement we have not forget that this little matter of the prize-fight be but a incident on we journey to newmarket we know full well that we present appearance would have find no recognition in the mall but we care nothing for the mall as we be not know by the fashion in the racing world and as for the other we should like to avoid they in any world you will wonder in these circumstance what we do we wait where we be through the whole of that wet afternoon and then on a couple of hack -- how we obtain they i do not know i never ask charley and nothing of any importance turn upon they -- we arrive at we comfortable royston quarter about eight o'clock tire to death we be receive with a hearty welcome by my uncle who be much entertain with we day 's adventure he like my description of the fight especially when i tell he how brassy draw caunt 's claret and show such other knowledge of the scientific practice that no one could possibly have learn have he not read up carefully _ bell 's life _ for the current week i be sure my uncle think i be one of the best of nephew and i consider he in reality my only uncle long think i may he prove to be and yet i never borrow a penny from he in my life on the next day fully equip and with all that be necessary for we distinguished position we set out for newmarket heath even now the glory of the racing world not forget goodwood which be more or less a private business and fashionable picnic i shall not attempt to describe newmarket no one can describe the indescribable i will only say it be not the newmarket which we later generation know it be then in its crude state of original simplicity there be no stand save the duke 's at the top of the town and one other somewhat smaller and nearer to the present grand stand those who could afford to do so ride on horseback about the heath those who could not walk if they feel disposed or sit down on the turf -- the best enjoyment of all if you be tire we do all three : we ride walk and sit down at last after a thoroughly enjoyable out such as the bar know nothing of in these respectable time we return to we business quarter in the temple chapter vii a episode at hertford quarter session hearsay be not as a rule evidence in a court of justice there be one or two exception which i need not mention if you want therefore to say what smith say you can not say it but must call smith himself and probably he will swear he never say anything of the sort the marquis of salisbury in the early day that i speak of be a kind-hearted chairman and would never allow the quibble of the lawyer to stand in the way of justice to the prisoner in those day at session they be not so nice in the observance of mere form as they be now and you could sometimes get in something that be not exactly evidence strictly speak in favor of a prisoner by a side-wind as it be although it be not the correct thing to do it happen that i be instruct to defend a man who have be commit to hertford quarter session on a charge of felony the commit magistrate have refuse to let the man out on bail a application be make at judge ' chamber before mr baron martin to reverse that decision which he do not a rag of evidence say the attorney 's clerk when he deliver the little brief -- not a shadder of evidence mr ` awkin it be a walk-over sir i know that mean a nominal fee but wonder how many more simile he be go to deliver instead of the money but to the honor of the solicitor i be bind to say that point be soon clear up and the practice of magistrate suppose to be in they right mind commit people for trial with no shadder of evidence against they it now become my duty to inquire into i ask how he know there be no evidence and whether the man bear a respectable character oh i be up before the baron he answer -lrb- yes i thought but you must wake very early if you be up too soon for baron martin -rrb- and the baron say as to grantin ' bail ` certainly he should the magistrate have no business to commit he for trial for there be not a rag of a case against the man ' so you see sir it be a easy case mr ` awkin and as the man 's a poor man we can not mark much of a fee the usual complaint with quarter session solicitor such be my instruction i be young in practice at that time and take a great deal more in -- i mean in the way of credulity -- than i do in after life nor be i very learn in the way of solicitor ' clerk i know that hearsay evidence even in the case of a judge 's observation be inadmissible and therefore what the baron say could not strictly be give but i do not know how far you might go in the country nor what the marquis 's opinion might be of the baron i therefore mention it to rodwell who of course be instruct for the prosecution he be in everything on one side or the other -- never i believe on both this stickler for etiquette be absolutely shock he hold up he hand begin a declamation on the rule of evidence and utter so many pharisaical platitude that i only escape annihilation by a hair 's - breadth he be always furious on etiquette much annoyed at he bumptious manner i be resolve now come what would to pay he off i want to show he he be not everybody even at hertford session so when the case come on and the policeman be in the box i rise to cross-examine he which i do very quietly now policeman i be go to ask you a question but pray do not answer it till you be tell to do so because my learn friend may object to it rodwell spring to he foot and object at once what be the question ask the marquis we must hear what the question be before i can rule as to you objection mr rodwell this be a good one for mr rodwell and make he color up to he eyebrow especially as i look at he and smile the question my lord say i be a very simple one : do not mr baron martin say when apply to for bail that there be not a rag of a case against the prisoner this be monstrous say the learn stickler for form and ceremony -- monstrous never hear of such a thing it might have be monstrous but it give I a excellent grievance with the jury even if the marquis do not see he way to allow the question and a grievance be worth something if you have no defense the marquis pay great attention to the case especially after that observation of the baron 's although he regret that it could not be get in as evidence he be good enough to say i should get the benefit of it with the jury all this time there be a continuous growl from my learn friend of monstrous monstrous -- so much so that for day after that word keep ring in my ear as monotonously as a muffin bell on a Sunday afternoon but i believe he be more irritated by my subsequent conduct for i play round the question like one longing for forbid fruit and emphasize the objection of my learn friend now and again : all very wrong i know now but in the heyday of youthful ardor how many fault we commit just tell I i say to the policeman do the learn judge -- i mean mr baron martin -- seem to know what he be about when he let this man out on bail o yes sir say the witness he know what he be about right enough stroke he chin you may rely on that say the marquis you may take that for grant mr hawkin i think so my lord there be not a judge on the bench who can see through a case quicker than the baron the grumble still continue now then do not answer this you have already rule my lord say rodwell this be another one say i but if it be regular to keep object before the prisoner 's counsel have a chance of put he question i sit down my lord i shall be allow probably to address the jury -- that be if mr rodwell do not object the noble marquis on see my distress say -- mr hawkin the question need no answer from the policeman you will get the benefit of it for what it be worth the jury will draw they own conclusion from mr rodwell 's objection as they do upon the whole case for they acquit much to mr rodwell 's annoyance now say the marquis let the officer stand back i want to ask what the baron really do say when he let this man out on bail my lord answer the witness he lordship say as how he look upon the whole lot as a _ gang of thief _ you have get it now say rodwell and so have you say i you should not have object and then you would have get the answer he have just give chapter viii a dangerous situation -- a forget prisoner i have be to pari in the summer of 18 -- for a little holiday and be return in the evening after some race have take place near that city i have not attend they and be in fact not aware that they be be hold but i soon discover the fact from find myself in the midst of the motley crowd which always throng railway station on such occasion only on this particular day they be a little worse than usual the race meeting have bring together the rough of all nation and especially from england as it seem to I my fellow-countryman always take the lead in this kind of competition i be endeavor to get to the booking-office amongst the rest of the crowd and there be far more push and struggle than be at all necessary for that purpose presently a burly ruffian with a low east end face of the slum pattern and complexion roll out a volley of oath at I he ask where the -- i be push and what game i be up to as though i be a professional pickpocket like himself he have the advantage of I in be surround by a gang of the most loathsome blackguard you could imagine while i be without a friend i speak therefore very civilly and say the crowd be push behind and force I forward the brute be annoy at my coolness and irritated all the more hitherto he language have not be strong enough to frighten I so he improve its strength by some tremendous epithet considerably above proof i think he must have enjoy the exclusive copyright for i never know he superlative imitate he finish the harangue by say that he would knock my head off if i say another word to this i reply with a look stronger than all he language no you will not my look must have be strong because the countenance of the bystander be subdue why will not i muster he ask for two reason i say : first because you will not try and secondly because you could not if you do he be somewhat tame and then i lift my hat so that he could see my close-cropped hair which be as short as he own only not for the same reason you do not seem to know who i be i add hope he would now take I for a member of the prize-ring but my appearance do not frighten he i have nothing but my short-cropped hair to rely on so in self-defence i have to devise another stratagem to frighten he one must look the ruffian in the face or look the ruffian that he be he continue to abuse I as we pass on we way to the booking-office window and i have no doubt he and he gang be determine to rob I one thing be common between we -- we have no regard for one another i now assume as bold a manner as i could and a rough east end accent look-ee ` ere say i : i know you do not keer for I no more ` a i keers for you i be not afraid o ' no man and i 'll tell you what it be : it be you ignorance of who i be that make you bold i know you be not a bad un with the mauler let 's have no more nonsense about it here i 'll fight you on Monday week say for a hundred a side in the butt and we 'll post the money at peter crawley 's next Saturday what d'ye say to that peter crawley whom i have already mention as invite I to breakfast be like a thunderclap to he i must be somebody if i know peter crawley and now he doubtless bethought he of my short hair i must confess if the fellow have take I at my word i should have be in as great a funk as he be but he do not my challenge be decline \* \* \* \* \* a curious incident happen once in the rural district of saffron walden it be a borough no doubt but it always seem to I to be too small for any grown-up thing and its name sound more like a little flower-bed than anything else on the occasion of which i speak there be great excitement in the place because they have get a prisoner -- a event which baffle the experience of the oldest inhabitant the recorder be a elderly barrister full of pomp and dignity and like many of he brother recorder have very seldom a prisoner to try you may therefore imagine with what stupendous importance he be invest when he find that the rural magistrate have commit a little boy for trial for steal a _ ball of twine _ think of the grand jury filing in to be charge by this judicial dignitary imagine he charge he well-chosen sentence in anticipation of the one to come at the end of the sit think of he eloquent disquisition on the law of larceny it be all there after the usual proclamation against vice and immorality have be read and after the grand jury have duly find a true bill the next thing be to find the prisoner and bring he up for trial we may not be sentimental or i might have cry god save the child as the usher say god save the queen but suffer little child to come unto I would not have apply to we jail in those miserable and inhuman time mercy and sympathy be out of the question when you have law and order to maintain as well as all the functionary who have to contribute to they preservation put up the prisoner say the recorder in solemn and commanding tone down into the jaw of the cavern below the dock descend the jailer of six foot two -- the only big thing about the place he be a resolute-looking man in full uniform and i can almost feel the breathless silence that pervade the court during he absence time pass and no one appear when a sufficient interval have elapse for the stalwart jailer to have eat he prisoner have he be so mind the recorder look up from behind the _ time _ which he appear to be read ask in a very stern voice why the prisoner be not put up they do not put up the boy but the jailer with a blood-forsaken face put himself up through the hole like a policeman come through a trap-door in a pantomime i beg you honor 's pardon my lord but they have forget to bring he forget to bring he what do you mean where be he they have leave he at chelmsford you honor it seem there be no jail at saffron walden because to the honor of the borough be it say they have no one to put into it and this small child have be commit for safe custody to chelmsford to wait he trial at session and have be there so long that he be actually forget when the day of trial come i never hear anything more of he but hope he small offence be forget as well as himself chapter ix the only racer i ever own -- sam linton the dog-finder i have be often ask whether i ever own a racer in point of fact i never do although i go as near to that honor as any man who never arrive at it -- a racer too who afterwards carry its owner 's color triumphantly past the winning-post the reader may have be shock at the story i tell of those poor ill-brought-up child whose mother be murder from the natural feeling that if pure innocence be not to be find in childhood where be we to seek it i will indicate the spot in three word -- _ on the turf _ true you will find fraud cunning knavery and robbery but you will find also the most unsophisticated innocence i go as a spectator a lover of sport and a lover of horse and take more delight in it than i ever could in any haunt of fashionable idleness i amuse myself by watch the proceedings of the betting-ring where there be a good deal more honesty than in many place dignified by the name of mart but if there be no innocence on the turf rogue could not live they be not cannibal -- not at all event while they can obtain tenderer food and be there not commercial circle also which could not exist without they equally innocent supporter experience may be a dear school but its lesson be never forget a very little should go a long way and the wisest make it go farthest if any one want a picture of innocence on the turf let I give one of my own drawing take from nature all my life i have love animal especially horse and dog and all field sport especially hunting and racing but i go on the turf with as much simplicity as a girl possess at she first ball know nothing about public form or the way to calculate odds to hedge or do anything but wonder at the number of fool there be in the world i do not know a thing or two like the know one who lose all they possess who could believe that man go about philanthropically to inform the innocent how to put they money on while they carefully avoid put on they own tipster in short be no part of my racing creed i be not so ignorant as that i believe in a good horse quite as much as lord rosebery do and much more than i believe in a good rider but there be even then honest jockey as well as unimpeachable owner all you can say be honesty be honesty everywhere and you will find a good deal of it on the turf if you know where to look for it and its value be in proportion to its quantity the moment you depart a hair 's - breadth from its immaculate principle there be no medium state between that and roguery however be that as it may i be once the owner of a pedigree thoroughbred call dreadnought which be present to I when a colt dreadnought 's dam collingwood be by muley moloch out of barbelle dreadnought be good for nothing as a racer and have break down in training as a castaway he be offer to I and i gladly accept the present as he be too young to work i send he down to -- park to be keep till he be fit for use he be there for a considerable time and be then send back in a neglect and miserable condition i ride he for some time until one day he take I to richmond park and on go up the hill fall and cut both he knee to piece and mine as well this be a sad mishap and of course i could have no further confidence in poor dreadnought fond of he as i be so he be place under the care of a skilful veterinary surgeon who give he every attention he bill be by no means heavy and he bring he quite round again in the course of time he acquire a respectable appearance although he broken knee to say nothing of he past prevent he become valuable so far as i be concerned certainly i have no expectation of he ever go on to the turf how could one believe that any owner would think of enter he for a race one morning my groom come to I and say i think sir i can find a purchaser for dreadnought if you have no objection to sell he he be a gentleman sir who would take great care of he and give he a good home sell he say i well i should not object if he find a good master i can not ride he and he be practically useless what price do he seem inclined to offer well he be not make any offer sir but he seem a good deal take with he and to like the look of he perhaps sir he might come and see you i tell he that i think a matter o ' _ fifteen pun _ might buy un i dunnow whether i do right sir but i tell un you would never take a farden less i stick to that no say i certainly not when the vet 's bill be twelve pound ten -- not a farthe less jame when the propose purchaser come he say it be a poor horse -- a very poor horse he want a lot of look after and i should not think of buy he except for the sake of see what i could do with he for i be not fond of lumber mr hawkin -- i do not care for lumber it be straightforward but i do not at the time see he depth of feeling he be evidently intend to buy he out of compassion as he have some knowledge of he ancestor but i stick to my fifteen pound hard and fast and at last he say well mr hawkin i 'll give you all you ask if so be you 'll throw in the saddle and bridle i be tire of the negotiation and yield so away go poor dreadnought with he saddle and bridle never for I to look on again i be sorry to part with he and the more so because he life have be unfortunate but i be deceive in he as well as in he new master from I he have conceal he merit only to reveal they as be often the case with latent genius when some accidental opportunity offer at that time bromley in kent be a central attraction for a great many second-class patron of the sport world i know little about the event that be negotiate at bromley and other small place of the kind but there be as i have be inform a good deal of blackguardism and pickpocketing on its course and in its little primitive street -- lucky if you come out of they with only one black eye they would steal the tooth out of you mouth if you do not keep it shut and you eye open however bromley race come on some time after the sale of my dreadnought the next morning my groom come with a look of astonishment that seem to have keep he awake all night and say -- you 'll be surprise to hear sir that we ` oss have win a fifty-pound prize at bromley and a pot of money besides in bet for he owner win a prize say i be it by stand on he head win a _ race _ sir then it must have be a walk-over oh no sir he beat the crack beat the favorite and take in all the know one i always say there be something about that there ` oss sir that i do not understand and nobody could not understand sir i be absolutely dumbfounded know very little about favorite or crack my groom i know i could rely upon for he always seem to be the very soul of honor i think at first he might have be mislead in some bromley taproom but afterwards find that it be all true -- he have hear it from the owner himself in whom the public seem to place confidence for they lay very long odds against dreadnought the animal be famous but not in that name he have like most honest person a alias how he achieve he victory be uncertain one thing however be certain -- it must have be a startling surprise to dreadnought to find himself in a race at all and still more astonishing to find himself in front how many run i ask three sir two of 'em crack horse at this time i take little interest in pedigree and know nothing of the crack so the name of those celebrated animal which dreadnought have beat be forget one of they it appear have be heavily back at 9 to 4 but dreadnought do not seem to care for that he run not on he public form but on he merit my eye be open at last and the whole mystery be solve when jame tell I that _ all three horse belong to the same owner _ from that time to this i never hear what become of dreadnought and never see the man who buy he even in the dock it be strange however that animal so true and faithful as dog and horse should be instrument so pervert as to make man liar and rogue while for intelligence many of they could give most of we pound and pass we easily at the winning-post speaking of dog remind I of dog-stealer and _ they _ way of which some year ago i have a curious experience i have tell the story before but it have become altered and the true one have never be hear since indeed no story be tell correctly when its copyright be infringe there be a man at the time refer to know as old sam linton the most extraordinary dog-fancier who ever live and the most curious thing about he be that he always fancy other people 's dog to he own he be a remarkable dog - _ finder _ too in these day of dog ' home the service of such a man as linton be not so much in request but he be a home in himself and do a great deal of good in he way by restore lose dog to they owner so that it become almost a common question in those day when a lady lose she pet to ask if she have make any inquiry of old sam linton he be better than the wise woman who indicate in some mysterious jargon where the steal watch might or might not be find in the distant future for old sam _ bring _ you the very dog on a _ specify day _ the wise woman never know where the lose property be old sam do i dare say he be a great blackguard but as he have long join the majority it be of no consequence there be one thing i admire about sam : there be a thorough absence in he of all hypocrisy and cant he profess no religion whatever but act upon the principle that a bargain be a bargain and should be carry out as between man and man that be he idea and as i find he true to it i respect he accordingly and mention he name as one of the few genuinely honest man i have meet the way i make he acquaintance be singular i be dine with my brother bencher at the middle temple hall when a message be bring that a gentleman would like to see I partickler after dinner if i could give he a few minute when i come out of the hall there be a man look very like a burglar he dress or what you should call he get-up be worth a momentary glance he have a cat-skin cap in he hand about as large as a frying-pan and nearly of the same color -- this he keep turn round and round first with one hand then with both -- a pea-jacket with large pearl button corduroy breeches a kind of moleskin waistcoat and blucher shoe he impress one in a moment as be fond of drink on one or two occasion i find this quality of great service to I in matter relate to the discovery of lose dog drink no doubt have its advantage to those who do not drink muster orkin sir say he beggin ' you pardon sir but might i have a word with you muster orkin if it be not a great intrusion sir i see my man at once and show he that i understand business you be sam linton it take he breath away he have not much but poor old sam do not like to part with it in a very husky voice that never seem to get outside he mouth he say -- _ yus sur _ that be it mr orkin then he breathe yer ` onner wot i mean to say be this -- what do you want linton never mind what you mean to say i know you 'll never say it well mr orkin sir ye see it be as this : you have lose a little dorg well you 'll say ` how do you know that ` ere sam ' ` well sir ' i say '' ow do not i know it be not you bin a ' offer _ fourteen pun _ for that

d'ye ` count for that sir you have see he then not i say sam unmoved even by a twitch but i know a party as ` as and it be not likely mr orkin as you 'll get ` im by orferin ' a price like that for why why it stand to reason -- do not it mr orkin -- it be not the _ dorg _ you be payin ' for but _ you feelin _ as these ` ere wagabonds be _ tradin ' on mr orkin _ that be where it be o sir it be abominable as i tell 'em keepin ' a gennelman 's dorg i be perfectly thunderstruck with the man 's philosophy and good feeling go on mr linton well mr orkin they know -- damn 'em -- as you feelin ull make you orfer more and more for who know that there dorg might belong _ to a lidy _ and then _ she _ feelin have to be take into consideration i 'll tell ` ee now mr orkin how this class of wagabond

angry voice like yours just now sir ` why sir ' i ses ` these people as find dawg ` ave they feelin as well as loser ` as theirs and sometimes when they can not find the owner they sell the animal ' well they sell this gennelman 's animal to a major and the reason why he could not be have for a little while be that the major be fond on he and ` avin ' pay a good price for the dawg it would ha ' be cruel if he do not let he have the pleasure of he like for a few day -- or a week sam and i part the best of friend and i need not say on the best of term i could get i know he for many year after this incident and say to he credit that although he be sometimes hard with customer he act from all one ever hear strictly in accordance with the bargain he make whatever it might be and what be more singular than all i never hear of old sam linton get into trouble chapter x why i give over card-playing like most man who be not saint i have the natural instinct for gamble without any passion for it but soon find the necessity for suppress my inclination for card lest it should interfere with my legitimate profession it be necessary to abandon the indulgence or abandon myself to its temptation i owe my determination never to play again at card to the bad luck which befall I on a particular occasion at ascot on the cup day of the year 18 -- i be at that time struggle to make my way in my profession and carefully store up my little savings for the proverbial rainy day have be previously to the epsom summer race and have such extraordinary good luck nothing but a severe reverse would have induce I to take the step i do good luck be fascinating and invariably lead we on with bad luck sometimes close behind i go to epsom with my dear old friend charley wright and we soon set to work in one of the booth to make something towards we fortune at _ rouge et noir _ the booth be keep by a man who seem -- to I at all event -- to be the soul of honor i have no reason to speak otherwise than well of he for i stake a half-crown on the black and win two half-crown every time or nearly every time i think it a most excellent game and with less of the element of chance or skill in it than any game i ever play my pocket be get stuff with half-crown so that they bulge and cause I to wonder if i should be allow to leave the racecourse alive for there be many thief who visit the downs in those day but my friend charley be with I and i know he would be a pretty trustworthy fellow in a row this however be but a momentary thought for i be too much engross in the game and in my good luck to dwell on possibility nor do i interest myself in charley 's proceedings but take it for grant that a game so propitious to I be no less so to he he be play with several other who or what they be be of no moment to I i pursued my game quietly and pick up my half-crown with great gladness and with no concern for those who have lose they presently however my attention be momentarily divert by hear charley let off a most uncontrollable d -- n what be the matter charley i ask without lift my head matter say charley rook -- that be all rook that be very extraordinary i be win like anything look here and i point to my pocket which be almost burst yes say he i see how it be : you have be win on two to one and i have be lose on three black 's the win color to-day charley -- _ noir _ you should have back _ noir _ besides long odds be much too risky i be quite content with two to one here there be a general break-up of the party because charley be out of it as well as several other it leave only one and of course the keeper of the booth be not so foolish however honorable to pay I two half-crown and win only one so there it end that night i make this game a study and the sensible conclusion come to I that if you would take advantage of the table you should play for the lower stake because you have a better chance of win than those who play high at least that be the result of my policy for while those who play high be ruin my pocket be fill and by that cautious mode of play i be so lucky that have there be enough at three to one i could have keep on make money as long as they have any to lose i change my half-crown with the booth-keeper for gold and reach my chamber safely with the spoil and how pleasant it be to count it it have occur to I since that the keeper of the booth have carefully note my proceedings -lrb- such be my innocence -rrb- and that he make he calculation for a future occasion one thing he be quite sure of -- namely that he would see I again on the first opportunity there be of win more half-crown it be possible that a succession of run of luck might have put a end to my professional career it be certain that the opposite result put a end to my card-playing aspiration in about a fortnight all eager for a renewal of my epsom experience i go down to the ascot meeting take with I not only all my previous winnings but my store of savings for the rainy day and be determine to pursue the same moderate system of cautious play there be the same booth the same little flag flutter on the top and the same oblige proprietor he recognize I at once and look as if he be quite sure i would be there -- as if in fact he have be wait for I after a pleasant greet and a few friendly word i think it a little odd that a man should be so glad to meet one who have come to fill he pocket at the booth-keeper 's expense -- at least i think this afterwards not at the time he look genuinely pleased and down i sit once more quite sure that two to one would beat three the proprietor keep he eye on my play in a very thoughtful manner nor be it surprising that he know he game as well as i in fact it turn out that he know it better to this day i be unable to explain how he manoeuvre it how he adjust he tactic to counteract mine but that something happen more than mere luck would account for be certain for as often as the half-crown go on black red be the lucky color but i persevere on black because it have be my friend at epsom and down go the half-crown to be sweep up by the keeper of the booth i can not even now explain how it be do intend to make a good day 's work and gather a rich harvest i take with I every shilling i have in the world -- not only my previous winnings but my hard-earned savings at the bar i begin to lose but go on playing in the vain hope -- the worst hope of the gambler -- of retrieve what i have lose and recover my former luck but it be not to be the table be against I i forsook my loyalty to black and lay on red alas red be no better friend i lose again and know now that all my epsom winnings have find they way once more into the keeper 's pocket a fortnight 's loan be all i have of they it be a pity they have not be give to some charity but i keep on bravely enough and do not despair or leave off while i have a half-crown left that half-crown however be soon rake up with the rest into the keeper 's bag i be bankrupt with nothing in my pocket but twopence and a return ticket from paddington hopeless and helpless i have learn a lesson -- a lesson you can only learn in the school of experience i little thought then that the only certain winner at the gaming-table be _ the table itself _ and make up my mind as i walk alone and disappoint through windsor park on my way to the station that i would never touch a card again -- and i never do for the first time since set out in the morning i feel hungry and buy a pennyworth of apple at a little stall keep by a old woman and a bottle of ginger-beer such be my frugal meal and thus sustained i tramp on my return ticket be my only possession in the world i reach paddington with a sorry heart and walk to the temple my good resolution my only comfort but it be all-sufficient for the occasion and for all time to come chapter xi codd 's puzzle have somewhat succeed in my practice at quarter session i enlarged my field of adventure by attend the old bailey hope of course to obtain some briefs at that court and although i abandon the practice as a rule i be in after-life on many occasion retain to appear in case which be still fresh in my memory i be with edwin jame who be counsel for mr bate one of the partner of strahan and sir john dean paul banker of the strand and who be sentence to fourteen year ' transportation for fraudulently misappropriate security of they customer i be counsel for a young clerk to leopold redpath the notorious man who be transport for extensive forgery upon the great northern railway the clerk be justly acquit by the jury my recollection of this period bring back many curious defence which illustrate the school of advocacy in which i study whether they contribute to my future success i do not know but that they afford amusement be prove by my remember they at all hertford and st alban be my chief place my earliest attachment and be amongst my pleasantest memory it seem childish to think of they as scene of my struggle for when i come to look back i have no struggle at all i be merely practise like a cricketer at the net there be nothing to struggle for except a verdict when it would not come without some effort but dear old codd be the man to struggle he struggle and wriggle tie he up as tightly as you could you see he fight to get free as he do in the follow great duck case he be a very amiable old barrister a fast talker -- so fast that he never stay to pronounce he word -- and of a ingenuity that ought to have be apply to some better purpose such as the making of steam-engine or write novel rather than defend thief he remind I on this occasion of the man in the circus who ride several horse at a time in the case i allude to he set up no less than _ seven defence _ to account for the unhappy duck 's find its way into he client 's pocket and the charm of they all be they variety inconsistency be not the word to apply reproachfully inconsistency be codd 's merit he be like a conjurer who ask you to name a card and as surely as you do so you draw it from the pack this particular duck case be know long after as codd 's puzzle first say codd my client buy the duck and pay for it he be not the man to be afraid of be ask where second say codd my client find it thirdly it have be give to he fourthly it fly into he garden fifthly he be asleep and some one put it into he pocket and so the untiring and ingenious codd proceed make he case unnaturally good but the strange thing be that instead of sweep he away with a touch of ridicule the young advocate argue the several defence one after the other with great dialectical skill so that the jury become puzzle and if the defense have not be so extraordinarily good there would have be a acquittal forthwith there have be such a bewildering torrent of argument that presently codd 's head begin to swim and he shrug he shoulder mean thereby that it be the most puzzling case _ he _ have ever have anything to do with at last it become a question whether amidst these conflict account there ever be any duck at all codd have not think of that till some junior suggest it and then he be ask by the marquis of salisbury we chairman whether there be any particular line of defense he wish to suggest no say codd not in particular my client wish to make a clean breast of it and put they all before the jury and i should be much oblige if those gentleman will adopt any one of they -lrb- a -rrb- the jury acquit the prisoner not because they choose any particular defense but because they do not know which to choose and so give the prisoner the benefit of the doubt the client be happy and codd famous -lrb- footnote a : sixty year after this event in the reply in the great tichborne case mr hawkin qc quote this very defense as a illustration of the absurdity of the suggestion that one of several _ osprey _ pick up sir roger tichborne -- as will hereafter appear -rrb- chapter xii graham the polite judge just before my time the punishment of death be inflict for almost every offence of steal which would now be think sufficiently deal with by a sentence of a week 's imprisonment the struggle to turn king 's evidence be great and it be almost a competitive examination to ascertain who know most about the crime and he be generally the worst of the gang be accept accordingly i remember when i be a child three man name respectively marshall cartwright and ingram be charge with have commit a burglary in the house of a gentleman name pym who live in a village in hertfordshire marshall be at that time and cartwright have previously be butler in the gentleman 's service ingram have be a footman in london the burglary be not in itself of a aggravate character plate only be steal and that have be conceal under the gravel bed of a little rivulet which run through the grounds no violence or threat of violence have be offer to any inmate of the house yet the case be look upon as serious because of the position of trust which have be hold by the two butler ingram be admit as king 's evidence the butler be convict sentence to death and hang whilst ingram be accord to universal practice set at liberty before the expiration of a year however he be convict of have steal a horse and as horse-stealing be a capital offence at that time he suffer the penalty of death at hereford it be a curious coincidence that only a year or two afterwards a man name probert who have give king 's evidence upon which the notorious thurtell and hunt be convict of the brutal murder of weare and execute be also release and within a year convict of horse-stealing and hang a old calendar for the assize at lincoln which i give as a appendix remind I of the condition of the law and of its victim at that time at every assize it be like a tiger let loose upon the district if a man escape the gallows he be lucky while the criminal be by no mean the hardened ruffian who have be train in the school of crime they be mostly compose of the most ignorant rural labourer -- if indeed in those day there be any degree of ignorance when to be able to read a few word by spell they be consider a prodigious feat juror often endeavor to mitigate the terror of the law by find that the steal property however valuable it might be be of less value than five shilling may the record angel drop a tear over this record of perjury and blot it out for ever it be in those day that mr justice graham be call upon to administer the law and on one occasion particularly he vindicate he character for courtesy to all who appear before he he be a man unconscious of humor and yet humorous and be not aware of the extreme civility which he exhibit to everybody and upon all occasion especially to the prisoner people go away with a sense of gratitude for he kindness and when he sentence a batch of prisoner to death he do it in a manner that might make any one suppose if he do not know the fact that they have be award prize for good conduct he be firm nevertheless -- a great thing in judge if not accompany with weakness of mind i may add that there be a singular precision in he mode of expression as well as in he idea at a country assize where he be preside in the crown court a man be indict for murder he plead not guilty the evidence contain in the deposition be terribly clear and of course the judge who have peruse they be aware of it the case have be call on for trial counsel for the prosecution apply for a postponement on the ground of the absence of a most material witness for the crown i should mention that in those day counsel be not allow to speak for the prisoner but the judge be always in theory suppose to watch the case on he behalf in the absence of a _ material _ witness the prisoner would be acquit the learn mr justice graham ask the accuse if he have any objection to the case be postpone until the next assizes on the ground as the prosecution have allege that they most material witness could not be produce he lordship put the case as somewhat of a misfortune for the prisoner and make it appear that it would be postpone if he desire it as a favor to _ he _ notwithstanding the judge 's courteous manner of put it the prisoner most strenuously object to any postponement it be not for he to oblige the crown at the expense of a broken neck and he desire above all thing to be try in accordance with law he stand there on he jail delivery graham be firm but polite and determine to grant the postponement ask for in this he be doubtless right for the interest of justice demand it but to soften down the prisoner 's disappointment and excuse the necessity of he further imprisonment he lordship address he in the follow term and in quite a sympathetic manner : -- prisoner i be extremely sorry to have to detain you in prison but _ common humanity _ require that i should not let you be try in the absence of a important witness for the prosecution although at the same time i can quite appreciate you desire to have you case speedily dispose of one do not like a thing of this sort hang over one 's head but now for the sake of argument prisoner suppose i be to try you to-day in the absence of that material witness and yet contrary to you expectation they be to find you guilty what then why in the absence of that material witness i should have to sentence you to be hang on Monday next that would be a painful ordeal for both of we but now let we take the other alternative and let we suppose that if you trial have be put off and the material witness when call could prove something in you favor -- this sometimes happen -- and that that something induce the jury to acquit you what a sad thing that would be it would not signify to you because you would have be hang and would be dead here he lordship pause for a considerable time unable to suppress he emotion but have recover himself continue -- but you must consider what my feeling would be when i think i have hang a innocent man at the next assizes the man be bring up the material witness appear the prisoner be find guilty and hang the humane judge 's feeling be therefore spare at the old bailey he be preside during a session which be rather light for the time there be less than a score leave for execution under sentence of death there be in fact only sixteen most of they for petty theft he lordship instead of read the whole of the sixteen name omit one and read out only fifteen he then politely and with exquisite precision and solemnity exhort they severally to prepare for the awful doom that await they the follow Monday and pronounce on each the sentence of death they leave the dock after they be go the jailer explain to he lordship that there have be _ sixteen _ prisoner capitally convict but that he lordship have omit the name of one of they and he would like to know what be to be do with he what be the prisoner 's name ask graham john robin my lord oh bring john robin back -- by all mean let john robin step forward i be oblige to you the culprit be once more place at the bar and graham address he in he singularly courteous manner say apologetically -- john robin i find i have accidentally omit you name in my list of prisoner doom to execution it be quite accidental i assure you and i ask you pardon for my mistake i be very sorry and can only add that you will be hang with the rest chapter xiii glorious old day -- the hon bob grimston and many other -- chicken-hazard the old glory of the circuit day vanish with stage-coach and post-chaise if you climb on to the former for the sake of economy because you could not afford to travel in the latter you would be fine at the circuit mess whose notion of propriety and economy be always at variance those who obtain no business find it particularly hateful to keep up the foolish appearance of have it by means of a post-chaise you might not ride in a public vehicle or dine at a public table or put up at a inn for fear of fall in with attorney and obtain briefs from they surreptitiously the home circuit be very strict in these respects but it be the cheapest circuit to travel in the kingdom so that its member be numerous and i need not say various in mind manner and position but it be a circuit of brilliant man in my young day many of they rise to eminence both in law and in parliament it be a time indeed when if judge make law law make judge i should like to say a word or two about those time and the necessary study to be undergo by those who aspire to eminence in the day of my earliest acquaintance with the law a ancient order of man now almost if not quite extinct call special pleader exist who after have keep the usual number of term -- that be to say eat the prescribed number of dinner in the inn of court to which they belong -- become qualify on payment of a fee of # 12 to take out a crown licence to plead under the bar this enable they to do all thing which a barrister could do that do not require to be transact in court they draw pleading advise and take pupil some of they practice in this way all they life and be never call other grow tired of the drudgery and be call to the bar where they remain _ junior _ barrister as long as they live old age have no effect upon they status some be promote to the ancient order of serjeants-at-law or be appoint she majesty 's counsel while some of the serjeant receive from the crown patent of precedence with priority over all queen 's counsel appoint after they and with the privilege of wear a silk gown and a queen 's counsel wig there be however this difference between a queen 's counsel and the holder of a patent of precedence : that the former have be appoint one of she majesty 's counsel could not thenceforth appear without special licence under the sign-manual of the queen to defend a prisoner upon a criminal charge the serjeant-at-law be as rare now as a bustard i mention these old-fashioned time and study not because of they interest at the present day but because they produce such man as littledale bayley parke -lrb- afterwards lord wensleydale -rrb- alderson tindal patteson wightman crompton vaughan william jame willes and later blackburn the contemplation of these legal giant amongst whom my career commence somewhat check the buoyant impulse which have urge I onward at quarter session but at the same time impart a little modest desire to imitate such incomparable model those of they who be select from the junior bar be good example of man whose vast knowledge of law be acquire in the way i have indicate and who be choose on they merit alone but even these successful example however encourage to the student be nevertheless not ill-calculated to make a young barrister whose income be small and sometimes as in my case by no means _ assure _ to he sicken at the thought that study as he like year might pass and probably would before a remunerative practice come to cheer he perhaps it would never come at all and he would become like so many hundred of other of he day and ours a hopeless failure all be competitor for the briefs and even the smile of solicitor for without they favor none could succeed although he might unite in himself all the quality of lawyer and advocate the prospect be not exhilarating for any one who have to perform the drudgery of the first few year of a junior 's life nevertheless i be not cast down by the mere apprehension or rather the mere possibility of failure for when i look round on my competitor i be encourage by the thought that dear old woollet know more about a rate appeal than littledale himself while old peter ryland with he inimitable saxon be quite as good at the irremovability of a pauper as codd be in accounting for the illegal removal of a duck and both in they several branch of knowledge more learn than alderson or bayley but here i be launch on that wide sea in which i be to sink or swim and as i prefer the latter i strike out with a resolute breast-stroke and as i have say never fail to keep my head above water it be some satisfaction to know that if the judge be so learn there be yet more learn to come much yet to come down from the old table-land of the common law and much more from the inexhaustible fountain of parliament the quarter session court be the arena of my first eight year of professional life i watch and wait with unwearied attention never without hope but often on the very verge of despair of ever make any progress which would justify my choose it as a profession my greatest delight perhaps be the obtain a acquittal of some one whose guilt nobody could doubt all the struggle of those time be the fight for the one three six and the hardest effort of my life be the most valuable because it give I the key which open the door to many depository of unexplored wealth there be many man who outlive they life and other who never live they life at all many man who do nothing and many more who would almost have give they life to do something there be however one man of those day whom i can not here pass over as he remain my companion and friend to he life 's end and will be remember by I with affection and reverence to the end of my own it be old bob grimston whom i first meet at the benefit of the spider one of the famous prize-fighter of the time the hon bob grimston be know in the sport world as one of its most enthusiastic supporter and acknowledge as one of the best man in saddle or at the wicket but bob be not only a sportsman -- he be a gentleman of the finest feeling you could meet and the keenest sense of honor have thus speak of some of the eminent man of my early day i would like to mention a little incident that occur before i have fairly settle down to practice or form any serious intention as to the course i should pursue -- that be to say whether i should remain a session man like woollet or become a master of saxon like old peter ryland a sportsman like bob grimston or a cosmopolitan like rodwell so as to comprehend all that come in my way i choose the latter for the simple reason that in principle i love what in these day would be call the open door and receive all comer even sometimes entertaining solicitor unaware accordingly i lay myself open to the attention of kind friend and people whose manner of life be found on the christian principle of be give to hospitality but before i come to the particular incident i wish to describe i must briefly mention a remarkable case that be try in the queen 's bench and which necessarily throw I back a year or two in my narrative it be a case know as boyle and lawson and the incident it reveal will give a idea of the state of society of that day i be not sure whether it differ in many respects from that of the present except in so far as its _ honor _ be concern for what be look upon then as a flagrant outrage on public morality be now regard as a error of judgment or a mistake occasion by some fortuitous combination of unconsidered circumstance such be the value in literature and argument of long word without mean however the action be bring against the proprietor of the _ time _ newspaper for libel the libel consist in the statement that the respectable plaintiff -- a lady -- have conspire with person unknown to obtain false letter of credit for large sum of money the hospitable friend i refer to live in excellent style in norwich how they have attain they social distinction i be unable to say but they be in fact in the very best set which in norwich be by no mean the fastest i be travel at this time with charle willshire and he brother thoma who be a mere youth there be also a undergraduate of cambridge of the name of crook with we and another who have join we party for a few day ' ramble we be enjoy ourselves in the old city of norwich as only youth can when we receive a invitation to pass a evening in a very fashionable circle how the invitation come i could not tell but we make no inquiry and accept it arrive at the house which be situate in the most aristocratic neighborhood that norwich could boast we find ourselves in the most agreeable society we could wish to meet this be a group of exalted and fashionable personage array in costume of the superb prince regent style nothing could exceed this party in elegance of costume or manners you could tell at once they be as it be then express of the quality they cordiality be equal only by they courtesy and have we be prince of the blood we could not have receive a more polite welcome there be a elegance too about the house and a refinement which coincide with the culture of the host and guest altogether it be one of the most agreeable party i have ever see there be several gentleman all prince regent and one sweet lady charming in every way from the well-arranged blonde tress to the neatest little shoe that ever adorn a cinderellum foot she be beautiful in person as she be charming in manner you see at once that she move in the best norwich society and be the idol of it crook be perfectly amaze at so much grace and splendor but then he be much younger than any of we i do not think any one be so much smitten as crook we have see more of the world than he have -- that be to say more of the witness-box -- and if you do not see the world there on its oath you can see it nowhere in the same unveil deformity we enjoy ourselves very much there be good music and a little sweet singing the lady be in that art as in every other well train and accomplish if i be not altogether ravish with the performance crook be you could see that by the tender look of he eye after the music card be introduce and they commence play _ vingt-et-un _ crook be the special favorite with everybody especially with the lady i believe much be due to the expression of he eye as i have give up card i do not join in the game but become more and more interested in it as a onlooker i be a little surprised however to find that in a very short while comparatively we friend crook have lose # 30 or # 40 and as this be the greater part of he allowance for travel expense it place he in a rather awkward position some man travel faster when they have no money this be not the case with poor crook who travel only by means of it alas i think _ twenty-one _ and _ vingt-et-un _ it be a serious matter and the worse because crook be not a good loser : he lose he head and he temper as well as he money and i have ever observe through life that the man who lose he temper lose himself and he friend he be disgust with he bad luck but nurture a desperate hope -- the forlorn hope that deceive all gambler -- that he should retrieve he loss on some future occasion which he eagerly look for and one might say demand the occasion be not far off it be in fact nearer than crook anticipate he pleasant manner and agreeable society at _ vingt-et-un _ procure we another invitation for the follow night but one and of course we accept it it be a great change to I from the scenery of the elm court chimney-pot whatever might be crook 's happily sanguine disposition and hope of retrieve he luck there be one thing which the calculator of chance do not take into consideration in game of this kind we visit such culture and fashionable people would never for a moment think so meanly of we friend i mean the possibility of they cheating a word never mention in well-bred society a suspicion of such conduct even would be tantamount to treason and a violation of the rule that regulate the conduct of lady and gentleman it be far from all we thought and the devil alone could entertain so malevolent a idea be that as it may as a matter of philosophy the onlooker see most of the game and as i be a onlooker this be what i saw : -- the elegant lady _ exchange glance with one of the player while she be look over crook 's hand _ crook be lose as fast as he could and no wonder i be now in a awkward position to have denounce we host because i interpret a lady 's glance in a manner that make she worse than a common thief might have produce unknown trouble but i keep my eye on the beautiful blonde nevertheless and become more and more confirm in my suspicion without any better opportunity of declare they the charming well-bred lady thus communicate she knowledge of crook 's card i need not say he be soon reduce to a state of insolvency and as the party be too exclusive and fashionable to extend they hospitality to those who have not the means of pay it soon break up and we return to we room i somewhat wiser and crook a great deal poorer such be the adventure which come to my mind when i saw in the queen 's bench at westminster the trial of boyle and lawson against the _ time _ for calumnious insinuation against the character of a lady and other suggest that they obtain false letter of credit to enable they to cheat and defraud _ this _ be the select party which norwich society have lionize -- the great unknown to whom we have be introduce and where crook have be cheat out of he travelling-money the lady be the fair plaintiff in this action seek for the rehabilitation of she character and she succeed in effect that object so far as the outlay of one farthing would enable she to do so for that be all the jury give she and it be exactly that amount too much she character be worth more to she in crook 's time speaking of a man run society on he fee -- that be endeavor to cope with the rich on the mere earnings of a barrister however large they may be -- i have meet with several instance which would have preserve I from the same fate have i ever be curse with such a inclination the number of successful man at the bar who have be ruin by worship the idol which be call society and which be perhaps a more disastrous deity to worship than any other be legion this be one unhappy example the only one i intend to give while i be live in bond street and work very hard i have little time and no inclination to lounge about amongst the socially great i have indeed no money to spend on great people the entrance-fee into the portal of the smart society temple be heavy especially for a working-man and so find the bright particular star who have long hold he place amidst the splendid social galaxy and then disappear into a deeper obscurity than that from which he have emerge to be see no more for ever he be a queen 's counsel a brilliant advocate in a certain line of business and a popular agreeable intellectual and amusing companion he obtain a seat in parliament and a footing in society which make he one of its select and principal lion in every society paper amongst its most fashionable intelligence there be he and society hardly seem to be able to get along without he one Sunday afternoon i be read in my little room when this agreeable member of the _ lite _ call upon I my astonishment be great because at that time of my career not only do i not receive visitor but _ such _ a visitor be beyond all expectation and i wonder when he name be announce what could have bring he he so great and i comparatively nothing it be true i have know he for some time but i know he so little that i thought of he as a most estimable great man whose career be lead he to the highest distinction in he profession another extraordinary thing that strike I long after but do not at the time be that the business he come upon make no particular impression on my mind any more than if it have be the most ordinary thing in the world that to I be still inexplicable my visitor do not let trouble sit upon he if trouble he ever have for he seem to be in the highest spirit society keep he ever in a state of effervescent hilarity so that he never let anything trouble he at this time he be make at the bar seven or eight thousand a year and consequently i think must be the happiest of man he manner be agreeable and he face wear a smile of complacency at variance with the nature of he errand which he quickly take care to make know by inform I that he be in a devil of a mess and do not know what he should do to get out of it oh i say quite carelessly you 'll manage and little do i think i should be the means of fulfil my own prophecy the fact be my dear hawkin say the wily intriguer for such he be i 'll tell you seriously how i stand to-morrow morning i have bill become due amounting to # 1250 and i want you to be good enough to lend I that sum to enable I to meet they i be perfectly astounded this greatness to have come down to # 1250 on the wrong side of the ledger i have no such amount say i and never have anything like it at my bank i must say i pity he and begin to wonder in what way i _ could _ help he he be so really and good-naturedly in earnest and seem so extremely anxious that at last i say well i 'll see what i can do and ask he to meet I in court the follow morning when i would tell he whether i could help he or not he gratitude be boundless my kindness should never be forget -- no as long as he live and if he have be address a common jury he could not have use more flower of speech or shed more abundant tear to water they with i be the best friend he have ever have and as it seem afterwards very foolishly so because he tell I he have not one farthing of security to offer for the loan a man who ought to have be worth from fifty to a hundred thousand pound however i go to my banker ' and make arrangement to be provide with the amount i meet he at the place of appointment and be quite surprised to see the change in he demeanor since the day before he be now apparently in a state of deeper distress than ever and think to soothe he i say it be all right you can have the money once more he overwhelm I with the eloquence of a grateful heart but say it be of no use -- no use whatever that instead of # 1250 he have other bill come in and unless they could all be meet he might just as well let the other go how much do you _ really _ want to quite clear you i ask with a simplicity which astonish I to this day well he say nothing be of the least use under # 2500 i be a little staggered but pity he distress of mind go once more to my banker ' and make the further necessary arrangement i borrow the whole amount at five per cent and place it to the credit of this brilliant queen 's counsel the only term i make with he on this new condition of thing be that he should out of he incoming fee pay my clerk # 500 a quarter until the whole sum be liquidate this he might easily have do and this he arrange to do but the next day he pledge the whole of he prospective income to a jew incur fresh liability and leave I without a shadow of a chance of ever see a penny of my money again i need not say every farthing be lose principal and interest i say interest because it cost I five per cent till the amount be pay he end be as romantic as he life but it be best tell in the word of my old friend charley colman who never spare color when it be necessary and in that respect be a artist who resemble nature thus he write : -- what a coward at heart be -- he allow himself to be sit upon and crush without raise a hand or voice in he defense of himself when he return from america he accept a seat in -- office -- in the office of the man who urge lord -- to prosecute he after you gift to he -- a noble gift of # 3000 -- he call at my chamber speak in high term of you generosity and wish all the world to know it so elated be he i be to publish it far and wide he go away in half a hour he return and beg I to keep the affair secret ` too late ' say i ` several gentleman have be here and to they i mention the matter and beg they to spread it far and wide ' he heart fail he when he think he would be talk about he be a kind-hearted fellow at time -- generous to a fault always most abstemious but he have a tongue and one he do not try to control he use to say stinging thing of people know they to be untrue what a life what a terrible fate be he turn out of parliament make to resign he benchership he gown take from he by the bencher drive to america by he creditor to get he live not allow to practice in the supreme court in america at forty-five year of age he life have founder he return to england -- for what simply to find he recklessness have blast he life and then -- sometimes in spite of _ all _ i feel a moisture in my eye when i think of he have he be true to himself what a brilliant life be open to he what a practice he have up to the last he tell I that he turn # 14000 a year he work hard very hard and he gain go to -- or to chicken-hazard poor fellow chapter xiv peter ryland -- the rev mr faker and the welsh will i be retain at hertford assize with peter ryland as my leader to prosecute a man for perjury which be allege to have be commit in a action in which a cantankerous man who have once fill the office of high sheriff for the county be the prosecutor wealthy and disagreeable he be nevertheless a henpecked tyrant mr brown he wife be a witness for the prosecution in the alleged perjury -- which be unfortunate for she husband because she have the greatest knowledge of the circumstance surround the case while mr brown have the best knowledge of the probable quality of he wife 's evidence when we be in consultation and consider the nature of this evidence and arrange the best mode of present we case to the jury brown interpose and beg that mr ryland should call mr brown as the _ last _ witness instead of first which be the proper course because say he _ if anything go wrong during the trial or anything be want mr brown will be quite ready to mop it all up _ this in a prosecution for _ perjury _ be one of the boldest proposition i have ever hear i need not say that good mr brown be call as she ought to have be first the lady 's mop be not in requisition at that stage of the trial and the jury decide against she i be sometimes in the divorce court and old jack holker be generally my opponent he be call long odds in one particular case i win some _ clat _ it be not relate on that account however but simply in consequence of its remarkable incident no case be interesting unless it be outside the ordinary stock-in-trade of the law court and i think this be the detail be not worth tell and i therefore pass they by cresswell be the president and the future president hannen my junior we win a great victory through the remarkable over-confidence and indiscretion of edwin jame qc who oppose we jame 's client be the husband of the decease by she will the lady have leave he the whole of she property amount to nearly # 100000 the case we set up be that the wife have be improperly influence by she husband in make it and that she mind be coerce into do what she do not intend to do and so we seek to set aside the will on that ground edwin jame have prove a very strong case on behalf of the validity of the will he have call the attest witness and they respectable gentleman as they undoubtedly be have prove all that be necessary -- namely that the testator notwithstanding that she be in a feeble condition and almost at the last stage be perfectly calm and capable in mind and understanding -- exactly in fact as a testator ought to be who will she property to she husband if he retain she affection the witness have be cross-examine by I and nothing have be elicit that cast the least doubt upon they character or credibility have the matter be leave where it be the # 100000 would have be secure but jame whatever may have be he brilliance be want in tact he would not leave well alone but resolve to call the rev mr faker a distinguished dissent minister in fiction this gentleman would have appear in the melodramatic guise of a spangled tunic sugar-loaf hat with party-coloured ribbon purple or green breeches and motley hose but in the witness-box he be in clerical uniform a long coat and white cravat with corresponding long face and hair especially at the back of he head a soberer style of a stage bandit be never see he be just the man for cross-examination i see at a glance -- a fancy witness and i believe a welshman as he be a christian warrior i have to find out the weak place in he armor but little he know of court of law and the penetrate art of cross-examination which could make a hole in the triple-plated coat of fraud hypocrisy and cunning i be in no such panoply i fight only with my little pebblestone and sling but take good aim and then the missile fly with well-directed speed i have to throw at a venture at first because happily there be no instruction how to cross-examine not that i should have follow they if there have be but i might have get a _ fact _ or two from they it be well know that artifice be the resource of cunning whether it act on the principle of conceal truth or boldly assert falsehood here the reverend strategist do both : he know how a little truth could deceive you must remember that at this point of the case when the rev faker be call there be nothing to cross-examine about i know nothing of the party the witness the solicitor or any one except my learn friend it would not have be discreditable to my advocacy if i have submit to a verdict i will therefore give the point of the question which elicit the truth from the christian warrior and probably the non-legal reader of these memoirs may be interested in see what may sometimes be do by a few judicious question mr faker i say sir say faker you have tell we you act as the adviser of the testatrix yes sir spiritual adviser of course a spiritual bow you advise the deceased lady probably as to she duty as a die woman certainly duty to she husband -- be that one a slight hesitation in mr faker reveal the vast amount of fraud of which he be capable it be the smallest peephole but i see a good way till then there be nothing to cross-examine about but after that hesitation there be # 100000 worth he have betray himself at last faker say -- yes mr hawkin yes sir -- she duty to she husband in the way of _ provide _ for he be my next question oh yes quite so you be careful of course as you tell you learn counsel to avoid any undue influence certainly the will be not complete i think when you first see the die woman -- on the day i mean of she death no not at that time be it keep in a little bag by the pillow of the testatrix do she retain the key of the bag herself that be quite right have it be execute at this time i think you say not not at this time it have to be revise how do you obtain possession of the key i obtain they yes i know but without she knowledge it be awkward for faker but he have to confess that he be not sure then he frankly admit that the will be take out of the bag -- in the lady 's presence of course but whether she be quite dead or almost alive be uncertain and then he and the husband spiritually confer as to what the real intention of the die woman in the circumstance be _ likely to be _ and have ascertain that they make _ another will _ which they call settle the former one by carry out the lady 's intention the lady be now dead to all intention whatsoever this be the will which be offer for probate cresswell think it be a curious state of affair and listen with much interest to the further cross-examination have you ever see any other will i inquire it be quite a accidental question as one would put in a desultory sort of conversation with a friend er -- yes -- i have say faker what be that well it be a will to tell you the truth mr hawkin execute in my favor for # 5000 where be it i have not the original say the minister but i have a copy of it copy but where be the original original repeat faker yes the original there must have be a original if you have a copy oh say the rev faker i remember the original be destroy after the testatrix 's death how burnt even the very grave hannen my ever-respected friend and junior smile cresswell never prone to smile at villainy smile also the original burnt and only a copy produce what do you mean sir the situation be dramatic be it not strange i ask even in _ you _ view of thing that the original will should be burnt and the copy preserve yes answer the reverend gentleman perhaps it would have be better -- to have burn the copy and give we the original and more especially after the lady be dead but let I ask you _ why _ do you destroy the original will i press he again and again but he could not answer the reason be plain he ingenuity be exhaust and so i give he the finish stroke with this question -- will you swear sir that a original will ever exist the answer be no i know it _ must _ be the answer because there could be no other that would not betray he what be you explanation ask cresswell my explanation my lord be that the testatrix have often express to I she intention to leave I # 5000 and i write the codicil which be destroy to carry out she wish cresswell have warn jame early in the case as to the futility of call witness after the two who alone be necessary but to no purpose he hurry he client to destruction and i have never be able to understand he conduct the most that can be say for he be that he do not suspect any danger and take no trouble to avoid incur it it be curious enough that on the morning of the trial we have try to compromise the matter by offer # 10000 the refusal of the offer show how little they think that any cross-examination could injure they cause hannen say he could not have believe a cross-examination could be conduct in that manner without any knowledge of the fact and pay I the compliment of say it be worth at the least # 80000 chapter xv tattersall 's -- baron martin harry hill and the old fox in the yard tattersall 's in my time be one of the pleasantest Sunday afternoon lounge in london there be a spirit of freedom and social equality pervade the place which only belong to assembly where sport be the principal object and pleasure of all there be also the absence of irksome workaday drudgery i think that be after all the main cause of its be so delightful a meeting-place to I there be however another attraction and that be dear old baron martin one of the most pleasant companion you could meet no matter whether in the court of exchequer or the old ring a keen sportsman he be and a shrewd common-sense lawyer -- so great a lover of the turf that it be tell of he and i know it to be true that once in court a man be point out to he bow with great reverence and repeat it over and over again until he catch the baron 's attention the judge with one pair of spectacles on he forehead and another on he eye immediately cry aloud to he marshal custance the jockey as i be alive and then the baron bow most politely to the man in the crowd the most famous jockey of he day speaking of tattersall 's remind I of many thing amongst they of the way in which happily i come to the resolution never to bet on a horse-race it be here i learn the lesson at a place where generally people learn the opposite and never forget it no sermon would ever have teach I so much as i learn there like my oldest and one of my dearest friend on the turf lord falmouth i never make a bet after the time i speak of no one who live in the world need any description of the tattersall 's of to-day but the tattersall 's of my earlier day be not exactly the same thing although the difference would not be recognizable to person who have not over-keen recollection the institution have perhaps know more great man than parliament itself -- not so many bishop perhaps as the church but more statesman than could get into the house of lord and all the biography that have ever be write could not furnish more illustration of the up and downs of life especially the downs nor of more illustrious man the name of all the great and mediocre people who visit the famous rendezvous would fill a respectable court guide and the money transaction that have take place would pay off the national debt all this be a pleasant outcome of the national character do not suppose that judge other than baron martin never look in for they do and so do learn and illustrious queen 's counsel and serjeants-at-law author editor actor statesman and to sum it up in brief all the real man of the day of all profession and degree of social position at first my visit be infrequent afterwards i go more often and then become a regular attendant i love the old ring and yet could never explain why i think it be the variety of human character that charm I i be do very little at the bar and be no doubt desirous to make as many acquaintance as possible and to see as much of the world as i could it be a long way back in my career but i go over the course with no regret and with every feeling of delight everything seem to have be enjoyable in those far-off day although i be in a constant state of uncertainty with regard to my career there be three principal place of pleasure at that time : one be tattersall 's one newmarket and the court of law a third there use to be in the center of the yard or court at tattersall 's a significant representation of a old fox and i often wonder whether it be set up as a warning or merely by way of ornamentation or as the symbol of sport it might have be to tell you to be wary and on the alert but whatever the original design of this statue to reynard the old fox read I a solemn lesson and seem to be always say take care harry be on you guard there be many prowler everywhere but there be another monitor in constant attendance who be deservedly respect by all who have the pleasure of he acquaintance -- that be to say by all who visit tattersall 's more than once he be not in the least emblematic like the old fox but a man of sound sense with no poetry of a extremely good nature and full of anecdote you might follow he advice and it would be well with you or you might follow you opinion in opposition to he and take you chance he name be hill -- harry hill they familiarly call he -- and although you might have many a grander acquaintance you could never meet a truer friend he be a old and much-respected friend of the baron and that say a great deal for he for if anybody in the world could understand a _ man _ it be baron martin whether it be the prime minister or the unhappy thief in the dock he know all class and all degree of criminality he be not poetical with regard to landscape for if one be point out to he by some proprietor of a lordly estate he would say yes a vera fine place indeed and i would have the winning-post _ there _ the old fox and harry hill the two character at tattersall 's in those day can never be forget by those who know they it may seem strange in these more enlighten day that at that time i be under the impression that no one could make a bet unless he have the means of pay if he lose this statement will provoke a smile but it be true the consequence be that i be debar from speculate where i think i have a most excellent chance of win have be bring up to believe that the world be almost destitute of fraud -- a strange and almost unaccountable idea which only time and experience prove to be erroneous judge of the vast unexplored field of discovery that lay before I harry hill be better inform he have live longer and have be bring in contact with the cleverest man of the age he know at a glance the adventurous fool who stake he last chance when the odds be a hundred to one and also the man of honor who stake he life on he honesty -- and sometimes _ lose _ there be blackleg in those day who look out for such honest gentleman and _ win _ -- scoundrel who degrade sport and trade successfully on the reputation of man of honor you can not cope with these honesty can not compete with fraud either in sport or trade it be a very brief Sunday sermon which harry preached to I this afternoon but it be a effective one and out of the abundance of he good nature he give I these well-remembered word of friendly warning -- mr hawkin i see you come here pretty regularly on Sunday afternoon but i advise you not to speculate amongst we for if you do we shall beat you we know we business better than you do and you 'll get nothing out of we any more than we should get out of you if we be to dabble in you law for you know _ that _ business better than we do this disinterested advice i take to heart and treat it as a warning i thank mr hill promise to take advantage of he kindness and keep my word during the whole time that tattersall 's remain in the old locality which it do for a considerable period the establishment at this time be at hyde park corner and have be rent from lord grosvenor since 1766 it be use for the purpose of sell thoroughbred and other horse of a first-rate order until the expiration of the lease which be i think in 1865 it be then remove to knightsbridge where i still continue my visit the new premise or as it might be call the new institution be inaugurate with a grand dinner chiefly attend by member of the sport world include admiral rous george payne and many other well-known and popular patron of we national sport there be also a great many who be know as swell people who take a lively interest in race affair and other who belong to the literary and artistic world and enjoy the national sport as well it be a large assembly and if any person can enjoy a good dinner and lively conversation it be those who take a interest in sport mixed as the company might be it be uniform in its object which be to be happy as well as jolly that i should have be ask to be present on this historic occasion be extremely gratifying but i could find no reason for the honor confer upon I except that it ` might be because i have always endeavor to make myself agreeable -- a faculty if it be a faculty most invaluable in all the relation and circumstance of life i be flatter by the compliment because in reality i be the guest of all the really great man of the day but a still more striking honor be in store i be call upon to respond for somebody or something i do not remember what it be to this day nor have i the faintest notion what i ought to say i be perfectly bewildered and the first utterance cause a roar of laughter i do not at that time know the reason it be of no consequence whether you know what you be talk about in a after-dinner speech or not for say what you may hardly anybody listen and if they do few will understand the drift of you observation you get a great deal of applause when you stand up and a great deal more when you sit down i seem to catch my audience quite accidentally by use a word taboo at that time in sport circle because it represent the blackleg of the racecourse and be use as a nickname for rascaldom gentleman i say i have be unexpectedly call upon my _ leg _ -- then i stammer a apology for use the word in that company and the laughter be unbounded next morning all the sport papers report it as a excellent joke although the last person who see the joke be myself after dinner we adjourn to the new premise which include a betting-room since christen place by interpretation of a particular statute by myself and other oh the castigation i receive from the jockey club on that account whether the monitory fox be anywhere within the precinct i do not know but i miss he at that time and attribute to he absence the lapse from virtue which undermine my previous resolution and in a moment undo the merit of exemplary year however it bring I to myself and be after all a blessing in disguise -- and pleasant to think of we be in the betting-room and there be harry hill my genial old friend who have advise I to take care and never to bet because we know we business better than you do alas amidst the hubbub and excitement to say nothing of the joviality of everybody and the excellence of the champagne i say in a brave tone -- come now mr hill i _ must _ have a bet on the opening of the new tattersall i will give you even for a fiver on -- for the derby alas my friend who _ ought _ to have know better forget the good advice he have give I only a few year before and i heedless of consequence in my hilarity repeat the offer of even on the _ favorite _ do say two or three and amongst they hill i might have repeat the offer and accept the bet over and over again so popular be it do do do everywhere but hill be the man for my money and he have it before morning the _ favorite be scratch _ it be the race which hermit win poor hasting lose heavily and die soon after i have back the wrong horse and have never cease to wonder how i could have be so foolish let I advise you not to speculate amongst we be hill 's word for if you do we shall beat you and it cost I five pound to learn that a lawyer 's opinion may be worth what be pay for it in a case state but of the soundness of of a horse 's wind or the thousand and one ailment to which that animal 's flesh and blood be heir i know nothing -- not so much as the little boy who run and fetch in the stable and who could give the ablest lawyer in great britain or ireland odds on any particular favorite 's public form and beat he put not you trust in tipster they no more know that hermit have a chance for the derby than they could foretell the snowstorm that be come to enable he to win it this be the last bet i ever make and i owe my abandonment of the practice to harry hill who give I excellent advice and enforce it by example chapter xvi arise out of the orsinus affair the orsinus affair be one of high treason and murder it be the attempt on the part of a band of conspirator to murder napoleon iii in order to accomplish this _ political _ object they explode a bomb as nearly under he majesty 's carriage as they could manage but instead of murder the emperor they kill a policeman orsinus be capture try and execute in the good old french fashion he political career end with the guillotine -- a sharp remedy but effective so far as he be concern one dr simon bernard be more fortunate than he principal for he be in england the refuge of discontented foreign murderer who try to do good by stealth and sometimes feel very uncomfortable when they find that it turn out to be assassination bernard be a brother conspirator in this famous orsinus business and be apprehend in england be take to be try before lord chief justice campbell edwin jame and myself be retain for the defense there be no defense on the fact and no case on the law he be indict for conspiracy with orsinus to murder the emperor in paris i have prepare a very elaborate and exhaustive argument in favor of the prisoner on the law and have little doubt i could secure he acquittal but the fact be terribly strong and we know well enough if the jury convict campbell would hang the prisoner for he never tolerate murder with this view of the case we summon dr bernard to a consultation which be hold in one of the most ghastly room of newgate no more miserable place could be find outside the jail and it could only be surpass in horror by one within it might have be and probably be a anteroom to hell but of that i say nothing i leave my description for i can do no more justice to it the only cheerful thing about it be dr bernard himself he be totally unconcerned with the danger of he situation and regard himself as a hero of the first order murder hang guillotine -- all seem to be the everyday chance of life and to he there be nothing sweeter or more desirable if you might judge by he demeanor i think it well to mention the fact that if the jury find he guilty lord campbell would certainly sentence he to death he exhibit no emotion whatever but shrug he shoulder after the manner of a frenchman who differ from you in opinion say -- well if i be hang i must be hang that be all with a man like he it be impossible to argue or ask for explanation he seem to be possess with the one idea that to remedy all the grievance of the state it be merely necessary to blow up the emperor with he horse and carriage and coolly inform we without the least reserve that the bomb manufacture with this political object have be send over to pari from england conceal in firkin of butter i can find no word in which to express my feeling so end we first consultation the merit of the case be go there be no defense but whatever might be we opinion on dr bernard 's state of mind we could not abandon he to he fate we be retain to defend he and defend he we must even in spite of himself if we could do so consistently with we professional honor and duty accordingly we have another consultation and as i have say there be one other room in england more ghastly than that where we hold we first interview so now i reluctantly introduce you to it if a man about to be try for he life could look on this apartment and its horror unmoved he would certainly be a fit subject for the attention of the hangman and deserving of no human sympathy it be enough to shake the nerve of the hangman himself we be in a apartment on the north-east side of the quadrangular building where the sunshine never enter even daylight never come but only a feeble sickening twilight precursor of the grave itself it be not merely the gloom that intensify the horror of the situation or the ghastly tradition of the place or the impending fate of we callous client but there be a tier of shelf occupy the side of the apartment on which be place in dismal prominence the plaster-of-paris bust of all the malefactor who have be hang in newgate for some hundred year no man can look attractive after have be hang and the indentation of the hangman 's rope on every one of they neck with the mark of the knot under the ear give such a impression of all that can be conceive of devilish horror as would baffle the conception of the most morbid genius whether these thing be preserve for phrenological purpose or for the gratification of the most sanguinary taste i never know but they impress I with a disgust of the brutal tendency of the age dr bernard however seem to take a different view probably he be scientific he go up to they and examine as it seem every one of these ghastly memorial with a interest which could only be scientific it do not seem to have occur to he brain that _ he _ head would probably be the next to adorn that repository of criminal effigy he be in charge of a warder and look round with the utmost composure as though examine the caesar in the british museum and be as interested as any fanatical fool of a phrenologist he shrug he shoulder raise he eyebrow and repeat he old formulum well if i be to be hang i must be hang _ he be acquit _ my elaborate argument on the law be not necessary for the jury actually refuse to believe the evidence as to the fact such be the chance of trial by jury as a relief to this gloomy chapter i must tell you of a distinguished judge who have to sentence a dishonest butler for rob he master of some silver spoon he consider it he duty to say a few word to the prisoner in pass sentence in order to show the enormity of the crime of a servant in he position rob he master and by way of warn to other who might be tempt to follow he example you prisoner say he lordship have be find guilty by a jury of you country of steal these article from you employer -- mark that -- _ you employer _ now it aggravate you offence that he be you employer because he employ you to look after he property you _ do _ look after it but not in the way that a butler should -- mark that the judge here hem and cough as if somewhat exhaust with he exemplary speech and then resume he address which be ethical and judicial : you prisoner have _ no _ excuse for you conduct you have a most excellent situation and a kind master to whom you owe a debt of the deepest gratitude and you allegiance as a faithful servant instead of which you pay he by _ feather you nest with he silver spoon _ therefore you must be transport for the term of seven year the metaphor be equal to that employ by a attorney-general who at a certain time in the history of the home rule agitation address he constituent tell they that _ mr gladstone have send up a balloon to see which way the cat jump with regard to ireland _ he be soon appoint a judge of the high court judge however be not always master of they feeling any more than they be of they language they be sometimes carry away by prejudice or even control by sentiment i know one a very worthy and amiable man who have to sentence a prisoner to death be so overcome by the terrible nature of the crime that he inform the unhappy convict that he could expect _ no mercy either in this world or the next _ littledale again be a uncommonly kind and virtuous man a good husband and a learn judge but he be afflict with a wife whom he could not control she on the contrary controlled he and leave he no peace unless she have she will at time however she overdo she business littledale have a butler who have be in the family many year and with whom he would not have part on any account he would sooner have part with she ladyship one morning however this excellent butler come to sir joseph and say with tear in he eye -- i beg you pardon my lord -- what be the matter jame i be very sorry my lord say the butler but i wish to leave wish to leave jame why what do you wish to leave for have not you get a good situation capital sitiwation sir joseph and you have always be a good kind master to I sir joseph but o sir joseph sir joseph what then jame what then why do you wish to leave not go to get marry eh -- not surely go to get marry o jame do not do it heaven forbid sir joseph eh eh well then what be it speak out jame and tell I all about it tell I -- tell I as a friend if there be any trouble -- well sir joseph i could put up with anything from _ you _ sir joseph but i _ can not get on with my lady _ my lady be -- o jame what a sinner you make of I be that all jame then go down on you knee at once and _ thank god my lady be not you wife _ it be a happy thought and jame stay i do not think i have mention a curious reason that a jury once give for _ not _ find a prisoner guilty although he have be try on a charge of a most terrible murder the evidence be irresistible to anybody but a jury and the case be one of inexcusable brutality the man have be try for the murder of he father and mother and as i say the evidence be too clear to leave a doubt as to he guilt the jury retire to consider they verdict and be away so long that the judge send for they and ask if there be any point upon which he could enlighten they they answer no and think they understand the case perfectly well after a great deal of further consideration they bring in a verdict of _ not guilty _ the judge be angry at so outrageous a violation of they plain duty and do what he ought not to have do -- namely ask the reason they bring in such a verdict when they know the culprit be guilty and ought to have be hang that be just it my lord say the foreman of this distinguished body i assure you we have no doubt about the prisoner 's guilt but we _ think there have be death enough in the family lately and so give he the benefit of the doubt _ there be a young solicitor who have be entrust with a defense in a case of murder it be he first case of importance and he be of course enthusiastic in he devotion to he client 's interest indeed he enthusiasm rather overstep he prudence by dint of perseverance and persuasion he obtain a promise from a juror-in-waiting that if he should be on the jury he would consent to no other verdict than manslaughter which would be a tremendous triumph for the young solicitor the case be a very strong one for wilful murder the friendly juror-in-waiting take he seat in the box everything go well except the evidence and the solicitor 's heart almost fail for fear he man should give way the jury for a long time be unable to agree now the young solicitor feel it be he faithful juror who be stand out all agree but one my lord go back to you room say the judge which they do and after another long absence return with a verdict of manslaughter jubilant with he success the young solicitor meet he juryman congratulate he on he firmness and thank he for he exertion how do you manage it my good friend -- how do you manage it be a wonderful verdict -- wonderful oh say he i be determine not to budge i never budge conscience be ever my guide i suppose there be eleven to one against you eleven to one a tough job sir -- a tough job eleven for wilful murder eh say the jubilant young man dear I what a narrow squeak eleven for _ murder _ no sir exclaim the juror what then _ eleven for a acquittal _ you may depend upon it sir the other juror have be ` get at ' lord watson dine with I one grand day at gray 's inn say he recollect a very stupid and a very rude scottish judge -lrb- which seem very remarkable -rrb- who scarcely ever listen to a advocate and pooh-pooh everything that be say one day a celebrated advocate be argue before he when to express he contempt of what he be say the cantankerous old curmudgeon of a judge point with one forefinger to one of he ear and with the other to the opposite one you see this mr -- i do my lord say the advocate well it just go in here and come out there and he lordship smile with the hilarity of a judge who think he have actually say a good thing the advocate look and smile not _ likewise _ but a good deal more wise then the expression of he face change to one of contempt i do not doubt it my lord say he what be there to prevent it the learn judge sit immovable and look -- like a judicial -- _ wit _ i be now get on so well in my profession that in the mind of many of the unsuccessful there be a natural feeling of disappointment why one man should succeed and a dozen fail have ever be a unsolved problem at the bar and ever will be but the curious part of this natural law be that it manifest itself in the most unexpected manner come one day from a county court where i have have a successful day and hum a little tune whom should i meet but my friend morgan -- he be a very pleasant man what be call a _ nice man _ of a quiet religious turn of mind and nobody be ever more painstaking to push himself along he be a great stickler for a man 's do he duty and be possess with the idea that get on as i be it be my duty to refuse to take a brief in the county court come up to I on the occasion i refer to morgan say what _ you _ here hawkin i believe you would take a brief before the devil in h -- i be quite take aback for the moment by the use of such language if he have not be so religious a man perhaps i should not have feel it so much as it be i could hardly fetch my breath when i recover my equanimity i answer yes morgan i would and should get one of my devil to hold it he seem appease by my frank avowal for he love honesty almost as much as fee chapter xvii appoint queen 's counsel -- a serious illness -- sam lewi on January 10 1859 the lord chancellor do I the honor of recommend my name to she most gracious majesty and i be raise to the rank and dignity of a queen 's counsel this be a step of doubtful wisdom to most man in the legal profession for it be generally look upon as the end of a man 's career or the beginning i have no doubt about the propriety of the step it have be the object of my ambition and i believe i should unhesitatingly have act as i do even if it have be the termination of my professional life my idea be to go forward in the career i have choose the junior work if it have not lose its emolument no longer possess the pleasurable excitement of the old day it be never my ambition merely to mark time that be unsatisfactory exertion and lead no whither but enough i take silk and a new life open before I i be a leader my business roll on in ever-increasing volume so that i have to fairly pick my way through the constant downpour of briefs but be always press forward by that useful institution know as the barrister 's clerk whatever business overwhelm the counsel no amount of it would disconcert the clerk and it be wonderful how many briefs he can arrange in upstand attitude along mantelpiece table top of dwarf cupboard window -- anywhere in fact where there be anything to stand a brief on -- without that gentleman feel the least exhaust it would take as long to wear he out as to wear to a level the rock of niagara the loss of a brief to he be almost like the loss of a eye it would take a week after such a disaster to get the right focus of thing my clerk come rush into my room one day so pale and excited that i wonder if the man have lose he wife or child he do not leave I long in suspense as soon as he could articulate he word sir say he you know those emmet that you have do so much for i remember well sir they have take a brief to another counsel it be a serious misfortune no doubt and i have to soothe he in the best manner i could so to lessen the calamity i make the best joke i could think of in the circumstance and say the emmet be small people almost beneath notice i do not wonder that he do not see it with tear in he eye he distress be painful to witness the poor fellow be dumbfounded but at last shake he head say -- we have have a good deal from those emmet sir but you need not make mountain out of ant-hill he do not see that either i be now live in bond street and for the first time in my life be take seriously ill my clerk 's worry then come home to I not about a single brief but about a great many illness would be a very serious matter as i have arrive at a important stage in my career a barrister in full practice can not afford to be ill in my distress i send to baron martin as i be in every case in he list for the follow day and beg he to oblige I by adjourn he court it be a large request but i know he kindness and feel i might ask the favor baron martin i should think never in he life do a unkind act or refuse to do a kind one he instantly comply with my request and do not listen for a moment to the public interest as the foolish fetish be call which sometimes do duty for its neglect the public interest on this occasion be the interest of all those who have entrust they business to my keep the public interest be the interest of the suitor my illness threaten to be fatal i have be overworked and nothing but the greatest care and skill bring I round one never know what friendship be and what friend be till one be ill at length there be a consultation dr addison charle johnson duplex and f hawkin my cousin be present it be a kind of medical jury which sit upon I i will pass over detail and come to the conclusion of the investigation after consider the case dr addison who act as foreman of the jury say -- we find a verdict of ` guilty ' under mitigating circumstance the prisoner have not injure himself with intent to do any grievous bodily or mental harm but he have be guilty of negligence not have take due care of himself and we hope the sentence we be about to pass will act as a warn to he and deter other from follow a like practice the prisoner be release on bail to come up for judgment when call upon and the meaning of that be say dr addison that if you behave yourself you will hear no more of this but if you return to you former practice without any regard to the warning you have have you will be promptly call up for judgment and i need not say the sentence will be proportion to the requirement of the case you may now go to carry on dr addison 's joke i heartily thank he for take my good character into consideration and practically acquit I of all evil tendency act upon he good advice from that time to this i have never be in trouble again watson qc afterwards baron watson advise I to take a long rest but as he be not a doctor of medicine i do not act upon he advice a long rest would have kill I much faster than any amount of work so i work with judgment and although my business go on increase to a extent that would not have please dr addison i suffer no evil effect but seem to get through it with more ease than ever and be soon in a fair way to achieve the greatest goal of human endeavor -- a comfortable independence the reason of get through so much work be that i have to reject a great deal and of course have my choice of the best not only as to work but as to client to use a sport phrase i get the best mount and therefore be at the top of the record in win good case be easy -- they do not need win they will do they own work if you only leave they alone bad case require all you attention they want much prop and you only chance be that if you can not win you opponent may _ lose _ but nothing in the chatter about the bar be more erroneous than the talk of the tremendous income of counsel a man be never estimate at he true worth in this world certainly not a barrister actor physician or writer and as for income no one can estimate he neighbor 's except the income-tax commissioner they get pretty near sometimes however without know it one morning i be ride in the park when old sam lewi the great money-lender a man for whom i have much esteem and about whom i will relate a little story presently come alongside we be on friendly and even familiar term although i never borrow any money of he in my life why mr hawkin say he you seem to be in almost everything what a fortune you must be pile up not so big as you might think i reply why how many he rejoin be make as much as you a good many be do twenty thousand a year i dare say but -- here i check he curiosity by ask if he have ever consider what twenty thousand a year mean he never have then i will tell you lewi _ you _ may make it in a day but to we it mean five hundred golden sovereign every week in the working year it somewhat startle he i could see and it effect my object without give offence what do it matter to sam lewi what my income be there be man who make it he answer some man have make it i say and i know some who make more but will never own to it ask who may i may say i like sam lewi and have tell the story of the queen 's counsel who _ borrow _ my money in so dishonest a manner i will tell one of sam the professional money-lender he never be know to take advantage of a man in difficulty and he never do nor to charge any one exorbitant interest i have know he lend to man and allow they to fix they own time of payment they own rate of interest and they own security he often lend without any at all he know he man and be not fool enough to trust a rogue at any amount of interest he be know and respect by all rank and never more esteemed than by those who have have pecuniary transaction with he he be the soul of honor and he transaction be world-wide business pass through he hand that would have be entrust nowhere else so that he be rich and no one be more deservedly so here be a incident in lewi 's business life that will show one phase of he character he hold a number of bill many of which be suspect by he to be forge -- that be to say that the figure have be alter after the signature of the acceptor have be write they be all in the name of lord -- one day lewi meet he lordship in the park and mention he suspicion at the same time invite he to call and examine the bill the noble lord be a little amaze and proceed at once to lewi 's office seating himself on one side of the table with he lordship on the other lewi hand to he the bill one by one and request he to set aside those that be forge the separation have be make it appear that over _ twenty thousand-pound ' worth of the bill be forge _ the noble lord be a little startled at the discovery but he mind be soon ease by lewi put the whole of the forge bill into the fire there be a end of they my lord say he we want no prosecution and i do not wish to receive payment from you i ought to have examine they with more care and you ought not to have leave space enough before the first figure to supplement it by another the rogue could not resist the temptation so end this monetary transaction creditable alike to the honor and generosity of the money-lender the most steady of mind will sometimes go on the tramp this be never better illustrated than when the young curate be be marry and the officiate clergyman ask he the formal question wilt thou have this woman to thy wed wife the poor bridegroom lose self-control and not have yet a better half to keep he straight answer that be my desire anticipate by a considerable period a totally different religious ceremony of the church -- namely the baptism of infant in he anticipation the young man have overreach the necessity of the situation this momentary digression lead I to the follow story i be stay at the house of a old friend a wealthy hebrew while another of the guest be arthur a ` becket as will sometimes happen when you be in good spirit the conversation take a religious turn we drift into it unconsciously and we worthy host be tell we that he be in the habit of pray night and morning be in a communicative mood i say well since you name it i sometimes say a little prayer myself the hebrew be attentive and seem not a little surprised this be especially the case in the morning i add but once upon a time my mind waver a little between business and prayer and i find myself in the midst of my devotional exercise say ` gentleman of the jury ' thank god cry a ` becket we friend hawkin be not a unitarian i often wonder how i be able to get through the amount of business that press upon I and retain my health but happily i do so one great factor in my fortunate condition of health be perhaps that i have no ridiculous ambition what be to come would come as the result of hard work for i be bear to no miraculous interposition or official friendship have drop gamble i set to work and after a long spell of _ nisus prius _ in all its phase have engage my attention a new sphere of action present itself in the shape of compensation case -- a easy and lucrative branch which seem to be add to rather than have grow out of we profession but whatever be its connection it be a prolific branch hang down with such good fruit that it require no tempter to make you taste it railway government and municipal authority be everywhere take land for public improvement and where they be as a rule my friend horace lloyd and myself be engage in friendly rivalry as to the amount to be pay chapter xviii the prize-fight on frimley common i must now describe a remarkable event that occur a great many year ago and which cause no little amusement at the time indeed for year after baron parke use to tell the story with the greatest pleasure in those old day there be a prize-fight on frimley common and it be know long after as the frimley common prize-fight although many a battle have take place on frimley ridge before that time and many a one since this particular fight be the more celebrated because one of the combatant be kill and i remember the event connect with it as clearly as if they have take place only yesterday at the follow kingston assize the victorious pugilist be indict for manslaughter it be a awful charge especially before the judge who be then preside the man however escape for the moment and a warrant be issue for he apprehension at a later period i be at guildford where the assizes be be hold even at that time the man want for the manslaughter could be easily identify for he still bear visible sign of the punishment he have undergo in the encounter i be sit in court one afternoon when a country sport attorney of the name of morri quietly sidle up to I i ought to mention that at these assizes lord chief justice erie be sit and it be well know that he also detest the prize ring and have therefore no sympathy with any of its member he be consequently a dangerous judge to have anything to do with in a case of this kind he punishment would be sure to be one of severity and a conviction a dead certainty there be a sparkle in the sport solicitor 's eye as he glance at I over he shoulder which plainly intimate that he have something good to communicate as he come in front of the seat where i be he say in a subdue whisper that he have be instruct by lord -- to defend the accuse prize-fighter that the man be at that moment in the town and would like to have my opinion as to whether it would be prudent to surrender at these assizes -- surrender that be to say to the constable who be on the lookout for he or whether it would be better as they be ignorant of he whereabouts to delay he trial until the next assizes when he would be better prepare to face the tribunal as by that time he would have recover from the punishment he have receive it be certain the jury would have take he battered appearance as evidence of the damage he have inflict on he adversary whom he have unfortunately kill and even more likely that erle should have regard he injury in the same light and punish he more severely for have receive they i have a perfect right to answer the question put to I and feel that it be my duty to the accuse to answer frankly so i say there be little doubt as the man be dead and the accuse still bear unmistakable sign of the contest there would be pretty clear evidence of identity that as erle be not a fool he would most certainly convict he while be oppose to everything connect with the noble art of self-defence he might send he to penal servitude for a number of year i have no need to say more the solicitor who be a ready-witted and voluble man be anxious to amalgamate he opinion with mine he be shrewd and catch a idea before you could be sure you have one yourself the most prudent thing sir he say would be to surrender at the next assizes and not at these that be just what i think sir and so i tell he advise in the meantime that he should carefully avoid put himself in the way of the police i have no doubt he act on this opinion for i hear that he leave the town immediately and be neither see nor hear of again till the eve of the spring assize which be to be hold at kingston and at which baron parke be to preside the baron be one of the shrewdest of man as any one would discover who attempt to deceive he on the commission day the attorney for the accuse present himself to I again and once more seek my opinion with regard to the trial and the surrender of the accuse would it be proper he ask for my client to show he respect for the court and dress in a become manner or should he appear in he everyday clothes as a work bricklayer dirty and unwashed again i advise as be my duty that he should scrupulously regard the dignity of the bench and show the greatest respect to the learn judge who preside that he ought not to come in a disgraceful costume if he could help it but appear as becomingly attire as possible that be all i say let I also observe what perhaps there be no occasion to say that i impressed upon the attorney that he client should abstain from any appearance of attempt to deceive the judge and inform he as the fact be that he lordship be scrupulously particular in all point of etiquette and decorum moreover i add as a last word the judge be too shrewd to be take in after thus duly impress upon he the importance of a quiet behavior i suggest that any costume other than that of the man when actually engage in the fight _ might _ throw some difficulty in the way of a young and inexperienced country constable identify he it be never too late for even a bricklayer to mend he garment or he manners and adjust they to the occasion the policeman who alone could identify the frimley champion have not see he for many month -- not since the fight in fact and the prisoner ought not to appear in the dock in fight costume as the young surrey constable see he on that one occasion moreover baron parke would not like he to appear in that dress this be as nearly as i can remember all that take place between we judge now of my surprise if you can when the case be call on to see the prisoner appear in the dock look like a _ young clergyman _ dress in a complete suit of black a long frock coat fitting he up to the neck and very nearly down to the heel he have the appearance of a very tame curate he hair instead of be short and stumpy as when the young policeman see he be now long shiny and carefully brush over both side of he forehead which give he the appearance so fashionable amongst the saint of the old master i be utterly astounded at the change from the rude rough bricklayer scar all over the face to the clergyman-like appearance of this gentlemanly prisoner i dare not laugh but it be difficult to maintain my countenance deceive baron parke i think he would deceive the devil himself who know a great deal more about parson than parke do the learn judge look at he for a considerable time as though he have never see a prize-fighter before and be determine to make the most of he if the ghost of hamlet have stand in the dock instead of the prisoner he would not have surprise dear old parke more than the prisoner do it be a masterpiece of deception notwithstanding my serious warning on the jury it so happen be a elderly quaker in he full array of drab coat vest and breeches with the regulation blue stocking he have long whitish hair and a quaker hat in front of he on the ledge of the jury-box he be what might be call a factor in the situation which it be no easy matter to know in a moment how to deal with he would be against prize-fighting to a certainty but how far he might be incline to convict a prize-fighter be another matter at last i make up my mind in what way to deal with he and it be this -- not on the merit of the noble art itself but on those of the case if i could convince this conscientious juror that there _ might be _ -lrb- that would be good enough -rrb- a doubt as to identity it would be sufficient for my purpose so i mainly address myself to _ he _ after dispose of the young policeman pretty satisfactorily leave only he bare belief to be deal with in argument the young policeman 's belief that _ that there _ be the man show what a strong young policeman he be i ask the quaker to allow I to suggest for the sake of argument only that _ he _ the quaker should imagine himself put off he quaker dress and assume the costume of a prize-fighter he hair cut so short that it would present the appearance of a aged rat then say i divest yourself of you shirt and flannel -- strip yourself in fact quite to the skin above you belt -- and with only a pair of cotton drawer of a sky blue or any other color you might prefer and say a bird 's - eye _ fogle _ round you waist you lower limb terminate in cotton sock and high-low -- with the additional ornamentation to all this elegant drapery of a couple of you front tooth knock out -- and i will venture to ask you sir and any one of the gentleman whom i be address whether you think you own good and respectable wife herself would recognize the partner of she joy the burst of laughter which this little transformation of the respectable stout old quaker occasion i be in no way responsible for but even old parke fall back in he seat and say -- mr hawkin mr hawkin i know what that mean and when the usher by dint of much clamor secure I another hearing i continue -- nay sir and if you look at yourself in a looking-glass you would not be able to recognize a single feature you possess have you be batter about the face as the unfortunate man be why the young policeman say in he evidence he nose be flatten he eye be swollen black blue and red he cheek gash and bloody but it be enough : if that be a correct description although a mild one of the man as he appear after the scene of the conflict how can you expect the young constable to recognize such a individual month afterwards or any of the witness although to they die day they would not forget the terrible disfigurement of the poor fellow whom you be suppose to be try all this time there be everywhere painfully suppress laughter and even the jury all of they epsom man and many of whom i know well enough be hardly able to contain themselves he lordship after sum up the case to the jury look down quietly to I as i be sit below he and murmur -- hawkin you have get all epsom with you yes i answer but you have get the quaker he be the only one i be afraid of you have transform he say the judge in a few minute the verdict show the accuracy of he lordship 's observation for the jury return a verdict of not guilty i must say however that parke do he utmost to obtain a conviction but reason and good sense be too much for he chapter xix sam warren the author of ten thousand a year amongst the illustrious man whom i have meet the name of sam warren deserve remembrance for he be a genial good-natured man full of humor and generally entertain a good opinion of everybody include himself he not only achieve distinction in he profession and become a queen 's counsel but write a book which attain a well-deserved popularity and be entitle ten thousand a year he be a member of the northern circuit and i believe be as popular as he book that he do not become a judge like several of he friend be not sam 's fault for no man go more into society cultivate acquaintance of the best style or have better qualification for the honor than he but although he do not achieve this distinction he be make a little lower than that order and become in due time a _ master in lunacy _ a post as it seem from sam 's description of the highest importance and no little fun a part of he duty be to visit lunatic asylum and other place where these patient be confine with a view to report to the authority he opinion of the patient ' mental condition no doubt to a man of sam 's observant mind this work present many study of interest as well as situation of excitement and at time of no little humor he find for instance that many of these poor creature be possess of a much larger income than ten thousand a year some of they be duke and some supernatural being who be just on a visit to this little clod of a world to see how thing be go soon after he appointment and before he have become use to the work he tell I of a singular experience he once have with a particular gentleman whom he be intend to report as have perfectly recover from any mental aberration with which he might have be afflict sam wonder how it be possible that a gentleman of such culture and understanding should be consider a fit subject for confinement for he have several pleasant and intellectual conversation with he and find he quite agreeable and refined and of a perfectly balanced mind i have be tell say the master that the peculiar form of derangement with this gentleman be that he have aspire to distinction in the english church and on one memorable occasion when i call he receive I not with the usual familiarity but with a certain stiffness and solemnity of bearing which be hardly in keep with he courteous demeanor on other occasion one have to be on one 's guard at all time or he might get a knife plunge into he without notice i chat for some time in a kind and easy manner hope to find that the mild restraint and discipline have do the poor fellow good alas how deceive i be when in a sudden rage he turn upon I and ask _ who the devil i think i be talk to _ i tell he a gentleman of a kind nature i be sure and of a amiable disposition ` yes ' say he ` but that be no reason why you should not treat I with proper deference and with due respect for my exalted position ' i bow politely and express a hope that i should never forget what be due from one gentleman to another ` no no ' say he ` that kind of excuse will not do one gentleman to another indeed whom be you talk to i insist on you treat I with reverence and respect perhaps you do not know that i be _ st paul _ ' ` indeed ' say i ' i be not aware that i be speak to that holy apostle to one whom i hold in extreme reverence and whose writings i have make my study ' after that it seem they get on very well together for the rest of the interview warren be able to delight he with he knowledge of cappadocium phrygium and pamphylium and the little incident of leave he cloak at troa he shipwreck and a vast number of thing which the apostle seem very pleased to hear while he conduct himself with that pious dignity which well deserve the obsequious reverence of the official visitor on parting st paul say -- you be rather _ mix in you scripture _ the only thing you be accurate about be _ leave my cloak at troa _ on warren 's next visit he resolve to conduct himself with more reverence st paul be look much the same as on the previous occasion sam genuflect and hold down he head put he hand devoutly together and make such other manifestation of reverence as he think the case require st paul look at warren with wonderment and be evidently by no means satisfy with he salutation who the devil say the madman do you think you be make those idiotic sign to whom do you take I for st paul you holiness ` st paul you holiness ' he repeat ` my -- you ought to be put into a lunatic asylum and look after you must be stark mad to think i be the holy apostle st paul what put that into you silly brain down on you knee villain at once and prostrate yourself before _ the shah of persium _ -- the dawn of creation and the light of the universe ' i think this be come it pretty strong continued sam but as it be all in my day 's work i conform as well as i could to my instruction the difficulty be in know how to address he majesty so i stammer ` dread potentate ' and see it please he ` light of the universe ' i cry ` it be morning may i rise ' ' i perceive ' say the shah ` you be a genius ' what do you think of he state of mind after that i ask sam laugh and answer : i think he be get better more rational and thank he for he good opinion ` mighty potentate ' say i ` monarch of the universe i apologize for my mistake but i be at _ st luke 's _ yesterday ' ` my faithful luke ' say he and clap he hand i know once more where he be ` the last time ' say i -lrb- think i would rather have he the amiable paul than the savage shah -rrb- ` you majesty inform I that you be the holy apostle st paul ' ` so i be ' answer the shah ' i be at a loss you majesty i humbly confess to understand how you immortal highness can be at one and the same time the bless apostle st paul and the shah of persium ' ` because you be such a damned fool ' reply he highness here be the fierceness of the shah but immediately the gentleness of the apostle restore he to a more amiable mood and come towards I with a smile he say -- ` the explanation my dear sir be simple ' and then in a quiet confidential tone he add : ' _ it be the same mother but two father _ ' i have another experience not long after in the same asylum continue warren one of my patient tell I he have marry the devil 's daughter when i be ask he about he relation ` she be a nice girl enough ' he say ` and although my people think i have marry beneath I i be satisfy with she rank see she be a prince 's daughter we go off on we honeymoon in a chariot of fire which she father lend we for the occasion and have a comfortable time of it at monte carlo where all the hotel be under she father 's special patronage ' ' i hope ' say i ` you marriage be a happy one ' ` yes ' say he with a sigh ' _ but we do not get on well with the old folk _ ' \* \* \* \* \* no writer be ever more solicitous of fame than sam warren it be a proud moment whenever there be the remotest allusion to he authorship and i always love to compliment he on he book in the famous case of lord st leonard 's will which have be lose i support the lose will and prove its contents from the evidence of miss sugden and other sam warren have be in the habit of visit lord st leonard at boyle farm ditton he give evidence as to what lord st leonard have tell he respect he intention as to the disposal of he property after examine he i say with a polite bow : mr warren i owe you a apology for bring you into the probate court i be sure no one will ever dream of dispute _ you _ will because you have leave everybody ' _ ten thousand a year _ ' whereupon warren bow most politely to I in acknowledgment of the compliment then bow to the _ judge _ and receive he lordship 's bow in return then bow to the _ jury _ then to the _ bar _ and lastly to the _ gallery _ writing of the probate and divorce court remind I of a curious application for the postponement of a trial make by george brown who be as good a humorist as he be a lawyer i have say that judge in those day be more strict in refuse these application than in ours and cresswell be no exception to the rule he dislike they and rarely yield but brown be a man of a very persuasive manner and it be always difficult to refuse he anything i be sit in cresswell 's court when george rise as soon as the judge have take he seat and ask if a case might be postpone which would be in the next day 's list have you a affidavit mr brown as to the reason yes my lord but i can hardly put the real ground of my application into the affidavit i have communicate with the other side and they be perfectly agreeable under the circumstance i can not agree to postpone without some adequate cause be state say cresswell i be very sorry my lord but it will be very inconvenient to I to be here to-morrow there be a laugh round the bar which cresswell observe ask what the real reason be brown smile and blush nothing would bring he to state plainly what the reason of he application be at last however he stammer -- my lord the fact be i be go to take the first step towards a divorce the appeal touch the judge the reason be sufficient every step in a divorce be to be encouraged especially the first the application be grant and brown be marry the next day chapter xx the brighton card-sharping case from the court of justice to the prize-ring be a easy and sometimes pleasant transition especially in book i visit from time to time such well-known person as deaf burke nat langham dutch sam and owen swift all remarkable man with constitution of iron and make like perfect model of humanity they name be unknown in these day although in those of the long past gentleman of the first position be proud of they acquaintance and these man although they profession be batter one another be as little inclined to brutality as any and when it be remember that they play they game in accordance with strict rule and on the most scientific principle it will be see that cruelty form no part of they character the true sportsman of the period amongst whom be the highest in the social and political world take the same interest in contest in the ring as they do on the turf or in the cricket-field and for the same reason whether jem mace would beat tom sayer have as much interest at fashionable dinner-table as whether lord derby would dispose of aberdeen or palmerston lord and duke back they opinion in thousand and the bargee and the ostler give or take the odds accord to the tip in shilling the gentleman of the long robe therefore be not to be suppose as altogether out of he element in sport circle any more than the gentleman who have not a rag to cover he nor be it uncommon to meet what be call the cream of society at the celebrated rendezvous of ben caunt which be the coach and horse st martin 's lane or at the less pretentious resort of the tipton slasher and what will we modern lady think of they fair predecessor who in those day witness the drawing of a badger or a dog-fight on a Sunday afternoon all mankind will attend exhibition of skill and prowess and although prize-fight be illegal you never can suppress the spirit which engender that form of competition i spend sometimes with many eminent spectator a quiet hour or two at tom spring 's in holborn and meet many of the best man there in all rank and profession always except the church after one of these entertainment i be travel with john gully once a formidable champion of the ring and at that time a great bookmaker as well as owner of racehorse -- afterwards present at court to she most gracious majesty the late queen -- and member of parliament we be travel on we way to bath and as we approach a tunnel not far from we destination gully point out a particular spot where say he i win my first fight and so proud be he of the recollection that he might have be in a picture like that of wellington point out the field of waterloo to a young lady this knowledge of the world see as i see it be of the greatest use in my profession if you would know the world you must not confine yourself to its virtue there _ be _ another side and it be well to look at it i think on one particular occasion how useful a little of this knowledge would have be during a certain cross-examination of arthur orton in chancery by a member of the chancery bar he put this question and many other of a similar kind -- do you swear sir that you be on board the _ bellum _ in a very severe tone yes sir say the claimant i do stop say the advocate i 'll take that down and he do with a great deal besides he cross-examination materially assist the man in prolong he fraudulent claim i be engage in the brighton card-sharping case upon which so much stress be lay by the claimant as prove he identity with roger tichborne roger not have be in the matter at all i be counsel for one of the person the notorious johnny broom who be indict for fraud and whose trial ought to have come on before lord chief justice jervi he be not a good judge so far as the _ defendant _ be concern to try such a case and that be johnny 's opinion he abscond from he bail the lord chief justice have a great knowledge of card-sharping and of all other roguery so that he be a apt man to deal with delinquent who practice they conviction before he would have be certain in this case he be in fact wait for johnny as it be a case of great roguery and intend to deal severely with he you may imagine then how angry he be when he hear that he man have fly but there be one consolation : the broom gang consist of a number of man who act on all occasion as confederate when the fraud be practice two of these rogue be also indict and place on they trial at this assize a mr johnson appear for the prosecution and in open the case for the crown in order to show he uncommon fairness be so impartial as to state that he could find no ground of complaint in respect of the _ card _ which he say have be most carefully examine by the brighton magistrate who these brighton magistrate be i never hear but probably they be gentleman who know nothing of sharper and they way and whose only experience of card be a quiet rubber with the lady of they household however such be they unanimous opinion and upon it the counsel for the crown inform the lord chief justice that he have no case so far as the fairness of the card be concern the lord chief justice see in a moment the importance of that admission on the part of the prosecution if that be accept the case be go since the fraud for which these man be indict could not have be perpetrate by honest card the brighton magistrate say the chief justice with become emphasis give I the card i should like to have a look at they they be hand up and then a little scene take place which be picturesque and instructive the judge take up the card one by one after carefully wipe and adjust he glass to he nose while he confidential clerk lean over he shoulder with clerk-like familiarity have scrutinize they with the minutest observation jervi pack they up and turn to mr johnson say -- mr johnson i will show you how the trick be do if you will take that card -- hand he one from the pack -- you will see that to the ordinary eye there be nothing to attract you attention that be precisely as it should be in all game of cheating for if every fool could see the private mark the rogue could not carry on they call johnson take the card and instruct by the lord chief justice carefully look it over but see nothing he face be a perfect blank and he mind could not have be much more picturesque turn it over say he lordship johnson obey still the cryptic hierograph do not appear the judge stare at he pupil do you see ask he lordship a tiny mark on the corner of the card at the back oh i see it say johnson with a face beam with delight and simplicity that mean _ the ace of diamond _ say the chief -- ace of diamond mr johnson and thus after a while the card and they secret sign be explain to the counsel for the crown who on the intelligence of the brighton magistrate declare that so far as the _ card _ be concern he must acquit these card-sharping rogue of all intention to deceive in all case the back of the card show what be on the face that be the simple secret of the whole contrivance although the brighton magistrate could not discover it as the whole of they combine have not a hundredth part of the intelligent cuteness of lord chief justice jervi two of this gang be stand near I and i hear one of they say to the other -- joey how would you like to play blind hookey with that -- old devil o my g -- exclaim joey the prisoner be convict principally upon the evidence of the lord chief justice and sentence to long term of imprisonment my client johnny get away he read about jervi and this trial in the papers and declare he would sooner abandon he profession than be try by such a old thief why say he that old bloke know every trick on the board he escape be rather interesting he come into lewe fully intend to take he trial and go out of lewe with the determination not to be try at those assizes for the simple reason as he say that jervi be too heavy weight for he counsel he take a room and show himself publicly but at night the police -- those stalwart county man -- pay a tiptoe visit to he bedroom they have no right to this privilege but perhaps harry think it would be better for he brother if they do so why they go on tiptoe be that harry tell they he brother be in so weak a state that he wake up with the least noise the police very kindly believe he and pay they first and second visit on tiptoe when they go the third time however they bird have fly johnny have let himself down by the window and evade the vigilance of those who may have be on the lookout escape but he do not go without provide a substitute harry be to answer all inquiry and wait the arrival of he watcher lie in johnny 's bedroom when the officer come he open the door in he night apparel and say hush do not disturb he poor johnny be not sleep hardly for a week over this ` ere job but you can have a peep at he only do not make a noise there he be and he point to a fancy nightcap of he brother 's which only want johnny 's head to make the story true the good constable have see it as they see it the night before leave the house as quietly as mouse still on tiptoe harry describe this performance to I himself jervi have the whole country scour for he but unless he have scour it himself there be little chance of any one else find the culprit chapter xxi the knebworth theatrical entertainment -- sir edward bulwer -- lytton -- charle dickens charle mathew macready dougla jerrold and many other among my pleasantest reminiscence be the partly amateur and partly professional entertainment that take place at the celebrated seat of the distinguished author sir edward bulwer-lytton about the year 185 - at that time a gentleman of position usually seek to enhance the family dignity by a seat in parliament the most brilliant mediocrity even could not succeed without the patronage of the great family while the great family be dependent upon those who have the franchise for the seat they covet forty-shilling freeholder be of some importance in those day hence these theatrical performance at knebworth park for sir edward want they suffrage without bribery or corruption those who be the happy possessor of what they call the frankise be also distinguish enough to be invite to the great performance at the candidate 's beautiful estate it be a happy thought to give a succession of dramatic entertainment amongst which every man in he humor be one sir edward know he constituent and they taste it would be better than oratory at some village inn to ask they to the stately hall of knebworth and give they one of we fine old english play i have already say that i have make up my mind in my earliest day to go to the bar or on the stage and that love for the histrionic art -lrb- sometimes call the footlights -rrb- never leave I for some reason or other i be invite to join the illustrious company which assemble on those eventful evening although i be cast for a very humble part in the performance nor be there much to wonder at when i tell you who my colleague be first come that most distinguish comedian of he day charle mathew i have know he for many a year and like he the better if that be possible the longer i know he mathew be the leader of the company next be another illustrious man whose name will live for ever and who be not only one of the greatest author of he time but also the most distinguish of the non-professional actor have he be on the stage mathew himself could not have surpass he this be charle dickens after he come a great friend of sir edward john foster a barrister of lincoln 's inn and author of the life of goldsmith as well as editor of the _ examiner _ newspaper i be not quite sure whether macready be present on this particular occasion but i think he be there be really so many illustrious name that it be impossible at this distance of time to be sure of every one macready be a great friend of bulwer and with dickens and other be engage in give stage representation for charitable purpose in london and the province so that it be at least possible i may be confounding knebworth with some other place where i be one of the company amongst we also be another whose name will always command the admiration of he countryman dougla jerrold there be also mark lemon frank stone and another royal academician john leech frederick dickens radcliffe eliot yorke henry hale and other whose name escape my memory at the present moment no greater honor could be show to a young barrister than to invite he to meet so distinguish a company and what be even more gratifying to my vanity ask I to act with they in the performance there be many lady some of they of the greatest distinction but without the leave of those who be they immediate relative which i have no time now to obtain i forbear to mention they name in this work the business -- for business it be as well as the greatest pleasure -- be no little strain on my energy for i be now obtain a large amount of work and appear in court every day i have the orthodox number of devil -- at least seven -- to assist I and every morning they come and receive the briefs they be to hold alas of the illustrious people i have mention all be dead all save one lady and myself when will such a company meet again i be no sooner in the midst of knebworth 's delightful association than i be anxious to return to the toilsome duty of the law court with they prosaic pleading and windbag eloquence i be want in several consultation long before the court meet so that it be idle to suppose i could stay the night at knebworth but what would i have give to be able to do so not my briefs they be the business of my life without which the knebworth pleasure would not have be possible i never look with any other feeling than that of pleasure on my work and whenever the question arise i decide without hesitation in favor of the more profitable but less delightful occupation but i manage a compromise now and then for instance after i have do my duty in the consultation and see my work fairly start in court i contrived to take the train pretty early to knebworth in order to attend rehearsal as well as perform in the evening sir edward 's good-nature cause he much distress at my have to journey to and fro what _ could _ he do he offer I the sole use of he library during the time i be there if i could make it in any way helpful and say it should be fit up as a bedroom and study but it be impossible to do other than i do the rehearsal be nearly always go on -- we have audience as though they be _ matines _ -- and they afford much amusement to we as well as the spectator when we make we correction or abused one another for some egregious blunder this of course do not include mathew who coach we from a improvise royalty box where he graciously act as george iv get up in a wonderful georgian costume for the occasion george be so good that he divert the attention of the audience from we and make a wonderful hit in he new character i will not say that at we regular performance we always win the admiration but i will affirm that we certainly receive the forbearance of we audience which say a great deal for they this observation however do not of course apply to the professional artist but only to myself who luckily through all the business still keep my head and it will be easily understand that this be the more difficult especially if i may include my temper with it when the good-natured baronet actually invite several of he hertford friend and neighbor to take part in the performance some of they be friend of my own and member of my profession so that at this electioneering time the whole of that division be alive with theatricals and every man in he humor which be exactly what sir edward want it be a ordeal for some of we to rehearse with the celebrity of the stage but i need not say they good-humour and delight in show how this and that should be do and how this and that should be speak be i be sure reciprocate by all the amateur in study the correction never be lesson more kindly give or receive with more pleasurable surprise some could scarcely conceive how they could so blunder in accent and emphasis however most thing require learn even advocacy and act eliot yorke be stage-manager and write a very excellent prologue it must have be good it be so heartily applaud and the same may be say of all of we i think radcliffe study the part of old knowell while i play young knowell speaking after this interval of many year i believe we be all word-perfect and pretty well conscious of we respective duty charle dickens arrange we costume while nathan supply they he arrange I well i be quite satisfied with my elizabethan ruff wound round my throat but must confess that it be a little uncomfortable for the first three or four hour my hose also give I great satisfaction and some little annoyance i think if i could walk into court without change my costume what a sensation i should create what would campbell or jervi say to _ young knowell _ my father as i have mention live at hitchin about six mile from knebworth and my professional duty call I so early to town i arrange to sleep at hitchin and go to london by a early train in the morning sir edward be much concern at all this and again wonder whether he library could not be appropriate but the other be the only practicable plan and be adopt every day i be in court by nine o'clock sometimes work till five then go by rail to stevenage and drive to knebworth three mile that be the routine it be then time to put on my elizabethan ruff and hose after the play i once more don my private costume and sup luxuriously at a round table where all we splendid company be assemble after supper some of we use to retire to dougla jerrold 's room in one of the tower and there we spend a jovial evening prolong the entertainment until the small hour of the morning then my fly which have be wait a long time enable I to reach hitchin and get three hour ' sleep all this be hard work but i be really strong and in the best of health so that i enjoy the labor as well as the pleasure one can not now conceive how it be possible to go through so much without break down i attribute it however to the attendant excitement which brace I up and have always find that excitement will enable you to exceed you normal strength i have very many theatrical friend all of they delightful in every way amongst they wright and paul bedford such companion as these be not to be meet with twice each with he individuality while the two in combination be incomparable they keep one in a perpetual state of laughter paul be irresistible in he drollery and whether it be mimicry or original humor you could not but revel in its quaint conceit such man be benefactor they brighten the darkest hour of existence turn sorrow into laughter and enable man to forget they trouble and live a little while in the sunshine of humor banish philosophy if you please banish ambition if you must banish something but leave we _ humor _ the light of the social world all who have experience its beautiful influence can appreciate its value and understand it as one of the choicest blessing confer on we existence the dullest company be enliven when wright enter upon the scene i remember paul be tell one day at the garrick club that a certain poor barrister who have be a actor be go to marry the daughter of a old friend ah say he yes he be _ a lover without spangle _ who but paul would have think of so grotesque a simile and yet its applicability be simply due to the language of the stage i remember robson too and he wonderful act he have no rival nature have give he the talent which art have cultivate to the highest perfection next come the keely ' impersonation of every phase of dramatic life -- original in act and actor of original but i must not linger over this portion of my story it would occupy many page and time and space be limited i therefore take my leave of one of the pleasantest chapter in my reminiscence all alas have pass away -- all i know and love all who make that time so happy and reluctantly as i say it it must be say : farewell dear grand old knebworth with all thy glory and all the glad face and merry heart i meet within you wall -- a long long farewell chapter xxii crockford 's -- the hook and eye -- dougla jerrold crockford 's have become a mere reminiscence but worthy in many respects of be preserve as part of the history of london it be historic in many of its association as well as its incident and man who make history as well as those who write it meet at crockford 's it be celebrated alike for high play and high company as i never have a real passion for gamble it be to I a place of great enjoyment for there be some of the celebrated man of the day amongst its invite guest -- wit poet novelist playwright painter -- in fact all who have distinguish themselves in art or literature law science or learning of any kind be always welcome it be as pleasant a lounge as any in london not except tattersall 's which have equal claim on my memory at crockford 's i meet captain h -- a wonderful gamester he die early but not too early for he welfare see that all the chance of life be against the gambler padwick too i know he entertain with refine and lavish hospitality he be one of the winner in the game of life who do not die early he tell good story and put much interest into they he know palmer the rugeley poisoner -- a sport man of the first water who poison john parson cook for the sake of he winnings and he wife and mother it be say for the sake of the insurance on they life padwick know everybody 's deed and misdeed who seek to increase he wealth on the turf or at the gaming-table he be a just and honorable man but without any sympathy for fool other i could recall by the score man of character and of no character some i know afterwards professionally and especially one who although convict of crime escape by collusion the sentence justly pass upon he another be a man of position without character whose evil habit destroy the talent that would have make he famous but i need not dwell on the manifold character and scene of crockford 's there have be nothing like it either in its origin or its subsequent history there will never be anything like it in a age of refinement and law which have be wisely pass for the protection of fool the founder of this fashionable gambling place be at one time a small fishmonger in either the strand or fleet street i forget which and live there till he remove to st jame 's street where he become a fisher of man but never in any other than a honorable way he palace of fortune be of the grandest style of architectural beauty it be one in which the worshipper of fortune plank down the last acre of they patrimonial estate to propitiate the fickle goddess in the allurement of the gaming-table but how _ can _ fortune herself give two to one on all comer some _ must _ lose to pay the winner at this palatial abode the most sumptuous repast be prepare by the most celebrated _ chef _ the world could produce and be eat by the most fastidious and expensive gourmand nature ever create gambler of the most distinguished and the most disreputable character gentleman of the latest pattern and the oldest school the worst of man and the best sport politician and political sportsman place-hunter minister ex-minister scion of old family and ancient pedigree as well as man of new family and no pedigree who purchase as we do now a coat of arm at the herald ' tailor shop and select they ancestor in wardor street only the wealthy could be member of this club for only the wealthy could lose money and pay it landscape painter might be guest but it be only the man who belong to the landscape who could belong to the body that gamble for it young barrister might visit the place possibly with a eye to business but only member of large practice or judge could be member of this society lord palmerston defend it manfully before the committee appoint really for its destruction he say it do a great deal of good -- much more good than all the gambling hell of london do harm whether he lordship contend that there be no bet carry on at crockford 's i be not prepare to say but when evidence be give before parliamentary committee it be sometimes difficult to understand its exact meaning palmerston however positively say without any doubt as to he meaning that candidate be not elect in order that they might be pluck of every feather they possess and that any one who maintain the contrary be slander one of the most respectable club in london some man would rather have pull down st paul 's than crockford 's it be the very perfection of a club say the statesman and its principal game be chicken hazard what could be stronger evidence than that of its usefulness and respectability at this game they usually lose all they have of little consequence to those who could not do better with they property and perhaps the best thing for the country because when it get into better hand it stand some chance of be apply to more legitimate purpose after a while crockford quarrel with he partner and they separate whatever man may say in these day against a institution which flourish in those ex-prime minister duke earl and ex-lord chancellor as well as future minister of state and future judge belong to it or seek eagerly for admission to its membership to be under the shadow of the fishmonger be greatness itself at the mention of the name of crockford 's a procession of the greatest man of the day pass before my eye they name would be legion as to number but a army of devoted patriot i should call they in every other sense for they be english to the backbone whether gambler or saint of course there be some amongst they as in every large body of man who be not so desirable to know as you could wish but they be easy to avoid and at all time a interesting study there be wise man and self-deluded fool manly well-bred man and effeminate conceited coxcomb who wear stay and do up they back hair use paint and daub they cheek with violet powder these man while they have it plank down they money with the longest possible odds against they there be one who be the very opposite to these in the person of old squire osbaldistone true he have squander more money than any one have ever see outside the bank of england but he have do it like a gentleman and not like a fool a real grand man be the old squire and i enjoy many a walk with he over newmarket heath listen to he amusing anecdote he delightful humor and brilliant wit he manner be so buoyant that no one could have believe he have spend hundred of thousand of pound but he have without compunction or regret the novelist and the painter could artistically describe squire osbaldistone i can only say he be a fine old english gentleman one of the olden time it be in a billiard-room at leamington where i first meet he and as he be as indifferent a player as you could meet he think himself one of the best that ever handle a cue i neither play chicken hazard nor any other game but enjoy myself in see other play and in pick up crumb of knowledge which i make good use of in my profession the institution be not establish for the benefit of science or literature except that kind of literature which go by the name of bookmake its founder be a veritable dunce but he be the cleverest of bookmaker and make more by it in one night than all the author of that day in they life one hundred thousand pound in one night be not bad evidence of he calculation of chance and he general knowledge of mankind to be a member of this club wealth be not the only qualification because in time you would lose it you have to be well bear or distinguish in some other way the fishmonger know a good salmon by its appearance he have also a keen respect for the man who have ancestor and ancestral estate i ought not to omit to mention another celebrated bookie of that day he be second only to crockford himself and be call the librarian he be also know as billy sim billy live in st jame 's street in a house which have long since be demolish and thither people resort to enjoy the idle witty and often scandalous gossip of the time it be as easy to lose you reputation there as you money at crockford 's and far more difficult to keep it the only really innocent conversation be when a man talk about himself from that popular gossip establishment i hear a little story tell by the son of sydney smith he father have be send for to see a old lady who be one of he most troublesome parishioner she be die sad to say she have always be querulous and quarrelsome it may have be constitutional but whatever the cause she husband have have a uncomfortable time with she when sydney smith reach the house the old lady be dead and the bereaved widower a religious man in he way and acquaint with scripture say -- ah sir you be too late : my poor dear wife have go to _ abraham 's bosom _ poor abraham exclaim sydney she 'll tear he inside out as all these thing pass through my memory i recall another little incident with much satisfaction because i be retain in the case it be a scandalous fraud in connection with the gaming-table a action be bring by a cheat against a gentleman who be say to have lose # 20000 on the cast of the dice i be the counsel oppose to plaintiff who be say to have cheat by means of _ loaded dice _ i win the case and it be generally believe that the action be the cause of the appointment of the gaming committee at which tribunal all the rascality of the gaming-table be call to give evidence and the witness do so in such a manner as to shock the conscience of the civilized world which be never conscious of anything until exposure take place in a court of law or in some other legal inquiry diabolical revelation be bring to light however as i have say lord palmerston effectually clear crockford 's and it almost seem from the evidence of those who know crockford 's best that they never play anything there but old-fashioned whist for threepenny point patience and beggar-my-neighbour he royal highness the then prince of wale come into court during the trial i refer to and seem interested in the proceedings i wonder if he majesty now remember it in those day baron martin and i meet once a year he on the bench and i in court with a hansom cab wait outside ready to start for the derby it be necessary for judge to sit on derby day to show that they do not go but if by some accident the work of the court be finish in time to get down to epsom those who love a afternoon in the country sometimes go in the direction of the downs there be usually a run on the list on that day there be another club to which i belong in those old day call the hook and eye where i meet for the last time poor dougla jerrold he be one of the eye and always on the lookout for a good thing or the opportunity of say one he be certainly in my opinion the wittiest man of he day but at time he wit be more hurtful than amusing wit should never leave a sting he be sometimes hard on those who be the object of he personal dislike of these sir charle taylor be one he be not a welcome member of the hook and eye and jerrold know it there be really no reason why sir charle should not have be like except perhaps that he be dull and prosaic rather simple than dull perhaps for he be always ready to laugh with the rest of we whether he understand the joke or not and what could the most brilliant do beyond that sir charle be fond of music he mention in jerrold 's company on one occasion that ` the last rose of summer ' so affect he that it quite carry he away can any one hum it ask jerrold chapter xxiii alderson tomkin and a free country -- a problem in human nature alderson be a very excellent man and a good judge i like he and could always deal with he on a level footing he be quaint and original and never lead away by a false philanthropy or a sickly sentimentalism appeal to on behalf of a man who have a wife and large family and have be convict of rob he neighbor true say alderson -- very true it be a free country nothing can be more proper than that a man should have a wife and a large family it be he due -- as many child as circumstance will permit but tomkin you have no right even in a free country to steal you neighbor 's property to support they i like he where there be a weak case on the other side he be particularly good on those occasion in the assize court at chelmsford a barrister who have a great criminal practice be retain to defend a man for steal sheep a very serious offence in those day -- one where anything less than transportation would be consider excessive leniency the principal evidence against the man be that the bone of the deceased animal be find in he garden which be urge by the prosecute counsel as somewhat strong proof of guilt but not conclusive it must have strike everybody who have watch criminal proceedings that the person a prisoner have most to fear when he be try be too often he own counsel who may not be qualify by nature 's certificate of capacity to defend however be that as it may in this case there be no evidence against the prisoner unless he counsel make it so counsel for the defense in those day be a wrong description -- he be call the _ friend _ of the prisoner and i should conclude from what i have see of this relationship that the adage save I from my friend originate in this connection the friend of this prisoner instead of insist that there be no evidence since no one could swear to the sheep bone when no man have ever see they endeavor to explain away the cause of death and thus by a foolish concession admit they actual identity it be not alderson 's duty to defend the prisoner against he own admission although but for that he would have point out to the crown how absolutely illogical they proposition be in law but the friend of the prisoner suggest that sheep often put they head through gap or breakage in the hurdle and rub they neck against the project point of the broken bar and that be so why should the jury not come to a verdict in favor of the prisoner on that ground it be quite possible that the constant rubbing would ultimately cut the sheep 's throat if it do not the prisoner submit to the same operation at the hand of he friend yes say baron alderson that be a very plausible suggestion to start with but have commence you line of defense on that ground you must continue it and carry it to the finish and to do this you must show that not only do this sheep in a moment of temporary insanity -- as i suppose you would allege in order to screen it -- commit suicide but that it skin itself and then bury its body or what be leave of it after give a portion to the prisoner to eat in the prisoner 's garden and cover itself up in its own grave you must go as far as that to make a complete defense of it i do not say the jury may not believe you we shall see gentleman what do you say -- be the sheep or the prisoner guilty the sheep be instantly acquit there be another display of forensic ingenuity by the same counsel in the next case where he be once again the friend of the prisoner a man be charge with steal a number of gold and silver coin which have be bury a few hour previously under the foundation-stone of a new public edifice the prisoner be one of the workman and have see they deposit for the historical curiosity of future age antiquity of course would be the essence of the value of the coin except to the thief the royal hand have cover they with the stone duly tap by the silver trowel amidst the hurrah of the loyal populace in which the prisoner heartily join but in the night he steal forth and then steal the coin they be find at he cottage secrete in a very private locality as though he conscience smite he or he fear seek to prevent discovery he legal friend however drive from the mere outwork of fact have take refuge in the citadel of law he be equal to the occasion alas alderson know the way into this impregnable retreat counsel suggest that it be never intend by those who place the coin where they be find that they should remain there till the end of time they be intend say he to be take away by somebody but by whom be not indicate by the depositor and as no time or person be mention they must belong to the first finder it be all a mere chance as to the time of they resurrection further it be certain they be not intend to be take by they owner who have place they there -- they never expect to see they again -- but by any one who happen to come upon they those who deposit they where they be find part not only with the possession but with all claim of ownership nor could any one represent he make any claim all this be excellent reasoning as far as it go and the only thing the prosecution allege by way of answer be that they be intend to be bring to light as antiquity very well say the prisoner 's counsel then there be no felonious intent in that case -- it be merely a mistake antiquity come too soon and so do the conviction i be instruct with the hon george denman son of my old friend whom i have so often mention to defend three person at the maidstone assize for a cruel murder mr justice wightman be the judge and there be not a better judge of evidence than he or of law either the prisoner be father mother and son and the decease be a poor servant girl who have be engage to be marry to another son of the male prisoner and he wife the unfortunate girl have leave she service at gravesend and go to this family on a visit the prisoner there could be no doubt be open to the gravest suspicion but how far each be concern with the actual murder be uncertain and possibly could never be prove the night before the trial the attorney who act for the accuse person call on I and ask this extraordinary question -- could you secure the acquittal of the father and the son if the woman will plead guilty it be impossible to conceive the amount of resolution and self-sacrifice involve in this attempt to save the life of she husband and son it be too startling a proposal to listen to i could advise no client to plead guilty to wilful murder it be so extraordinary a proposition look at it from whatever point i might that it be perfectly impossible to advise such a course i ask he if the woman know what she be do and that if she plead guilty certain death would follow oh yes say he she be quite prepare the murder i say be one of the worst that can be conceive -- cruel and fiendish he agree but persist that she be perfectly willing to sacrifice she own life if she husband and son could be save this woman so full of feel for she own family have think so little of that of other that she have hold down the poor servant girl in bed while she son strangle she if say i she be to plead guilty the great probability be that the jury would believe they be all guilty -- very probably they be and most certainly in that case they would all be hang i therefore strongly advise that the woman should stand she trial with the other which she do in the end they all _ get off _ the evidence not be sufficiently clear against any it be a strange mingling of evil and good in one breast -- of diabolical cruelty and noble self-sacrifice i leave other to work out this problem of human nature chapter xxiv charle mathew -- a harvest festival at the village church the sport world have no greater claim on my memory than the theatrical or the artistic i recall they with a vividness that bring back all the enjoyment of long and sincere friendship for instance one evening i be in charle mathew 's dressing-room at the theater and enjoy a little chat when he be call come along say he come along why he should call I to come along i never know i have no part in the piece at that moment but he soon give I one i follow with linger step and slow have no knowledge of the construction of the premise but in a moment mathew have disappear and i find myself in the middle of the stage with a crowded house in front of I the whole audience burst into a uproar of laughter i suppose it be the incompatibility of my appearance at that juncture which make I take so well but it bring down the house and if the curtain have fall at that moment i should have be a great success and mathew would have be out of it in the midst of my discomfiture however he come on to the stage by another entrance as cool as a cucumber he tell I afterwards that he have turn the incident to good account by refer to I as every man in he humor or a bailiff in distressing circumstance i be visit the country house of a respectable old solicitor who be instruct I in a compensation case which be to be hear at wakefield i do not know mr hawkin say he on Sunday morning whether you would like to see we little church no thank you i answer we can have a look at it to-morrow when we have a ` view of the premise ' i think perhaps say mr goodman you might like to attend the service no say i not particularly a walk under the ` broad canopy ' be preferable on a beautiful morning like this to a poky little pew and i like the singing of the bird better than the humming of a clergyman 's nose very well he say we will if you like take a little walk with surprising innocence he inflict upon I a pious fraud lead I over field and meadow stile and rustic bridge until at last the cunning old fox bring I out along a by-path and over a plank bridge right into the village then turn a corner near a picturesque farmhouse he smilingly observe this be we church it be a very old one and look much more picturesque in the distance shall we have a view a little farther off st mary 's say he 1694 be the date -- st mary 's say i fancy and what be the date -- 1694 it have some fine tablet mr hawkin if you would like to look in -- i do not care for tablet i answer if i go to church it be not to stare at tablet at last my host sum up courage to say -- mr hawkin this be we little harvest festival of thanksgiving and i should not like to be absent why on earth mr goodman i answer do you not say that before let we go in by all means i like a good harvest as well as any christian on earth the pew be the family pew -- the _ whole family pew _ and nothing but the family pew buy with the estate with the family estate and be in a excellent situation for the congregation to have a fine view of mr goodman indeed he cheery face could be see by everybody in church i must say the little edifice look very nice and have be adorn with the most artistic taste by the young lady of the vicarage and the hall mr goodman be the hall there be bunch of neatly-arranged turnip and carrot with potato barley oats and mangel-wurzel and almost every variety of fruit from the little village and every girl have barley and wheat-ear in she straw hat it be a affect sight calculate to make any one adore the young lady and long for dinner the sermon be a excellent one so far as i could pronounce a opinion but would have be considerably improve have it be three-quarter of a hour shorter it contain however the usual allusion to harvest-home gather into barn and lay up treasure which last observation remind mr goodman that he have _ leave he purse at home _ and have come away without any money i see he fumble in he pocket now think i the time have come for show my devotion to mr goodman as soon therefore as he have whisper to I i hand he all i have which consist of a five-pound note he gratefully take it and although about five time as much as _ he _ intend to give when the bag be hand to he in go the five-pound note i know my friend be chuckle as soon as we get into he family pew at the way in which he have lure I step by step till we walk the last plank over the ditch so i be not sorry to return good for evil and lend he my note he stare somewhat sideways at I when the bag pass but i bear it with fortitude i take particular notice that the crimson bag pass along the front of we family pew at a very dilatory pace and tarry a good deal as if reluctant to leave it to and fro it pass in front of my nose as if it contain something i should like to smell and at last move away altogether i be glad of that because it prevent my follow the word of the hymn in my book and unfortunately it be one of those harvest hymn i do not know by heart on we way home over the meadow where the grasshopper be practise for the next day 's sport and be in high glee over this harvest festival mr goodman seem fidgety whether conscience-stricken for the sabbath fraud he have practice upon I or not i could not say but at last he ask how i like they little service i say it be quite large enough you -- he pause -- you do not i think -- another pause -- contribute to we little gathering no i say but it be not my fault i lend you all i have the fund however will not suffer in the least and you have the satisfaction of have contribute the whole of we joint pocket-money it do not matter who the giver be so long as the fund obtain it i then divert he mind with a story or two cockburn i say be sit next to thesiger during a trial before campbell chief justice in which the judge read some french document and be a scotsman it attract a good deal of attention cockburn who be a good french scholar be much annoyed at the chief justice 's pronunciation of the french language he be murder it say he -- _ murder _ it no my dear cockburn answer thesiger he be not kill it only scotch it sir alexander be at a little shooting-party with bethell and he son one of whom shoot the gamekeeper the father accuse the son of the misadventure while the son return the compliment cockburn after some little time ask the gamekeeper what be the real truth of the unfortunate incident -- who be the gentleman who have inflict the injury the gamekeeper still smart from he wound and forget the respect due to the questioner answer -- o sir alexander -- d -- n 'em it be _ both _ a remark make by lord young the scotch judge one of the wittiest man who ever adorn the bar and who be a bencher of the middle temple strike I as particularly happy there be a conversation about the admission of solicitor to the roll and the long time it take before they be eligible to pass from they stage of pupilage to that of solicitor amounting i think to seven year upon which lord young say _ nemo repente fuit turpissimus _ chapter xxv compensation -- nice calculation in old day -- expert -- lloyd and i as my business continue to increase it take I more and more from the ordinary _ nisus prius _ and keep I perpetually employ in special matter i have a great many compensation case where house land and business have be take for public or company purpose they be interesting and by no means difficult the great difficulty be to get the true value when you have as i have know a hundred thousand pound ask on one side and ten thousand offer on the other railway company be especially plunder in the exorbitant valuation of land and therefore a advocate who could check the valuer by cross-examination be seek after jury be always liable to be impose upon and generally give liberal compensation altogether apart from the market value expert such as land agent and surveyor be always in request and indeed these expert in value cause the most extravagant amount to be award even the mean sum between highest and lowest be a monstrously unfair guide for one old expert use to instruct he pupil that the only true principle in estimate value be to ask at least twice as much as the business or other property be worth because he say the other side will be sure to try and cut you down one-half and then probably offer to split the difference if you accept that you will of course get one-quarter more than you could by state what you really want no one could deal with the real value because there be no such thing know in the compensation court on one occasion i be travel north in connection with one of these case retain as usual on behalf of a railway company in my judgment the claim would have be handsomely meet by a award of # 10000 and that sum we be prepare to give on my way i observe in my carriage a gentleman who be very busy in make calculation on slip of paper and every now and again mention the figure at which he have arrive -- repeat they to himself when we get to a station he throw away he paper after tear it up and when we start commence again but at every stoppage on we journey he increase he amount after we have travel 250 mile the property he be value have attain the handsome figure of # 100000 he evidently have not observe I i be very quiet and well wrap up the next day when he step into the witness-box he have not the least idea that i have be he fellow-traveller of the previous night he be not very sharp except in the matter of figure but he opinion like that of all expert be invincible he name be bunce when do you view this property mr bunce i understand you come from london i see it this morning sir do you make any calculation as to its value _ before _ you see it this puzzle he and he stare at I it be a hard stare but i hold out he say no not when you be travel do it not pass through you mind when you be in the train for instance -- ' i wonder now what that property be worth ' i dare say it do sir but do not _ dare say _ anything unless it be true i do then run it over in my mind and i dare say you make note and can produce they do you make note after a while i say i see you do you may as well let I have they i tear they up why what become of the piece i throw they away do you remember what price you have arrive at when you reach peterborough for instance the expert think i be some one whom we never mention except when in a bad temper and he be more and more puzzle when he find that at every stoppage i know how much he price have increase as the case be try by a arbitrator and not a jury my task be easy arbitrator not be so likely to be befool as the other form of tribunal this arbitrator especially know the elasticity of a expert 's opinion and therefore i be not alarm for my client the amount be soon arrive at by reduce the sum claim by no less than # 90000 thus vanish the visionary claim and the expert he evidently have not be train by the cunning old surveyor whose experience teach he to be moderate and ask only twice as much as you ought to get in another claim which be no less than # 10000 the jury give # 300 this be a state of thing that have to be stop and it could only be accomplish at that time by counsel who appear on behalf of the company sir henry hunt be one of the best of arbitrator and it be difficult to deceive he it take a clever expert to convince he that a piece of land whose actual value would be # 100 be worth # 20000 sir henry once pay I a compliment -- of course i be not present hawkin say he be the very best advocate of the day and strange to say he initial be the same as mine you may turn they upside down and they will still stand on they leg -lrb- hh -rrb- sir henry be sometimes a witness and as such always dangerous to the side against whom he be call because he be a judge of value and a man of honor one instance in which i take a somewhat novel course in demolish a fictitious claim be perhaps worth while to relate although so many year have pass since it occur it be so far back as the time of the old hungerford market which the railway company be take for they present charing cross terminus the question be as to the value of a business for the sale of medical appliance mr lloyd as usual be for the business while i appear for the company my excellent friend proceed on the good old line of compensation advocacy with the same comfortable routine that one play the old family rubber of threepenny point i occasionally finesse however and put my opponent off he play he hold good hand but if i have a occasionally bad one i sometimes manage to save the odd trick lloyd have expatiate on the value of the situation the highroad between waterloo station and the strand immense traffic and grand frontage to prove all this he call a multitude of witness who kiss the same book and swear the same thing almost in the same word but to he great surprise i do not cross-examine lloyd be bewildered and say i have admit the value by not cross-examine and he should not call any more witness i then address the jury and say a multitude of witness may prove anything they like but my friend have start with a entirely erroneous view of the situation the compensation for disturbance of a business must depend a great deal on the nature of the business if you can carry it on elsewhere with the same facility and profit the compensation you be entitle to be very little i will illustrate my meaning let we suppose that in this thoroughfare there be a good public-house -- for such a business it would indeed be a excellent situation you may easily imagine a couple of burly farmer come up from farnham or windlesham to the cattle show and walk over the bridge hot and thirsty ` hallo ' say one ' i say jim here be a nice public what d'ye say to goin ' in and havin ' a glass o ' bitter it be a goodish pull over this ` ere bridge ` with all my heart ' say jim and in they go there you see the advantage of be on the highroad but now let we see these two stalwart farmer come along and -- instead of the handsome public and the bitter ale there be this shop where they sell medical arrangement -- can you imagine one of they say to the other ' i say jim here be a very nice medical shop what d'ye say to go in and have a truss ' the argument considerably reduce the compensation but what it lack in money the claimant get in laughter sometimes i lead a witness who be a expert valuer for a claimant to such a gross exaggeration of the value of a business as to stamp the claim with fraud and so destroy he evidence altogether sir henry hunt use to nod with apparent approval at every piece of evidence which show any kind of exaggeration but every nod be worth as a rule a handsome reduction to the other side i shall never forget a attorney 's face who have be offer # 10000 for a property stand out for # 13000 it be a claim by a poulterer ' company for eight house that be take by a railway company i rely entirely on my speech as i often do because the threadbare cross-examination be almost by this time thing of course as be the figure themselves mere result of true calculation on false basis this attorney who have perhaps never have a compensation case before be quite a great man and take the arbitrator 's assent nod as so much cash down so encouraged indeed be he that he become almost impudent to I and give I no little annoyance by he impertinent aside at last i look at he good-humouredly and politely request he as though he be the court itself to suspend he judgment while i have the honor of address the arbitrator for twenty minute at the end of which time i promise to make you sir say i the most miserable man in existence i be support in this appeal by the arbitrator who hope he would not interrupt mr hawkin as i proceed the attorney fidget puff out he cheek blow out he breath twirl he thumb as i twirl he figure and grate he tooth as he look at I sideways while i conclude a little peroration i have get up for he which be merely to this effect that if railway company yield to such extortionate demand as be make by this attorney on behalf of the poulterer ' company they would not leave they shareholder a feather to fly with the attorney look very much like moult himself and the end of it be that he get _ two thousand pound _ less than we have offer he in the morning and consequently have to pay all the cost as i have state john horatio lloyd be my principal opponent in these great public work case and i remember he with every feeling of respect he be a advocate whom no opponent could treat lightly and be uniformly kind and agreeable of course i have a very large experience in those time -- i suppose without vanity i may say the very largest i be retain to assess compensation for the immense block of building acquire for the space now occupy by the law court in the very early case the law officer of the crown be concerned but after that the whole of the business be entrust to my care although for reason best know to themselves the commissioner decline to send I a general retainer which would have be one small sum for the whole but give instead a special retainer on every case if my memory serve I on one occasion i have ninety-four of these special retainer deliver at my chamber this be in consequence of they refuse to retain I generally for the whole which would have be a nominal fee of five guinea chapter xxvi election petition another class of work which give I much pleasure and interest be that of election petition these come in such abundance that i have to put on as i think a prohibitory fee which in reality increase the volume of my labor one day baron martin ask I if i be come to such and such a election petition no i answer no i have put a prohibitory fee on my service i can not be bother with election petition how much have you put on five hundred guinea and two hundred a day the baron laugh heartily a prohibitory fee they must have you hawkin -- they must have you put on what you like make it high enough and they 'll have you all the more and i do it turn out a very lucrative branch of my business and my electioneering expense be a good investment my experience at barnstaple to be tell hereafter repay the outlay and no feature of a election ever come before I but i recognize a family likeness amongst the earliest be that of wh smith who have be return for westminster the petitioner endeavor to unseat he on the ground of bribery allege to have be commit in pay large sum of money for exhibit placard on behalf of the candidate it be try before baron martin about the payment there be no element of extravagance but there be undoubtedly many case of payment and these be allege to be illegal ballantine be my junior one of the curious matter in the case be that these payment have be principally make by or under the advice of my old friend whom i can not mention too often the hon robert grimston ballantine as i think most injudiciously advise I not to call that old fool but believe in grimston and have charge of the case i resolve to call he baron martin know grimston as well as i do and believe in he as much who be this ask the judge another bill-sticker my lord grimston give he evidence and be severely cross-examine by my friend j fitzjame stephen he fully and satisfactorily explain every one of the question item evidently to the satisfaction of martin who dismiss the petition and thus mr smith retain he seat the learn judge say in give judgment that without grimston 's evidence the seat would have be in great danger but that he have put a innocent color on the whole case and that know he to be a honorable man and incapable of say anything but the truth he have implicitly trust to every word he speak mr smith whom i meet some day after say he be perfectly assure that if i have not have the conduct of the case and grimston have not be call he seat would have be lose in the petition against sir george elliot for durham there be nothing of any importance in the case except that sir george give a very interesting history of he life he have be a poor boy who have work in the cutting of the pit lie on he back and pick out from the roof overhead the coal which be shovel into the truck from this humble position literally and socially he have proceed first to he foot and then step by step until from one grade to another he have amass a large fortune and sufficient income to enable he to incur not only the expense of a election and a seat in parliament but also those of a bitterly hostile election petition enormously extravagant in every way i succeed in win he case and never be more proud of a victory it have last many day there be one matter almost of a historical character which i mention in order to do all the justice in my power to a man who although deserving of reprobation be also entitle to admiration for the chivalry of he true nature i speak of it with some hesitation and therefore without the name those who be interested in he memory will know to whom i allude and possibly be grateful for the tribute to he character however much it may have be sully by he temporary absence of manly discretion he be charge with assault a young lady in a railway train between aldershot and waterloo there be much of the melodramatic in the incident and much of the righteous indignation of the public before trial there be judgment and condemnation in every virtuous mind the assault allege be doubtless of a most serious character if prove i say nothing of what might have be prove or not prove but speak as a advocate i will not hesitate to affirm that cross-examination may sometimes save one person 's character without in the least affect that of another but this be not to be whatever line of defense my experience might have suggest i be debar by he express command from put a single question i say to he honor that as a gentleman and a british officer he prefer to take to himself the ruin of he own character the forfeiture of he commission in the army the loss of social status and _ all _ that could make life worth have to cast even a doubt on the lady 's veracity in the witness-box my instruction cripple I but i obeyed my client of course implicitly in the letter and the spirit even though to some extent he may have entail upon himself more ignominy and greater severity of punishment than i feel he deserve he die in egypt never have be reinstate in the british army i know but little of he until this catastrophe occur but the manliness of he defense show he to be naturally a man of honor who have be guilty of serious misconduct do all he could to amend the wrong he have do and so he win my sympathy in he sad misfortune and misery in the day when burglary be punish with death there be very seldom any remission i be in court one day at guildford when a respectably-dressed man in a velveteen suit of a yellowy green color and pearl button come up to I he look like one of lord onslow 's gamekeeper i know nothing of he but seem to recognize he feature as those of one i have see before when he come in front of my seat he grin with immense satisfaction and say -- can i get you anything mr orkin i could not understand the man 's meaning no thank you i say what do you mean do not you recollect sir you defend I at kingston for a burglary charge and get I off mr orkin in flyin ' color i recollected he seem to have the fly color on he lip very well i say i hope you will never want defend again no sir never that be right would a _ teapot _ be of any use to you mr orkin a teapot yes sir or a few silver spoon -- anything you like to name mr orkin i begged he to leave the court mr orkin i will but i be grateful for you gettin ' I off that job and if a piece o ' plate will be any good i 'll guarantee it be good old family stuff as 'll fetch you a lot o ' money some day i again tell he to go and disappoint at my not accept thing of greater value he say -- sir will a sack o ' tater be of any service to you this sort of gratitude be not uncommon in those day i tell the story to mr justice wightman and he say -- oh that be nothing to what happen to the common serjeant of london he have send to he once a christmas hamper contain a hare a brace and a half of pheasant three duck and a couple of fowl which _ he accept _ i sometimes win a jury over by a little good-natured banter and often annoyed chief justice campbell when i wake he up with laughter and yet he like I for although often annoyed he be never really angry he use to crouch he head down over he two forearm and go to sleep or pretend to by way of show it do not matter what i say to the jury i dare say it be disrespectful but i could not help on these occasion quietly point across my shoulder at he with my thumb and that be enough the jury roar and campbell look up -- what be the joke mr hawkin nothing my lord i be only say i be quite sure you lordship would tell the jury exactly what i be say go on mr hawkin -- then he turn to he clerk and say -- i shall catch he one of these day confine yourself to the issue mr hawkin if you lordship please say i and go on the eccentricity of judge would form a laughable chapter some of they be overwhelm with the importance of they position none be ever modest enough to perceive they own small individuality amidst they judicial environment and this think remind I of a occurrence at liverpool assizes when huddlestone and manisty the two judge on circuit dine as usual with the lord mayor the queen 's health be propose of course and manisty with he innate good breeding stand up to drink it whereupon he August brother judge pull he violently by he sleeve say sit down manisty you damned fool _ we _ be the queen i be address a jury for the plaintiff in a breach of promise case and as the defendant have not appear in the witness-box i inadvertently call attention to a elderly well-dressed gentleman in blue frock-coat and brass button -- a man apparently of good position the jury look at he and then at one another as i say how shameful it be for a gentleman to brazen it out in the way the defendant do -- ashamed to go into the witness-box but not ashamed to sit in court here the gentleman rise in a great rage amidst the laughter of the audience in which even the usher and javelin-men join to say nothing of the judge himself and shout with angry vociferation -- mr hawkin i be _ not _ the defendant in this case sir -- i be very sorry for you i reply but no one say you be there be another outburst and the poor gentleman gesticulate if possible more vehemently than before i be not the def -- nobody would have suppose you be sir if you have not take so much trouble to deny it the jury however will now judge of it i be a married man sir so much the worse say i chapter xxvii my candidature for barnstaple although the house of common dislike lawyer constituency love they the enterprising patriot of the long robe be everywhere seek after provide they possess with all they other qualification the one thing needful and possess which all other may be dispense with barnstaple be no exception to the rule it have a character for conspicuous discernment and like the unseen eagle in the sky could pick out at any distance the object of its desire eminent respectable and rich must be the qualification of any candidate who seek its suffrage -- the last at all event be indispensable up to this time i have not feel those patriotic yearning which be manifest so early in the legal heart i be never a political adventurer i have no eye on parliament merely as a stepping-stone to a judgeship and probably but for the event i be about to describe i should never have be hear of as a politician at all there be so many candidate in the profession to whom time be no object that i leave this political hunting-ground entirely to they in 1865 i be wait upon at westminster by a very influential deputation from the barnstaple elector -- honest-looking elector as any candidate could wish to see -- bring with they a requisition sign by almost innumerable independent elector and state that there be a great many more of the same respectable class who would have sign have time be permit further signature be however to be forward it be urge by the deputation that i should make my appearance at barnstaple at the earliest possible date as no time be to be lose and they be most anxious to hear my view especially upon topic that they know more about than i which be generally the case i be tell in most constituency i ask when they think i ought to put in a appearance within a week at latest say the lead spirit of the deputation within a week at latest repeat all the deputation in chorus because say the lead personage there be already a gentleman of the name of cave -lrb- it should have be pronounce as two syllable so as to afford I some sort of warning of the danger i be confront -rrb- busily canvass in all direction for the liberal party and mr howell gwynne and sir george stukely will be the conservative candidate however it would be a certain seat if i would do they the honor of come forward there would be little trouble and it would almost be a walk-over a walk-over be very nice and the tantalizing hope this deputation inspire I with overcome my great reluctance to enter the field of politics and in that ill-advised moment i promise to allow myself to be nominate it be arrange that i should make my appearance by a specify afternoon train on a particular day in the week -lrb- apparently to be set apart as a public holiday -rrb- so that i have little time for preparation by the next day 's post i receive a kind of official communication from we committee state that a very substantial deputation from the general body would have the honor to meet I at the station and accompany I to the committee-room for the purpose of introduction down therefore i go by the great western line and in due time arrive at my destination as i think i find instead of the influential body of gentleman who be to have the honor of conduct I to the headquarters of the liberal party there be only a small portion of it almost too insignificant to admit of counting but he be a important personage in uniform and dress somewhat like a commissionaire after much salutation and deferential hemming and stammer he say i have better proceed to a _ little station only a few mile farther on and dine _ and if so be i would do that they would meet I in the evening not be a professional politician nor greatly ambitious of its honor i be somewhat disconcerted at such extraordinary conduct on the part of my committee and would have return to town but that the train be go the wrong way and by the time i reach the little station i have argue the matter out as i think it _ might _ be a measure of precaution in a constituency so respectable as barnstaple to prevent the least suspicion of _ treat _ or corrupt influence have i dine at barnstaple it might have be suggest that some one dine with I or drink my health whatever it be the revelation be not yet i be to return as soon as i have dine everything be to be ready for my reception all these instruction i obey with the greatest loyalty and return at a early hour in the evening but if i be disappoint at my first reception how be i elate by the second all be make up for by good feeling and enthusiasm we be evidently all brother fight for the sacred cause but what the cause be i have not be inform up to this time at the station be a local band of music wait to receive I and to strike up the inspiring air see the conquer hero come but unfortunately the band consist only of a drum of such dimension that i think it must have be build for the occasion and a clarionet before the band strike up however i be greet with such enthusiastic outburst that they might have bring tear into the eye of any one less firm than myself orkin for ever roar the multitude it almost stun I never could i have dream my popularity would be so great orkin for ever again and again they repeat each volley if possible louder than before bravo orkin let 'em ` ave it orkin do not spare 'em i wish i have know what this mean i must say they do all that mortal could do with they mouth to honor they future member hogarth 's march to finchley be outdo by that march to the barnstaple town hall a enormous body of elector free and independent stamped on they face as well as they hand be gather there and it be a long time before we could get anywhere near the door again and again the air be rent with the cry for orkin and it be perfectly useless for the police to attempt to clear the way they have I as if on show and it be only by the most wonderful perseverance and good luck that i find myself go head first along the corridor lead to the hall itself when i appear on the platform it seem as if barnstaple have never see such a man they be mad with joy and all want to shake hand with I at once i dodge a good many and by dint of wave he arm like a semaphore the chairman succeed not in restore peace but in moderate the noise i now have a opportunity of use my eye and there before I in one of the front seat be the redoubtable cave -- the great canvassing cave -- who instantly rise and give I the most cordial welcome trust i be to be he future colleague in the house and be most generous in he expression of admiration for the people of barnstaple especially the vote portion of they and hope i should have a very pleasant time and never forget dear old barnstaple i say i be not likely to -- nor be i of course i have to address the assemble elector first after the introduction by the chairman who take a long time to inform we what the elector _ wanted _ i make up my mind what to say in order to convince they that they should have it i give they hope of a great deal of legal reform and reduction of punishment for i think that would suit most of they best and then gladly assent to a satisfactory adjustment of all local requirement and improvement as well as a determine redress of grievance which should on no account be longer delay -lrb- orkin for ever -rrb- then cave stand up -- a impose man with a good deal of presence and shirt-collar -- who invite any man -- indeed _ challenge _ anybody -- in that hall to question he on any subject whatever the challenge be accept and up stand one of the rank and file of the elector -- no doubt send by the howell gwynne party -- and with a voice that show at least he mean to be hear say -- mr cave first and foremost of all i should like to know _ how you missus be to-day _ it be scarcely a political or public question but nobody object and everybody roar with laughter because it seem at all political meeting cave have start the fashion which have be adopt by many candidate since that time of refer _ to he wife _ cave always begin by say he could never go through this ordeal without the help and sympathy of he dear wife -- he support and joy -- at whose bidding and in pursuit of whose dream he have come forward to win a seat in they uncorruptible borough and to represent they -- the most coveted honor of he life -- in the house of common of course this oratory have a religious flavor take with a very large body of the barnstaple elector and be always receive with cheer as a encouragement to domestic felicity and faithfulness to connubial tie when this gentleman put the question cave answer as though it be ask in real earnest and be cheer to the echo not merely for he domestic felicity but he cool contempt for any man who could so far forget connubial bliss as to sneer at it for a few day all go tolerably well and then i be tell that a very different kind of influence prevail in the borough than that of religion or political morality and that it would be perfectly hopeless to expect to win the seat unless i be prepare to purchase the large majority of elector indeed that i must buy almost every voter -lrb- that be what they mean by give it 'em orkin let 'em ` ave it -rrb- this i refuse to believe but it be say they be such free and independent elector that they would vote for _ either _ party and you could not be sure of they until the last moment in fact _ if i would win i must bribe _ to say nothing of all sort of subscription to cricket club and blanket club as well as friendly society of all kind i decline to accept these warning and look upon it as some kind of political dodge get up by the other side i resolve to win by play the game and make up my mind to go to the poll on the political question which be agitate the public mind as i be inform by a simple honest candidature think that in political as in every other warfare honesty be the best policy on that noble maxim i enter into the contest believe in barnstaple and feeling confident i should represent it in parliament to indulge in bribery of any sort would i know be fatal to my own interest even if i have not be actuate by any higher motive i place myself therefore in the hand of my friend and principal agent mr kingston as well as the other agent of the party we do not long however remain true to ourselves there be a hitch somewhere which soon develop into a split and it be certain some of we must go to the wall i could not however understand the reason of it we profess the same politics the same cause the same battle-cry the same enemy but whatever it be we be so much divide that my chance of head the poll be diminish i have be cheer to the echo night after night and all day long so that there be enough shout to make a prime minister my horse have time after time be take from my carriage and cheer voter draw I along these unmistakable sign of popular devotion to my interest have be most encouraging and as they shout themselves hoarse for I i talk myself hoarse for they we have a mutual hoarseness for each other everything look like success everything _ sound _ like success and night after night out come drum and clarionet to do they duty manfully in drum I to my hotel it have be a remarkable success everybody say so most of they declare solemnly they have never see anything like it they pronounce it a record popularity i think it be because the good people have select I as they candidate on independent and purity of election principle this explanation give they great joy and they cheer with extra enthusiasm for they own virtue judge then my surprise a short while after when notwithstanding the firm principle upon which we have proceed and by which my popularity be secure i begin to perceive that _ money be the only thing they want _ they uncorruptible nature yield alas to the lower influence of that deity it be at first a little mysterious why they should have postpone they demand -- secret and silent -- until almost the last moment but the fact be a large section of my party be dissatisfy with the voluntary nature of they service they decline to work for nothing and have show I that the prize -- that be the seat -- be mine they determine to let I know it must be pay for a large number of my voter would do nothing they keep they hand in they pocket because they could not get they into mine this be no longer a secret but on the eve of the election be boldly put forward as a demand and i be plainly tell that # 500 distribute in small sum would make my election sure as however in no circumstance would i stoop to they offer this demand do not in the least influence I -- i never waver in my resolution and refuse to give a farthing furthermore show the web in which they seek to entangle I the same voice that suggest the # 500 also inform I that i be closely watch by a couple of detective set on by the other side i be well aware that the other side have give five-pound note for vote but i could neither follow the example nor use the information as it be tell I in the strictest confidence i be therefore powerless and feel we be drift asunder more and more at last come the polling day and a happy relief from a unpleasant situation it certainly be a fine bright morning usher in a exciting day there be a great inrush of voter at the polling-booth friendly vote if i may call they so -- vote i mean to say of honest supporter these be my acquaintance make during my sojourn at barnstaple other come a few for cave as well as myself cave do not seem to enjoy the popularity that i have achieve still he get a few vote now come a exciting scene about midday the work man 's dinner hour the tide begin to turn for the whole body of _ bribe _ voter be release from work my majority quickly dwindle and at length disappear until i be in a very hopeless minority everywhere it be stukely for ever some cry stukely and free beer stukely who till now have hardly be anybody and have not talk himself hoarse in they interest as i have be the great object of they admiration and they hope the consequence of this sudden development of stukely 's popularity be that cave unite he destiny with the new favorite and such a involution of party take place that stukely and cave join hand in hand and heart to heart while poor howell gwynne and myself be abandon as useless candidate at one o'clock it be clear that i must be defeat by a large majority the cave party then approach I with the modest request that as it be quite clear that i could not be return would i mind attend the polling place and give my support to cave this piece of unparalleled impudence i decline to accede to and do nothing the election be over so far as i be interested in its result but i be determine to have a parting word with the elector before leave the town i be mortify at the unblushing treachery and deception of my supporter i be next ask what i propose to do it be they object to get I out of the town as soon as possible for if unsuccessful as a candidate i might be troublesome in other way such people be not without a sense of fear if they have no feeling of shame i say i should do nothing but take a stroll by the river the day be fine and come back when the poll be declare and make they a little speech the little speech be exactly what they do not want so in the most friendly manner they inform I that a fast train would leave barnstaple at a certain time and that probably i would like to catch that as no doubt i wish to be in town as early as possible to attend to my numerous engagement if they have charter the train themselves they could not have show greater consideration for my interest but i inform they that i should stop and address the elector and with this statement they turn sulkily away at the appoint hour for the declaration of the poll i be on the hustings -- well up there although the lowest on the poll stukely and cave be first and second howell gwynne and myself third and _ last _ when my turn come to address the multitude i speak in no measure term as to the conduct of the election which i denounce as have be win by the most scandalous bribery and corruption all who be present as unbiassed spectator be sorry and many of they express a wish that i would return on a future day not say i until the place have be purge of the foul corruption with which it be taint i have resolve to leave by the mail train and be actually accompany to the station by a crowd of some 2000 people include the rector or vicar of the parish who give I godspeed on my journey home this kind and sincere expression of goodwill and sympathy be worth all the boisterous cheer with which i have be receive on the platform at the railway station i have to make another little speech and then i take my seat not for barnstaple but london as the train draw out of the station the people cling to the carriage like bee and although i have not even honeyed word to give they they give I a send-off with vociferous cheer and the most cordial good wish thus i bade good-bye to barnstaple never to return or be return and i can only say of that enlighten and independent constituency that while seek the interest of they country they never neglect they own i need not add that i learn a great deal in that election which be of the greatest importance in the conduct of the parliamentary petition which be shower upon I before i accept the candidature of barnstaple a friend of mine say he have be make inquiry as to how the little borough of totne could be win and that the lowest figure require as a instalment to commence with be # 7000 after this i have no more to do with electioneering in the sense of be a candidate but a good deal to do with it in every other chapter xxviii the tichborne case -lrb- the greatest of all chapter in the life of mr hawkin be the prosecution of the impostor arthur orton for perjury and yet the story of the tichborne case be one of the simplest and most romantic the heir to the tichborne baronetcy and estate be shipwreck while on board the _ bellum _ and drown in 1854 in 1865 a butcher at wagga wagga in australium assume the title and claim the estate but the story be not relate in these reminiscence on account of its romantic incident but as a incident in the life of lord brampton it be so great that there be nothing in the annals of we ordinary court of justice comparable with it either in its magnitude or its advocacy i speak particularly of the trial for perjury in which mr hawkin lead for the prosecution and not of the precede trial in which he be junior to sir john coleridge it be impossible to give more than the _ point _ of this strange story as they be make and the real _ fact _ as they be elicit in cross-examination and piece together in he open speech and he reply in the case for the crown what render the task the more difficult be that he predecessor have so bungle the cross-examination in many way that they not only have not elicit what they might have do but actually by many question furnish information to the claimant which enable he to carry on he imposture -rrb- the tichborne trial demand a few word by way of introduction for although there be two trial they be of a different character the first be a ordinary action of ejectment in which the claimant seek to dispossess the youthful heir whose title he have already assume under circumstance of the most extraordinary nature the action of ejectment be try before chief justice bovill at the common plea westminster ballantine and giffard -lrb- now lord halsbury -rrb- lead for the plaintiff the butcher while on behalf of the trustee of the estate -lrb- that be the real heir -rrb- be the solicitor-general coleridge myself bowen -lrb- afterwards lord bowen -rrb- and chapman barber a _ equity _ counsel i must explain how it be that i have be retain to lead coleridge be afterwards compel to be lead by he and it be a interesting event in the history of the bar as well as of the judicial bench the action be really a western circuit case although the venue be lay in london coleridge lead that circuit and be retain i belong to the home circuit and have no idea of be engage at all for that side i have be retain for the claimant but the solicitor with great kindness withdraw he retainer at my request i be bring into the case for the purpose of lead and no other but by the appointment of coleridge to the solicitor-generalship in 1868 i be displaced and coleridge ultimately lead he further elevation happen in this way : sir robert collier be attorney-general and it be desire to give he a high appointment which at that moment be vacant and could only be fill by a judge of the high court collier be not a judge and therefore be not eligible for the post the question be how to make he eligible the prime minister of the day be not to be baffle by a mere technicality and he could soon make the attorney-general a judge of the high court if that be a condition precedent there be immediately a vacancy on the bench collier be appoint to the judgeship and in three day have acquire all the experience that the act of parliament anticipate as necessary for the higher appointment in the privy council instead of lead therefore in the case before chief justice bovill i have to perform whatever duty coleridge assign to I my commanding position be go and it be no longer presumable that i should be entrust with the cross-examination of the plaintiff i be bind to obey order and cross-examine whomsoever i be allow to -lrb- the one thing mr hawkin be retain for be the cross-examination of the plaintiff lord chief justice cockburn say i would have give a thousand pound to cross-examine he it would have be a excellent investment of the tichborne family to have give hawkin ten thousand pound to do so for i be sure there would have be a end of the case as soon as he get to wapp coleridge acknowledge that the claimant cross-examine he instead of he cross-examine the claimant when that shrewd and cunning impostor be ask would you be surprise to hear this or that no say he i should be surprise at nothing after this long time and the trouble i have be through but now that you call my attention to it i remember it all perfectly well coleridge say : i be leader by a accident yes say hawkin a colliery accident -rrb- i have also be retain by the trustee of the doughty estate lady doughty be a aunt of sir roger tichborne and it be she daughter kate whom the heir desire to marry have the claimant succeed in the first case he would have bring a action against she also no copy of the proceedings have be supply to I and i be inform that at this preliminary cross-examination they would not require my assistance that they learn chancery barrister be merely go to cross-examine the claimant on he affidavit -- a matter of small consequence so it be in one way but of immeasurable importance in many other way but they say _ i might like to hear the cross-examination as a matter of curiosity _ i do the claimant have it all he own way i be powerless to lend any assistance but have i be instruct i be perfectly sure i could then and there have extinguish the case for the claimant at that time know absolutely nothing of the life and history of roger tichborne so the case proceed with cost pile on cost information pick up especially by means of interminable preliminary proceedings until the impostor be left master of the situation to the gratification of fool and the hope of fanatic i be however allow in the trial to cross-examine some witness amongst they be a man of the name of baigent the historian of the family who know more of the tichborne than they know of themselves the cross-examination of baigent which do more than anything to destroy the claimant 's case occupy ten day he be the real roger 's old friend and know he up to the time of he leave england never to return i draw from he the confession that he do not believe he be alive but that he have encourage the dowager lady tichborne to believe that the claimant be she son and that she garden be light night after night with chinese lantern in expectation of he come admission be also obtain that when he see the claimant at alresford station neither know the other although baigent have never alter in the least as he allege there be another witness allot to I and that be carter a old servant of roger whilst he be in the carabineer this man supply the plaintiff with information as to what occur in the regiment while roger belong to it but he only know what be know to the whole regiment he do _ not _ know private matter which take place at the officer ' mess and it be upon these that my cross-examination show the claimant to be a impostor i have he there as parry and i be sit one morning wait for the judge i remark on the subject of the counsel choose for the prosecution : suppose parry you and i have be solicitor and attorney-general in the circumstance what should we have do plunge the country into a bloody war before now i dare say say parry elevate he eyebrow and wig at the same time i confess when i undertake the responsibility of this great trial i be not aware of the immense labor and responsibility it would involve nor do i believe any one have the smallest notion of the magnitude of the task instead of the work diminish as we proceed it increase day by day and week by week one set of witness entail the calling of another set the case grow in difficulty and extent it seem absolutely endless and hopeless within a few week of the start a necessity arise for procure the testimony of a witness from australium a matter of month and the trial be a criminal one the defendant be entitle to have the case for the prosecution conclude within a reasonable time if we have no evidence it be to he advantage and we have no right to detain he for a year while we be try to obtain it however the australian evidence come in time number of witness have to be call who not only be not in we brief but be never dream of for instance there be the danish perjurer louie who swear he pick up the defendant at sea when the _ bellum _ go down instead of this man go away after he have give he evidence he remain until two gentleman from the city see he portrait in the stereoscopic company 's window in regent street identify he as a dishonest servant of theirs who be undergo a sentence of penal servitude at the time he swear he pick roger up he receive five year ' penal servitude for he evidence i have pledge myself to the task which extend over many month more than i ever anticipate at every sacrifice however i be bind to devote myself to the case and do so although i have to relinquish a very large portion of my professional income what make thing worse there be not only no effort make to curtail the business but advantage be take of every circumstance to prolong it the longer it be drag out the better chance there be of a acquittal have a juryman die after month of the trial have pass the government must have abandon the prosecution it would have be impossible to commence again this be the last hope of the defense -lrb- the trial before bovill end at last as it ought to have do month before in a verdict for the defendant and the order for the prosecution of the claimant for perjury it be this prosecution that occupy the attention of the court and of the world for 188 day extend over portion of two year there be no doubt that coleridge would a second time have deprive the country of mr hawkin 's service but higher influence than he prevail and the distinguished counsel be appoint to lead for the crown with mr serjeant parry as he lead junior it be not too much to say that no one know the case so well as mr hawkin and none could have do it so well bowen and mathew be also he junior the whole case from the commencement of the chancery proceedings down to the commencement of this trial have be a comedy of blunder the very claim be a absurdity every step in the great fraud be a absurdity and every proceeding have some ridiculous absurdity to accompany it it be not until the cross-examination of baigent by mr hawkin that the undoubted truth begin to appear you be the first say baron bramwell who have let daylight into the case it will be see presently what the simple story be which the learn counsel at last evolve from the lie and half-truth which have for so many year impose upon a great number even of the intelligent and educate class of the community and i would observe that until nearly the end of the trial the case be never safe or quite free from doubt it be only what be elicit by mr hawkin that make it so no wonder the advocate say to giffard who be oppose to he on the first trial : if you and i have be together in that case in the first instance we should have win it for the claimant be on the other side this be how the case stand when he have complete it : -- the real heir to the family be a fairly well-formed slender youth of medium height the personator of this youth be a man a inch and a half or two inch taller and weigh five-and-twenty stone he hand be a great deal larger than those of roger and at least a inch longer he foot be a inch and a half longer he be broader deeper thicker and altogether of a different build the lobe of he ear instead of be pendent like roger 's adhere to he cheek but he be not more unlike in physical outline than in mental endowment taste character pursuit and sentiment in manners and habit in culture and education connection and recollection roger have be educate at stonyhurst with the education of a gentleman this man have never have any education at all roger have move in the best english society this man amongst slaughterman bushranger thief and highwayman roger have be engage to a young lady he cousin kate doughty this man have be engage to a young woman of wapping of the name of mary ann loader a respectable girl in he own sphere of life roger 's engagement to this young lady he cousin be disapprove of by the tichborne family and be the cause of he leave england but before he go he give she a writing and deposit a copy of it with mr gosford the legal adviser of the family this document be one of the most important incident in the history of the case and upon it if the cross-examination have be conduct by mr hawkin in chancery the case would have be crush at the outset it be not my task to show how but to state what it all come to when the learn counsel leave it to the jury to say whether the claimant _ be _ the roger tichborne he have swear himself to be or whether he be arthur orton the butcher of wapping whom he swear he be not this document form the subject of the seal packet leave with mr gosford and contain in effect these word : if god spare I to return and marry my beloved kate within a year i promise to build a church and dedicate it to my patron saint till he cross-examination in chancery he have never hear of this packet and when he be inform of it he solicitor naturally demand a copy gosford have destroy the original and of course there be no end of capital out of it a concoct original be make which be to the effect that this gentleman so like roger _ have seduce he cousin _ and that if she prove to be _ enceinte _ gosford be to take care of she luckily kate doughty have she original preserve with sacred affection but such be the memory of this man 's early life contrast with what _ would _ have be the memory of sir roger tichborne he do not recollect be at stonyhurst but say positively he be at winchester where certainly roger never be he do not remember he mother 's christian name and could not write he own he come to england to see he mother and then would not go to she she go to see he and he get on to the bed and turn he face to the wall she do not see he face but recognize he by he ear because they be like he uncle 's then order the servant to undo he brace for fear he should choke such a piece as this on the stage would not have last one night in real life it have a run for many year but then there never be a rogue that some fool would not believe in how else be it possible that million believe in this man who have forget the religion he have be bring up in and be marry by a wesleyan minister at a wesleyan church he be as he mother inform he a strict roman catholic from he birth however he do he best to reform he error by get married again by a roman priest although he make another blunder and forget he be sir roger tichborne marry as arthur orton the son of the wapping butcher when he dear mother remind he of he be a catholic he write and thank she for the information and hope the bless marium would take care of she for evermore little dream that the black marium would one day take particularly good care of himself so that he forget the place of he birth the seat of he ancestor the friend of he youth the face feature and form of he mother he education and religion he brother officer in the regiment the regiment itself and the position he occupy think he have be a private for fifteen day instead of a painstaking studious diligent officer who be beloved by he fellow he have forget all he neighbor servant dependant as well as the family solicitor who make he will and be appoint he executor he forget he life in paris the village church of he ancestral seat -- nay the ancestral seat itself -- and the very road that lead to it he forget he old friend and historian who swear he have never alter the least in appearance since roger leave -- historian and picture-cleaner to the family in short there be not one single thing in the life of roger that he know he forget what any but a bear fool would remember while he be in poverty and bankruptcy for a couple of hundred pound the real roger have write home on hearing of the death of he uncle from whom he derive he title and estate say pray go to messr glyn 's and exchange my letter of credit for # 2000 for three year for one for # 3000 imagine a man forget he have # 3000 a year and a estate in england worth # 30000 and earn he bread in a slaughter-house and in the bush borrowing money from a poor woman and run away with it but now another singular thing stamp this fraudulent impostor who make so many believe in he he allege by he supporter to be sir roger tichborne recollect all about a place that he have never be to people he have never hear of far less see event that he could _ not _ know and which never happen to he but do happen to arthur orton he know wapp well -- every inch of it old charle orton the father of arthur charle orton the brother the sister the people who keep this shop and that so that when on he return to england he go to the wapping seat of he ancestor instead of ashford he ask all about they and remind they so faithfully of the little event of arthur 's boyhood and resemble that person so much in the face that they say why you be arthur orton yourself true he pay some of they to swear he be not but the impression remain mr hawkin tell the jury how he pick up he second-hand knowledge of the thing he speak about concern the tichborne for it be necessary to be able to answer a good many question wherever he go especially when he go into the witness-box there be a old black servant quite black who have be a valet in the tichborne family he name be bogle and the claimant be tell by the poor old dowager that if he could meet with he bogle could tell he a good many thing about himself bogle be a excellent diplomatist and no sooner hear from lady tichborne that she son roger be in australium than the two begin to look for one another the one as black inside as the other be out bogle announce that he be the man before he see he on the mother 's recommendation and become and be to the end one of he principal supporter -- so much so that old bogle spread the claimant 's knowledge of the tichborne abroad and like everybody else believe in he because he know so much which he could not have know unless he have be the veritable roger all which bogle have tell he but in the interest of justice old bogle and mr hawkin become acquaint much to the advantage of the latter as he happen to meet bogle in the witness-box a place where the counsel unravel the trickster 's most subtle of design the advocate like old bogle as he call he because say he bogle have white hair be so like a malacca cane with a silver knob white at the top and black below bogle have swear that roger have no tattoo mark when he leave england in point of fact he have and bogle have to fit they to the claimant who have have tattoo mark of a very different kind from roger 's the claimant have remove he and therefore be present to the court without any how do you know roger have no tattoo mark ask mr hawkin i see he arm on three occasion this be a serious answer for bogle when and where and under what circumstance follow in quick succession so that there be no escape the witness say that roger have on a pair of black trousers tie round the waist and he shirt button up the sleeve how be they loose how come you to see he naked arm he be rub one of they like this what do he rub for i think he would get a flea do you see it no of course where be it just there what time be this ten minute past eleven that be the first occasion come to the second just the same say bogle same time yes do he always put he hand inside he sleeve to rub i do not know but i want to know if you shirt be unbuttoned mr hawkin and you be rubbin ' you arm you would draw up you sleeve -- never mind what i should do i want to know what you see the same as before answer bogle angrily a flea i suppose but do you see he bogle i tell you mr hawkin i do not excuse I that be on the first occasion well this be the same same flea i suppose same time -- ten minute past eleven yes then all i can say be he must have be a very punctual old flea exit bogle and with he he evidence after the trial have be proceed for some time baigent be give evidence of the family pedigree honeyman whisper we might as well have the first chapter of genesis and read that genesis say hawkin i want to get to the last chapter of revelation one day mr jl toole come in and be invite to sit next to mr hawkin which he do at the adjournment for luncheon the claimant mutter as they pass along there be toole come to learn actin ' from ` arry orkin there be one witness who ought not to be forget it be mr biddulph a relation of the tichborne family a good-natured amiable man willing to oblige any one and a county magistrate -- one of the most amiable county magistrate i have ever meet a man of the strictest honor and unimpeachable integrity he have be ask by the dowager lady to recognize she son i do not see how i can say he i be willing to oblige but not at the expense of truth better get some one else who know he better than i do this man bear no resemblance to the man i know i can not do it and so he resist all entreaty with that firmness of purpose for which he be remarkable he be then invite say mr hawkin to a little dinner at another supporter of the claimant 's and one somewhat shrewder than the rest the claimant describe this party as consist of a county magistrate a money-lender a lawyer and a humbug this be how the advocate deal with this little party in he address to the jury : -- gentleman can not you imagine the scene perkin the lawyer say to biddulph ` come now mr biddulph you know you have have great experience in cross-examine as a county magistrate at petty session now cross-examine this man _ firmly _ and you 'll soon find he know more than you think if he be not the man he be nobody else you may be quite sure of that but first of all ' say perkin ` what do you know of roger that be the first thing let 's start with that ' ` oh not very much ' say biddulph ` he stay at bath once for a fortnight while he mother be there ' ` pass mr biddulph the champagne ' say perkin -lrb- laughter -rrb- ` now ' he add ` how do you amuse yourselve eh ' ` well ' say biddulph ` we use to smoke together at the hotel -- the -- the -- white something it be call ' ` do you smoke pipe or cigar ' ` well i remember we have some curious pipe ' ` another glass of champagne for mr biddulph ' -lrb- more laughter -rrb- ` what sort of pipe ' ask the claimant ` death 's - head pipe ' the magistrate remember open he eye and lift he hand thus the amiable magistrate be convinced although he say candidly enough ' i do not recognize he by he feature walk voice or twitch in he eye but i be strike with he recollection of have meet I at bath ' the death 's - head pipe settle he as for miss brain the governess she be of a different order from mr biddulph she tell we she have listen to the defendant when he solemnly swear that he have seduce she former pupil that he have stand in the dock for horse-stealing and have be the associate of highwayman and bushranger and have make a will for the purpose of fraud and yet this woman take he by the hand and be not ashamed of he companionship he counsel describe she as a minister angel heaven defend I from minister angel if miss brain be one the claimant while in australium be ask what kind of lady he mother -lrb- the dowager lady tichborne -rrb- be answer oh a very stout lady and that be the reason i be so fond of mr butt of the metropolitan hotel she be a tall stout and buxom woman and like mr mina jury -lrb- of wapping -rrb- because she be like my mother a witness of the name of coyne be call to give evidence of the recognition of the claimant by the mother in pari and the solicitor say to coyne you see how she recognize he yes say coyne he be lucky there be no cross-examination and mr hawkin say to the jury they need not cross-examine unless they like it be a free country they may leave this man 's account unquestioned if they like but if it be a true account what do you say to the recognition louie the dane say that while the claimant be on board he ship he amuse himself by pick oakum and read the garden of the soul there be several _ osprey _ speak to as have pick up the claimant after the wreck of the _ bellum _ and the defendant have not the least idea which one be the best to carry he safely into harbor the defendant 's counsel notwithstanding have tell the jury that he hawkin have not venture to contradict one or other of the story of the wreck and have not call the captain of the _ osprey _ which have pick he up comment on such a proposition in advocacy would be ridiculous mr hawkin deal with it by a example which the reader will remember as have occur in he early day : -- ` we do not know which _ osprey _ you mean ' ` take any one ' say the defendant 's counsel remind I of the defense of a man charge with steal a duck and have give seven different account as to how he become possess of it he counsel be at last ask which he rely on ` oh never mind which ' he answer ' i shall be much oblige if the jury will adopt any one of they ' you remember gentleman the touching word in which the defendant 's counsel speak of bogle : ` he be one of those negro ' say he ` describe by the author of paul and virginium who be faithful to the death true as gold itself if ever a witness of truth come into the box that witness be bogle ' well you have see he -- old bogle what do you think of he be there ever a better specimen of feigned simplicity than he ` bogle ' cry the defendant after all those year of estrangement ` be that _ you _ ' ` yes sir roger ' answer bogle how do you do ' ` do you remember give I a pipe o ' baccy ' ask a poor country greenhorn down at alresford ` yes ' answer the claimant ` then you be the man ' say the greenhorn such be the way evidence be manufacture a poor lady -- you remember mr stubb -- have a picture of she great-great-grandfather 's great-grandfather in go the claimant and in he artful manner show he childhood 's memory ` ah mr stubb ' say he look at another picture ` that be not the _ old _ picture be it ' -lrb- somebody have put he up to this -rrb- no sir ' cry mrs stubb delighted with he recollection -- ` no sir but please to walk this way into my parlor ' and there sure enough be the picture he have be tell to ask for ` ah ' he exclaim ` there it be there be the old picture ' how could mr stubb disbelieve she own sens one sir walter strickland decline to see the claimant and be mislead and be roundly abuse by the defendant 's counsel one of the jury ask if _ he be still alive _ yes say the lord chief justice although the defendant express a hope that they would all die who do not recognize he in a letter to rous my lord where he say ' i see i have one enemy the less in harri 's death captain strickland who make himself so great on the other side go to stay at stonyhurst with he brother and die there he call on I a week before and abuse I shamefully so will all go some day ' -- this say mr hawkin be not exhibit the same christian spirit which he show when he say ` god help those poor _ purgure _ sailor ' why should the defendant ask mr hawkin at the close of one of the day 's speech if he be sir roger avoid arthur orton 's sister why would he not have say ` they will be glad indeed to see I and hear I tell they about the camp-fire under the canopy of heaven ' as he counsel put it ` where they brother arthur tell I all about fergusson the old pilot of the dundee boat who keep the public-house at wapping and the shetland pony of wapping and the shottle of the nook at wapping and wish I to ask who keep wright 's public-house now and about the cronin and mr macfarlane of the globe -- all of wapp ' the judge fall back with laughter and the curtain come down for these be the question with many more the claimant ask on the evening of he landing i shall attack the noble army of carabineer say mr hawkin on another occasion he do so and conquer the regiment in detail one old carabineer be librarian at the westminster hospital he name be manton and he be a sergeant he tell baigent something that have happen while roger be he officer and baigent tell the claimant manton afterwards see the huge man and fail to recognize he in any way but when the claimant repeat to he what he have tell baigent manton open he eye this look like proof of he be the man he be strike with he marvellous recollection and be at once pin down to a affidavit : -- the claimant 's voice be stronger and have less foreign accent he swear but i recognize he voice and find he tone and pronunciation to be _ the same as roger tichborne 's _ whom i know as a officer truly a affidavit be a powerful auxiliary in fraud while mr hawkin be reply one afternoon mr whalley mp come in and sit next to the claimant he be from the first one of he most enthusiastic supporter well he say and how be we get on to-day how be we get on eh get on growl the claimant he be be go on at a pretty rate and if he go on much longer i shall begin to think i be arthur orton after all i will conclude this chapter with the follow reminiscence by lord brampton himself -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* i have a great deal to put up with from day to day in many way during this prolonged investigation the lord chief justice cockburn although good be a little impatient and hard to please at time my opponent seek day by day some cause of quarrel with I at time he be most insulting and grow almost hourly worse until i be compel in order to stop he insult to declare openly that i would never speak to he again on this side the grave and i never do my life be make miserable and what ought to have be a quiet and orderly performance be render a continual scene of bickering and conflict too often about the most trifling matter with every one else i get on happily and agreeably my junior loyally do they very utmost to render I every assistance and lighten my burden even the claimant himself not only give I no offence from first to last but be at time in he manner very amusing and preserved he natural good temper admirably consider what he have at stake on the issue of the trial and remember also that that issue devolve mainly upon my own personal exertion nor be the claimant devoid of humor on the contrary he be plentifully endow with it one morning on he go into court a elderly lady dress in deep mourning present he with a religious tract he thank she go to he seat and peruse the document then he write something on the tract carefully revise what he have write and throw it on the floor the usher be watch these proceedings and as soon as he could do so unobserved secure the paper and hand it to I the tract be head sinner repent the claimant have write on it surely this must have be mean for orkin not for I louie 's story of pick he up in the boat must have amuse he greatly if he be amuse at the ease with which fool can be humbug he must also have be astounded at the awful villainy of those who perfect stranger to he have perjure themselves for the sake of notoriety i do what i could to shorten the proceedings my opening speech be confine to six day as compare with twenty-eight on the other side my reply to nine but that reply be a labor fearful to look back upon the mere classification of the evidence be a momentous and necessary task it have to be gather from the four quarter of the world it have to be sift winnow and arrange in order as a perfect whole before the true story could be evolve from the complication and entanglement with which it be surround and when i rise to reply to perform my last work and make my last effort for the success of my cause i feel as one about to plunge into a boundless ocean with the certain knowledge that everything depend upon my own unaided effort as to whether i should sink or swim happily for the cause of justice i succeed and at the end although nattering word of approval and commendation pour upon I from all side from the highest to the humblest i do hot then realize they value to the extent that i do afterwards the excitement and the exertion have be too great for anything to add to it but i afterwards remember -- ay and can never forget -- the word of the lord chief justice himself the first to appreciate and applaud as i be pass near he in leave the court : bravo bravo hawkin and then he add i have not hear a piece of oratory like that for many a long day and he pat I cordially on the back as he look at I with i believe the sincerest appreciation lord chelmsford too who year before have give I my silk gown be on the bench on this last day and i shall never forget the compliment he pay I on my speech it be of itself worth all the trouble and anxiety i have undergo beyond all this and more gratifying even still my speech be like by the bar from the most eminent to the briefless but greatest of all event in that eventful day be one which go deeper to my feeling my old father who have take so strong a view against my go to the bar and who tell I so mournfully that after five year i must sink or swim my old father who have never once see I in my wig and gown from that day to this the almost close scene in my forensic career come into court and sit by my side when i make successfully the greatest effort of my life chapter xxix a visit to sheffield -- mr hailstone 's danish boarhound the remembrance of my session day will never vanish from my mind although at the period of which i be speak they have long recede into the distant past even _ nisi prius _ be diminish in importance although increase in its business and fee solicitor no longer condescend to deliver they briefs but compete for my service i say this without the smallest vanity and only because it be the fact and a great fact in my life i be want to win cause by advocacy or compromise and the innumerable compensation case which continually come in with so steady and so full a tide be a sufficient proof that at all event the solicitor and other think my service worth have so do my clerk those be the day of the golden harvest the very gleanings of which be valuable to those who come after lloyd must have make # 20000 a year with the greatest ease what my income be be of no consequence to any one suffice it to say that no expectation of mine ever come up to its amount and even now when i look back it seem absolutely fabulous i will say no more notwithstanding the curiosity it have excite amongst the member of the profession of course it be a step for I from the humble _ one three six _ but i have have a more lively satisfaction from that little sum than from many a larger fee in the midst of all this rush of london business i still find time to run down to country place in case of election petition or compensation one day i find myself on my way to sheffield to support the member against a attempt to deprive he of he seat in parliament i go with the hon sir edward chando leigh my distinguished junior on that memorable occasion the journey be pleasant until we get near the end of it and then the smoke roll over and around in voluminous dense cloud for a description of which you may search in vain through paradise lose we be meet at the station with great state and even splendor and treat with almost boundless hospitality to keep up we spirit we be take for a drive by the sit member a few mile out into what they call the country in those part the suburban residence be situate in a well-wooded park if that can be call well-wooded where there be no wood but only stunt undergrowth sicken with the baleful fume that proceed from the city of darkness in the distance and black with the soot of a thousand chimney the member apologize politely enough for bring we to this almost uninhabitable and heaven-forsaken region but i begged he not to mind : it be only a more blast scene than the heath in macbeth yes say he still apologetically it _ be _ very bad i admit you see the fume and fire from those manufactory make such havoc of we wood this be apparent but the question be how to pass the time amidst this gloom and sickening atmosphere i find he residence however to my great joy be farther than i expect from the appalling city of darkness and hope begin to revive both in my junior 's heart and mine we friend and host see we spirit thus elated begin to talk with more life-like animation the fume from the factory mr hawkin have so play the devil with we tree that the general impoverishment of nature have earn for the locality of sheffield the unpleasant title of the ` suburb of hell ' i do not wonder i answer no name could be more appropriate or better deserve but if it be my fate to choose my locality i should prefer to live in _ the city itself _ a curious incident happen to we during this yorkshire visit a excursion be arrange to see warburton 's situate some few mile off and notable for many oddity we be drive over and when we arrive be by no means disappoint by the singularity of the mansion it be enclose within a high wall which have be build not for the purpose as you might suppose of prevent the house from get away but for that of keep out rat and fox for there be bird to be preserve from these destructive animal next this portion of the estate be surround by water which afford a additional security to its isolation access to the island be attainable only by means of a bridge the mansion be occupy by a mr hailstone whose duty it be to show visitor over the house and explain everything as she go along ghost story as well and be a remarkably affable lady with a great gift of language we have a very intelligent and edifying lecture in every room we pass through now upon ornithology now chronology next on pisciculture and the habit of stuff pike and other fish but this be not all we guide be wonderfully well read in architecture and display no end of knowledge in point out the different order and sub-order period of and blending of the same so that we be quite ready for lunch as soon as that period should mercifully arrive but it be not exactly yet there be many other curiosity to be show for instance we have not do the warburton library which be a most singular apartment as we be inform i do not know how many story high at the top of a very singular tower with as many language in it as the tower of babel itself and very nearly as tall one only wish the whole thing would topple down before we could come to it at last however we climb to this lofty eminence and revel as well as we could amongst the musty old book which themselves revel in the dust of age have see all the shelf and the back of the book and hear all the account of they without receive any information we commence we descent by means of the wind staircase towards the garden on we way a curious circumstance take place there be a enormously great danish boarhound which have unperceive by we follow mr hailstone from the library it push by without ceremony and proceed until it reach the lady who be some distance in advance he then carefully take the skirt of she dress with he mouth and carry it like a accomplished train-bearer until she reach the bottom of the stair and the garden when he let go the dress and gaze as a interested spectator we be now in the midst of a very beautiful and well-kept garden with a lawn like velvet stretch far away to the lake where ultimately we should have to wait for a boat to ferry we along its placid water this be part of we entertainment and a very beautiful part it be but before we part from mr hailstone and while i be talk to she i feel my hand in the boarhound 's mouth and a pretty capacious mouth it be for i seem to touch nothing but its formidable fang it be not a pleasant experience but i preserve sufficient presence of mind to make no demonstration dog know well enough when a man or woman love they kind and i be sure this one be no exception or he would never have behave with such gentlemanly politeness so soft be the touch of he fang that i be only just conscious my hand be in he mouth by now and then the gentlest reminder i know animal too well to attempt to withdraw it and so preserve a calm more wonderful than i could have give myself credit for while i be wonder what the next proceeding might be mrs hailstone beg I to be quite easy and on no account to show any opposition to the dog 's proceedings in which case she promise that he would lead I gently to the other side of the lawn and there leave I without do the least harm all this be say with such cool indifference that i wonder whether it be a part of the day 's program and rather suppose it be but it turn out that she say it to reassure I and prevent mischief i also learn that it be not by any mean the first occasion when this business have take place it be the first time in my life that i have be in custody and if i have have my choice i should have prefer a pair of handcuffs without tooth as i be be lead away mr hailstone say -- do exactly as he wish he be jealous of you talk to I and lead any one away who do so to the other side of the garden have conduct I to the remotest spot he could find he open he huge jaw and release my hand wag he tail and trot off much pleased with he performance he return to he mistress and put he large paw on she arm -- a striking proof i thought of the dog 's sagacity there will be in this history some story of my famous jack but as he belong to I after i become a judge they be defer until that period arrive the reminiscence of jack be amongst my dearest and most pleasant recollection the changeful nature of popular clamor be never more manifest than on this visit the claimant have be convict and sentence to penal servitude but to deprive a man of he title and estate because he be a butcher 's son do not coincide with the wish of a generous democracy who linger round the sheffield court where the fate of they sit member be to be try they believe in they member and not know on which side i be retain when i go along the corridor into the court they yah yah would at I with lung that would have be strong enough to set they furnace go or blow they out after the petition be try and i have be successful they change they mind and they language this same british public which not long before have yah yah would at I now come forward with true british hooray and bravo ` orkin for ever hooray for orkin bravo orkin hooray a -- hooray hooray for wagga wagga this last cry have reference to a village in australium where the great tichborne fraud have its origin where the first advertisement of the dowager seek she lost son be show to the butcher in he own little shop the son of the respectable butcher of wapp the number of people who profess to believe in the claimant long after he be send to penal servitude be prodigious although not one of they could have give a reason for he faith or point to a particle of unimpeachable evidence to support he opinion it have never be anything other than feeling in the dark for what never exist chapter xxx a expert in handwriting -- do you know joe brown i always take great interest in the class of expert who profess to identify handwriting expert of all class give evidence only as to opinion nevertheless those who decide upon handwriting believe in they infallibility cross-examination can never shake they confidence some will pin they faith even to the cross of a t the perpendicularity my lord of a down-stroke or the obliquity of a upstroke mr nethercliffe one of the greatest in he profession and a thorough believer in all he say have be often cross-examine by I and we understand each other very well i sometimes indulge in a little chaff at he expense indeed i generally have a little fling at he when he be in the box it be remarkable that at the time i speak of judge as a rule have wonderful confidence in this class of expert and never seem to think of form any opinion of they own a witness swear to certain peculiarity the judge look at they and at once see they too often without consider that peculiarity be exactly the thing that forger imitate you find the same peculiarity here my lord and the same peculiarity there my lord consequently i say it be the same handwriting in day long go by the eminent expert in this science have a great reputation as i often meet he i know _ he _ peculiarity and how annoyed he be if the correctness of he opinion be in the least doubt he have a son of whom he be deservedly proud and he and he son in case of importance be often employ on opposite side to support or deny the genuineness of a question handwriting on one occasion in the queen 's bench a libel be charge against a defendant which he positively deny ever to have write i appear for the defendant and mr nethercliffe be call as a witness for the plaintiff when i rise to cross-examine i hand to the expert six slip of paper each of which be write in a different kind of handwriting nethercliffe take out he large pair of spectacles -- magnifier -- which he always carry and begin to polish they with a great deal of care say -- i see mr hawkin what you be go to try to do -- you want to put I in a hole i do mr nethercliffe and if you be ready for the hole tell I -- be those six piece of paper write by one hand at about the same time he examine they carefully and after a considerable time answer : no they be write at different time and by different hand by different person do you say yes certainly now mr nethercliffe you be in the hole i write they myself this morning at this desk he be a good deal disconcert not to say very angry and i then begin to ask he about he son you educate you son to you own profession i believe mr nethercliffe i do sir i hope there be no harm in that mr hawkin not in the least it be a lucrative profession be he a diligent student he be and become as good a expert as he father i hope even better i should say if possible i think you profess to be infallible do you not that be true mr hawkin though i say it and you son who as you say be even better than yourself be he as infallible as you certainly he ought to be why not then i put this question have you and you son be sometimes employ on opposite side in a case that be hardly a fair question mr hawkin let I give you a instance : in lady d -- 's case which have recently be try do not you son swear one way and you another he do not deny it whereupon i add : it seem strange that two infallible should contradict one another the case be at a end \* \* \* \* \* one evening after a good hard day 's work i be sit in my easy-chair after dinner comfortably enjoy myself when a man who be quite a respectable work man come in i have know he for a considerable time what be the matter jenkin i inquire see he be somewhat troubled well mr hawkin it be a terrible job this ` ere i want you to appear for I where i inquire at bow street mr hawkin bow street what have you be do jenkin why nothing sir but it be a put-up job you know my jame i dessay well sir that there boy my son jame have be bring up i might say on the church catechism there be not much in that i say meaning nothing they could take he to bow street for be that the charge against he no sir but from a babby sir he poor mother have bring that there boy up to speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and it be a curious thing mr hawkin -- a very curious thing sir -- that arter all he poor mother 's care and jame 's desire to speak the truth they have go and charge that there boy with perjury ` at all time ' say he mother ` jame speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth ' and this be what it be come to -- would anybody believe it sir _ could _ anybody believe it it be enough to make anybody disbelieve in christianity and what be more sir that there boy be so eager at all time to tell the whole truth that to make quite sure he tell it all he would go a little beyond on the other side sir -- he would indeed when he hear my fee be a hundred guinea to appear at the police court i hear no more of truthful jame \* \* \* \* \* in deal with a case where there be really no substantial defense it be sometimes necessary to throw a little ridicule over the proceedings take care first to see what be the humor of the jury i remember try this with great success and reduce a verdict which might have be considerable to a comparatively trifling amount -lrb- in illustration of this mr cecil a coward have give a incident that occur in a action for slander try at the guildhall many year ago in which mr hawkin qc be for the defendant and mr joseph brown qc for the plaintiff the slander consist in the defendant point he thumb over he shoulder and ask another man do you know he that be joe smith mr joseph brown qc have to rely upon he innuendo -- mean thereby joe smith be a rogue -- and be very eloquent as to slander unspoken but express by sign and tone after a exhausting speech he sit down and bury he head in he bandana as he habit be hawkin get up and turn mr joseph brown 's speech to ridicule in two or three sentence gentleman he almost whisper after a very small whistle which nobody could hear but those close around at the same time point he thumb over he shoulder at he opponent do you know he -- do you know joe brown there be a roar of laughter joe look up saw nothing and retire again into he bandana again the performance be go through do you know joe brown the best fellow in the world brown look up again and be just in time to hear the jury say they have hear quite enough of the case no slander -- verdict for the defendant it be one of the best piece of act i ever see he do -rrb- chapter xxxi appoint a judge -- my first trial for murder no sooner be the tichborne case finish than i be once more in the full run of work one brief be deliver with a fee marked twenty thousand guinea which i decline it would not in any way have answer my purpose to accept it i be ask however to name my own fee with the assurance that whatever i name it would be forthcoming i promise to consider a fee of fifty thousand guinea and do so but resolve not to accept the brief on any term as it involve my go to indie and i feel it would be unwise to do so in 1874 i be offer by lord cairn the honor of a judgeship which i respectfully decline it be no hope of mine to step into a puisne judgeship or for the matter of that any other judicial position i be contented with my work and with my career i do not wish to abandon my position at the bar and my friend at the bar and take up one on the bench with no friend at all for a judge 's position be one of almost isolation this refusal give great dissatisfaction to many and a letter i have before I say i get into a great row with my editor by you refusal another say he lose a lot of money in consequence : i think it be any odds upon you take it sir alexander cockburn give I a complimentary side-cut in a speech he make to some of he old constituent the time come say he when man of the greatest eminence be call upon to give up they professional emolument for the interest of they country in my opinion they have no right to refuse they service no man have this right when he country call for they but these animadversion do not affect I i hold on to the course which i have deliberately choose and which i think my labor and sacrifice in the tichborne case on behalf of my country entitle I to enjoy let any one who have the least knowledge of advocacy consider what it be to carry that case to a successful issue and then condemn I for not take a judgeship if he will i be entitle to freedom and rest a judgeship be neither as one find out when once he put on the ermine but it require no argument to justify the course i take i be entitle to decline and i do there be nothing else to be say all other consideration be idle and irrelevant a judgeship be however a second time offer by lord cairn in 1876 this after due consideration i accept and receive my appointment as a judge of the exchequer court on November 2 of that year the first and most sensational case that i be call upon to preside over be know as the penge case sir alexander cockburn have appoint himself to try it on account of its sensational character but as it come for trial at a time when the lord chief justice could not attend it fall to the junior judge on the bench i be not go to relate the detail of that extraordinary case -lrb- a -rrb- which be best leave in the obscurity of the newspaper file but i refer to it because it can not well be pass over in the reminiscence of my life i shall however only touch upon one or two prominent point -lrb- footnote a : the great sensation of the case be almost overpower by the great sensation that a new power have come upon the bench these be as nearly as i can give they the word of one of we most distinguished advocate and one of the most brilliant who be in the penge case : -- we feel and the bar feel that a great power have come upon the bench he sum up that case as no living man could have do every word tell every point be touch upon and make so clear that it be impossible not to see it another distinguish advocate say there be no other judge on the bench who could have sum that case up as sir henry hawkin do -- rh -rrb- every person i say in my sum up who be under a legal duty whether such duty be impose by law or contract to take charge of another person must provide that person with the necessaries of life every person who have that legal duty impose upon he be criminally responsible if he culpably neglect that duty and the death of the person for whom he ought to provide ensue if the death be the result of mere carelessness and without criminal intent the offence would be manslaughter provide the jury come to the conclusion that there have be culpable neglect of the duty cast upon the individual who have undertake to perform it with regard to the evidence of one of the witness who be say to be a accomplice so that it be necessary that she should be corroborate i say a jury might convict without it but recommend they strongly not to take for grant she evidence unless they find there be so much corroboration of she testimony as to induce they to believe she be tell the truth as to one of the accuse i say : if she have no legal object to fulfil in provide the decease with the necessaries of life the mere omission to do so would not render she guilty but if she do a act wrongfully which have a tendency to destroy life but which be not clone with that intention she would be guilty of manslaughter the jury find a verdict of guilty against all but with a strong recommendation in favor of one in which i join when a verdict of guilty of wilful murder be return a judge whatever may be he opinion of its propriety or justice have no alternative but to deliver the sentence of death and in the very word the law prescribe it be not _ he _ judgment or decision but it be so decree that the sentence shall in no way depend upon the sympathy or opinion of the judge whatever mitigate circumstance there may be must be consider by the secretary of state for the home department as represent the sovereign and upon he advice alone the sovereign act but the home secretary never allow a sentence of death to be execute without the fullest possible inquiry as to mitigating circumstance and it be at this stage that the opinion of the judge be almost all-powerful my judgment in this case be the result of much anxious thought and consideration the responsibility cast upon I be great the case be as difficult as it be serious but my line of duty be plain and it be to leave the fact as clearly as i could possibly state they with such explanation of the law applicable to each case as my ability would allow and then leave the jury to find accord to they honest belief no duty more arduous have ever since be impose upon I and i perform it in my honest conscience without swerve from what i believe and believe still to be my strict line of duty i have have many opportunity of reconsider the whole circumstance but i have never change or vary my opinion after all these year and be certain i never shall -- namely that i do my duty accord to the best of my judgment and ability a judge may go wrong in many way and often do in one way or other especially if he do not know he own mind -- the worst of all weakness because it usually lead to a attempt to strike a medium line between innocence and guilt one great weakness too in a judge be not have the faculty of set out the fact in language which be intelligible to the jury or in not set they out at all but repeat they so often and in so many form that they be at last leave in a absolutely hopeless muddle a judge once keep on so at the jury about if you find burglarious intent and if you do not find burglarious intent that at last the jury find nothing except a verdict of not guilty give the benefit of the doubt as to what the judge mean as a illustration of the necessity of give the jury a clear idea of the evidence in the simplest case i will state what take place at exeter jury be unused to evidence and have very often to be tell what be the bearing of it in a case of fowl-stealing which i be try there be a curious defense raise which seem too ridiculous to notice it be that the fowl have creep into the nose-bag in which they have be find and which be in the prisoner 's possession in order to shelter themselves from the east wind forget that possibly i have a unreasoning and ignorant jury to deal with i think they would at once see through so absurd a defense and do not insult they common sense by sum up i merely say -- gentleman do you believe in the defense they put they head together and keep in that position for some time and at last to my utter amazement say -- we do my lord we find the prisoner _ not guilty _ it be a verdict for the prisoner and a lesson for I it be always my practice found on much calculation of the respective and relative merit and demerit of prisoner to do what no other judge that i be aware of ever do which be to put convict prisoner back until the whole calendar have be try then to bring they up and pass sentence after deliberate consideration of every case i thus have the opportunity of reading over my note and form a opinion as to whether there be any circumstance which i could take into consideration by way of mitigation or in the same manner as to whether there be matter of aggravation such as cruelty or deliberate wilful malice the result of this plan on one occasion at stafford assizes which i remember very well be this two man be convict of bigamy the offence be the same in law as to both the prisoner the one be altogether physically and morally a brute cruel and merciless the other man find guilty have be a bad husband to he wife before he go through the form of the second marriage but as he have be already punish for he misconduct in that respect i think it fair that he should not be punish again for the same offence such be my idea of the law of england although i fear it be sometimes forget i therefore treat this man 's crime as one of a very mitigated character no harm have be do to the second woman and release he on he own recognizance to come up for judgment if he should be call upon i would not revisit upon he he past misdeed the other man i send into penal servitude for five year chapter xxxii on the midland circuit that be orkin hover there say a burly-looking sportsman as i arrive one day at newmarket heath -- ` im a-torkin ' to corlett see ` im nice bernevolent old cove to look at be not ' e yus that do not stop ` be guvin ' I _ five of he wery best _ simply becorze by accident i mistook someb ` dy else 's ` ouse and plate-chest for my own sorter mistake which might ` appen a ` most to henybody there ' e be see ` im that be orkin i need not say i be frequently speak of in this complimentary manner by person who have be introduce to I at the bar i be once lead a little fox terrier with a string because on several occasion he have give I the slip and cause I to be a little late in court i lead he therefore in the leash until he know he duty on this day however as the crowd be wait for I on the little platform of a country station my fox terrier jump out in front of I while i be hold he by the string good -- cry a voice from a gentleman to whom i have previously give a situation under government livery and all find why blow I if the old bloke be not blind lookee there ` be dawg 's a-leadin ' ` im wot d'ye think o ' that but person in much higher station be no less at time fond of chaff which i always take good-humouredly a story of lord grimthorpe who many year after have some fun with I at time over my little jack will appear in he reminiscence a little farther on i use to lead jack with a string in the same manner as i have do the other for educational purpose and lord grimthorpe jocularly call I jack 's prisoner but i must let he tell he own story in he own way when he turn come the midland circuit be always famous for its ill accommodation of she majesty 's judge and of late year even in the supply of prisoner to keep they from loitering away they day in idleness or lonely diversion i always love work and comfortable lodgings and may say from the first to the last of my judicial day set myself to the improvement of both the work and the accommodation some judge in they charge use to discourse with the grand jury of we foreign relation turnip or the state of trade but i take a more humble theme at aylesbury when i inform that August body that the quarter assign to she majesty 's judge be such that a officer would hardly think they good enough to billet soldier in my rest gentleman have be rudely disturb say i in the lodgings assign to I my bedroom be hardly accessible on account of what appear to be a dense fog which be difficult to struggle through i seek refuge in the dressing-room be a bitterly cold night and a very draughty room some one have light a fire in it but unfortunately all the smoke come down the chimney after go up a little way bring down as much soot as it could manage to lay hold of all this be the fault of the antiquated chimney and ill-contrived building generally my marshal be the subject of equal discomfort and i think i may congratulate you gentleman not only on there be very few prisoner but also on the fact that you be not hold a inquest on we body the grand jury be good enough to say that there be a institution call the standing joint committee who will no doubt inquire into you lordship 's subject of complaint the standing joint committee sound powerfully but i believe no further notice be take and the question drop that be a nice un say one of the javelin-man at the door when a friend of he come out do yer ` ear that jimmy orkin be a nice un to talk about lodgings let he look to he own cirkit -- the ` orne cirkit -- where my brother tell I as at a trial at guildford the tenant of that there house would not pay he rent for why because they be so pestered wus ' wermin and what do you think orkin tell the jury -- he be counsel for the tenant -- ` why ' he say ` gentleman you hear what one of the witness say how that the flea be so outrageous that they ackshally stand on the back o ' the ` all chair and bark at 'em as they come in ' that be orkin on he own circuit and ` ere he be find fault with we lodgings it be not long after my arrival at lincoln on the first occasion of my visit that drowsy old ecclesiastical city that i be wait upon first by one benevolent body of gentleman and then another all philanthropist seek subscription for charitable object one bitterly cold morning i be stand in my robe with my back to the fire at my lodgings wait to step into the carriage on my way to court when a very polite gentleman who head quite a body of other polite gentleman ask if he lordship would do they the honor of receive a deputation from the l and b skating club i assent -- nothing would give I more pleasure and in file the deputation arrange themselves hat in hand round I in a semicircle we have the honor my lord to call upon you lordship in pursuance of a resolution pass last night at a special meeting of we club -- what be the name of you club the l and b skating club my lord what be its object _ we _ object my lord no the object of you _ society _ i can guess you object the leader answer with a smile of the greatest satisfaction -- er -- skate my lord you own amusement the head of the deputation bow do you want _ I _ to skate no my lord but we take the liberty of ask you lordship to kindly support we club with a subscription when i see i reply so much poverty and misery around I which need actual relief and when i look at this inclement weather and think how these poor creature must suffer from the cold it seem to I that _ they _ be the people who should apply to those who have anything to bestow in charity not those who be the only people as it would appear who can take pleasure in this excruciating weather see if you club can not do something for these poor sufferer instead of collect merely for you own personal amusement contribute to they necessity and then come and see I again i shall be here till Monday the head of the deputation stare but it do not lose its presence of mind or forget its duty the deputation make a little speech thank I heartily for the kind manner in which they have be receive i never see anything more of they from that day to this -lrb- in a case at devize sir henry show in a striking manner the character he always bear as a humane judge he be not humane where cruelty be any part of the culprit 's misdeed for he visit that with the punishment he think it deserve and he idea of that be on a somewhat considerable scale -rrb- i be down upon cruelty and always lenient where there be any mitigating circumstance whatever either of mental weakness great temptation provocation or unhappy surroundings a woman be bring up before I who have be commit to take she trial on a charge of conceal the birth of a child for prisoner in these circumstance i always feel great sympathy and regard the moral guilt as altogether unworthy of punishment the law however be bind to be vindicate so far as the legal offence be concerned she have already be in prison for three month because she be too poor and too friendless to find bail i be always point out that if magistrate would send more case to the judge than they do they would get some precedent as to the appropriate measure of punishment which they seem badly to need this woman have already be punish without be find guilty with three time the punishment she ought to have receive have she be find guilty a month 's imprisonment would have be excessive prisoner should always be release on they own recognizance where there be a reasonable expectation that they will appear the result be that the unhappy woman who have be punish severely while in the eye of the law she be innocent be discharge when she be find to be guilty we have see how mr justice maule examine a little boy as to he understand the nature of a oath i once examine a little girl upon a preliminary point of this kind before she have arrive at that period of mental acuteness which enable one to understand exactly the meaning of the word utter in the administration of the oath the child be call and after allow the form of the evidence you shall give etc and kiss the book to be gabble over i say before the testament could reach the child 's lip -- stop do you understand what that gentleman have be say no sir i think it be a great farce to let little child be swear who can not be expect to understand even the language in which the oath be administer to say nothing of the oath itself how can they comprehend the meaning of the phrase employ and many grown-up uneducated people be in the same situation surely a simple form such as _ you swear to god to speak the truth _ -- or even better still to make false evidence punishable without any oath at all -- would be far better chapter xxxiii jack i be always fond of dog and never cease to admire they intelligence and sagacity my little jack be give to I when quite a puppy by my old and very dear friend lord falmouth he be bring to I by lady falmouth and from that time he history be my history for he companionship be constant and faithful in my hour of labor and of pleasure he be always with I and i believe if i have have any sorrow he would have share they as he do my pleasure -- nay these he enhance more than i can tell of course he invariably come circuit and sit with I in my lodgings and on the bench where he would patiently remain till the time come to close my notebook for the day whether he like it or not i be unable to say but he seem to take a interest in the proceedings about this however he reminiscence will speak for themselves he always occupy the seat of honor in the sheriff 's carriage and walk to it with a dignity worthy the occasion i be glad to say the judge all love jack and treat he most kindly not for my sake but i believe for he own -- although i may add in pass he sometimes give they a pretty loud rebuke if they show any approach to ill-humour on a occasional want of punctuality in come into court some of they be exceedingly particular in be up to time to a _ moment _ and i should have equal to the occasion at all time but that i have to give jack a run before we start for the duty of the day it be necessary for he health and good behavior on circuit of course whenever there be little to do -- i be speaking of the midland particularly although the western be quite as pleasant -- i give he longer run for instance in warwick park nothing could be more beautiful than to loiter there on a summer morning amongst the cedar on the beautiful lawn it may seem unreasonable to say so but jack almost seem to be endow with human instinct he be as restless as i be over long windy speech and cross-examination that be more adapt for the smoking-room of a club than a court of justice and in order to repress any tendency to manifest he displeasure i give he plenty of exercise in the open air which make he sleep generally when counsel begin to speak have mention the commencement of my companionship with jack which in these reminiscence i would on no account omit i shall let he hereafter tell he own experience in he own way jack 's reminiscence i be bear into the family of my lord falmouth and claim descent from the most well breed of my race in this kingdom the smooth fox terrier all my ancestor be note for they love of sport they keen sense of humor and hatred of vermin at a very early period of my infancy i be present to sir henry hawkin one of she majesty 's judge of the high court who take a great fancy to I and if i may say so without appear to be vain at once adopt I as he companion and a member of he family sir henry or as i prefer to call he my lord treat I with the sweetest kindness and i go with he wherever it be possible for he to take I at first my youthful waywardness and love of freedom -- for that be inherent in we race -- compel he to restrain I by a string which i sometimes pull with such violence that my lord have to run and on see we so amusing ourselves one morning old lord grimthorpe i think they call he who be always full of good-natured chaff cry out -- halloa hawkin what have jack make you he prisoner ha ha hold he jack do not let he get away well this go on for several week what i think you call chaff and at last i be allow to go without the string it happen that on the very first morning when i be thus give my liberty whom should we meet but this same old lord grimthorpe halloa he cry again -- halloa hawkin do you keeper let you go without be attach to a string no no say my lord -- no no jack 's attach to _ I _ now thereupon dear old grimthorpe who love a joke laugh till he elbow rest on he knee as he stoop down well say he that be good hawkin very good indeed on one occasion one of those country yokel who always meet we at assize town and get as close up to we javelin-man as they could so that we could not only see they but indulge we other sens at the same time see we get out of we carriage say to another yokel i say bill blarm if the old bloke be not bring he dawg again -- that there fox terrier -- to go a-rattin ' i do not know what rattin ' mean at that time and do not learn it till we get to warwick i think it be rude to call my lord a bloke especially in he red robe but do not quite know what bloke mean for i have see so little of mankind one morning before we open the commission at warwick -- i may as well come to it at once -- my lord and i go for a walk along the road that lead over the bridge by warwick castle towards leamington there be a turn to a village which belong to the old day but do not seem now to belong to anything and look something like a rural watering-place quiet and unexciting we turn down this quiet road and come alongside a beautiful little garden cover with flower of all kind i have occasion afterwards to learn whom they belong to but i will tell you before we go further so as to make the situation intelligible he be a countryman who use to make it he boast that he never have a day 's schooling in he life -lrb- so that he ought to have be leader of the most ignorant class -rrb- and this make he the independent man he be towards he betters then my lady warwick use to take notice of he and this also give he another lift in he own estimation he learn to read in the long run for he really have a good deal of native talent for a man and set himself up for a politician and a something they call a philosopher which any man can be with a pint pot in front of he i be tell especially at a village alehouse he be a great orator at the gridiron beershop in the lane which run round one part of my lord warwick 's park and it be say that old gale -- such be he name -- have pick up most of he education from he own speech gale be also the lawyer of the village -- he could tell everybody what he rights be if anybody have any besides gale but he declare he have be do out of _ he _ rights by a man who have lend he old father some money on the bit of land i be come to as we go along what should we see but a rat i know what he be in a moment although i have never see such a thing before and know i have to hunt he my lord cry _ ci _ -- _ rat jack _ -- _ rat _ away i go after the rat -- i do not care what he name be -- and sir henry after I with all the exuberance he use to show when he be follow the quorn presently we hear the dreadful orator 's voice use language only utter i be glad to say amongst man where the h -- l be you come to like this he cry i forget to say that we marshal be with we and of course he take upon himself to explain how matter stand indeed it be one of he duty when judge go out a-ratting to explain _ who _ they be so when we arrive at the place where they be talk together i hear the dreadful man say -- judge o ' th ' land he be not much of a judge o ' th ' land to tear my flower to piece like that look at these ` ere toolips the marshal explain how that it be for the improvement of sir henry hawkin 's health that a little fresh air be take every morning lookee ` ere say gale i do not know it wur the judge doin ' I the honor to tear my flower-bed to piece i bin workin ' at these ` ere bed for month and here they be spill in a minit but i tell ee what orkin or no orkin he be not gwine to play hell with my flower-bed like that ` ere if he want the ground for public improvement as you call it well you can take it under the act there be room enough for improvement i dessay now instead of he lordship send the man to prison as i think to be sure he must do he speak to he as mild as a lamb and tell he he commend he spirit and actually ask he what he value the flower at a judge condescend to do that this mollify the old man 's temper and turn away he flowery wrath so he say at once he be not the man to make a profit out o ' the circum_starnce _ but right be right and wrong wor not no man 's right with a great many other proverb of a like nature which be as hard to get rid of amongst man and woman as precedent amongst judge and then the old man much against he will and inclination have a sovereign force upon he by we marshal which he put into he pocket and then accompany we to the gate now come this remarkable circumstance when we get back to we lodgings after be church what should we find but a beautiful nosegay of cut flower in we drawing-room from old gale and every morning come a similar token of he good-nature and admiration while we be there and the same whenever we go on that circuit one of we servant be kind enough to make I a set of robe exactly like my lord 's which i use to wear in the court of crown case reserve and at high function such as the queen 's birthday or chancellor 's breakfast in court i always appear in mufti on ordinary occasion -- that be to say i do not appear at all ostentatiously like some man but sit quietly on my lord 's robe close to he chair i well remember one occasion while we be at hereford a very pompous and extremely proper town as all cathedral city be my lord and i be robe for the reception of the high sheriff -lrb- as he be call -rrb- and he chaplain who be presently come with the great carriage to take we to be church before we charge the grand jury hereford be a very stately place and enjoy a very high opinion of its own importance in the world it be almost too respectable to admit of the least frivolity in any circumstance you always seem to be go to church at hereford or just come out -- the latter be nicest -- so that there be in my time a sedateness only to be equal by the hardness of a brazil nut which would ruin even my tooth to crack i do not know if that be a proper way in which to describe a solid herefordian but if so judge of the high sheriff 's surprise as well as that of the chaplain when i walk by the side of my lord into we drawing-room i never see a clergyman look so glum we be both in robe as i observe and my lord be so pleased with my appearance that he hold I up for the two dignitary to admire but hereford do not admire other people they confine they admiration within they own precinct on we way from the station to we lodgings i ought to have say both these gentleman be full of praise who would not admire a judge 's companion although sheriff and chaplain be highly proper the former could not restrain a hearty laugh while the latter tighten he lip with a reprove smile but then the chaplain with a proper reverence for the state function afterwards look very straight down he nose and hem a little ventured to say -- my lord be you _ really _ go to take the little dog to divine service in the cathedral my lord look quite astonished at the question and then put he face down to I and pretend to whisper and then to listen afterwards he say -- no jack say not to-day he do not like long sermon the chaplain would much rather i have go to church than have hear such a reprimand but this be not quite the end of my reminiscence i hear on the best authority that the sermon of the chaplain on that morning be the _ shortest he have ever preach _ as a assize discourse and my lord attribute it entirely to my suppose observation on that subject so that my presence at all event be useful i have always observe that lesser dignitary be more jealous of they dignity than greater one here be a excellent example of it the chaplain look very severe but when this little story reach the ear of the good bishop atlay he be delighted and wish to see I i be become famous i make my call in due course and let he see that a judge 's dog be not to be put down by a mere chaplain and come away much gratify with he lordship 's politeness after this during we stay in the city the bishop give I the run of he beautiful new garden along the riverside and there my lord and i use to gambol for a hour after we duty in court be over this lovely garden be a additional pleasure to I because i be relieve from a muzzle there be only one thing want : the bishop keep no rat after this he lordship never see my lord without ask the question how 's dear jack which show how much a bishop could respect a little dog and how much superior he be to a chaplain i hear he say once we be all god 's creature but that of course i be not able to understand at the time i do not know if it include the chaplain i think i must now tell a little story of myself if you will not think I conceit it be about a small matter that happen at cambridge one day a very amiable but dreadfully noisy advocate be cross-examine a witness as i think rather angrily because the man would not say exactly what he want he to say my lord do not take notice of this and it go on until i think i would call he attention to the counsel 's manner and accordingly give a growl -- merely a growl of inquiry brown -- which be the counsel 's name -- be a little startled at this unexpected remonstrance and pause look up at the judge go on say my lord -- go on pray pretend not to know the cause of the interruption he go on accordingly for a considerable time with a very noisy speech -- so noisy that one could not hear one 's self bark which i do two or three time without any effect however at last i make one of my best effort but this be bad policy inasmuch as it attract too much attention to myself who have be hitherto unseen my lord however thanks to he presence of mind have the kindness to say -- dear I i wish people would not bring they dog into court then turn to we marshal he say take jack into baron pollock 's room -- the baron have just go in to lunch for he be always punctual to a minute -- and ask he to give he a mutton-chop and when five minute later my lord come in the baron be enjoy he chop and i be eat my lord 's in another court the judge administer a well-timed rebuke to a flippant and very egotistical counsel and i could hardly restrain myself from administer another during the progress of a dreadfully long address to the jury for the defense he say -- why gentleman there be not sufficient evidence against the prisoner _ on which to hang a dog _ and how much evidence mr -- would you consider sufficient to hang a dog that would depend my lord as to whom the dog belong i think how like human nature that young man be i use to have a very good view of all that take place in court and could tell some very funny as well as interesting story about person i have see one day i be amuse _ so _ much that have i not remember where i be i must like my friend mention by robert burn in he twa dog have bark wus ' joy because i think it so strange here be a queen 's counsel a man of so proper a countenance that i do not think it ever smile in its life and so very devoted to he profession that he would never think of leave it to go to a racecourse i should have as soon expect to meet he in we dog ' home look for a greyhound to go course with on primrose hill -- and here he be stand up on he hind leg and make a application to the court which my lord be never in he life know to grant it be the night before the derby and we always take care to have a full list of case for that Wednesday for _ fear _ the public should think we go to the derby and leave the work to look after itself we generally have about a dozen in pretty early in the afternoon of Tuesday so that the suitor and witness solicitor and all other whom it concern might know where they be and that _ they _ could not go to the derby the follow day what a scene it be as soon as this list be publish i use to sit and watch the various applicant sidle into they seat with the most sheepish face for man i ever see in come the first gentleman fluster with excitement would you lordship allow I to make a application yes say my lord -- yes i see no objection what be you application mr -- i will not give he name there be a case my lord in to-morrow 's list -- number ten it be quite impossible see the number of case before it that that case can be reach if that be so say my lord there be no necessity for make any application -- if you know it be impossible to reach it i mean to say -- it be _ ex abundanti cautela _ my lord i think that be the expression but as it be not dog-latin i be not sure it be a good horse to run i dare say say my lord but i do not think he 'll win this time the counsel shake he head and would have smile i could see that only he be disappointed i feel sorry for he because he client have make arrangement to go to the derby as he be turn disconsolately away my lord speak with a little more encouragement in he tone and a quiet smile we will see later mr -- be you client _ unable _ to appear to-morrow i be afraid so my lord quite have you a doctor 's certificate i be afraid not my lord he be not ill then you can renew the application later but understand i be _ determine to get through the list _ that be so like my lord nothing would turn he from he resolution if he sit till midnight and i nearly bark with admiration then come number six on the list with the same complaint that it be not likely to be reach i be not so sure say sir henry i have just refuse number ten yours be a long way before that some of the previous one may go off very soon there do not seem to be anything _ very long _ in front of you mr -- what be you difficulty about be here the real difficulty my lord -- and as he hesitate the judge say -- you want to be elsewhere frankly my lord that be so very well if both side be agree i have no objection if i be not try you case i shall be try some one else 's and it be a matter of perfect indifference to I whose case it be a hour after in come a brisk junior state that he leader be unavoidably absent what be the application mr wallsend there be a case on you lordship 's list for to-morrow my lord yes what number number seven my lord i be tell number six be a long case and sure to be fight my application be that as that case will last over Friday -- Friday why Friday there be a little laughter because it happen to be the oak day i be tell it be a long case my lord yes but number six have go so that you will stand a excellent chance of come on about two o'clock perhaps a little before what be the nature of you case illegal imprisonment my lord very well if it be any convenience to you mr wallsend i will take it last by the look of the young man it seem of no great convenience that will give you witness time to be here i hope the counsel shake he head and then begin to say that the fact be that he client have a engagement and he lordship would see it be the great race of the year i do not like these application make in this random manner i be willing to oblige the party in all case if i can but these constant motion to postpone interfere very much with the public convenience and i mean to say that the public be to be consider now come the gentleman who never attend race and devoted himself to business he could not have tell you the name of a horse to save he life but he also make he application to postpone a case until Thursday delightful day Thursday such a convenient day too -- between the derby and the oak say my lord who be very friendly to the learn counsel and like he not only as a member of he old circuit but as a brother bencher and a clever advocate -- oh i see i see where _ you _ want to be to-morrow my lord it be no use in spite of the gentleman 's remonstrance and protestation he say -- you may go mr -- and i hope you will enjoy yourself i need hardly say nothing be leave of the list by twelve o'clock the next day and sir henry have the honor of go in the royal train and dining at marlborough house in the evening i ought perhaps to mention that there be a case proceeding when all these interruption take place i do not know the name but two counsel be in it one of whom be remarkable for the soul of wit which be call _ brevity _ and the other be not one be frank lockwood qc a very amusing counsel whom i always like because he often sketch I and my lord in pen and ink mr jelf qc be the other learn counsel although i like most of the barrister i often wish i could teach they the invaluable lesson _ when to leave off _ it would have save many a verdict and give I the opportunity of hear my own voice lockwood be cross-examine and appear to I deal rather seriously with jelf 's witness who be a pious body of gentleman and pride themselves above all thing on speak the truth as though it be a great credit not to commit perjury at last mr jelf tire with be route in so ruthless a manner cry in a lamentable voice -- pray pray mr lockwood so i do say lockwood -- so i do mr jelf at fitting and proper time chapter xxxiv two tragedy -lrb- the _ daily telegraph _ speaking of the necessity for justice sometimes to strip the bandage from she eye and look into the real merit of a case mention the follow case as show sir henry 's unequalled knowledge of human nature and the sound equity of he decree : -- a young respectable woman have be lead away by a villain who be already marry and under a promise of marriage have betray she he induce she to elope with he and suggest that she should tear a cheque out of she father 's cheque-book and forge he name so completely be she under he influence that she do so he send she to different bank to try and cash it but it be not till she get to a local bank where she be know that this be accomplish the cheque be for # 200 but the seducer never obtain the money the girl be apprehend before she reach he sir henry openly express he strong sympathy for the unhappy girl and order she to be bind over in she own recognizance of # 20 to come up for judgment when call upon -rrb- during the early year of my tenure of office as a criminal judge i become and still be firmly impress with the belief that to enable one fill that office to discharge the twofold duty attach to it -- namely that of try the issue whether the crime imputed to the prisoner have be establish by legal evidence and if so what punishment ought to be impose upon the prisoner assume the preside judge to be the person to determine it -- it be absolutely essential that he should keep the whole of the circumstance in he mind and carefully weigh every fact which either form a element in the constitution of the offence itself or have a substantial bearing as affect the aggravation or mitigation of the punishment for it be not only essential that these matter should be know to and appreciate by the judge who try the case but that they may be also present for the information of the home secretary who ought to be acquaint with they so that he may form a satisfactory view of the whole of the circumstance surround the case a strange story that will ever stand out in my memory as one of the most dramatic of my life be that of a young lady who be a professional nurse at the general hospital at liverpool she be young clever and i believe beautiful as well as esteemed and love by all who know she she have become engage to a engineer and it have be arrange that she should pay a visit to she mother in nottingham on a Friday so as to acquaint she with they engagement the intended husband have arrange to come on the follow Monday the parent be poor respectable people and the girl herself be poor so that she have no change of attire but go in she professional nurse 's dress it be she intention however to buy a ordinary dress at nottingham there be a dressmaker in that city whom she mother know and with whose child in they early day she daughter have play accordingly in the evening the nurse with a younger sister go to the cottage to make the necessary arrangement while she be there the son of the dressmaker come in and be at once attract by the beauty and the manner of the girl as they have know one another in childhood it be not surprising that they should talk with more familiarity than would have be the case have they be stranger when the nurse rise to go the young man ask permission to accompany she to she mother 's she decline but he persist in he request this man be a clever mechanic and have invent a machine for make chenille sad to say this invention he use for the purpose of inveigle the girl into he workshop which be situate on the second floor of a extensive range of warehouse in a yard at nottingham he ask she to come on the Monday morning and when she inform he that she lover be to come by the 1230 train at nottingham station he say if she come at eleven she would have plenty of time to see he invention and then meet he she at last consent i now come to a series of fact of a sensational character on the Monday morning she go accord to the appointment and be see to go with this man up a flight of step which lead from the yard to the first floor the door open on to the landing outwardly in about a quarter of a hour after she be see stagger down the step and cross the yard in the direction of the street in the street she fall and be convey to a neighbouring house she be afterwards take to a hospital in the course of some minute the man himself come down the step and be inform that a girl have be see come out of he premise bleed and have be take to a cottage be there say he and walk away in the afternoon he be apprehend he say he be very sorry but that he be show the girl a little toy pistol and that it have go off : quite accidentally he wish to be take to the hospital where she be the magistrate in the meanwhile have be inform of the occurrence and with he clerk attend at the hospital to take she die deposition there be a amount of skill and ability about the prisoner which be somewhat surprising to I who be seldom surprise at anything do you not think it be a accident he ask the die girl answer yes in re-examination by the magistrate 's clerk at the end of the business the follow answer be elicit -- i think it be a accident before the second shot be fire the extraordinary part of this story to my mind be that the able counsel -- and able he indeed be who defend he -- treat the matter as the most frivolous prosecution that be ever institute i know that he almost laugh at the idea of murder and further that the junior counsel for the prosecution treat the charge in the same manner and say that in he opinion there be no case the man be indict for wilful murder and i be bind to say after read the deposition i could come to no other conclusion than that he be guilty of the most cruel and deliberate murder if the deposition be correct i go with the counsel on both side to view the scene of the tragedy and it be agree that the counsel for the prosecution should indicate as well as he could the case for the crown by merely state undisputed fact in connection with the premise the flight of step as i have say lead from the courtyard to the first landing the door open outwards and the first visible piece of evidence be that some violence have be exercise in force open the door on the occasion of some one make he or she escape from the building for the staple into which the bolt of the lock have be thrust show that the door have be lock on the inside and that the person come from the premise must have use considerable force in break through the key be not in the lock neither have it fall out or it would have be find somewhere near it have evidently be take out and secrete because it be find at the bottom of a dustbin a long way off from the staircase and in the room occupy by the prisoner there be one additional fact at this part of the view which i must mention a bullet be pick up near the door it have strike the opposite wall and then glance off and hit the other wall close to the door the bullet have be fire from the landing above this be indicate by the direction as it glance along the wall and further by the mark it have leave of its line of flight from the landing above for it have strike against the low ceiling of that spot as though the person firing have fire in a hurry and have not take sufficient aim to avoid it it might be take therefore that the person firing be not use to firearm or he would not have hit what might be call the ceiling the bullet be produce by the chief constable on reach the second landing the mark of the bullet in the lintel show clearly that it have be fire in the direction of some object below -- some one probably descend the stair on turn into the factory on this floor which be quite empty i see on the wall near the doorway the mark of another bullet which have rest near and be find by the police it be a bad aim and show therefore that the person who fire it be unused to firearm we go to the next room into which we ascend by six step it be clear that it be from the head of these stair that the course of the bullet be direct its elevated position and the angle of incidence show this but as neither of these bullet have strike the decease for there be no mark of any kind to prove it there be another bullet to be account for and as the prisoner say that the pistol go off by accident two or three matter have to be consider where be the spot where the accident occur and be aim actually take the bullet have enter the hinder part of the neck have take a downward direction and lodge in the spine it do not therefore go off while he be explain the pistol to she otherwise it would have strike she at any other place than where it do moreover she have run in a state of intense fright the moment she be wound -- have commence to run before in fact have escape from the clutch of she murderer for the skirt of she dress be tear from the gather it be prove that the prisoner have buy the pistol on the Saturday night that he be unused to firearm for he have to ask the man who sell it to explain the mode of use it he be hear practise with it on Sunday and when the accident occur it be prove that the interval between the first and second shot exactly account for the space which intervene between the respective spot where the firing must have take place much be make of the fact that the poor girl have say she think it be a accident but i have to call the learn counsel 's attention to the statement at the end of she examination which be this : i think at first it be a accident for i could not believe he could be so cruel but after the _ second shot _ i believe he mean to kill I a somewhat novel incident occur during the examination for the prosecution a wire stand have be dress with the girl 's clothes to show where the lower part of the dress have be tear from the gather it be place on the table and no doubt exactly resemble the girl herself the prisoner be so much affect that he shudder and have to be support he be condemn to death in the house of common and out of it sympathy be of course arouse not for the unhappy girl who have be send suddenly to she account but for the lustful brute who have murder she a question be ask of the secretary of state for the home department as to the prisoner be insane and whether there be not abundant evidence of insanity at the trial the counsel for the prosecution write to the home secretary and request he to lay he letter before the prisoner 's counsel to ascertain whether he agree with it the letter be to this effect : not only be there no evidence of insanity but the prisoner 's counsel base he defense entirely upon the fact that there be no suggestion that the man be or ever have be insane he must have be insane argue the counsel if he have commit a brutal murder of that kind there be no insanity and therefore it be a accident the humane questioner of the home secretary leave the prisoner after that statement to he well-deserved fate \* \* \* \* \* i recollect at one gloucester assize a man be try before I for the murder of a woman near bristol the prisoner have give he account of the tragedy and say he have make up he mind to kill the first woman he meet alone and unprotect that be to say he have make up he mind to kill somebody when there be no witness of the deed humanitarian for murderer might call this insanity he go forth on he mission and see a woman come towards he with a baby he instantly resolve to kill both and probably would have do so but for the fact that some one be see come towards he in the distance the woman and child therefore escape the person he have see in the distance also pass by and then he wait in the lane alone in a little time a poor woman come along the ruffian instantly seize she cut she throat and kill she on the spot no sooner have he accomplish he purpose than a young farmer drive along in he cart and see the dead body in the road and the murderer a little way off jump out of he cart and arrest he a little farther on the road there be a labor man who have not be visible up to this moment break stone look after this man say the farmer he have commit murder keep he safe while i go to the village and get a constable all right say the labourer i 'll keep un as soon as the farmer be go the labourer and the murderer get into conversation for they have to while away the time until the farmer have procure the constable why ask the stone-breaker what have you be a-doin ' of killin ' a woman answer the murderer killin ' a woman say the mason why what do you want to kill a woman for she war not you wife be she nay answer the murderer or i should ha ' kill she afore the want of motive be always a strong argument with humanitarian who pity the murderer and not the victim i hear no particle of sympathy express for the poor woman but there be abundance of commiseration for the fiend who have perpetrate the terrible deed there never be any _ adequate _ motive for murder but there be never a deed commit or any act perform without motive insanity on the ground of absence of motive be set up as a matter of course but insanity should be base on proof apart from the cruelty of the act itself it be a premeditated crime a bloodthirsty desire to wreak he malice on some one but beyond the act beyond the malignant disposition of the man there be no evidence whatever of insanity i refuse to recommend he to the royal clemency on that ground or on any ground for there be not the smallest pretence for say it be not a deliberate cold-blooded murder and the man be rightly hang society should be protect from murderer this may be hard deal with the enemy of society but it be just to society itself i be never hard on a prisoner the least circumstance in mitigation find in I a hearty reception but cruelty in man or woman a unflinching judge take another case in gloucestershire a man be convict of kill a girl by stab she in no less than thirty-eight place again the humanitarian besiege the home secretary no man in he sens would have be so cruel and there be he conduct in the dock : he be so wild so incoherent there be also he conduct in the field where he have commit the deed : he call the attention of the passer-by to he have kill she and last of all there be the doctor whom the home secretary have consult after the trial i be appeal to and state my opinion honestly : that i have closely watch the man at the trial and be satisfy that he be sham insanity and he sham it so awkwardly that there be no doubt whatever that he be sane another judge be ask about the case who see only the evidence and he come to the same conclusion and i be compel to report that the doctor who certify that he be insane do so _ without have see he _ as the doctor for the prosecution have at the trial and before he be hang chapter xxxv the st neot case this be the last trial for murder that i preside over the object be not to show the horrible detail of the deed but my mode of deal with the fact for it be in the elimination of the false from the true that the work of a judge must consist otherwise he office be a useless form i shall give this case therefore more in detail than i otherwise should the case be that of horsford in the year 1898 at huntingdon assizes i say now long after the event the murderer be not improperly describe by the _ daily news _ as the greatest monster of we criminal annals and yet even in that case some kind-hearted people say i have go quite _ to the limit of a judge 's rights _ in sum up the case let I say a word about circumstantial evidence some writer have speak of it as a kind of dangerous innovation in we criminal procedure it be actually almost the only evidence that be obtainable in all great crime and it be the best and most reliable you may draw wrong impression from it i grant but so you may from the evidence of witness where it be _ doubtful _ but you can not fail to draw the right one where the fact be not doubtful if it be capable of a wrong inference a judge should be absolutely positive in he direction to the jury not to draw it i have witness many great trial for murder but do not remember one where there be a eye-witness to the deed how be it possible then to bring home the charge to the culprit unless you rely on circumstantial evidence circumstantial evidence be the evidence of circumstance -- fact that speak for themselves and that can not be contradict circumstance have no motive to deceive while human testimony be too often the product of every kind of motive the history of this case be extremely simple the accuse walter horsford aged thirty-six be a farmer of spaldwick the person murder annie holme be a widow whose age be thirty-eight year she have reside for several month at st neot where she die on the night of January 7 she have be marry and lose she husband thirteen year ago on he death he leave two child annie and percy the latter be sixteen year of age and the girl fourteen the prisoner be a cousin of the deceased woman while she live at stonely the man have be in the habit of visit she and have become a intimate member of the family in the month of October the prisoner be marry to a young woman name bessie -- the widow with she two child and a third which it would be idle affectation to suggest be the offspring of she late husband go to reside at st neot in a cottage rent at about # 8 a year the prisoner write to annie holme on at least two occasion towards the close of the year annie holme suspect herself to be pregnant she be anxious not to bring another child into the world and have some communication with the prisoner on the subject on January 5 he write to she that he would come and make some arrangement the woman be deceive as to she condition but that make no difference with regard to the crime the letter go on to state : you must remember i pay you for what i do do not write any more letter for i do not want bessie to know on December 28 he purchase from a chemist to whom he be a stranger and who live at thrapston a quantity of poison allege that he want to poison rat prisoner call in a gentleman as a reference to he respectability as the chemist have refuse to sell he the poison without at last a small parcel be supply it be enter in a book with the prisoner 's name and he sign the book as do also the gentleman who be he introducer the poison be strychnine arsenic prussic acid and carbolic acid no less than 90 grain of strychnine be supply he have write to say he would come over on the Friday which follow January 5 there be no reason to suppose he do not fulfil he promise on the Friday the woman be suffer from neuralgia in the evening however she be in she usual health and spirit and do she iron up to eight o'clock she go to bed between half-past nine and ten and take with she a tumbler of water in ten minute the little girl and she brother go upstairs they go to the mother who be in bed with she child the tumbler be nearly empty the mother ask for a sweet which the little girl give after this annie get into bed the mother begin to twitch she arm and leg and seem in great pain dr turner be send for as she get worse he assistant dr anderson come and watch the patient notice that the symptom be those of strychnine poisoning she be die before he could get to the surgery and return with a antidote the woman be dead she who have be well at half-past nine be dead before eleven the police be communicate with and a constable search the house turn up the valance of the bed he find a piece of paper crumple up this be send to a analyst on the follow day a inquest be hold and a post-mortem direct horsford at the inquest swear that he have never write to the deceased or visit she on the evening of Saturday the 8th after the post-mortem mr hensman and another woman find between the mattress and the bed a packet of papers these be also submit for analysis one of they contain 35 grain of strychnine another have crystal of strychnine upon it there be write on one of the packet and it be the handwriting of the prisoner it say take in a little water it be quite harmless will come over in a day or two on another packet be write : one dose take as tell also in the prisoner 's handwriting the body have be bury and be exhume three grain of strychnine be find by the county analyst in such part of the stomach as be submit to he dr stevenson take other part to london and the conclusion he come to be that at least 10 grain must have be in the body at the time of death while 1\/2 grain have be know to be fatal there be a singular circumstance in the defense of this case one which i have never hear before or since and that be a complaint that the counsel for the prisoner be twit by the crown because he have not call _ evidence for the defense _ the jury be solemnly ask to remember that if one jot or tittle of evidence have be put forward or a single document put in by he the prisoner 's counsel he would _ lose the last word on behalf of the prisoner _ of course counsel 's last word may be of more value than some evidence but the smallest jot or tittle of evidence or any document whatever that even _ tend _ to prove the innocence of the accuse be of more value than a thousand last word of the most powerful speaker i have ever listen to and i would go further and say that evidence in favor of a prisoner should never be keep back for the sake of the last word it be the bounden duty of counsel to produce it especially where evidence be so strong that no speech could save the prisoner neither side should keep back evidence in a prisoner 's favor i say to the jury -- we be assemble in the presence of god to fulfil one of the most solemn obligation it be possible to fulfil and i will to the best of my ability assist you to arrive at a honest and just conclusion the law be that if a man deliberately or designedly administer or cause to be administer a fatal poison to procure abortion whether the woman be pregnant or not and she die of it the crime be wilful murder you have be ask to form a bad opinion of this deceased woman but she have bring up she child respectably on she slender means and there be no evidence that she be a loose woman it more than pained I when i hear the learn counsel -- _ instruct by the prisoner _ -- cross-examine that poor little girl leave a orphan by the death of the mother with a view to create a impression that the poor dead creature be a person of shameless character again counsel have comment in unkind term on the deceased woman and say the prisoner _ have no motive _ in commit this crime on a woman whom he value at half a crown he might not it be true care half a crown for she it be not a question as to what he value the woman at we be not try that at all but it show there _ be _ a motive i have not admit a statement which the woman make while in she die state because she may not fully have realize she condition probably you will have no doubt that by whomsoever this fatal dose be administer there be only know to medical science one poison which will produce the symptom of this woman 's die agony one thing be surprising at this stage -- that immediately after death the door of the house be not lock and while the body be upon the bed a paper of no importance be find and that afterwards several relative go in the object of the cross-examination be to show that some evil-disposed person have enter the house and place thing there _ without any motive _ but whoever may have go into that house there be one person who _ do not go _ -- one who above all other owe decease some respect -- and that be the prisoner and unless you can wipe out the half-crown letter from you mind you would have expect a man on those intimate term with the poor woman to have go and make some inquiry concern she death he do not go he be at the falcon hotel at huntingdon and a telegram be send tell he to fail not to be at the inquest at the inquest he tell a deliberate lie for he swear he have never write to the woman or send she anything or be on familiar term with she he have write to she and if he letter do not prove familiar term there be no meaning in language with regard to the prisoner 's alleged handwriting on the packet and papers find under the woman 's bed and elsewhere i must point out to you that here be one on which be write ` take in a little water it be quite harmless will come over in a day or two ' this be write on a buff paper which dr stevenson say must have contain 35 grain of strychnine sufficient to kill thirty-five person and the direction write be ` one dose take as tell ' these inscription be swear to by expert as be in the prisoner 's handwriting here i point out the allege resemblance in the character of the letter so that the jury might judge if the prisoner write they if the prisoner write the word ` take as tell ' you must ask yourselve the meaning of it also you will ask whether it be not a little strange that the death occur on that very Friday night when he say he would go over and see she again the word ` harmless ' be of the gravest character see that within the fold of that paper be 35 grain of a deadly powder which even for rat-powder would be mix with something else again as to motive upon which so much stress have be lay by the defendant 's counsel if the prisoner have no motive who else have be there a human be on earth who have ill-will towards she or anything to gain by she death the learn counsel carefully avoid suggest any one nor could he suggest that any one in the neighborhood write the same handwriting as the prisoner i will dismiss the theory that some one have imitate the prisoner 's writing in order to do he a injury and ask if you can see any reason for any one else give the woman the powder there be one fact beyond all dispute : in December the prisoner buy a shilling 's worth of strychnine he say he buy it for rat but no one on the farm have be call to prove it what have be do with the rest of the powder where be he on that Friday he counsel say he could not prove a _ alibi _ but if he be at spaldwick after say he be go to st neot to see this poor woman he _ could _ have prove it the prisoner 's counsel say that the accuse do not speak of the woman 's murder after the inquest and say it be not necessary he do not understand the ` familiar jargon ' of the law court the familiar jargon of the law court gentleman be not quite the phrase to use with reference to we judicial proceedings the law court be the bulwark of we liberty we life and we property we welfare would be jeopardize indeed if you dismiss what take place in they as ` familiar jargon ' the question be whether the charge have be so reasonably bring home to the prisoner as to lead you in you conscience to believe that he be guilty if so it be you duty to god you duty to society and you duty to yourselve to say so such be the sum up that be arraign by the humanitarian partisan of the prisoner if a judge may not deal with the fallacy of a defense by place before the jury the true trend of the evidence what other business have he on the bench and it be for thus clearly define the issue that some one suggest a petition for a reprieve on the ground that the evidence be _ purely circumstantial _ and that my sum up be against _ the weight of the evidence _ truly a strange thing that circumstance by themselves shall have no weight but there be another strange incident in this remarkable trial : _ the jury thank I for the pain i have take in the case _ i tell they i look for no thanks but be grateful nevertheless i have learn that the jury on retire deposit every one on a slip of paper the word guilty without any previous consultation -- a sufficient indication of they opinion of the _ weight _ of the evidence this be the last case of any importance which i try on circuit and if any trial could show the value of circumstantial evidence it be this one it leave the identity of the prisoner and the conclusion of fact demonstrable almost to mathematical certainty a suppose eye-witness might have say : i see he write the paper and i see he administer the poison it would not have add to the weight of the evidence the witness might have lie chapter xxxvi a night at nottingham ever since the establishment of itinerant justice now considerably over seven hundred year go circuit have be a interesting and important ceremony attend with great pomp and circumstance i have intend to give a sketch of my own drawing of this great function but a esteem friend who be a lover of the picturesque have send I a interesting description of one of my own itinerary and i insert it with the more pleasure because i could not describe thing from he point of view and even if i could might lay myself open to the charge of be egotistical when sir henry hawkin step into the train with he marshal he feel all the exuberance which a judge usually experience on go circuit go circuit be a pleasant diversion and may be a delightful holiday when the weather be fine and case few i be not speak of those northern town where hard labor be the portion of the judicial personage from the time he open the commission to the moment when he turn he back upon he prison-house but of rural assize town like warwick and bedford or oakham where the judge take he white glove smile at the grand jury

lincoln station on this present occasion there be a goodly crowd outside and in some well dress and some slatternly some barehead out of respect to the judge and other of necessity but all with a look of profoundest awe but as they wait the arrival of the train all heart be beat to see the judge alas for some of they they will see he too soon and too closely most conspicuous be the fat and dignified coachman in a powdered wig and tam-o ' - shanter cap and the footman with the important calf cluster along the platform and push they nose between the palisade fencing seem gather together all the little boy of lincoln -- that be to say those who do not live at the top of steep hill for on that sacred eminence the mount zion of lincolnshire be the _ cloister _ and the close where be situate the residence of canon archdeacon and other ecclesiastical divinity the top of this mountain hold no communion with the bottom on the platform -- for the signal have be give that the judicial train be enter the station -- range in due order be the sheriff of lincoln in full robe he chaplain in full canonical and a great many other worthy dignity which want of space prevent my mention in detail all be barehead all motionless save those bosom which heave with the excitement of the occasion although the chaplain and the sheriff hold they hat in they hand it be understand in a well-bred town like lincoln there will be no cheer only a deep respectful silence and so amid a hush of expectation and a wonder as to whether it be _ orkin _ some say one thing and some another the train draw slowly in a respectful porter select for the occasion open the door and out leap -- jack then burst from the crowd a general murmur ` there ' e be see ` im bill ' cry one ` there be orkin see ` im

between a irishman and a scotchman which make the english language quite a hotch-potch of equivocal word and a babel of sound the slander be one that seem to shake the very foundation of butcherdom throughout the world -- namely a insinuation that the plaintiff have sell australian mutton for scotch beef on the face of it a extraordinary allegation although it have to find its way for the interpretation of a jury as to its meaning amidst this costly international wrangle the judge keep he temper occasionally cheer the combatant by say in a interrogative tone yes and in the meanwhile write the follow on a slip of paper which he hand to a friend : -- great prize competition for patience hawkin first prize job honorable mention much earlier in the evening a application have be make

pleasant evening at the hall he discharge a good many other pun which i be glad to say i have forget but there be a man present who be a good story-teller some i have hear before but they be none the less welcome while one or two i relate be as good as new to my host and old squire fullerton who have once be high sheriff and be suppose to know all about circuit business he preface almost everything he say with when i be high sheriff so i ask he innocently enough how many time he have be high sheriff on which my host be a quick-witted man look at he with a broad grin while he balance the nutcracker on he forefinger well say fullerton it be in parke 's time yes but which of they i ask be you allude to sir alan they do not both come together surely now lookee fullerton say my old friend tap the mahogany with the nutcracker as though he be about to say something remarkably clever one of 'em jemmy have a kind of a cast in one of he eye -- do not he judge yes say i but they name be not spell alike no no cry the squire i be come to that one eye be a little troublesome at time i believe -- at least they say so in my time when _ i _ be high sheriff -- and that make he a little ill-tempered at time now that judge 's name be spell p-a-r-k-e -lrb- tap every letter with he nutcracker -rrb- so the bar use to call he ' _ parke with a e _ ' and what do you think they use to call the other whose name be park -- come now judge you can guess that i suppose i shake my head for he say why you tell I the story yourself four year ago -- ah it must be five year ago -- at this very table when old squire hawley have lay two thousand on jannette for the leger ` this be it ' say you ` they call one of they parke with a e and the other park with a i ' very well i say after they have do laugh at the way in which my host have catch I now i 'll tell you what the duke of wellington say one morning you recollect he grace meet with a accident and lose a eye which be keep in spirit of wine on ask he how he be the duke answer -- ` oh lord cairn ask I yesterday the same question and i say i be rather depressed but i believe my eye be in pretty good spirit ' chapter xxxviii the tilney street outrage -- be you not go to put on the black cap my lord one evening while sit with some friend in tilney street there be one of the most tremendous explosion ever hear it seem as if the world be blow up but as nothing happen we do not leave the room and go on with the conversation it be not until the next day it be ascertain that a attempt have be make to blow in reginald brett 's front door which be a few house off and that it have be perpetrate by some fenian whose friend have be award penal servitude for life for a similar outrage with dynamite why they anger be direct against mr reginald brett -- a most peaceful and excellent man -- it be difficult to say for he be very kind-hearted and above all the son of the master of the roll who never try prisoner at all only counsel have make inquiry the next morning -- i do not know of whom there be such a number of people in tilney street -- i be astonish to hear some one say they mean to pay _ you _ that visit sir henry then _ they knock at the wrong door _ say i the stranger seem to know I and i have a little further conversation with he it turn out he be a chancery barrister and a friend of brett 's why i ask do you think they mean the visit for I well he answer it be if it be intend for I i reply i can only say they be most ungrateful for i give they friend all i could yes -- penal servitude for life very well i add if they think they 'll frighten I by blow in reginald brett 's front door they be very much deceive lord esher i believe always consider that _ he _ be the object of this attack and as i have no wish to disturb so comforting a idea take no further notice and the fenian take no further notice of I year after however my name be mention in parliament in connection with this case nor be my severity call in question there be no more explosion in tilney street but a singular circumstance occur which place I in a position if i have desire it to deprive lord esher of the satisfaction of believe that he be the object of so much fenian attention but if it be a comfort to he or a source of pride i do not see why i should take it away a reverend father of the roman church tell I that a long while ago a man in confession make a statement which he wish the priest to communicate to I it be under the seal of confession and he refuse as he be bind to do to mention a word the man persist in ask he and he as persistently decline some considerable time however have elapse the same man go to the priest not to confess but to repeat he request in ordinary conversation this the father could have no objection to and the culprit tell he that he have undertake to throw the bomb at the front door of number 5 but that through have in the gas-light misread the figure he have place it against that of number 2 he beg the priest as a great favor to assure I on he word that the bomb be certainly intend for I and not for brett on this subject the _ kent leader _ have some interesting remark on the anarchist as well as they judge speaking of dynamite it say we have serious cause for alarm in we free land the wretch concern in the abominable outrage of Tuesday last can not be too severely deal with it be evident that they intent be against justice hawkin and the fact that sir henry be the preside judge at the recent anarchist ' trial point the connection between the outrage and other anarchist justice hawkin have be speak of as a harsh judge ever since the ` penge mystery ' trial many have term he the hang judge we have sit under he on many eventful occasion and venture the opinion that no one who have have equal opportunity would come to any other conclusion than that he be painstaking and careful to a degree and particularly in criminal case form one of the most conscientious judge on the bench hang judge why we have see the tear start to he eye when sentence a prisoner to death and owe to emotion only by a masterful effort could he voice be hear above all he be a just judge -lrb- many person be not aware and thousand be not at the present time that when a verdict of wilful murder be pronounce a judge have no alternative but to read the prescribed sentence of death if this be not so the situation would be almost intolerable for who would not avoid if possible decide that the irrevocable doom of the prisoner should be deliver in many case the feeling of the judge would interfere with the course of justice and murderer would receive more sympathy than they victim while fiend would escape to the danger of society and yet that judge have sympathy and that it can be and be in these day properly exercise the follow story will testify i give the story as lord brampton tell it -rrb- in a circuit town a poor woman be try before I for murder she baby the fact be so simple that they can be tell in a few word she baby be a week old and the poor woman unable to sustain the load of shame which oppress she run one night into a river hold the baby in she arm she have get into the water deep enough to drown the baby while she own life be save by a boatman the scene be sad enough as she stand under a lamp and look into the face of the policeman clutch she dead child to she breast and refuse to part with it at the trial there be no defense to the charge of wilful murder except _ one _ and that i feel it my duty to discountenance i think the deposition be hand to a young barrister by my order and that be so i exercise my discretion as to the mode of defense in other word i defend the prisoner myself in order to avoid the sentence that would have follow a acquittal _ on the ground of insanity _ which would have entail perhaps lifelong imprisonment i take upon myself to depart from the usual course and ask the jury whether _ without be insane in the ordinary sense the woman might not have be at the time of commit the deed in so excite a state as not to know what she be do _ i thus avoid the technical form of question sane or insane and obtain a verdict of guilty but that the woman at the time be not answerable for she conduct together with a strong recommendation to mercy this verdict if not accord to the strictest legal quibble be accord to justice i be about to pronounce sentence in accordance with the law which it be not possible for I to avoid however much my mind be incline to do so when the pompous old high sheriff all importance and dignity say -- my lord be you not go to put on the black cap no i answer i be not i do not intend the poor creature to be hang and i be not go to frighten she to death address she by name i say do not pay any attention to what i be go to read no harm will be do to you i be sure you do not know in you great trouble and sorrow what you be do and i will take care to represent you case so that nothing will harm you in the way of punishment i then mumble over the word of the sentence of death take care that the poor woman do not hear they -- much no doubt to the chagrin of the high sheriff and to the lowering of he high office and dignity nothing so enhance a sheriff 's dignity as the gallows -lrb- there be a great deal of unlooked-for appreciation of he merit and from quarter where have he be a hard judge one could never have expect it there be even the observation of the costermonger lean over he barrow near the assize court when one morning sir henry be go in with little jack gorblime jemmy see ` im the ole bloke 's be poachin ' agin see what he be get it be a brace of pheasant and not go into court with he gun but only he dog it be take for grant he have be out all night on a unlawful expedition some one once ask sir henry what be the most wonderful verdict he ever obtain he answer : it depend upon circumstance do you mean as to value and amount well then he say _ half a farthing _ some of the company be a little disconcerted i 'll tell you say the judge there be in we gracious majesty 's reign a coinage of _ half a farthing _ it be soon discountenance as useless but while it be current as coin of the realm i have the honor of obtain a verdict for that amount and need not say have it be pay in _ specie _ and preserve it would in value more than equal at the present time any verdict the jury might have give in that case -rrb- one of the most remarkable trial in which as a judge i have preside be what be know as the muswell hill tragedy it be a brutal commonplace affair and with its sordid detail might make a respectable society novel i should have like sherlock holme to have be in the case because he would have save I a great deal of sensational development as well as much anxiety and observation burglar be usually crafty and faithless to one another they never act alone -- that be the real professional -- and invariably while in danger of be convict betray one another such at all event be my experience each fear the treachery of he companion in guilt and endeavor to be first in disclose it in the case i be now speak of this experience be never more verify than in the attempt on the part of these two murderer each to shift the guilt on to the other the ruffian milsome and fowler resolve to commit a burglary in the house of a old man who lead a lonely life at the suburb know as muswell hill near hornsey the sole occupant of the cottage sleep in a bedroom on the first floor in he room be a iron safe in which he keep a considerable sum of money close by the side of he bed in the dead of night the two robber find they way into the kitchen which be below the bedroom they make however so much noise as to arouse the sleeper in the room above the old man rise and go down into the kitchen where he find the two prisoner prepare to search for whatever property they might carry away instantly they fall upon they victim throw he on to the floor and with a tablecloth which they find in the room and which they cut into strip for the purpose bind the poor old man hand and foot and strike he so violently about the head that he be kill on the spot where he be find the follow morning the prisoner fail to obtain the booty they be in search of and make off with some trifling plunder the only reward for a most cruel murder they escape for a time but be at last trace by a singular accident -- one of the prisoner have take a boy 's toy lamp on the night of the burglary from he mother 's cottage and leave it in the kitchen of the murder man the boy identify one of the prisoner as the man who have be at he mother 's and take the lamp the man be jointly charge with the murder before I each try to fix the guilt on the other know -- or at all event believe -- that he himself would escape the consequence of wilful murder if he succeed in hang he friend i know well enough that unless it could be prove that _ both _ be implicate in the murder or if it should be leave uncertain which be the man who actually commit it or that they both go to the place with the joint intention of perpetrate it if necessary for they object they might both avoid the gallows i therefore direct my attention closely to every circumstance in the case and after a considerable amount of evidence have be give without much result so far as implicate both prisoner in the actual murder be concern a accidental discovery reveal the whole of the fact of the tragedy as plainly as if i have see it committed i have say that the tablecover have be _ cut _ into strip to accomplish they purpose and it be clear that a penknife have be use for one be find on the floor suddenly my attention be call to the fact that _ two _ penknife which no one have hitherto notice be produce they belong not to the prisoner but to the deceased man and be usually place on the shelf in the kitchen but it come out in evidence quite as it seem accidentally that they have be take from that place and be find on the floor where the cut up of the tablecover have be perform at some little distance from one another but each knife _ by the side of and not far from the deceased man _ they be at my wish hand to I i also ask for some of the shred which have bind the dead man upon examination it seem that these be the knife that have be use to cut the tablecloth into shred and if so the jury might well assume that _ each _ prisoner have use one of the knife for that purpose for one man could not at the same time use two the tablecloth have jag or hack edge which satisfy the jury that the knife have be use hurriedly and that each man have be do he share of the cut it be thus clearly establish that both the man be engage in the murder and equally guilty and so the jury find by they verdict whilst they be consider the bigger of the two a very powerful man make a murderous attack upon the other whom he evidently look upon as he betrayer and try to kill he in the dock the struggle be a fearful one but the warder at last separated they they be both sentence to death and hang -lrb- the fact of these man make a noise in enter the house be strongly against they on a question of intent burglar work silently and at the least noise decamp as a rule in the present case there be only one old man to contend against it be easy to silence he as they do and as they doubtless intend when they go to the house -rrb- chapter xxxix several scene i think i have say that i have a favorite motto which be never fret it have often stand I in good stead and help I to obey it i be once put to it however on my way to open the commission at bangor on the welsh circuit the assizes be to commence on the follow day it be a very glorious afternoon and one to make you wish that no assize might ever be hold again i have engage to dine with the high sheriff who live three or four mile away from the town in a very beautiful part of the country so there be everything to make one glad except the assizes add to all this pleasurable excitement the chester cup be to be run for in the meanwhile and i have many old friend who i know would be there and whom i should have be glad to meet have it be possible the sheriff have make most elaborate calculation from he bradshaw and other source as to the time of departure and arrival by train i do not know what to do so arrange with the stationmaster at chester to shunt my carriage till the afternoon have no doubt i should be able to fulfil my engagement easily it so happen however that the racing arrangement of the railway have be completely disturb by the great crowd of visitor and the result be that i do not reach carnarvon at the proper time and my arrival in that place be delay for nearly a hour nevertheless i open the commission and the high sheriff ask I if i would allow he to go on to he house to receive he guest whom he have invite to meet I and permit the chaplain to escort I in the performance of my duty have dress in full uniform i get into the carriage with the chaplain who be quite a lively companion of a enterprising turn of mind and desirous of learn something of the world i could have teach he a good deal i have no doubt have i allow myself to be draw my friend have no great conversational power but be possess of a inquire mind after we have ride a little way to my great amusement he ask I if i have any favorite _ motto _ that i could tell he so that he might keep it in he memory yes say i i have a very good one and cheerfully say never fret this when i explain it to he especially with reference to my business arrangement seem to please he very much it be as good as say do not fret because you can not preach two sermon from two pulpit at the same time he ask if he might write it down in he pocket-book and i tell he by all means and hope he would excellent he murmur as he write it : never fret he then ask modestly if i could give he any other pithy say which would be worthy of remembrance yes say i think a little i recollect one very good thing which you will do well to remember : never say anything you think will be disagreeable to other person he express great admiration for this as it sound so original and be particularly adapt to the clergy oh say he that be in the real spirit of christianity be that so i ask as he write it down in he book and he seem to admire it exceedingly after he have write it even more than the other then he say he really do not like to trouble I but it be the first time he have have the honor of occupy the position of sheriff 's chaplain etc but might he trouble I for another motto or something that might go as a kind of companion to the other in he pocket-book this a little puzzle I but i feel that he take I now for a sage and that my reputation as such be at stake i have nothing in stock but wonder if it would be possible to make one for he while he wait yes say i with the greatest displeasure : never do anything which you feel will be disagreeable to yourself my lord he cry in the greatest glee that be by far the best of all that must go down in my book it be so practical and of everyday use i be of course equally delighted to afford so young a man so much instruction and think what a thing it be to be young however here be a opportunity not to be lose of show he how to put to the practical test of experience two at least if not all three of the little aphorism and i say so i should be delighted my lord to put you advice into practice at the earliest opportunity he answer that will be on Sunday say i at twelve o'clock do not preach a long sermon in due time we arrive at the sheriff 's house and there find all the guest assemble and wait to meet I i be quite quick enough to perceive at a glance that they have be plan some scheme to entrap I -- at all event to cause I embarrassment the lady be in it for they all smile and say as plainly by they look as possible we shall have you nicely judge depend upon it by-and-by the sheriff be the chief spokesman no sooner have we sit down to table than he address I in a most unaffected manner as if the question be quite in the ordinary course and have not be plan i answer it in the same spirit my lord could you kindly tell we which horse have win the cup evidently think that i have be to the course there be a dead silence at this crucial question -- a silence that you could feel be the result of a deep-laid conspiracy -- and all the lady smile fortunately i be not catch nor be i even take aback my presence of mind do not desert I in this my hour of need and i say in the most natural tone i could assume -- yes i be sure that would be the first question you would ask I when i have the pleasure of meeting this brilliant company as you know i must pass through chester station so i popped my head out of the window and ask the porter which horse have win he tell I the judge have win by a length chaplain be a good second and sheriff a bad third the squire take he defeat like a man i be remind during the evening of a singular case of bigamy -- a double bigamy -- that come before I at derby in which the simple story be that a unfortunate couple have get married twenty year before the time i speak of and that they have the good luck to find out they do not care for one another the week after they be marry it would have be luckier if they have find it out a week before instead of a week after but so it be and in the circumstance they do the wisest thing probably that they could they separate and never meet again until they meet in the dock before I -- a trysting-place not of they own choosing and more strange than a novelist would dream of but there they be and this be the story of they life : -- the man after the separation live for some time single then form a companionship and as he afterwards hear that he wife have get marry to some one else thought he would follow she example now if a judge punish immorality here be something to punish but the law leave that to the ecclesiastical or some other jurisdiction the judge have but to deal with the breach of the law and to punish in accordance with the requirement of the injury to society -- not even to the injury of the individual i make inquiry of the police and other as the prisoner have plead guilty and find that all the party -- the four person -- have be live respectable and hard-working life there be no fault whatever to be find with they conduct they be respect by all who know they i then ask how it be find out at last that these people live quietly and happily have be previously marry o my lord say a policeman there be a hinquest on a babby which be the female prisoner 's babby and what have die then it come out afore mr coroner my lord and he order the woman into custody and then the man be take i think they have have punishment enough for they offence and give they no imprisonment but order they to be release on they own recognizance and to come up for judgment if call upon now come _ my _ sentence the clergyman of the parish in which this terrible crime have be discover evidently feel that he have be live in the utmost danger for year here these people come to he church and for aught he know pray for forgiveness under the very roof where he himself worship he say i have do a fine thing to encourage sin and immorality and what could come of humanity if judge would not punish he denounce I i afterwards learn in he pulpit in the severest term although i do not hear that he use the same vituperative language towards the poor creature i have so far absolved luckily i be not attend the reverend gentleman 's ministration but he seem to think the greatest crime i have commit be disallow the cost of the prosecution that be a direct _ incentive to bigamy _ although in what respect i never learn it sometimes suggest to my mind this question -- what would this minister of the gospel have say to the divine master when the woman catch in the very act be before he and he say in word never to be forget till man and woman be no more neither do i condemn thee i think those who love a prosecution of this kind -- whoever it may have be -- _ ought _ to pay for the luxury and so i condemn _ they _ in the cost chapter xl dr lamson -lrb- a -rrb- -- a case of mistaken identity -- a will case -lrb- footnote a : in this and one or two other case i be pleased to acknowledge my thanks to my esteemed friend mr charle w mathew the distinguished advocate for refreshing my memory with the incident -rrb- one of the most diabolical case which come before I while a judge be one which although it occupy several day can be tell in the course of a few minute i mention it moreover not so much on account of its inhuman feature as the fact that in my opinion dr lamson lead the prosecutor -- that be the government solicitor -- into a theory which be calculate by that cunning murderer to save he from a conviction and it nearly do so the story be this : -- there be in the year 1873 a family of five child one of whom die that year and another in 1879 leave two daughter and a poor cripple boy of eighteen he be partially paralyzed and have a malformation of the spine so that he be a object of great commiseration he be of a kind and cheerful disposition and except he spinal affliction in good health he seem to have be love by everybody he playmate wheel he about in he chair so that he might enjoy they pastime and even carry he up and down stair one of this boy 's sister marry a mr chapman the other marry a man who be a doctor or pass as one of the name of lamson he be a man of idle habit luxurious taste and a wicked heart he be in debt have fraudulently draw cheque when he have nothing at the bank to meet they and be so reduce to poverty that he have pawn he watch and he case of surgical instrument by the death of the brother in 1879 the two sister receive each a sum of # 800 this boy percy receive the like amount and if he should live to come of age would have a further sum of # 3000 but if he die before that period one-half would go to mr chapman and the other half to mr lamson the doctor 's wife lamson have buy a medical practice at bournemouth in 1880 but very soon after writ and execution be issue against he for three year before percy 's death he have be at school at blenheim house wimbledon it appear from he statement while die that he feel just the same as i do once before when i be at shanklin with my brother-in-law the doctor after he have give I a quinine pill my throat be burn and my skin feel all draw up this pill however do not kill he but it show as subsequent event prove the murderous design of dr lamson on December 3 the boy be still at school and in good health be amusing himself with he schoolfellow when he brother-in-law the prisoner call percy be take into the room to see he well percy old boy say the doctor how fat you be look the doctor sit down and percy be seat near he the visitor then take out of a little bag a dundee cake and some sweet and cut a small slice of the cake with he penknife about fifteen minute afterwards he say to mr bedbury the master i do not forget you and you boy : these capsule will be nice for they to take nauseous medicine in and he take several box of capsule from the bag and place they on the table one box he push towards mr bedbury ask he to try they no one have see lamson take a capsule out of the box but he be see to fill one with sugar and give it to the boy say here percy you be a swell pill-taker within five minute after that the doctor excuse himself for go so soon say if he do not he would lose he train not long after he departure -- that be between eight and nine -- the boy be take ill and put into bed with all the violent symptom which be invariably produce by that most deadly of vegetable poison aconitine and he die at twenty minute past eleven the same night aconitine be find in the stomach aconitine have be purchase by the doctor before the boy 's death and be well and have be well the brother-in-law give he the last thing he swallow before the dreadful symptom of the poison betray its presence at that time no chemical test could be apply to aconitine any more than it could to strychnine in the time of palmer but its symptom be in the one case as well as in the other unmistakable and such as no other cause of illness would produce two pill be find in the boy 's play-box one of which be say to contain aconitine such be the simple case which occupy six day to try the jury be not long in come to a conclusion and return into court with a verdict of guilty my awful duty be soon conclude i tell the prisoner the law compel I to pass upon he the sentence of death but give he both by voice and manner to understand that in this world there could be no hope for such a criminal i say as i think it right to say that it be no part of my duty to admonish he as to how he be to meet the dread doom that await he but nevertheless i entreated he to seek for pardon of he great sin from the almighty it be my opinion and i believe that of the counsel for the defense that although so much stress be lay upon the _ capsule _ and the administration of the poison by that mean it be not so administer but that the capsule be a artifice design to hoodwink the doctor and treasury solicitor to have poison the boy in such a manner would have be a clumsy device for so keen and artful a criminal as lamson and i know it be convey in another manner it should be state that in lamson 's pocket-book be find memorandum as to the symptom and effect of aconitine and as to there be no test for its discovery lamson therefore have make the poisoning of this boy a careful and particular study he be not such a clumsy operator as to administer it in the way suggest the openness of that proceeding be to blind the eye of detective and lawyer alike the aconitine be convey to the lad 's stomach _ by means of a raisin in the piece of dundee cake which lamson cut with he penknife and hand to he _ he know of course the part of the cake where it be my attention be direct to the artifice employ by lamson by the shallowness of the stratagem and by the one circumstance that almost escape notice -- namely the dundee cake and the curious desire of the man to offer the boy a piece in so unusual a manner so eager be he to give he a taste that he must need cut it with he _ penknife _ i be sure and be sure now although there be no evidence but that which common sense act on circumstance suggest that the aconitine be convey to the decease by means of the piece of cake which lamson give he and be carefully place in the interior of the raisin would not operate until the skin have have time to digest and he the opportunity of get on he journey to pari whither he be bind that night to await no doubt the news of the boy 's illness and death if the poison have be convey in the capsule its operation would have be almost immediate and so would the detection of the aconitine as i have say the contrivance would have be too clumsy for so crafty a mind a detective would not expect to find the secret design so foolishly expose any more than a spectator would expect to see the actual trick of a conjurer in the manner of its performance i be not able to bring the artifice before the jury the crown have not discover it and lamson 's deep-laid scheme be nearly successful he plan of course be to lead the prosecution to maintain that he give the poison in the capsule and then to compel they to show that there be no evidence of it the jury be satisfy that the boy be poison by lamson and little troubled themselves about the way in which it be do a singular case of mistaken identity come under my notice during the trial of a serious charge of wound with intent to do grievous bodily harm _ five _ man be charge and the evidence show that a most brutal mutilation of a gamekeeper 's hand have be inflict the man be notorious poacher and be engage in a poach expedition when the crime be commit one of the accuse be a young man scarcely more than a youth but i have no doubt that he be the cleverest of the gang the man be convict but this young man vehemently protest he innocence and declare that he be not with the gang that night he manner impress I so much that i begin to doubt whether some mistake have not be make the injured keeper however whose honesty i have no reason to doubt declare that this youth be really the man who kneel on he breast and inflict the grievous injury to he hand by nearly sever the thumb he swear that he have every opportunity of see he while he be commit the deed as he face be close to he own and _ they eye meet _ moreover the young man 's cap be find _ close by the spot where the assault take place _ about this there be no dispute and could be no mistake for the prisoner confess that the cap be he add however that he _ have lend it on that night to one of the other prisoner _ the youth vehemently protest he innocence after the verdict be give so far as he be concerned i be _ not _ satisfied with the conviction be it possible i ask myself that there can have be a mistake i do not think that in the excitement of such a moment and during so fearful a struggle with he antagonist with they face _ so close together _ that they stare into each other 's eye there be such a opportunity of see the youth 's face as to make it clear beyond any doubt that he be the man who commit the crime the jury i think have judge too hastily from appearance -- a mistake always to be guard against i invite the prosecute counsel to come to my room and ask he be you satisfy with that verdict so far as the _ youngest prisoner _ be concerned yes he say the jury find he ` guilty ' and i think the evidence be enough to justify the verdict i _ do not _ i say and shall try he again on another indictment there be another involve the same evidence i consider the matter very carefully during the night and weigh every particle of evidence with every probability and the more i thought of it the more convinced i be that injustice have be do first of all to prevent the man who i be convince be rightly convict from entertain any doubt about the result of they conviction i sentence they to penal servitude i then undertake to watch the case on behalf of the young man myself and do not as i might have do assign he counsel the prisoner be put up for trial and the second inquiry commence it have strike I during the night that there be a point in the case which have be take for grant by the _ counsel on both side _ and that that point be _ the _ one on which the verdict have go wrong as i have say i do not doubt the honest belief of the keeper but i doubt and in fact disbelieve altogether in the power of any man to identify the face of another when they eye be close together as he have no ordinary but a distorted view of the feature in order to test my theory on this matter i take the real point in the case as it afterwards turn out to be it be this : _ five man _ be take _ for grant _ to have be in the gang and in the field on that occasion the difficulty be to prove that there be only _ four _ and then to show that the young man be not one of the four these two difficulty lay before I but i resolve to test they to the utmost of my ability the crown be against I and the treasury counsel i know pretty well where to begin -- which be a great point i think in advocacy -- and begin in the right place i must repeat that the prisoner boldly assert when the evidence be give as to the finding of he cap close to the spot where the outrage be commit that it _ be _ he cap but that he have not wear it on that night have lend it to one of the other man whom he then name this be to my mind a very important point in this second trial and i make a note of it to assist I at a later period of the case if this be true the strong corroboration of the keeper 's evidence of identity be go indeed it go a good deal further in its value than that for it may have be the finding of the prisoner 's cap that induce the belief that the man whose face he see be the prisoner 's i ask the accuse if he would like the other man call to prove he statement warn he at the same time that it be upon he own evidence that they have be arrest and point out the risk he run from they ill-will my lord say he they will owe I no ill-will and they will not deny what i say it be true i be one of 'em and i know they will not deny it without discard this evidence i let the case proceed i ask the policeman when he come into the witness-box if he examine carefully the footprint at the gate where the man enter he say he have and be _ quite positive _ that there be the footprint of _ four man only _ and further that these print correspond with the shoe of the four man who have be sentence and _ not _ with those of the prisoner it show how fatal it may be in judge counsel or jury to take anything for grant in a criminal charge it have be take for grant at the former trial that _ five _ man have enter the field and how the counsel for the defense could have do so i be at a loss to conceive it be further ascertain that the same number and the _ same footprint _ marked the step of those come _ out _ of the field it go even further for it be prove that _ no footprint of a fifth man be anywhere visible on any other part of the field _ although the most careful search have be make if this be establish as i think it be beyond all controversy it clearly prove that only _ four man _ be in the field when the injury be inflict but it might nevertheless be that the young man identify be one of the four whether he be or not be now the question at issue it be reduce to that one point to disprove this the prisoner say he would like the man to be call i caution he again as to the danger of the course he propose feel that he be pretty safe as it be in the hand of the jury they could hardly convict under my ruling in the circumstance no my lord he say i be _ sure they will speak the truth about it _ they will not swear falsely against I to save themselves the man who be allege to have borrow the cap be then bring up and i ask he if it be true that he wear the prisoner 's cap on the night of the outrage he say it be true my lord i borrow it then be you the man who inflict the injury on the keeper he answer be unhappily my lord i be and i be heartily sorry for it when ask be this young man with you that night no my lord be the answer the jury at once say they would not trouble I to sum up the case they be perfectly satisfy that the prisoner be not guilty and that what he say be true -- that he be not in the field that night they accordingly acquit he to my perfect satisfaction of course i instantly write to the home secretary mr h matthew -lrb- now viscount llandaff -rrb- who at once procure a free pardon on the former conviction and the prisoner be restore to liberty this case strikingly point to the imperative demand of justice that every case shall be investigate in its minutest detail the broad feature be not by any means sufficient to fix guilt on any one accuse and it be in such case that circumstantial evidence be often bring in question while indeed the _ real _ circumstance be too often not bring to light circumstantial evidence can seldom fail if the real circumstance be bring out nobody have think of raise a doubt as to there be _ five _ person in the field upon such small point the great issue of a case often depend another curious case come before I on the western circuit a solicitor be charge with forge the will of a lady which devise to he a considerable amount of she property but as the case proceed it become clear to I that the will be sign after the lady 's death and then with a dry pen hold in the hand of the decease by the accuse himself whilst he guide it over a signature which he have craftily forge a woman be present when this be do and as she have attest the execution of the will she be a necessary witness for the prisoner and in examination-in-chief she be very clear indeed that it be by the _ hand of the deceased _ that the will be sign and that she herself have see the deceased sign it suspicion only exist as to what the real fact be until this woman go into the box and then a scene highly dramatic occur in the course of she cross-examination by mr charle mathew who hold the brief for the prosecution the woman positively swear that she see the testatrix sign the will _ with she own hand _ and no amount of the rough-and-ready inartistic and disingenuous will you swear this and be you prepare to swear that would have be of any avail she _ have _ swear it and be prepare to swear it in she own way any number of time that any counsel might desire the only mode of deal with she be adopt she be ask -- where be the will sign on the bed be any one near yes the prisoner how near quite close so that he could hand the ink if necessary oh yes and the pen oh yes _ do he hand the pen _ he do _ and the ink _ yes there be no one else to do so except you no do he put the pen into she hand yes and assist she while she sign the will yes how do he assist she _ by raise she in the bed and support she when he have raise she _ do he guide she hand no do he touch she hand at all _ i think he do just touch she hand _ when he do touch she hand _ be she dead _ at this last question the woman turn terribly pale be see to falter and fall in a swoon on the ground and so _ reveal the truth _ which she have come to _ deny _ chapter xli mrjl toole on the bench sir henry hawkin be sit at derby assizes in the criminal court which as usual in country town be crowd so that you could scarcely breathe while the air you have to breathe be like that of a pestilence there be however a little space leave behind the dock which admit of the passage of one man at a time window and door be all securely close so as to prevent draught for nothing be so bad as draught when you be hot and nothing make you so hot as be stive by hundred in a narrow space without draught he happen to look up into the face of this shine but by no means brilliant assembly when what should he observe peeping over the shoulder of two buxom factory woman with blue kerchief but the _ head of jl toole _ at least it look like mr toole 's head but how it come there it be impossible to say it be a delight anywhere but it seem now out of place the marshal ask the sheriff be not that toole the answer be it look like he we know he be in the town and that there be to be a bespeak night when she majesty 's judge and the midland circuit would honor etc derby be not behind other town in this respect presently the judge 's eye go in the direction of the object which excite so much curiosity and like every one else he be interested in the appearance of the great comedian although at that moment he be not act a part but endure a situation in the afternoon the actor be on the bench sit next to the marshal and assume a air of great gravity which would have become a judge of the greatest dignity there be never the faintest suggestion of a smile he look indeed like byron 's description of the corsair : -- and where he frown of hatred darkly fall hope withering flee and mercy sigh farewell a turkey-cock in a pulpit could not have seem more to dominate the proceedings one very annoying circumstance occur at this assize it be the crack sometimes almost banging of the _ seat _ and wainscote which have be remake of oak every now and again there be a loud squeak and then a noise like the crack of walnut to a sensitive mind it must have be a try situation as toole afterwards say when you be try prisoner meanwhile sir henry pursue the even tenor of he way speak little as be he wont and think much about the case before he of a very trumpery character unless you measure it by the game law but no one less like to be disturb by noise of any kind than sir henry when at work even the rustling of a newspaper would cause he to direct the reader to study in some other part of the building suddenly there be a squeak of another kind distinguishable from all other -- it be the squeak of _ Sunday boot _ in the country no boot be consider Sunday boot unless they squeak at all event that be the case in derbyshire at the time i write of the noise proceed from a heavy farmer a juror-in-waiting who be allow to cross from one side of the court to the other for change of air he endeavor to suppress the noise of he boot only seem to cause they the greater irritation there be a universal titter as the crowd look up to see what line the judge would take sir henry reprove quietly and just as the farmer who be prance like a elephant have get well in front of the bench he say -- if that gentleman desire to perambulate this court he have better take off he boot the gravity of the situation be disturbed but that of the farmer remain unhappily for he for with one foot plant firmly on the ground and the other poise between heaven and earth he be afraid to let it come down and there he stand we will wait say the judge until that gentleman have get to the door which lead into the street the juryman toole tell we afterwards be delighted for he escape for the whole assize although there be much laughter toole know he position and dignity too well to join in it but he do what any respectable citizen would be expect to do in the circumstance -- try to suppress it yet make such face in the attempt that the whole house come down in volley but now he be resolve to set matter right and prevent any further repetition of unseemly conduct the way he do so be worthy of note he take a pen dip it in the ink and then spread he elbow out as one in great authority and duly impressed with the dignity of the situation write these word on a sheet of paper which have the royal arm in the center he tongue meanwhile seem to imitate the motion of he pen : i have have my eye on you for a long time past and if i see you laugh again i will send you to prison be warn in time just hand that say he give it to a javelin-man to the gentleman there in the _ green blouse _ and red hair the paper be stick into the slit of the taper fishing-rod-like instrument and place under the nose of the man who have be laugh it be some time before he could believe he eye but a thrust or two of the stick act like a pair of spectacles and convinced he it be intend for he perusal the effect be instantaneous and he hand the document to he wife it be interesting to watch the face of toole suffuse with good-humour and yet preserve its elastic dignity in contrast with that of the farmer which be almost white with terror as they interchange furtive glance for the next half-hour however it all end happily for the man never laugh again toole be invite to dine at the judge 's dinner but be himself on circuit and not at liberty till _ eleven _ when he take supper a invitation to look in be accept instead if it be not too late after supper he accordingly go for he look in and arrive at half-past eleven be in time for dinner which do not take place till half-past twelve the court have adjourn at 1215 however we spend a very pleasant evening toole tell the story of he go to see hawkin in the tichborne trial related elsewhere and sir henry that of the queen refusing once upon a time to accept a box at drury lane theater while et smith be lessee which make smith so angry that he could hardly bring himself to propose she majesty 's health at a dinner that same evening at drury lane nothing but he loyalty prevent he resent it in a suitable and dignified manner when one sovereign be affront by another the only thing be to consider they respective _ commercial _ value for that as a rule be the test of all thing in a commercial world but the sequel be that et say _ although I and she majesty have have a little difference i think on the whole i may propose the queen _ fool be he who neglect he sovereign and get in exchange sovereign contempt such be toole 's observation it be at this little entertainment that sir henry tell the story of the banker 's clerk and the bad boy -- a true story he say although it may be without a moral the best story say toole like the best people have no moral -- at least none to make a song about -- any more than the best dog have the longest tail a gentleman who be a customer at a certain bank be ask by a bank clerk whether a particular cheque bear he signature the gentleman look at it and say that be all right all right say the bank clerk be that really you signature sir certainly say the gentleman quite sure sir as sure as i be of my own existence the clerk look puzzle and somewhat disconcerted so sure be he that the signature be false how can i be deceive in my own handwriting ask the suppose drawer of the cheque well say the clerk you will excuse I i hope but i have _ refuse to pay on that signature _ because i do not believe it be yours _ pay _ say the customer for heaven 's sake do not dishonor my signature i will never do that be the answer but will you look through you papers counterfoil bank-book and account and see if you can trace this cheque the customer look through he account and find no trace of it or the amount for which it be give at last on examine the _ number _ of the cheque he be convince that the signature could not be he _ because he have never have a cheque-book with that number in it _ at the same time he astonishment be great that the clerk should know he handwriting better than he know it himself i will tell you say the clerk how i discover the forgery a boy present this cheque purport to have be sign by you i cash it he come again with another i cash that a little while afterwards he come again my suspicion be then arouse not by anything in the signature or the cheque but by the circumstance of the _ frequency of he come _ when he come the third time however i suspend payment until i see you because the _ line under you signature with which you always finish be not at the same angle _ it go a trifle nearer the letter and i at once conclude it be a forgery and so it turn out to be that boy say toole deserve to be take up by some one for he have great talent and in speaking of this matter say sir henry i may tell you that banker ' clerk be the very best that ever could be invent as test for handwriting they intelligence and accuracy be perfectly astonishing they hardly ever make a mistake and be seldom deceive the expert in handwriting be clever enough and mean to be true but every _ expert _ in a case be he doctor caligrapher or phrenologist have some unknown quantity of bias and must almost of necessity if he be on the one side or the other exercise it however unintentional it may be the banker speak _ without this influence _ and therefore if not more likely to be correct be more reasonably suppose to be so do you remember sir henry ask toole what the clever rogue orton write in he pocket-book ` some have money no brain some have brain no money they as have money no brain be make for they as have brain no money ' just like roger say sir henry this be a catch-phrase in society at the time of the trial some one recite from a number of _ hood 's comic annual _ the follow poem by tom hood : -- a bird of another feather -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : these line appear about 1874 and i have to make acknowledgment to those whom i have be unable to ask for permission to reproduce and trust they will accept both my apology and thanks -rrb- yestreen when i retire to bed i have a funny dream imagination backward speed up history 's ancient stream a falconer in fullest dress be teach I he art of tercel eya hood and jess the term i learn by heart he fly he falcon to attack the osprey swan and hern and show I when he wish it back the lure for its return i think it be a noble sport i struggle to excel my gentle teacher and in short i manage rather well the dream be o'er and i to-day return to modern time but yet i have something more to say if you will list my rhyme i have be a witness in a case for seven long mortal hour and cross-examine have to face the counsel 's keenest power with courteous phrase and win smile he lead I gently on i fall a victim to he wiles -- but how he change anon ` oh you be prepare to swear to that ' and ` now sir just take care ' and ` come be cautious what you be at ' with question hard to bear and when he would turn I inside out he turn I outside in i know not what i be about -- my brain be all a-spin i be shake now with nervous fright and since i leave the court i have change my dream-opinion quite -- i do not think hawkin sport before conclude the evening toole say -- you remember you joke sir henry about miss brain and she black kid not for the world not for the world my dear toole not for the world sir henry not for the world only for we not before the boy you say it be the best joke you ever make and the worst but i be not a judge then -rrb- chapter xlii a full member of the jockey club i know a great many man connect with the turf from the highest to the

setting at lord falmouth 's my old and esteemed friend i have spend many jovial and happy hour he be one of the most amiable of host and of a boundless hospitality run many distinguished horse and win many big race i use to drive with he to see he horse at exercise before breakfast and in he company visit some of the most celebrated man of the day who be also amongst the most distinguish of the turf amongst these be prince b -- whose fate be the saddest of all my reminiscence of the turf i almost witness he death for it take place nearly at the moment of my take leave of he at the jockey club there be a flight of stair from where i stand with he lead down to the luncheon-room and there he appear to have slip and fall i do not know that it be in consequence of this accident or whether it have anything to do with it but i seem after this sad event to have practically break my connection with the turf and yet perhaps i be more intimately attach to it than ever for lord rosebery ask I -lrb- i be a honorary member of the jockey club -rrb- whether there be any reason so far as my judicial position be concerned why i should not be elect a _ full member _ i say there be none so he lordship propose I and i be elect the only privilege i acquire by full membership be that i have to pay ten guinea a year subscription instead of nothing i almost regularly have the honor of be invite with other member of the club to the entertainment give by hrh the prince of wale on the derby night -- a festivity continue since he majesty 's accession to the throne nor shall i forget the several occasion on which i have have the honor to be the guest of he gracious majesty at sandringham and i mention they here to record my respectful gratitude for the kindness and hospitality of they majesty the king and queen whenever it have be my good fortune to be invite speak however of race man i have always think that the passion for gambling be one of the strongest propensity of we nature and once the mind be give to it there be no restraint possible either from law or pulpit its fascination never slacken and time never blunt the keen desire of self-gratification which it engender while the grip with which it fasten upon we be as fast in old age as in youth it will absorb all other pleasure and pastime i will give a instance of what i mean there be a well-known bookmaker of my acquaintance whose whole mind be devote to this passion he lifetime be a gamble everything seem to be create to make a bet upon do what he would go where he would he thought be upon horse-racing i be stay with charley carew the owner and occupier of beddington park with a small party of guest invite for shoot one morning there be to be a rabbit-killing expedition and after a pretty good morning 's walk i have a rest and then leisurely go along towards the trysting-place for lunch it be a large oak tree and as i come up there be hodgman the bookie who do not see I walk round the rabbit which lay in row count they and mutter _ two -- four -- twenty _ and so on up to a hundred he then pause and after a while soliloquize ah fancy a hundred one hundred _ dead un _ what would i give for such a lot for the chester cup he mind be not with the rabbit except in connection with he betting-book on the chester cup he be by no means singular except in the manner of show he propensity the devotee of bridge be all hodgman in they way at the bencher ' table i be speak of clarkson in reference to the old bailey he have be with I in consultation in a very bad case we have not the ghost of a chance of win it and indicate we opinion to that effect to the unhappy client he turn from we with a sad look as if desperation have seize he and then with tear in he eye ask clarkson if he think it advisable for he to _ surrender _ and take he trial my good man say clarkson it be my duty as a loyal subject to advise you to surrender and take you trial _ but if i be in you shoe _ i 'll be damned if i would the man however for some reason or other _ do _ surrender like a good citizen and the man who do not appear be he own leading counsel clarkson he never even look in and the conduct of the case therefore devolve on I i do my best for he however and succeed the man be acquit not content with this piece of good fortune for such indeed it be he be ill-advised enough to bring a action for _ malicious prosecution _ lord denman try it and tell he it be a most impudent action and he be astonish that he be not convict during this conversation another of no little importance take place and lord westbury be report to have say -- i do not assert that the house of lord have abolish hell with cost although i have no doubt that the large majority would gladly assent to any such decree -- all in fact except the bishop as i never listen to after-dinner theology i forbear comment on this subject but before this time there have be a curious action bring by a churchwarden against he vicar for refuse to administer the sacrament to he on the ground that he do not believe in the personality of the devil after the decision in the court below it be finally determine by the house of lord that the vicar be wrong hence it be that westbury be report to have say that the house of lord have abolish hell with cost what i do say say westbury be that the poor churchwarden who do not at one time believe in the personality of the devil return to the true orthodox christian faith when he receive he attorney 's bill turn to I he lordship say -- my dear hawkin you shall write you reminiscence and what be more they shall be print in good type and what be more the first copy shall be direct to I and so it should be if i only know he address chapter xliii the little mouse and the prisoner i come now to a small event which occur during my judgeship and which i call my little mouse story i be preside at the old bailey session and a case come before I of a prisoner who be undergo a term of two year ' imprisonment with hard labor for some offence against the post office the charge against he on the present occasion be attempt to murder or do grievous bodily harm to a prison warder this officer be on duty in the prisoner 's cell when the assault take place the fact rely on by the crown be simple enough the warder have go into the cell to take the man 's dinner when suddenly the prisoner seize the knife bring for he use and make a rush at the warder with it in he hand at the same time utter threat and imprecation believe he life to be in danger the warder run to the door and get outside into the adjoining corridor pull the cell door to after he and close it he have no sooner escape than the prisoner strike a violent blow in the direction the warder have go but the door be close it fall harmlessly enough it leave such a mark however that no doubt could be entertain as to the violence with which it be deliver and the probable result have it reach the warder himself thus present the case look serious mr montagu william who be counsel for the crown feel it to be as it undoubtedly be he duty in common fairness to present not only the bare fact necessary for he own case but also those which might be rely upon by the prisoner as he defense or at all event in mitigation of punishment in perform this duty he elicit from he witness a very touching little history of the origin and cause of the crime it be this : -- a poor little mouse have somehow or other manage to get inside the prisoner 's cell and one day while the unhappy man be eat he prison fare he see the mouse run timidly along the floor at last it come to a few crumb of bread which the prisoner have purposely spread and run away with one of they into its hiding-place the next day it come again and find more crumb and so on from day to day the prisoner relieve the irksomeness and the weary solitude of he confinement by tempting it to trust he and become he one companion and friend till at last it become so tame that it form a little nest and make its home in the sleeve of the prisoner 's jail clothes during the long hour of the dreary day it be he companion and pet play with he feed with he and mitigate he solitude it even sleep with he at night all this be of course against the prison rule but the mouse have no reason to obey they one unhappy day a warder come into the cell when the poor mouse peep out from he tiny hiding-place and the officer i presume as a matter of duty seize the little intruder on the spot and capture it god help the world if every one do he strict duty in it but -- what to the prisoner seem inexcusable barbarity -- he kill the poor little mouse in the sight of the unhappy man whose friend and companion it have be this infuriate he to such a extent that have the dinner-knife in he hand -- the knife which would have assist at the mouse 's banquet as well as he own -- he rush at the warder who fortunately escape through the open door of the cell the prisoner strike the knife into the door in the result the prisoner be indict on the charge of attempt to murder the warder the defense be that as murder in the circumstance be impossible _ the attempt could not be establish _ and on the authority of a case -lrb- which have however since be overrule -rrb- i feel bind to direct a acquittal and i confess _ i be not sorry _ to come to that conclusion for it would have be a sad thing have the prisoner be convict of a offence commit in a moment of such great and not unnatural excitement and one for which penal servitude must have be award the poor fellow have suffer enough without additional punishment i can conceive nothing more keen than the torture of return to he cell to grieve for the little friend which could never come to he again chapter xliv the last of lord campbell -- wine and water -- sir thoma wilde life alas must have its sad story as well as its mirthful i have tell few of the former not because they have not be present to my mind but because i think it useless to perpetuate they by narration but for its occasional gleam of humor life would indeed be dull and ever eclipse by the shadow of sorrow one of the story the chief baron tell I be as indelibly fix on my memory as it be on he lord campbell have be so long and so prominently before the country that he death would be a theme of conversation in the world of literature science law and fashion but it be not he death that impressed I it be the incident that immediately attend it he lordship -- thus be the event related -- have be entertain a party at dinner and amongst they be he brother-in-law colonel scarlett in its incident the dinner have be as lively and agreeable as those event in social and refined life usually be scarlett have a important engagement with campbell in the city on the follow Monday this be Saturday night as he rise to go scarlett wish he host good-night with a hearty shake-hand ` good-night -- good-night we shall meet again on Monday ' alas campbell die that night suddenly and by a singular interposition of providence scarlett die suddenly the next day Sunday they meet no more in this world \* \* \* \* \* in the course of my life i have suffer like many other from nameless affliction -- nameless because they do not exist no one can localize this strange infirmity or realize it you only know you have a sensation of depression in every other respect i be perfectly well yet i think it be necessary to see a doctor so it be if i wish to be ill be in this unhappy condition i consult sir jame paget then in the zenith of he fame it do not take he very long to test I i think he do it with a smile for i feel a good deal better after it just tell I say he do you ever drink any water now it be come i think he be go to knock I off my wine i think however i would be equal to the occasion and say -- i know what you be drive at : you want to know if i ever mix a little water in my wine no no i do not say he you be quite wrong for if you water be good and you wine bad you spoil you water and if you wine be good and you water bad you spoil you wine i take he advice -- which be certainly worth the fee -- and never mixed my wine with water after that although i have some doubt as to whether i have ever do so before i come away in good heart because i be so delighted that there be not a vestige of anything the matter with I with a view to enable I to give each case due consideration before fix the poor wretch 's doom after conviction i invariably order the prisoner to stand down until all be try i then spend a night in go through my note in each case so that if there be any circumstance that i could lay hold of by way of mitigation of the sentence i do so i do not mean to say that i do this in trifling case such as a magistrate could dispose of but in all case of magnitude possibly involve penal servitude once however i have make up my mind as to what be in accordance with my judgment the sentence to be pass i take care never to alter it upon any plea in mitigation whatever for this line of conduct i have the example of sir thoma wilde when as lord chief justice of the court of common plea he travel the home circuit he be a marvellous and powerful judge in deal with the fact of a case he have try a prisoner for larceny in steal from a house a sack of pea the prisoner 's counsel have make for he a very poor and absurd defense in which over and over again he have reiterate that one pea be very like another pea and that he would be a bold man who would swear to the identity of two pea this miserable defense make the lord chief justice angry and he sum up the case tersely but crushingly to this effect : gentleman you have be tell by the learn counsel very truly that one pea be very like another pea and if the only evidence in this case have be that one pea have be take from the house of the prosecutor and a similar pea have be find in the prisoner house i for one should have say it would have be insufficient evidence to justify the accusation that the prisoner have take it but such be _ not _ the fact of this case and when you find as be the fact here that on march 30 a sack appear in a particular place mark with the prosecutor 's initial safe in he house at night where it ought to have be but be not on the morning of the 31st and when you find that on that morning a sack of pea of precisely similar character be in the house of the prisoner in a precisely similar sack behind the door the question very naturally arise _ how come _ those pea in that man 's house he say he find they do you believe he do it ever occur to you gentleman to find a similar sack of pea in the dead of the night on any road on which you chance to be travel the prosecutor say the prisoner steal they and that be the question i ask you to answer do he or not in you opinion steal they i need not say what the verdict be the man be _ put back for sentence _ that be the point i be upon on the follow morning the lord chief justice still a bit angry with the prisoner 's counsel for the miserable imposture he have attempt upon the jury say -- god forbid prisoner at the bar that the defense attempt by you counsel yesterday should aggravate the punishment which i be about to inflict upon you and with a view to dispel from my mind all that be then urge on you behalf i have take the night to consider what sentence i ought to pronounce have say thus much about the speech for the defense he give a very moderate sentence of two or three month ' imprisonment every sentence that this chief justice pass have be well think out and consider and be the result of anxious deliberation -- that be to say in the serious case that demand it of course i do not claim for my adopt system a infallibility which belong to no human device but only that during some year by patiently follow it i be enable the better to determine how i could combine justice with leniency chapter xlv how i cross-examine prince loui napoleon i have be often question in a indirect manner as to the amount of my income and the number of my briefs i do not mean by the income tax commissioner but by private authority i be often _ tell _ how much i must be make sometimes it be say oh the associate ' office verdict book show this and that why hawkin you must be make thirty thousand a year if you be make a penny what a hard-working man you be how _ do _ you manage to get through it well i have no answer it be a curious inquisitiveness which it would do no one any good to gratify i do not think it necessary to the happiness of my friend that they should know and if it would afford _ I _ any satisfaction it be far better that they should name the amount than i they could exaggerate it i have no wish to do so it be true enough in common language i work hard but work by system make it easy slovenly work be always hard work you never get through it satisfactorily it be by work easily that i get through so much never fret and _ toujor pret _ be my motto as i tell the chaplain i hope he remember they to this day if they would not help he to a bishopric nothing would but i will say seriously that nothing be so great a help in we daily struggle as _ good temper _ and with that observation i leave my friend still to wonder how i get through so much judge often talk over they experience at the bar sometimes i talk of mine and on one occasion tell the follow curious incident in my long career i mention this circumstance as a curiosity only so far as the incident be concerned but as more than a curiosity so far as the legality of evade the substance of the law by a technicality be concern all man be not privileged to cross-examine royalty and especially future emperor on July 1 1847 which be not very long after my call to the bar prince loui napoleon who afterwards become emperor of the french be reside in england of course in look back upon a man who afterwards become a emperor the proportion seem to have alter and he look greater than he figure actually be he be more important in one 's eye and therefore from this point of view the event seem to be of greater magnitude than the mere police-court business that it be when a man become great the smallest detail of he career increase in value and importance the prince have give a man of the name of charle pollard into custody for steal and obtain by fraud two bill of exchange for # 1000 each i be instruct by one saul -lrb- not of tarsus -rrb- to defend and old saul think it would be judicious to cross-examine the prince into a cocked hat little dream what kind of a cocked hat we opponent would one day wear but saul not content with this ordinary drum-beating kind of old bailey performance in which there be much more alarm than harm instruct I to make a few inquiry as to the prince 's private life and so _ show he up _ in public saul love that kind of persecution to he the witness-box be a pillory notwithstanding there be more mud attach to the thrower than to the mere object of they attention young as i be in my profession i have sense enough to know that to dip into a prosecutor 's private history and the history of he father and grandfather and a succession of grandmother and aunt be hardly the way to show that the prisoner have not steal that gentleman 's property but be a good way to prevent the prince from recommend he to mercy i therefore in my simplicity ask old saul what the uncle of the prince and he voyage in the _ bellerophon _ etc have to do with this man 's steal these two bill of exchange never mind mr hawkin you do it it have a great deal to do with it however i make up my own mind as to the course i should pursue and have carefully read my instruction find that the man have be unjustly accuse by this napoleon -- there never be a man so trample on -- and every word of the whole accusation be false _ so _ do some solicitor instruct young counsel in those day i start my business of cross-examination accordingly with a few tentative question test whether the ice would bear before i take the other foot off dry land it do not seem to be very strong i think some of they be a little bewildering perhaps but that doubtless be they only fault which the prince be desirous of amend and he graciously appeal to I in a very sensible manner by suggest that if i would put a question that he _ could _ answer he would do so i think it a fair offer even from a prince if i could only trust he i keep my bargain and definitely shaped my examination so that yes and no should be all that would be necessary we get on very well indeed for some little time he answer come with great readiness and truth he be perfectly straightforward and so be i yes sir no sir that be all as i have say at this time i have not have much experience in cross-examination but i have some intuitive knowledge of the art wait to be develop napoleon give I my first lesson in that department i be afraid sir say he highness you have be sadly misinstruct in this case i be afraid sir i have say i one or the other of we must be wrong and i be much inclined to think it be my solicitor it be a nice little bull which the prince like apparently for he laugh good-humouredly and especially when i find as i quickly do that my strength be to sit still which i also do i have learn by this exhibition of force that there _ be _ a defense if i could only keep it up my sleeve to expose it before the magistrate would simply enable clarkson who be oppose to I to bring up reinforcement and knock I into a cocked hat instead of napoleon old saul know nothing whatever about my intended maneuver nor do clarkson or he solicitor i know the man would be commit for trial the magistrate have intimate as much i therefore say nothing except that i would reserve my defense have i say a word clarkson would have shape he indictment to meet the objection which i intend to make the man however be commit to the old bailey in total ignorance of what defense be to be make the case be try before baron alderson as shrewd a judge perhaps as ever adorn the bench when i take my point he at once see the difficulty napoleon be in -- a difficulty from which no napoleon could escape even by a _ coup d'tat _ it be in fact this -- simple as a b c : -- when the bill of exchange be receive by pollard although he intend to defraud they be _ neither draw nor accept _ and so be not bill of exchange at all another process be necessary before they could become so even in appearance and that be forgery moreover there be include in this point another objection -- namely that the _ stamp _ sign by the prince have be hand to he with the intention that they _ should be subsequently fill up _ they be not _ valuable security _ -lrb- for steal which the ill-used pollard be indict -rrb- at the time they be appropriate and could not therefore be so treat in short the legal truth be that pollard neither steal nor obtain either _ bill of exchange _ -lrb- for such they be not at that time -rrb- or valuable security such be the law i believe napoleon say the devil must have make it or work it into that tam shape there be many technicality in the law of those day and justice be often defeat by legal quibble but the law be so severe in its punishment that justice herself often connive at its evasion at the present day there be a gradual tendency to make punishment more lenient and more certain -- to remove the entanglement of the pleader and render progress towards substantial instead of technical justice more sure and speedy napoleon 's defeat could not have occur at the present day -- not at all event in that tam shape in a case in which the member of st ive be petition against on the ground of treat before lush j i be oppose by russell -lrb- afterwards lord chief justice and lord russell of killowen -rrb- al smith be my junior and i need not say he know almost everything there be to be know about election law there be however no law in the case no specific act of treat be prove but we feel that general treat have take place in such a wholesale manner that we client be affect by it so we consent to he lose he seat -- that be to say that the election should be declare _ void _ -- merely void as the other side do not seem to be aware that this void could be fill by the member who be unseated they do not ask that we client should not be permit to put up for the vacancy although this be the real object of my opponent 's petition he want the seat for himself but know that he have not the remotest chance against he unseated opponent he surprise therefore must have be as great as he chagrin when the very night of the decision which unseated he he come forward once more as a candidate the petition have increase he popularity and he win the seat with the greatest ease and without any subsequent disturbance by the former petitioner i have tell you of a curious trial before a recorder of saffron walden and my memory of that event remind I of another which take place in that same abode of learning and justice joseph brown qc and thoma chamber qc be brother bencher of mine and when we meet at the parliament chamber after dinner it be more than likely that many story would be tell for we often fight we battle over again at the time i speak of knox be the recorder of that important borough and be possess of all the dignity which so enhance a great officer in the eye of the public whether he be the most modest of beadle in beadledom or the highest recorder in christendom to give himself a greater air of importance knox always carry a _ blue umbrella _ of a most blaze grandeur he be look up to of course at saffron walden as they greatest man especially as he occupy the best apartment at the chief brimstone shop in the town when i say _ brimstone _ i mean that it seem to be its leading article for there be a great many yellow placard all over and about the emporium which perhaps ought to have be call a general shop there be three man up before knox for steal malt a very serious offence indeed in saffron walden where malt be almost regard as a sacred object -- until it get into the beer tom chamber -lrb- afterwards recorder of london -rrb- be defend these prisoner and i have no doubt from the conduct of knox acquire a great deal of that discrimination of character which afterwards so distinguished he in the city of london the degree of guilt in these person ought to be note by all person who hold or hope to hold a judicial position as to the first man the actual thief there could be no doubt about he crime for he be actually wheeling the two or three shovelful of malt in a barrow so there be not much use in defend he about the second man there be not the same degree of certainty for he have never touch the malt or the barrow and there be no evidence that he know the first man have steal it the only suspicion -- for it be nothing more -- against he be that he be see to be walk _ along the highway _ near the man who be wheeling the barrow and as it be daytime many other be equally guilty the third man be still less implicate for all that appear against he be that _ at some time or other _ he have be see either on the day of the theft or just before to be in a public-house with the thief and ask he to have a drink if it have not be at saffron walden where they be so jealous of they malt and such admirer of they maltster there would have be no case against any one but the actual thief and if the recorder have know the law as well as he know saffron walden or half as much as saffron walden admire he he would have rule to that effect however he point out to the jury the case one by one with great care and no stint of language against the first say he the case be clear enough : he be catch with the steal goods in he possession in the second case _ perhaps _ it be not quite so strong you will think but it be for _ you _ gentleman not for _ I _ to judge you will not forget gentleman he be walk along by the side of the actual thief and it be for you to say what that mean then after clear he throat for a final effort he say -- now we come to the third man where be he i must say there be a slight difference between he case and that of the other two man who might be say to have be catch in the very act but it be for _ you _ gentleman not for _ I _ it be difficult to point out item by item as it be the difference between the three case but you will say gentleman whether they be not all mix up in this robbery -- it be for _ you _ gentleman not for _ I _ the jury be not go to let off three such rogue as the recorder plainly think they and instantly return a verdict of guilty against all i agree with the verdict say the recorder it be _ a very bad case _ and a mercantile community like saffron walden must be protect against such depredator as you no doubt there be degree of guilt in you several case but i do not think i should be do my duty to the public if i make any distinction in you sentence : you must all of you undergo a term of five year ' penal servitude whereupon tom chamber be furious up he jump and say -- really sir really -- yes say knox really well then sir you can not do it say the counsel you can not give penal servitude for petty larceny here be the act -lrb- reading -rrb- : ` unless the prisoner have be guilty of any felony before ' very well say the recorder you brown the actual thief and you jone he accessory in the very act not have be convict before i be sorry to say can not be sentence to more than two year ' imprisonment with hard labor and i reduce the sentence in you case to that but as to you robinson yours be a very bad case the jury have find that you be _ mix up _ in this robbery and i find that you have be convict of steal apple true it be a good many year ago but it bring you within the purview of the statute and therefore you sentence of five year will stand chapter xlvi the new law allow the accuse to give evidence -- the case of dr wallace the last i try on circuit i should like to make a observation on the recent act for enable prisoner to go into the witness-box and subject themselves after give they evidence to cross-examination it must be apparent to every one learn and unlearned in its mystery that no evidence can be of its highest value and often be of no value until sift by cross-examination i be always oppose to this process as against a accuse person because i know how difficult it be under the most favourable circumstance to avoid the pitfall which a clever and artistic cross-examiner may dig for the unwary it do not occur to I in that early stage of the discussion on the bill that a really true story _ can not _ be shake in cross-examination and that only the _ false _ must give way beneath its search effect i have to learn something in advocacy indeed i be always learn and the best of we may go on for ever learn as long as this wonderful and mysterious human nature exist however i be not write philosophical essay but relate the fact of my simple life and i confess that the case that come before I on this occasion totally upset my quiet repose in all the comfortable tradition of the past human nature have something which i have not see : it arise in this way a doctor be accuse of a terrible crime against a female patient i need not give its detail it be sufficient to say that if the girl 's statement be true penal servitude for life be not too much for he be a villain of the very worst character take the ordinary run of evidence if i may use the word and the ordinary mode of cross-examination which in the hand of unskilled practitioner generally tend to corroborate the evidence-in-chief the case be overwhelmingly prove and how sad and painful it be to contemplate none can realize who do not understand anything below the surface of human existence i have watch the case with the anxious care that i be conscious should be exercise in all inquiry and especially criminal inquiry that come before one i watch and let I say _ especially watch _ for any point in the evidence on which i could put a question in the prisoner 's favor upon that subject i never waver throughout the whole of my career and the testimony of the letter which i receive from the most distinguished member of the criminal bar -- not to say that they be not equally distinguish in the civil -- will i be sure bear out my little self-praise upon a small matter of infinite importance everything in this case seem to be overwhelmingly against the unhappy doctor no one in court except himself _ could _ believe on the evidence but that he be guilty i who through my whole life have be study evidence and the mode in which it be deliver believe in the man 's guilt and feel that no cross-examination however subtle and skilfully conduct could shake it i feel for the man -- a scholar a scientist -- as one must feel for the victim of so great a temptation but i feel also that he be entitle on account of all those thing which arouse my sympathy to the severest sentence which i have already consider it would be my duty to award he then under the new act which i have speak against and write against as one long associate with all the bearing of evidence give in the witness-box the poor doctor step into that terrible trap for the untruthful let I now observe that even before he be swear he _ manner _ make a great impression on my mind and on this subject i would like to say that few judge or advocate sufficiently consider it the greatest actor have a manner the man who be not a actor have a manner and if you be only sufficiently read in the human character it can not deceive you however disguise it may be a witness 's evidence may deceive but he manner be the looking-glass of he mind sometimes of he innocence it be so in this case the man be not act and he be not a actor this make the first impression on my mind and i know there _ must _ be something beneath it which only _ he _ could explain i wait patiently it be much more than life and death to this man the next thing that impress I be that there be not the least confusion in he evidence or in himself he tone he language could only be the result of conscious innocence it be not very long before i gather that he be the victim of a cruel and cowardly conspiracy it be absolutely a case of _ blackmail and nothing else _ i believe every word the man say and so do the jury he evidence _ acquit he _ he be save from a ignominious doom by the new act and from that moment i go heart and soul with it : however much it may be a danger to the guilty it be of the utmost importance to the innocent this case be not finish without a little touch of humor when half-past seven arrive -- a hour on circuit at which i always consider it too early to adjourn -- the jury think it look very like a all-night sit although i have no such intention and one of they body or of the bar i forget which raise the question on a motion for the adjournment of the house i be ask i know by some impatient member of the bar whether a case in which _ he _ be engage could not go over till the morning this give immense encouragement to a independent juryman who evidently be determine to beard the lion in he den and possibly shake off the dewdrop of he british indignation i never believe in british lion except on he majesty 's quartering and although they look very formidable in heraldry i never find they so in fact indeed if the british lion be ever a native of the british isle he must have become extinct for i have never hear so much as a imitation growl from he except in hyde park on a Sunday the british lion however in this case seem to assert himself in the jury-box and rise on he hind leg say in a husky voice which appear to come from some conceal cupboard in he bosom -- my lord yes i say in my blandest manner my lord this ` ere -- be a little bit stiff my lord with all respect for you lordship what be that sir why my lord i have be cramp up in this ` ere narrer box for fourteen hour and the seat 's that hard and the back so straight up that now i get out on it i be not get a leg to stand on i be sorry for the chair i say he be a very thick-set man and the whole of the jury burst into a laugh then he go on with tear in he eye -- my lord when i go home last night arter sittin ' here so many hour i could not sleep a wink i could not help say -- then it be no use go to bed we may as well finish the business that be all very well for he but another juryman arise amidst roar of laughter and lift up a hard wooden-bottomed chair and beat it with he heavy walking-stick the chair be perfectly indifferent to the treatment it be receive after support the juryman for so many hour without the smallest hope of any reward and i then ask -- be that to keep order sir the excitement continue for a long time but at last it subside and i suggest a compromise i say probably the gentleman in the next case would not speak for more than one hour each and if they would agree to this i would undertake to sum up in _ five minute _ the husky lion sit down and so do the musician the jury acquit and go home these be some of the caprice of a jury which a judge have sometimes to put up with and it have often be say that judge be more try than prisoner perhaps that be so especially when if they do not get the kind of rough music i have mention from the jury-box they sometimes receive a by no means complimentary address from the prisoner one occur to my mind with which i will close this chapter i have occasion to sentence to death a soldier for a cruel murder by take the life of he sergeant it be at winchester and after i have utter the fatal word the culprit turn savagely towards I and in a loud gruff voice cry curse you i make no remark and the man be remove to the cell very humanely the chaplain go to the prisoner and endeavor to bring he to a proper state of mind with regard to he impend fate on the day appoint for the execution i receive by post a long letter from the clergyman enclose another write on prison paper the letter be to tell I that for ten day he could make no impression on the condemn man but on the tenth or twelfth day he express he sincere sorrow that he have curse I for pass on he the sentence he have so well deserve and he great desire be to make a humble apology to I in person he be tell that that be impossible as i could not come to he nor could he go to I whereupon he beg to be allow to write this humble apology this he be permit to do and the letter from the culprit who be hang that morning i be read at the very moment of he execution it contain i believe sincere expression of contrition for the cruel deed he have do but be mostly take up with apology to I for have curse I after advise he to prepare for the doom that await he he beg my forgiveness which i need not say i freely give chapter xlvii a farewell memory of jack poor little jack be dead it be a real grief to I a more intelligent faithful and affectionate creature never have existence and to he i have be indebted for very many of the happiest hour of my life poor dear little jack he live with I for many year and at last i believe some miscreant poison he for he be take very ill with symptom of strychnine and die in a few hour in the early morning of may 24 1894 i be with he when he die i never replace he and to this hour have never cease to be sad when i think of the merciless and cruel fate by which the ruffian put a end to he dear little life he be bury under some shrub in hyde park where i hope he sleep the sleep of good affectionate dog it be ten year ago and yet there be no abatement of my love for he hardly any of my sorrow he always occupy the best seat in the sheriff 's carriage on circuit and look as though he feel it be he right he sleep by my side on a little bed of he own at norwich i think he make he first appearance in state the moment he enter the house he appropriate to himself the chair of state which have be provide by the local upholsterer for the express use of queen alexandra then princess of wale on she first visit to norwich to confer honor and happiness on queen victorium 's subject in the eastern county nobody however molest jack in he seat and i believe have it be one of the seat for the county there would have be no petition to disturb he he would have be as faithful a member as the immortal toby mp for barkshire of mr punch to whom ever my best regard jack consider himself entitle to precedence wherever he go and maintain it he be a famous judge of upholstery and the softest chair or sofa hearthrug or divan be instantly appropriate this sometimes make the local dignitary sit up a little they might be accustom to the dignity of one of she majesty 's judge but the impudence of she majesty 's jack -- for so he deem himself on circuit -- be a little beyond they aldermanic nature i be much and agreeably surprise to find that the press everywhere sympathize with my loss of jack and many a extract i make contain they very kind remark my room might have be one of romeike 's cutting-room here be one i will give as a sample i be sorry i can not positively state the name of the journal but i be almost sure it be from the _ daily telegraph _ a item of judicial intelligence which may not everywhere be duly appreciate be the death of mr justice hawkin 's fox terrier jack jack have be he lordship 's most constant friend for many year with some master such a useful dog as he be would have find go on circuit a bear but with sir henry hawkin who know what kind of life suit a dog and like to see that he enjoy it go on circuit be a career of adventure the judge be always out betime to give jack a long morning walk and when he duty take he to small county town he often rise with the farmer for no other purpose here be another paragraph and i should like to be able to give the writer 's name for it be very pleasant at all time to find expression of true love for animal whose devotion and faithfulness to man endear they to we : -- sir henry hawkin have my sincere sympathy in he great bereavement jack the famous fox terrier who accompany he master everywhere be dead innumerable be the thing tell of jack 's devotion to sir henry and of sir henry 's devotion to jack i first make they acquaintance at worcester railway station some year ago when i see jack march solemnly in the procession of official who have come with wand and stave and javelin to receive sir henry hawkin at the opening of the assizes jack be on one or two special occasion i believe accommodate with a seat on the bench and at maidstone when the lodgings catch fire sir henry rush back at the risk of he life to save he faithful little dog these be small memory perhaps but to I more dear than the praise too often unworthily bestow on action unworthy to be record but here i pause jack rest in he little grave in hyde park and i sometimes go and look on the spot where he lie many and many a affectionate letter be write to I bewail the loss of we little friend only one of these i shall particularly mention because it show how immeasurably superior be jack to the lady who write it in that true and sincere feeling which we call friendship and which to my mind be the bond of society and the only security for its well-being she be a lady who belong to what be call society the characteristic of which be that it exist not only independently of friendship but in spite of it after condole with I on my loss and show she sweet womanly sympathy she conclude she letter by inform I that she have one of the sweetest pet eye ever behold a darling devote to she with a faithfulness which would really be a lesson to ` we specie ' and that in the circumstance she would let I have she little darling for _ five pound _ i be so astonished and angry at the meanness of this lady of fashion that i say -- well perhaps my exact expression have better be bury in oblivion ballad of the unsurprised judge 1895 -lrb- a -rrb- -lrb- footnote a : it be a well-known expression of sir henry hawkin when on the bench i should be surprise at nothing and after the long and strange experience which these reminiscence indicate the literal truth of the observation be not to be doubt this clever ballad which be write in 1895 seem sufficiently appropriate to find a place in these memoirs and i wish i know the name of the writer that my thanks and apology might be convey to he for this appropriation of they -rrb- -lrb- mr justice hawkin observe ' i be

friend they have vanish from the scene in which they play so prominent a part and yet they influence remain there be the old admiral himself the king of sportsman and good fellow horse or man-o ' - war it be all one to he and although sport may not be regard as of the same importance with politics who know which have the more beneficial influence on mankind i would have back admiral rous to save we from war and if we drift into it to save we from the enemy against any man in the world then there be he bosom friend george payne and the old old squire george osbaldeston lord falmouth w crawfurd the earl of wilton lord bradford lord rosslyn lord vivian the duke of hamilton george brace general mark wood alexander lord westmorland the earl of aylesbury clare vyner dudley milner sir john astley

and prince eddy lord gerard the earl of hardwicke viscount royston sam batchelor and tyrwhitt wilson these be some of those whom i remember and by the way i ought to add the duke of westminster and tom jenning name interesting and distinguished and indicative of a phase of life ever full of enjoyment such as be not know out of the sport world where excitement lend to pleasure the effervescence and sparkle which make life something more than animal existence this be true in hunting racing cricket and i should think intensify in the highest degree in a charge of cavalry take balaclava for instance : the very fact of stake life at such odds must have compress into that moment a whole life of ordinary pleasure i will mention a few more name and then close another chapter of my memory

also jame weatherby judge clark and tattersall chapter xlix leave the bench -- lord brampton at length the time come when i be to bid good-bye to the queen 's bench and the court no 5 in which i have so long preside where i have meet and make so many friend all more or less learn in the law i have be a judge since the year 1876 and time in its never-ceasing progress have whisper to I more than once tarry not too long upon the scene of you old labor where you presence have make you a familiar object to all the member of every branch of you great and responsible profession and while health and vigor and intelligence still by god 's blessing remain to you apparently unimpaired by lapse of year take some of that rest and repose which you have earn ere it be too late thereupon without any needless ceremony of leave-taking at the close of the year 1898 i take my leave of the bench with a simple bow silently but with real affection for all i be leave behind I i quit my occupation on the bench i consider this to be a far more dignified way of make my exit than meeting face to face the whole of the court and its practitioner and officer and leave it to the eloquent and friendly speech of the attorney-general to flatter I far beyond my desert in the customary farewell address which he would have offer to I i think it better to rely upon the expression and conduct of those who know I well and to feel that they appreciate the discharge of the many arduous duty which i have be call on to perform as some evidence of this i would point to the good wish from all kind and class of people which have follow I into private life and the numerous letter which every post bring I and which would fill a volume in themselves but the crowning honor be graciously confer upon I by she late majesty queen victorium on January 1 1899 through the then marquis of salisbury who signify that she majesty intend to raise I to the peerage he lordship 's letter announce the gracious act i recall with feeling of pleasure and gratitude and i need not say that it will while life last be my greatest pride i be subsequently swear of she majesty 's privy council and for more than two year attend pretty regularly in the final court of appeal it do not behove I to say more on this subject than that the acknowledgment of my long service by the sovereign must ever be my greatest pride and satisfaction on February 7 1899 i be introduce to the house of peer and take my seat i choose for my name and designation the title of baron brampton which she majesty be please to approve my little property therefore which i mention earlier in my reminiscence confer on I what be more valuable than its income -- the title by which i be now know speak with reference to those long year ago when i be dissuade from my career by those who doubtless have the most affectionate interest in my welfare and to whose advice i prove to be so undutiful i can not help whether vanity be attribute to I or not contrast the position of the penniless articled clerk in the attorney 's office and the situation which come to I as the result of unremitting labor let I state it with pride as well as humility that my reward have be beyond my dream and far above my desert on February 7 in a committee room of the house i be meet by my supporter and those whose duty make they a portion of the ceremony and realize the ambition that come to I only in my later life some member of my family would have prefer the family name to be associate with the title i must confess i have some attachment for it as it have render I such good service and it be somewhat hard to give it up if however i have have any hesitation it would have be remove when one afternoon lord -- call on I and in he chaff manner say -- well i hear you be to be lord ' _ awkin _ of ' _ itchin _ ` erts be -- if i will say i brampton 's the only land estate i have inherit and although the old lady who be life-tenants keep I out of it as long as they could i shall take my title from it as the only thing i be likely to get out of it bravo say he i do not like ` awkin of ` itchin ` erts _ brampton _ sound like a title and so my hearty congratulation and may you and she ladyship live long to enjoy it mr punch be good enough to furnish I with a beautiful and humorous coat of arm do by that very talented artist mr et reed \* \* \* \* \* since the commencement of this volume many of the old friend mention in it with affectionate remembrance have go to they rest and i be steadily approach my own end trust to the mercy and goodness of god i patiently await my summons i can but humbly add that to the best of my poor ability i have ever conscientiously endeavor in all thing to do my duty and now as i lay down my pen dreamily think over old name old friend and old face of bygone year i live my life over again everything pass like a picturesque vision before my eye i can see the old coach which bring I from my home -- a distance of thirty mile in eight hour -- a rapid journey in those day this be old kirshaw 's swift procedure then there be the bedford time i travel with which be whitehead 's fire-engine kind of motor but generally in that district john crowe be the celebrated whip then pass before I the old cock that crew over the doorway in fleet street a johnsonian tavern of mighty lineage and celebrity for chop and steak and i see the old waiter with he huge pocket behind in which he deposit the ton of copper tip from the numberless diner whom he attend to during he long career then i observe the rainbow by no means such a celebrity although more brilliant than the mitre by its side and in the mitre i see -lrb- but only in imagination -rrb- johnson and goldsmith talking over the quaint philosophy of wine and letter till three o'clock in the morning finish they three or four bottle of port and wonder why they be a little seedy the next day and there sit at my side enjoy he chop tom firr describe as the king of huntsman -- a true and honest sportsman simple respectful and respected whose name i will not omit from my list of celebrity for he be as worthy of a place in my reminiscence as any mfh you could meet chapter l sentence there be no part of a judge 's duty which be more important or more difficult than apportion the punishment to the particular circumstance of a conviction as a illustration of this statement i would take the offence of bigamy where in the one case the convict person would deserve a severe sentence of imprisonment while in another case he or she might be set at liberty without any punishment at all such case have occur before I the sentence of another judge upon another prisoner ought not to be follow for each prisoner should be punish for nothing but the particular crime which he have commit for this reason the case of each individual should be consider by itself i dislike also the practice of pass a severe sentence for a trifling offence merely because it have be a common habit in other place or of other person for instance i have know five year of penal servitude impose for steal from outside a shop on a second conviction when one month would have be more than enough on a first conviction and two or three month on a second conviction for small offence like these the penalty should always be the same in character -- i mean not excessive imprisonment and never penal servitude as often as a man steal let he be send to prison and it may be for each offence the time of imprisonment should be somewhat slightly increase but not the character of the punishment year ago in my session day i remember a poor and i be afraid dishonest client of mine be _ transport for life _ -lrb- on a second conviction for larceny -rrb- for steal _ a donkey _ but i doubt if that could happen nowadays it seem incredible nobody who have carefully note the innumerable phase of crime which we criminal court have continually to deal with and the infinite shades of guilt attach to each of those crime will fail to come to the conclusion that one might as well attempt to allocate to its fitting place each grain of sand expose to the current of a desert and all other disturbing influence as endeavor by any scheme or fix rule to determine what be the fitting sentence to be endure for every crime which a person can be prove under any circumstance to have commit the course i adopt in practice be this my first care be never to pass any sentence inconsistent with any other sentence pass under similar circumstance for another though similar offence then i proceed to fix in my own mind what ought to be the outside sentence that should be award for that particular offence have it stand alone and from that i deducted every circumstance of mitigation provocation etc the balance represent the sentence i finally award confine it purely to the actual guilt of the prisoner i have notice that burglary with violence be rarely commit by one man alone and that when two or more man be concern in a murder one or more of they be afraid that some one in the hope of save himself from the treachery of other be anxious to shift the whole guilt of the robbery with its accompany violence on to the shoulder of he comrade it be well that this should be so and that such dangerous criminal should distrust with fear and hatred they equally guilty associate except for special peremptory reason i never pass sentence until i have reconsider the case and inform my own mind to the best of my ability as to what be the true magnitude and character of the offence i be call upon to punish the effect of such deliberation be that i often mitigate the punishment i have intend to inflict and when i have propose my sentence i do not remember ever feel that i have act excessively or do injustice i be now quite certain that no sentence can be properly award unless after such consideration i speak of course only of serious crime it have more than once happen that even after all the evidence in the case be before the jury as be suppose i have discover that a accuse man in _ mitigation of sentence _ have plead that which would have be a _ perfect defense to the charge make against he _ one of these instance be very remarkable it happen at some country racecourse a man be charge with rob another who be in custody in charge of the police for welsh the prisoner have undoubtedly while the prosecutor as i will call he be in custody and be lead along the course rush up to he after jump the barrier and put he hand in he coat-pocket pull out he pocket-book and other article he then make off but be pursue by the police and arrest he be indict for the robbery and the fact be undisputed there be no defense set up and i be about to ask the jury for they opinion on the case which certainly have a very extraordinary aspect suddenly the prisoner blurt out as excuse himself -- well sir _ he ask I to take the thing _ i be a stranger to he and the mob be turn he pocket inside out and ill-treat he for welsh i immediately ask the prosecutor be that true and he answer yes the prisoner say i only do it to protect he thing for he of course i instantly stop the case and direct a acquittal i then give both party a little advice to the prosecutor -lrb- the welsher -rrb- i say do not go welsh any more and to the prisoner if you ever again see a welsher in distress do not help he i should like to say one word more it should not be suppose that a man when sentence be altogether bad because he use insulting language to the judge he may not be utterly bad and past all hope of redemption on that account the want of even a approach to uniformity in criminal sentence be no doubt a very serious matter and be due not to any defect in the criminal law -lrb- much as i think that might be improve in many respects -rrb- but be owe to the great diversity of opinion and therefore of action which not unnaturally exist among criminal judge from the highest to the humblest numbering as they do at least 5000 personage include judge of the high court commissioner recorder police magistrate and justice of the peace when one consider the condition under which the criminal law be administer in england and remember that no fixed principle upon which punishment should be award have be authoritatively lay down and that the law have state only a maximum -lrb- but happily at the present time not a minimum -rrb- and each judge be leave practically at liberty to exercise he own unfettered discretion so long as he confines himself within the limit so prescribe it be no matter for wonder that so great a diversity of punishment should follow so great a variety of opinion even in the most accurate and useful book of practice to which all look for guidance and assistance during every stage of the criminal proceedings down to the conviction of the offender no serious attempt have be make to deal even in the most general way with the mode in which the appropriate sentence should be arrive at the result of this state of thing be extremely unsatisfactory and the most glaring irregularity diversity and variety of sentence be daily bring to we notice the same offence commit under similar circumstance be visit by one judge with a long term of penal servitude by another with simple imprisonment with nothing appreciable to account for the difference in one or the other of these sentence discretion must have be erroneously exercise i have see such diversity even between judge of profound learning in the law who might not unreasonably _ prim facie _ be point to as safe example to be follow and so they be so far as regard they legal utterance experience however have tell we that the profoundest lawyer be not always the best administrator of the criminal law practically there be now no criminal offence which can be visit with the penalty of death treason and murder still remain for the latter offence the judge be _ bind to pronounce sentence of death _ which be imperatively fix and ordain by act of parliament and any other sentence would be illegal there be certain principle which i consider ought never to be lose sight of in the first place it must be remember that for mere immorality not make criminal by the common or statute law of the land no punishment can be legally inflict and in my opinion no crime ought to be visit with a heavier punishment merely because it be also against the law of god take for example the crime of unlawfully know a girl under the age of sixteen year even with consent assume that with she invitation the man commit himself go further and establish the sin of incest the latter sin ought to be _ totally ignore _ in deal with the _ statutory _ offence i must not however be understand as intend my observation to apply to case where the immorality be in itself a _ element _ of the crime my view be that the rule ought to apply only in case where the immorality be only a sin against god and be severable from the _ crime _ commit against the law of the land the case i have suggest be a illustration of what i mean secondly a sentence ought never to be so severe as to create in the mind of reasonable person have knowledge of the circumstance a sympathy with the criminal for that tend to bring the administration of the law into discredit and while give a judge credit for have act with the strictest sense of justice it might give rise to a suspicion of he fitness and qualification for the administration of the criminal law -- a state of thing which ought to be avoid the same observation apply but not with equal force to sentence which may to reasonable person acquaint with all the circumstance appear to be ridiculously light for it be more consistent with we law to err on the side of mercy than on the side of severity the object of criminal sentence be to compel the observance by all person high and low rich and poor of those public rights and privilege both as regard the person and property common to all they fellow-subject the infringement of which be make criminal for the infringement of other rights of a private character the law have provide civil remedy with which we be not at this moment concerned punishment then should be administer only as a necessary sequence to the breach of a _ criminal _ law with the object of deter the offender from repeat he offence of necessity it operate to some extent as a warn to other but that be not its primary object for no punishment ought to exceed in severity that which be due to the particular offence to which it be apply to add to a sentence for a very venial offence for which a nominal punishment ought to suffice a extra fine or term of imprisonment by way of example or warn to other would be unreasonable and unjust vengeance or the infliction of unnecessary pain especially for the sake of other should never form part of a criminal sentence reformation of the criminal by and during he imprisonment should be one chief object of he punishment but a just sentence for the offence be not to be prolong either for education or reformation unless expressly sanction by law as in the case of reformatory with regard to crime of violence it sometimes happen that long period of restraint and imprisonment be imperative -- where for instance the criminal be persistent in he threat or have make it evident by he action or word that on he liberation from imprisonment for criminal violence he intend to resume he criminal course and will do so unless restrained take for instance the case of a persistent burglar the great majority of whose robbery be commit under circumstance calculate to create terror and alarm and upon whom imprisonment however long have no restraining effect after he liberation take the confirm highway robber who to secure he booty do not scruple to use deadly violence upon he victim it be rare that one short term of imprisonment or the fear of another induce he to abandon he criminal course in such case it be essential for the protection of the public that he should no longer be at liberty to pursue he dangerous and alarming course of life for he therefore a much longer term of restraint be necessary than in the case of mere pilferer whose theft although cause loss and vexation be not productive of personal injury lastly i be strongly averse from abolish the sentence of death in case of deliberate murder even when the crime be commit under the influence of jealousy i should take little pain to save the life of one who have cruelly and deliberately murder another for the gratification of revenge or the purpose of robbery in the case of poor creature who make away with they illegitimate offspring in the agony of they trouble and shame there be in my experience almost always to be find very strong reason for commutation even to very limited period of imprisonment chapter li cardinal manning -- we chapel cardinal manning be a real friend to I and i often spend a hour with he on a Sunday morning or afternoon discuss general topic at my request when i have no thought of be convert to he church he mark in a book of prayer which he give I several of he own selection which i have carefully preserved but i can truly say he never utter one word or make the least attempt to proselytize I he leave I to my own free uncontrolled and uncontrollable action my reception into the church of rome be purely of my own free choice and will and accord to the exercise of my own judgment i think for myself and act for myself or i should not have act at all i have always be and _ be _ satisfied that i be right as to cardinal man he extreme good sense and toleration be my admiration at all time and i shall
