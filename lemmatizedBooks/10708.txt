produce by charle frank leonard d johnson susan goble and pg distribute proofreader de quincey 's writings it be the intention of the publisher to issue at interval a complete collection of mr de quincey 's writings uniform with this volume the first four volume of the series will contain -- i confession of a english opium-eater and suspirium de profundis ii biographical essay iii miscellaneous essay iv the cæsars miscellaneous essay by thomas de quincey contents on the knock at the gate in macbeth murder consider as one of the fine art second paper on murder joan of arc the english mail-coach the vision of sudden death dinner real and repute on the knock at the gate in macbeth from my boyish day i have always feel a great perplexity on one point in macbeth it be this : the knock at the gate which succeed to the murder of duncan produce to my feeling a effect for which i never could account the effect be that it reflect back upon the murder a peculiar awfulness and a depth of solemnity yet however obstinately i endeavor with my understand to comprehend this for many year i never could see _ why _ it should produce such a effect here i pause for one moment to exhort the reader never to pay any attention to he understanding when it stand in opposition to any other faculty of he mind the mere understanding however useful and indispensable be the meanest faculty in the human mind and the most to be distrust and yet the great majority of people trust to nothing else which may do for ordinary life but not for philosophical purpose of this out of ten thousand instance that i might produce i will cite one ask of any person whatsoever who be not previously prepare for the demand by a knowledge of perspective to draw in the rudest way the commonest appearance which depend upon the law of that science as for instance to represent the effect of two wall stand at right angle to each other or the appearance of the house on each side of a street as see by a person look down the street from one extremity now in all case unless the person have happen to observe in picture how it be that artist produce these effect he will be utterly unable to make the smallest approximation to it yet why for he have actually see the effect every day of he life the reason be -- that he allow he understanding to overrule he eye he understanding which include no intuitive knowledge of the law of vision can furnish he with no reason why a line which be know and can be prove to be a horizontal line should not _ appear _ a horizontal line a line that make any angle with the perpendicular less than a right angle would seem to he to indicate that he house be all tumble down together accordingly he make the line of he house a horizontal line and fail of course to produce the effect demand here then be one instance out of many in which not only the understanding be allow to overrule the eye but where the understanding be positively allow to obliterate the eye as it be for not only do the man believe the evidence of he understanding in opposition to that of he eye but -lrb- what be monstrous -rrb- the idiot be not aware that he eye ever give such evidence he do not know that he have see -lrb- and therefore _ quoad _ he consciousness have _ not _ see -rrb- that which he _ have _ see every day of he life but to return from this digression my understanding could furnish no reason why the knock at the gate in macbeth should produce any effect direct or reflect in fact my understanding say positively that it could _ not _ produce any effect but i know better i feel that it do and i wait and cling to the problem until further knowledge should enable I to solve it at length in 1812 mr william make he _ début _ on the stage of ratcliffe highway and execute those unparalleled murder which have procure for he such a brilliant and undying reputation on which murder by the way i must observe that in one respect they have have a ill effect by make the connoisseur in murder very fastidious in he taste and dissatisfy by anything that have be since do in that line all other murder look pale by the deep crimson of he and as a amateur once say to I in a querulous tone there have be absolutely nothing _ do _ since he time or nothing that be worth speaking of but this be wrong for it be unreasonable to expect all man to be great artist and bear with the genius of mr william now it will be remember that in the first of these murder -lrb- that of the marr -rrb- the same incident -lrb- of a knock at the door soon after the work of extermination be complete -rrb- do actually occur which the genius of shakspeare have invent and all good judge and the most eminent dilettante acknowledge the felicity of shakspeare 's suggestion as soon as it be actually realize here then be a fresh proof that i be right in rely on my own feeling in opposition to my understanding and i again set myself to study the problem at length i solve it to my own satisfaction and my solution be this murder in ordinary case where the sympathy be wholly direct to the case of the murder person be a incident of coarse and vulgar horror and for this reason that it fling the interest exclusively upon the natural but ignoble instinct by which we cleave to life a instinct which as be indispensable to the primal law of self-preservation be the same in kind -lrb- though different in degree -rrb- amongst all live creature this instinct therefore because it annihilate all distinction and degrade the greatest of man to the level of the poor beetle that we tread on exhibit human nature in its most abject and humiliating attitude such a attitude would little suit the purpose of the poet what then must he do he must throw the interest on the murderer we sympathy must be with _ he _ -lrb- of course i mean a sympathy of comprehension a sympathy by which we enter into he feeling and be make to understand they -- not a sympathy -lrb- 1 -rrb- of pity or approbation -rrb- in the murder person all strife of think all flux and reflux of passion and of purpose be crush by one overwhelming panic the fear of instant death smite he with its petrific mace but in the murderer such a murderer as a poet will condescend to there must be rage some great storm of passion -- jealousy ambition vengeance hatred -- which will create a hell within he and into this hell we be to look -lrb- footnote 1 : it seem almost ludicrous to guard and explain my use of a word in a situation where it would naturally explain itself but it have become necessary to do so in consequence of the unscholarlike use of the word sympathy at present so general by which instead of take it in its proper sense as the act of reproduce in we mind the feeling of another whether for hatred indignation love pity or approbation it be make a mere synonyme of the word _ pity _ and hence instead of say sympathy _ with _ another many writer adopt the monstrous barbarism of sympathy _ for _ another -rrb- in macbeth for the sake of gratify he own enormous and teem faculty of creation shakspeare have introduce two murderer : and as usual in he hand they be remarkably discriminate : but though in macbeth the strife of mind be greater than in he wife the tiger spirit not so awake and he feeling catch chiefly by contagion from she -- yet as both be finally involve in the guilt of murder the murderous mind of necessity be finally to be presume in both this be to be express and on its own account as well as to make it a more proportionable antagonist to the unoffending nature of they victim the gracious duncan and adequately to expound the deep damnation of he take off this be to be express with peculiar energy we be to be make to feel that the human nature _ ie _ the divine nature of love and mercy spread through the heart of all creature and seldom utterly withdraw from man -- be go vanish extinct and that the fiendish nature have take its place and as this effect be marvellously accomplish in the _ dialogue _ and _ soliloquy _ themselves so it be finally consummate by the expedient under consideration and it be to this that i now solicit the reader 's attention if the reader have ever witness a wife daughter or sister in a faint fit he may chance to have observe that the most affect moment in such a spectacle be _ that _ in which a sigh and a stir announce the recommencement of suspend life or if the reader have ever be present in a vast metropolis on the day when some great national idol be carry in funeral pomp to he grave and chance to walk near the course through which it pass have feel powerfully in the silence and desertion of the street and in the stagnation of ordinary business the deep interest which at that moment be possess the heart of man -- if all at once he should hear the death-like stillness break up by the sound of wheel rattle away from the scene and make know that the transitory vision be dissolve he will be aware that at no moment be he sense of the complete suspension and pause in ordinary human concern so full and affect as at that moment when the suspension cease and the goings-on of human life be suddenly resume all action in any direction be best expound measure and make apprehensible by reaction now apply this to the case in macbeth here as i have say the retire of the human heart and the entrance of the fiendish heart be to be express and make sensible another world have step in and the murderer be take out of the region of human thing human purpose human desire they be transfigure : lady macbeth be unsexed macbeth have forget that he be bear of woman both be conform to the image of devil and the world of devil be suddenly reveal but how shall this be convey and make palpable in order that a new world may step in this world must for a time disappear the murderer and the murder must be insulate -- cut off by a immeasurable gulph from the ordinary tide and succession of human affair -- lock up and sequester in some deep recess we must be make sensible that the world of ordinary life be suddenly arrest -- lay asleep -- trance -- rack into a dread armistice : time must be annihilate relation to thing without abolish and all must pass self-withdrawn into a deep syncope and suspension of earthly passion hence it be that when the deed be do when the work of darkness be perfect then the world of darkness pass away like a pageantry in the cloud : the knock at the gate be hear and it make known audibly that the reaction have commence : the human have make its reflux upon the fiendish the pulse of life be begin to beat again and the re-establishment of the goings-on of the world in which we live first make we profoundly sensible of the awful parenthesis that have suspend they o mighty poet thy work be not as those of other man simply and merely great work of art but be also like the phenomenon of nature like the sun and the sea the star and the flower -- like frost and snow rain and dew hail-storm and thunder which be to be study with entire submission of we own faculty and in the perfect faith that in they there can be no too much or too little nothing useless or inert -- but that the further we press in we discovery the more we shall see proof of design and self-supporting arrangement where the careless eye have see nothing but accident on murder consider as one of the fine art to the editor of blackwood 's magazine sir -- we have all hear of a society for the promotion of vice of the hell-fire club & c at brighton i think it be that a society be form for the suppression of virtue that society be itself suppress -- but i be sorry to say that another exist in london of a character still more atrocious in tendency it may be denominate a society for the encouragement of murder but accord to they own delicate -lrb- greek : euphaemismo -rrb- it be style -- the society of connoisseur in murder they profess to be curious in homicide amateur and dilettante in the various mode of bloodshed and in short murder-fancier every fresh atrocity of that class which the police annals of europe bring up they meet and criticise as they would a picture statue or other work of art but i need not trouble myself with any attempt to describe the spirit of they proceedings as you will collect _ that _ much better from one of the monthly lecture read before the society last year this have fall into my hand accidentally in spite of all the vigilance exercise to keep they transaction from the public eye the publication of it will alarm they and my purpose be that it should for i would much rather put they down quietly by a appeal to public opinion through you than by such a exposure of name as would follow a appeal to bow street which last appeal however if this should fail i must positively resort to for it be scandalous that such thing should go on in a christian land even in a heathen land the toleration of murder be feel by a christian writer to be the most cry reproach of the public moral this writer be lactantius and with he word as singularly applicable to the present occasion i shall conclude : quid tam horribile say he tam tetrum quam hominis trucidatio ideo severissimis legibus vita nostra munitur ideo bella execrabilia sunt invenit taman consuetudo quatenus homicidium sine bello ac sine legibus faciat : et hoc sibi voluptas quod scelus vindicavit quod si interesse homicidio sceleri conscientium est -- et eidem facinori spectator obstrictus est cuus et admissor ergo et in he gladiatorum cædibus non minus cruore profunditur quus spectat quam ille qui facit : nec potest esse immunis à sanguine quus voluit effundus aut viderus non interfecisse quus interfectorus et favit et proemium postulavit human life say he be guard by law of the uttermost rigor yet custom have devise a mode of evade they in behalf of murder and the demand of taste -lrb- volupta -rrb- be now become the same as those of abandon guilt let the society of gentleman amateur consider this and let I call they especial attention to the last sentence which be so weighty that i shall attempt to convey it in english : now if merely to be present at a murder fasten on a man the character of a accomplice if barely to be a spectator involve we in one common guilt with the perpetrator it follow of necessity that in these murder of the amphitheatre the hand which inflict the fatal blow be not more deeply imbrue in blood than he who sit and look on : neither can _ he _ be clear of blood who have countenance its shed nor that man seem other than a participator in murder who give he applause to the murderer and call for prize in he behalf the _ præmia postulavit _ i have not yet hear charge upon the gentleman amateur of london though undoubtedly they proceedings tend to that but the _ interfectorus favil _ be imply in the very title of this association and express in every line of the lecture which i send you i be & c x y z \* \* \* \* \* lecture gentleman -- i have have the honor to be appoint by you committee to the try task of read the william ' lecture on murder consider as one of the fine art a task which might be easy enough three or four century ago when the art be little understood and few great model have be exhibit but in this age when masterpiece of excellence have be execute by professional man it must be evident that in the style of criticism apply to they the public will look for something of a corresponding improvement practice and theory must advance _ parus passu _ people begin to see that something more go to the composition of a fine murder than two blockhead to kill and be kill -- a knife -- a purse -- and a dark lane design gentleman group light and shade poetry sentiment be now deem indispensable to attempt of this nature mr william have exalt the ideal of murder to all of we and to I therefore in particular have deepen the arduousness of my task like æschylus or milton in poetry like michael angelo in painting he have carry he art to a point of colossal sublimity and as mr wordsworth observe have in a manner create the taste by which he be to be enjoy to sketch the history of the art and to examine its principle critically now remain as a duty for the connoisseur and for judge of quite another stamp from he majesty 's judge of assize before i begin let I say a word or two to certain prig who affect to speak of we society as if it be in some degree immoral in its tendency immoral god bless my soul gentleman what be it that people mean i be for morality and always shall be and for virtue and all that and i do affirm and always shall -lrb- let what will come of it -rrb- that murder be a improper line of conduct highly improper and i do not stick to assert that any man who deal in murder must have very incorrect way of think and truly inaccurate principle and so far from aid and abet he by point out he victim 's hiding-place as a great moralist -lrb- 1 -rrb- of germany declare it to be every good man 's duty to do i would subscribe one shilling and sixpense to have he apprehend which be more by eighteen-penny than the most eminent moralist have subscribe for that purpose but what then everything in this world have two handle murder for instance may be lay hold of by its moral handle -lrb- as it generally be in the pulpit and at the old bailey -rrb- and _ that _ i confess be its weak side or it may also be treat _ æsthetically _ as the german call it that be in relation to good taste -lrb- footnote 1 : kant -- who carry he demand of unconditional veracity to so extravagant a length as to affirm that if a man be to see a innocent person escape from a murderer it would be he duty on be question by the murderer to tell the truth and to point out the retreat of the innocent person under any certainty of cause murder lest this doctrine should be suppose to have escape he in any heat of dispute on be tax with it by a celebrated french writer he solemnly reaffirm it with he reason -rrb- to illustrate this i will urge the authority of three eminent person viz st coleridge aristotle and mr howship the surgeon to begin with stc one night many year ago i be drink tea with he in berner ' street -lrb- which by the way for a short street have be uncommonly fruitful in man of genius -rrb- other be there besides myself and amidst some carnal consideration of tea and toast we be all imbibe a dissertation on plotinus from the attic lip of stc suddenly a cry arise of _ fire -- fire _ upon which all of we master and disciple plato and -lrb- greek : hous peri ton platona -rrb- rush out eager for the spectacle the fire be in oxford street at a piano-forte maker 's and as it promise to be a conflagration of merit i be sorry that my engagement force I away from mr coleridge 's party before matter be come to a crisis some day after meet with my platonic host i remind he of the case and beg to know how that very promising exhibition have terminate oh sir say he it turn out so ill that we damned it unanimously now do any man suppose that mr coleridge -- who for all he be too fat to be a person of active virtue be undoubtedly a worthy christian -- that this good s t c i say be a incendiary or capable of wish any ill to the poor man and he piano-forte -lrb- many of they doubtless with the additional key -rrb- on the contrary i know he to be that sort of man that i durst stake my life upon it he would have work a engine in a case of necessity although rather of the fattest for such fiery trial of he virtue but how stand the case virtue be in no request on the arrival of the fire-engine morality have devolve wholly on the insurance office this be the case he have a right to gratify he taste he have leave he tea be he to have nothing in return i contend that the most virtuous man under the premise state be entitle to make a luxury of the fire and to hiss it as he would any other performance that raise expectation in the public mind which afterwards it disappoint again to cite another great authority what say the stagyrite he -lrb- in the fifth book i think it be of he metaphysics -rrb- describe what he call -lrb- greek : kleptaen teleion -rrb- ie _ a perfect thief _ and as to mr howship in a work of he on indigestion he make no scruple to talk with admiration of a certain ulcer which he have see and which he style a beautiful ulcer now will any man pretend that abstractedly consider a thief could appear to aristotle a perfect character or that mr howship could be enamor of a ulcer aristotle it be well know be himself so very moral a character that not content with write he nichomachean ethic in one volume octavo he also write another system call _ magna moralium _ or big ethic now it be impossible that a man who compose any ethic at all big or little should admire a thief _ per se _ and as to mr howship it be well know that he make war upon all ulcer and without suffer himself to be seduce by they charm endeavor to banish they from the county of middlesex but the truth be that however objectionable _ per se _ yet relatively to other of they class both a thief and a ulcer may have infinite degree of merit they be both imperfection it be true but to be imperfect be they essence the very greatness of they imperfection become they perfection _ spartam nactus e hunc exorna _ a thief like autolycus or mr barrington and a grim phagedænic ulcer superbly define and run regularly through all its natural stage may no less justly be regard as ideal after _ they _ kind than the most faultless moss-rose amongst flower in its progress from bud to bright consummate flower or amongst human flower the most magnificent young female apparel in the pomp of womanhood and thus not only the ideal of a inkstand may be imagine -lrb- as mr coleridge demonstrate in he celebrated correspondence with mr blackwood -rrb- in which by the way there be not so much because a inkstand be a laudable sort of thing and a valuable member of society but even imperfection itself may have its ideal or perfect state really gentleman i beg pardon for so much philosophy at one time and now let I apply it when a murder be in the paulo-post-futurum tense and a rumor of it come to we ear by all mean let we treat it morally but suppose it over and do and that you can say of it -lrb- greek : tetelesaus -rrb- or -lrb- in that adamantine molossus of medea -rrb- -lrb- greek : eirzasaus -rrb- suppose the poor murder man to be out of he pain and the rascal that do it off like a shot nobody know whither suppose lastly that we have do we best by put out we leg to trip up the fellow in he flight but all to no purpose -- abiit evasit & c -- why then i say what be the use of any more virtue enough have be give to morality now come the turn of taste and the fine art a sad thing it be no doubt very sad but _ we _ can not mend it therefore let we make the best of a bad matter and as it be impossible to hammer anything out of it for moral purpose let we treat it æsthetically and see if it will turn to account in that way such be the logic of a sensible man and what follow we dry up we tear and have the satisfaction perhaps to discover that a transaction which morally consider be shocking and without a leg to stand upon when try by principle of taste turn out to be a very meritorious performance thus all the world be please the old proverb be justified that it be a ill wind which blow nobody good the amateur from look bilious and sulky by too close a attention to virtue begin to pick up he crumb and general hilarity prevail virtue have have she day and henceforward _ vertu _ and connoisseurship have leave to provide for themselves upon this principle gentleman i propose to guide you study from cain to mr thurtell through this great gallery of murder therefore together let we wander hand in hand in delighted admiration while i endeavor to point you attention to the object of profitable criticism \* \* \* \* \* the first murder be familiar to you all as the inventor of murder and the father of the art cain must have be a man of first-rate genius all the cain be man of genius tubal cain invent tube i think or some such thing but whatever be the originality and genius of the artist every art be then in its infancy and the work must be criticise with a recollection of that fact even tubal 's work would probably be little approved at this day in sheffield and therefore of cain -lrb- cain senior i mean -rrb- it be no disparagement to say that he performance be but so so milton however be suppose to have think differently by he way of relate the case it should seem to have be rather a pet murder with he for he retouch it with a apparent anxiety for its picturesque effect : whereat he inly rage and as they talk would smite he into the midriff with a stone that beat out life : he fall and deadly pale groan would out he soul _ with gush blood effus would _ _ par lose b xi _ upon this richardson the painter who have a eye for effect remark as follow in he note on paradise lose p 497 : it have be think say he that cain beat -lrb- as the common say be -rrb- the breath out of he brother 's body with a great stone milton give in to this with the addition however of a large wound in this place it be a judicious addition for the rudeness of the weapon unless raise and enrich by a warm sanguinary coloring have too much of the naked air of the savage school as if the deed be perpetrate by a polypheme without science premeditation or anything but a mutton bone however i be chiefly please with the improvement as it imply that milton be a amateur as to shakspeare there never be a better as he description of the murder duke of gloucester in henry vi of duncan 's banquo 's & c sufficiently prove the foundation of the art have be once lay it be pitiable to see how it slumber without improvement for age in fact i shall now be oblige to leap over all murder sacred and profane as utterly unworthy of notice until long after the christian era greece even in the age of pericle produce no murder of the slightest merit and rome have too little originality of genius in any of the art to succeed where she model fail she in fact the latin language sink under the very idea of murder the man be murder -- how will this sound in latin _ interfectus est interemptus est _ -- which simply express a homicide and hence the christian latinity of the middle age be oblige to introduce a new word such as the feebleness of classic conception never ascend to _ murdratus est _ say the sublimer dialect of gothic age meantime the jewish school of murder keep alive whatever be yet know in the art and gradually transfer it to the western world indeed the jewish school be always respectable even in the dark age as the case of hugh of lincoln show which be honor with the approbation of chaucer on occasion of another performance from the same school which he put into the mouth of the lady abbess recur however for one moment to classical antiquity i can not but think that catiline clodius and some of that coterie would have make first-rate artist and it be on all account to be regret that the priggism of cicero rob he country of the only chance she have for distinction in this line as the _ subject _ of a murder no person could have answer better than himself lord how he would have howl with panic if he have hear cethegus under he bed it would have be truly divert to have listen to he and satisfied i be gentleman that he would have prefer the _ utile _ of creep into a closet or even into a _ cloaca _ to the _ honestum _ of face the bold artist to come now to the dark age -- -lrb- by which we that speak with precision mean _ par excellence _ the tenth century and the time immediately before and after -rrb- -- these age ought naturally to be favorable to the art of murder as they be to church architecture to stain glass & c and accordingly about the latter end of this period there arise a great character in we art i mean the old man of the mountain he be a shine light indeed and i need not tell you that the very word assassin be deduce from he so keen a amateur be he that on one occasion when he own life be attempt by a favorite assassin he be so much pleased with the talent show that notwithstanding the failure of the artist he create he a duke upon the spot with remainder to the female line and settle a pension on he for three life assassination be a branch of the art which demand a separate notice and i shall devote a entire lecture to it meantime i shall only observe how odd it be that this branch of the art have flourish by fit it never rain but it pour we own age can boast of some fine specimen and about two century ago there be a most brilliant constellation of murder in this class i need hardly say that i allude especially to those five splendid work -- the assassination of william i of orange of henry iv of france of the duke of buckingham -lrb- which you will find excellently describe in the letter publish by mr elli of the british museum -rrb- of gustavus adolphus and of wallenstein the king of sweden 's assassination by the by be doubt by many writer harte amongst other but they be wrong he be murder and i consider he murder unique in its excellence for he be murder at noon-day and on the field of battle -- a feature of original conception which occur in no other work of art that i remember indeed all of these assassination may be study with profit by the advanced connoisseur they be all of they _ exemplarium _ of which one may say -- nociurnâ versatâ manu versate diurne especially _ nocturnâ _ in these assassination of prince and statesman there be nothing to excite we wonder important change often depend on they death and from the eminence on which they stand they be peculiarly expose to the aim of every artist who happen to be possess by the craving for scenical effect but there be another class of assassination which have prevail from a early period of the seventeenth century that really _ do _ surprise I i mean the assassination of philosopher for gentleman it be a fact that every philosopher of eminence for the two last century have either be murder or at the least be very near it insomuch that if a man call himself a philosopher and never have he life attempt rest assure there be nothing in he and against locke 's philosophy in particular i think it a unanswerable objection -lrb- if we need any -rrb- that although he carry he throat about with he in this world for seventy-two year no man ever condescend to cut it as these case of philosopher be not much know and be generally good and well compose in they circumstance i shall here read a excursus on that subject chiefly by way of show my own learn the first great philosopher of the seventeenth century -lrb- if we except galileo -rrb- be des cartes and if ever one could say of a man that he be all _ but _ murder -- murder within a inch -- one must say it of he the case be this as report by baillet in he _ vie de m des cartes _ tom i p 102-3 in the year 1621 when des cartes might be about twenty-six year old he be tour about as usual -lrb- for he be as restless as a hyæna -rrb- and come to the elbe either at gluckstadt or at hamburgh he take shipping for east friezland : what he could want in east friezland no man have ever discover and perhaps he take this into consideration himself for on reach embden he resolve to sail instantly for _ west _ friezland and be very impatient of delay he hire a bark with a few mariner to navigate it no sooner have he get out to sea than he make a please discovery viz that he have shut himself up in a den of murderer he crew say m baillet he soon find out to be des scélérats -- not _ amateur _ gentleman as we be but professional man -- the height of whose ambition at that moment be to cut he throat but the story be too please to be abridged i shall give it therefore accurately from the french of he biographer : m des cartes have no company but that of he servant with whom he be converse in french the sailor who take he for a foreign merchant rather than a cavalier conclude that he must have money about he accordingly they come to a resolution by no means advantageous to he purse there be this difference however between sea-robber and the robber in forest that the latter may without hazard spare the life of they victim whereas the other can not put a passenger on shore in such a case without run the risk of be apprehend the crew of m des cartes arrange they measure with a view to evade any danger of that sort they observe that he be a stranger from a distance without acquaintance in the country and that nobody would take any trouble to inquire about he in case he should never come to hand -lrb- _ quand il viendroit à manquer _ -rrb- think gentleman of these friezland dog discuss a philosopher as if he be a puncheon of rum he temper they remark be very mild and patient and judge from the gentleness of he deportment and the courtesy with which he treat themselves that he could be nothing more than some green young man they conclude that they should have all the easier task in dispose of he life they make no scruple to discuss the whole matter in he presence as not suppose that he understand any other language than that in which he converse with he servant and the amount of they deliberation be -- to murder he then to throw he into the sea and to divide he spoil excuse my laughing gentleman but the fact be i always _ do _ laugh when i think of this case -- two thing about it seem so droll one be the horrid panic or funk -lrb- as the man of eton call it -rrb- in which des cartes must have find himself upon hear this regular drama sketch for he own death -- funeral -- succession and administration to he effect but another thing which seem to I still more funny about this affair be that if these friezland hound have be game we should have no cartesian philosophy and how we could have do without _ that _ consider the world of book it have produce i leave to any respectable trunk-maker to declare however to go on spite of he enormous funk des cartes show fight and by that mean awed these anti-cartesian rascal find say m baillet that the matter be no joke m des cartes leap upon he foot in a trice assume a stern countenance that these craven have never look for and address they in they own language threaten to run they through on the spot if they dare to offer he any insult certainly gentleman this would have be a honor far above the merit of such inconsiderable rascal -- to be spit like lark upon a cartesian sword and therefore i be glad m des cartes do not rob the gallows by execute he threat especially as he could not possibly have bring he vessel to port after he have murder he crew so that he must have continue to cruise for ever in the zuyder zee and would probably have be mistake by sailor for the _ fly dutchman _ homeward bind the spirit which m des cartes manifest say he biographer have the effect of magic on these wretch the suddenness of they consternation strike they mind with a confusion which blind they to they advantage and they convey he to he destination as peaceably as he could desire possibly gentleman you may fancy that on the model of cæsar 's address to he poor ferryman -- _ cæsarem vehi et fortunas ejus _ -- m des cartes need only to have say -- dog you can not cut my throat for you carry des cartes and he philosophy and might safely have defy they to do they worst a german emperor have the same notion when be caution to keep out of the way of a cannonade he reply tut man do you ever hear of a cannon-ball that kill a emperor as to a emperor i can not say but a less thing have suffice to smash a philosoper and the next great philosopher of europe undoubtedly _ be _ murder this be spinosa i know very well the common opinion about he be that he die in he bed perhaps he do but he be murder for all that and this i shall prove by a book publish at brussels in the year 1731 entitle _ la via de spinosa par m jean colerus _ with many addition from a m life by one of he friend spinosa die on the 21st February 1677 be then little more than forty-four year old this of itself look suspicious and m jean admit that a certain expression in the m life of he would warrant the conclusion que sa mort n ' a pas été tout-à-fait naturelle living in a damp country and a sailor 's country like holland he may be think to have indulge a good deal in grog especially in punch -lrb- 1 -rrb- which be then newly discover undoubtedly he might have do so but the fact be that he do not m jean call he extrêmement sobre en son boire et en son manger and though some wild story be afloat about he use the juice of mandragora -lrb- p 140 -rrb- and opium -lrb- p 144 -rrb- yet neither of these article appear in he druggist 's bill live therefore with such sobriety how be it possible that he should die a natural death at forty-four hear he biographer 's account : -- Sunday morning the 21st of February before it be church time spinosa come down stair and converse with the master and mistress of the house at this time therefore perhaps ten o'clock on Sunday morning you see that spinosa be alive and pretty well but it seem he have summon from amsterdam a certain physician whom say the biographer i shall not otherwise point out to notice than by these two letter lm this lm have direct the people of the house to purchase a ancient cock and to have he boil forthwith in order that spinosa might take some broth about noon which in fact he do and eat some of the _ old cock _ with a good appetite after the landlord and he wife have return from church -lrb- footnote 1 : June 1 1675 -- drinke part of 3 boule of punch -lrb- a liquor very strainge to I -rrb- say the rev mr henry teonge in he diary lately publish in a note on this passage a reference be make to fryer 's travels to the east indy 1672 who speak of that enervating liquor call _ paunch _ -lrb- which be indostan for five -rrb- from five ingredient make thus it seem the medical man call it diapente if with four only diatessaron no doubt it be its evangelical name that recommend it to the rev mr teonge -rrb- in the afternoon lm staid alone with spinosa the people of the house have return to church on come out from which they learn with much surprise that spinosa have die about three o'clock in the presence of lm who take he departure for amsterdam the same evening by the night-boat without pay the least attention to the deceased no doubt he be the readier to dispense with these duty as he have possess himself of a ducatoon and a small quantity of silver together with a silver-hafted knife and have abscond with he pillage here you see gentleman the murder be plain and the manner of it it be lm who murder spinosa for he money poor s be a invalid meager and weak : as no blood be observe lm no doubt throw he down and smother he with pillow -- the poor man be already half suffocate by he infernal dinner but who be lm it surely never could be lindley murray for i see he at york in 1825 and besides i do not think he would do such a thing at least not to a brother grammarian : for you know gentleman that spinosa write a very respectable hebrew grammar hobbe but why or on what principle i never could understand be not murder this be a capital oversight of the professional man in the seventeenth century because in every light he be a fine subject for murder except indeed that he be lean and skinny for i can prove that he have money and -lrb- what be very funny -rrb- he have no right to make the least resistance for accord to himself irresistible power create the very highest species of right so that it be rebellion of the blackest die to refuse to be murder when a competent force appear to murder you however gentleman though he be not murder i be happy to assure you that -lrb- by he own account -rrb- he be three time very near be murder the first time be in the spring of 1640 when he pretend to have circulate a little m on the king 's behalf against the parliament he never could produce this m by the by but he say that have not he majesty dissolve the parliament -lrb- in may -rrb- it have bring he into danger of he life dissolve the parliament however be of no use for in November of the same year the long parliament assemble and hobbe a second time fear he should be murder run away to france this look like the madness of john denni who think that loui xiv would never make peace with queen anne unless he be give up to he vengeance and actually run away from the sea-coast in that belief in france hobbe manage to take care of he throat pretty well for ten year but at the end of that time by way of pay court to cromwell he publish he leviathan the old coward now begin to funk horribly for the third time he fancy the sword of the cavalier be constantly at he throat recollect how they have serve the parliament ambassador at the hague and madrid turn say he in he dog-latin life of himself tum venit in mentem mihus dorislaus et ascham tanquam proscripto terror ubique aderat and accordingly he run home to england now certainly it be very true that a man deserve a cudgelling for write leviathan and two or three cudgelling for write a pentameter end so villanously as -- terror ubique aderat but no man ever think he worthy of anything beyond cudgelling and in fact the whole story be a bounce of he own for in a most abusive letter which he write to a learn person -lrb- meaning walli the mathematician -rrb- he give quite another account of the matter and say -lrb- p 8 -rrb- he run home because he would not trust he safety with the french clergy insinuate that he be likely to be murder for he religion which would have be a high joke indeed -- tom 's be bring to the stake for religion bounce or not bounce however certain it be that hobbe to the end of he life fear that somebody would murder he this be prove by the story i be go to tell you : it be not from a manuscript but -lrb- as mr coleridge say -rrb- it be as good as manuscript for it come from a book now entirely forget viz the creed of mr hobbe examine in a conference between he and a student in divinity -lrb- publish about ten year before hobbe 's death -rrb- the book be anonymous but it be write by tennison the same who about thirty year after succeed tillotson as archbishop of canterbury the introductory anecdote be as follow : a certain divine it seem -lrb- no doubt tennison himself -rrb- take a annual tour of one month to different part of the island in one of these excursion -lrb- 1670 -rrb- he visit the peak in derbyshire partly in consequence of hobbe 's description of it be in that neighborhood he could not but pay a visit to buxton and at the very moment of he arrival he be fortunate enough to find a party of gentleman dismount at the inn door amongst whom be a long thin fellow who turn out to be no less a person than mr hobbe who probably have ride over from chattsworth meeting so great a lion -- a tourist in search of the picturesque could do no less than present himself in the character of bear and luckily for this scheme two of mr hobbe 's companion be suddenly summon away by express so that for the rest of he stay at buxton he have leviathan entirely to himself and have the honor of bowse with he in the evening hobbe it seem at first show a good deal of stiffness for he be shy of divine but this wear off and he become very sociable and funny and they agree to go into the bath together how tennison could venture to gambol in the same water with leviathan i can not explain but so it be : they frolic about like two dolphin though hobbe must have be as old as the hill and in those interval wherein they abstain from swimming and plunge themselves -lrb- ie diving -rrb- they discourse of many thing relate to the bath of the ancient and the origine of spring when they have in this manner pass away a hour they step out of the bath and have dry and cloathe themselves they sate down in expectation of such a supper as the place afford design to refresh themselves like the _ deipnosophilæ _ and rather to reason than to drink profoundly but in this innocent intention they be interrupt by the disturbance arise from a little quarrel in which some of the ruder people in the house be for a short time engage at this mr hobbe seem much concerned though he be at some distance from the person and why be he concern gentleman no doubt you fancy from some benign and disinterested love of peace and harmony worthy of a old man and a philosopher but listen -- for a while he be not compose but relate it once or twice as to himself with a low and careful tone how sextus roscius be murther after supper by the balneæ palatinæ of such general extent be that remark of cicero in relation to epicurus the atheist of whom he observe that he of all man dread most those thing which he contemn -- death and the god merely because it be supper time and in the neighborhood of a bath mr hobbe must have the fate of sextus roscius what logic be there in this unless to a man who be always dream of murder here be leviathan no longer afraid of the dagger of english cavalier or french clergy but frighten from he propriety by a row in a ale-house between some honest clod-hopper of derbyshire whom he own gaunt scare-crow of a person that belong to quite another century would have frighten out of they wit malebranche it will give you pleasure to hear be murder the man who murder he be well know : it be bishop berkeley the story be familiar though hitherto not put in a proper light berkeley when a young man go to paris and call on père malebranche he find he in he cell cooking cook have ever be a _ genus irritabile _ author still more so : malebranche be both : a dispute arise the old father warm already become warmer culinary and metaphysical irritation unite to derange he liver : he take to he bed and die such be the common version of the story : so the whole ear of denmark be abuse the fact be that the matter be hush up out of consideration for berkeley who -lrb- as pope remark -rrb- have every virtue under heaven : else it be well know that berkeley feeling himself nettle by the waspishness of the old frenchman square at he a _ turn-up _ be the consequence : malebranche be floor in the first round the conceit be wholly take out of he and he would perhaps have give in but berkeley 's blood be now up and he insist on the old frenchman 's retract he doctrine of occasional cause the vanity of the man be too great for this and he fall a sacrifice to the impetuosity of irish youth combine with he own absurd obstinacy leibnitz be every way superior to malebranche one might _ a fortiorus _ have count on _ he _ be murder which however be not the case i believe he be nettle at this neglect and feel himself insult by the security in which he pass he day in no other way can i explain he conduct at the latter end of he life when he choose to grow very avaricious and to hoard up large sum of gold which he keep in he own house this be at vienna where he die and letter be still in existence describe the immeasurable anxiety which he entertain for he throat still he ambition for be _ attempt _ at least be so great that he would not forego the danger a late english pedagogue of birmingham manufacture viz dr parr take a more selfish course under the same circumstance he have amass a considerable quantity of gold and silver plate which be for some time deposit in he bed-room at he parsonage house hatton but grow every day more afraid of be murder which he know that he could not stand -lrb- and to which indeed he never have the slightest pretension -rrb- he transfer the whole to the hatton blacksmith conceive no doubt that the murder of a blacksmith would fall more lightly on the _ salus reipublicæ _ than that of a pedagogue but i have hear this greatly dispute and it seem now generally agree that one good horse-shoe be worth about 2 1\/4 spital sermon as leibnitz though not murder may be say to have die partly of the fear that he should be murder and partly of vexation that he be not -- kant on the other hand -- who have no ambition in that way -- have a narrower escape from a murderer than any man we read of except des cartes so absurdly do fortune throw about she favor the case be tell i think in a anonymous life of this very great man for health 's sake kant impose upon himself at one time a walk of six mile every day along a highroad this fact become know to a man who have he private reason for commit murder at the third milestone from königsberg he wait for he intend who come up to time as duly as a mail-coach but for a accident kant be a dead man however on consideration of morality it happen that the murderer prefer a little child whom he see play in the road to the old transcendentalist : this child he murder and thus it happen that kant escape such be the german account of the matter but my opinion be -- that the murderer be a amateur who feel how little would be gain to the cause of good taste by murder a old arid and adust metaphysician there be no room for display as the man could not possibly look more like a mummy when dead than he have do alive thus gentleman i have trace the connection between philosophy and we art until insensibly i find that i have wander into we own era this i shall not take any pain to characterize apart from that which precede it for in fact they have no distinct character the seventeenth and eighteenth century together with so much of the nineteenth as we have yet see jointly compose the augustan age of murder the finest work of the seventeenth century be unquestionably the murder of sir edmondbury godfrey which have my entire approbation at the same time it must be observe that the quantity of murder be not great in this century at least amongst we own artist which perhaps be attributable to the want of enlighten patronage _ sint mæcenates non deerunt flacce marone _ consult grant 's observation on the bill of mortality -lrb- 4th edition oxford 1665 -rrb- i find that out of 229250 who die in london during one period of twenty year in the seventeenth century not more than eighty-six be murder that be about four three-tenths per annum a small number this gentleman to find a academy upon and certainly where the quantity be so small we have a right to expect that the quality should be first-rate perhaps it be yet still i be of opinion that the best artist in this century be not equal to the best in that which follow for instance however praiseworthy the case of sir edmondbury godfrey may be -lrb- and nobody can be more sensible of its merit than i be -rrb- still i can not consent to place it on a level with that of mr ruscombe of bristol either as to originality of design or boldness and breadth of style this good lady 's murder take place early in the reign of george iii a reign which be notoriously favorable to the art generally she live in college green with a single maid-servant neither of they have any pretension to the notice of history but what they derive from the great artist whose workmanship i be record one fine morning when all bristol be alive and in motion some suspicion arise the neighbor force a entrance into the house and find mr ruscombe murder in she bed-room and the servant murder on the stair : this be at noon and not more than two hour before both mistress and servant have be see alive to the best of my remembrance this be in 1764 upward of sixty year therefore have now elapse and yet the artist be still undiscovered the suspicion of posterity have settle upon two pretender -- a baker and a chimney-sweeper but posterity be wrong no unpractised artist could have conceive so bold a idea as that of a noon-day murder in the heart of a great city it be no obscure baker gentleman or anonymous chimney-sweeper be assure that execute this work i know who it be -lrb- _ here there be a general buzz which at length break out into open applause upon which the lecturer blush and go on with much earnestness _ -rrb- for heaven 's sake gentleman do not mistake I it be not i that do it i have not the vanity to think myself equal to any such achievement be assure that you greatly overrate my poor talent mr ruscombe 's affair be far beyond my slender ability but i come to know who the artist be from a celebrated surgeon who assist at he dissection this gentleman have a private museum in the way of he profession one corner of which be occupy by a cast from a man of remarkably fine proportion that say the surgeon be a cast from the celebrated lancashire highwayman who conceal he profession for some time from he neighbor by draw woollen stocking over he horse 's leg and in that way muffle the clatter which he must else have make in ride up a flag alley that lead to he stable at the time of he execution for highway robbery i be study under cruickshank : and the man 's figure be so uncommonly fine that no money or exertion be spare to get into possession of he with the least possible delay by the connivance of the under-sheriff he be cut down within the legal time and instantly put into a chaise and four so that when he reach cruickshank 's he be positively not dead mr -- a young student at that time have the honor of give he the _ coup de grâce _ and finish the sentence of the law this remarkable anecdote which seem to imply that all the gentleman in the dissecting-room be amateur of we class strike I a good deal and i be repeat it one day to a lancashire lady who thereupon inform I that she have herself live in the neighborhood of that highwayman and well remember two circumstance which combine in the opinion of all he neighbor to fix upon he the credit of mr ruscombe 's affair one be the fact of he absence for a whole fortnight at the period of that murder : the other that within a very little time after the neighborhood of this highwayman be deluge with dollar : now mr ruscombe be know to have hoard about two thousand of that coin be the artist however who he might the affair remain a durable monument of he genius for such be the impression of awe and the sense of power leave behind by the strength of conception manifest in this murder that no tenant -lrb- as i be tell in 1810 -rrb- have be find up to that time for mr ruscombe 's house but whilst i thus eulogize the ruscombian case let I not be suppose to overlook the many other specimen of extraordinary merit spread over the face of this century such case indeed as that of miss bland or of captain donnellan and sir theophilus boughton shall never have any countenance from I fie on these dealer in poison say i : can they not keep to the old honest way of cut throat without introduce such abominable innovation from italy i consider all these poisoning case compare with the legitimate style as no better than wax-work by the side of sculpture or a lithographic print by the side of a fine volpato but dismiss these there remain many excellent work of art in a pure style such as nobody need be ashamed to own as every candid connoisseur will admit _ candid _ observe i say for great allowance must be make in these case no artist can ever be sure of carry through he own fine preconception awkward disturbance will arise people will not submit to have they throat cut quietly they will run they will kick they will bite and whilst the portrait painter often have to complain of too much torpor in he subject the artist in we line be generally embarrass by too much animation at the same time however disagreeable to the artist this tendency in murder to excite and irritate the subject be certainly one of its advantage to the world in general which we ought not to overlook since it favor the development of latent talent jeremy taylor notice with admiration the extraordinary leap which people will take under the influence of fear there be a striking instance of this in the recent case of the m ` keand the boy clear a height such as he will never clear again to he die day talent also of the most brilliant description for thump and indeed for all the gymnastic exercise have sometimes be develop by the panic which accompany we artist talent else bury and hide under a bushel to the possessor as much as to they friend i remember a interesting illustration of this fact in a case which i learn in germany ride one day in the neighborhood of munich i overtook a distinguished amateur of we society whose name i shall conceal this gentleman inform I that find himself wearied with the frigid pleasure -lrb- so he call they -rrb- of mere amateurship he have quit england for the continent -- mean to practice a little professionally for this purpose he resort to germany conceive the police in that part of europe to be more heavy and drowsy than elsewhere he _ debut _ as a practitioner take place at mannheim and know I to be a brother amateur he freely communicate the whole of he maiden adventure opposite to my lodging say he live a baker : he be somewhat of a miser and live quite alone whether it be he great expanse of chalky face or what else i know not -- but the fact be i ` fancy ' he and resolve to commence business upon he throat which by the way he always carry bare -- a fashion which be very irritating to my desire precisely at eight o'clock in the evening i observe that he regularly shut up he window one night i watch he when thus engage -- bolt in after he -- lock the door -- and address he with great suavity acquaint he with the nature of my errand at the same time advise he to make no resistance which would be mutually unpleasant so say i draw out my tool and be proceed to operate but at this spectacle the baker who seem to have be strike by catalepsy at my first announce awake into tremendous agitation ' i will _ not _ be murder ' he shriek aloud ` what for will i lose my precious throat ' ` what for ' say i ` if for no other reason for this -- that you put alum into you bread but no matter alum or no alum -lrb- for i be resolve to forestall any argument on that point -rrb- know that i be a virtuoso in the art of murder -- be desirous of improve myself in its detail -- and be enamored of you vast surface of throat to which i be determine to be a customer ' ` be it so ' say he ` but i 'll find you custom in another line ' and so say he throw himself into a boxing attitude the very idea of he boxing strike I as ludicrous it be true a london baker have distinguish himself in the ring and become know to fame under the title of the master of the roll but he be young and unspoiled : whereas this man be a monstrous feather-bed in person fifty year old and totally out of condition spite of all this however and contend against I who be a master in the art he make so desperate a defense that many time i fear he might turn the table upon I and that i a amateur might be murder by a rascally baker what a situation mind of sensibility will sympathize with my anxiety how severe it be you may understand by this that for the first thirteen round the baker have the advantage round the fourteenth i receive a blow on the right eye which close it up in the end i believe this be my salvation : for the anger it rouse in I be so great that in this and every one of the three follow round i floor the baker round 18th the baker come up piping and manifestly the worse for wear he geometrical exploit in the four last round have do he no good however he show some skill in stop a message which i be send to he cadaverous mug in deliver which my foot slip and i go down round 19th survey the baker i become ashamed of have be so much bother by a shapeless mass of dough and i go in fiercely and administer some severe punishment a rally take place -- both go down -- baker undermost -- ten to three on amateur round 20th the baker jump up with surprising agility indeed he manage he pin capitally and fight wonderfully consider that he be drench in perspiration but the shine be now take out of he and he game be the mere effect of panic it be now clear that he could not last much longer in the course of this round we try the weave system in which i have greatly the advantage and hit he repeatedly on the conk my reason for this be that he conk be cover with carbuncle and i think i should vex he by take such liberty with he conk which in fact i do the three next round the master of the roll stagger about like a cow on the ice see how matter stand in round twenty-fourth i whisper something into he ear which send he down like a shot it be nothing more than my private opinion of the value of he throat at a annuity office this little confidential whisper affect he greatly the very perspiration be freeze on he face and for the next two round i have it all my own way and when i call _ time _ for the twenty-seventh round he lay like a log on the floor after which say i to the amateur it may be presume that you accomplish you purpose you be right say he mildly i do and a great satisfaction you know it be to my mind for by this mean i kill two bird with one stone meaning that he have both thump the baker and murder he now for the life of I i could not see _ that _ for on the contrary to my mind it appear that he have take two stone to kill one bird have be oblige to take the conceit out of he first with he fist and then with he tool but no matter for he logic the moral of he story be good for it show what a astonishing stimulus to latent talent be contain in any reasonable prospect of be murder a pursy unwieldy half cataleptic baker of mannheim have absolutely fight six-and-twenty round with a accomplished english boxer merely upon this inspiration so greatly be natural genius exalt and sublime by the genial presence of he murderer really gentleman when one hear of such thing as these it become a duty perhaps a little to soften that extreme asperity with which most man speak of murder to hear people talk you would suppose that all the disadvantage and inconvenience be on the side of be murder and that there be none at all in _ not _ be murder but considerate man think otherwise certainly say jeremy taylor it be a less temporal evil to fall by the rudeness of a sword than the violence of a fever : and the axe -lrb- to which he might have add the ship-carpenter 's mallet and the crow-bar -rrb- a much less affliction than a strangury very true the bishop talk like a wise man and a amateur as he be and another great philosopher marcus aurelius be equally above the vulgar prejudice on this subject he declare it to be one of the noblest function of reason to know whether it be time to walk out of the world or not -lrb- book iii coller ' translation -rrb- no sort of knowledge be rarer than this surely _ that _ man must be a most philanthropic character who undertake to instruct people in this branch of knowledge grati and at no little hazard to himself all this however i throw out only in the way of speculation to future moralist declare in the meantime my own private conviction that very few man commit murder upon philanthropic or patriotic principle and repeat what i have already say once at least -- that as to the majority of murderer they be very incorrect character with respect to william 's murder the sublimest and most entire in they excellence that ever be commit i shall not allow myself to speak incidentally nothing less than a entire lecture or even a entire course of lecture would suffice to expound they merit but one curious fact connect with he case i shall mention because it seem to imply that the blaze of he genius absolutely dazzle the eye of criminal justice you all remember i doubt not that the instrument with which he execute he first great work -lrb- the murder of the marr -rrb- be a ship-carpenter 's mallet and a knife now the mallet belong to a old swede one john petersen and bear he initial this instrument william leave behind he in marr 's house and it fall into the hand of the magistrate now gentleman it be a fact that the publication of this circumstance of the initial lead immediately to the apprehension of william and if make earlier would have prevent he second great work -lrb- the murder of the williamson -rrb- which take place precisely twelve day after but the magistrate keep back this fact from the public for the entire twelve day and until that second work be accomplish that finish they publish it apparently feel that william have now do enough for he fame and that he glory be at length place beyond the reach of accident as to mr thurtell 's case i know not what to say naturally i have every disposition to think highly of my predecessor in the chair of this society and i acknowledge that he lecture be unexceptionable but speak ingenuously i do really think that he principal performance as a artist have be much overrated i admit that at first i be myself carry away by the general enthusiasm on the morning when the murder be make know in london there be the fullest meeting of amateur that i have ever know since the day of william old bed-ridden connoisseur who have get into a peevish way of sneering and complain that there be nothing do now hobble down to we club-room : such hilarity such benign expression of general satisfaction i have rarely witness on every side you see people shake hand congratulating each other and form dinner party for the evening and nothing be to be hear but triumphant challenge of -- well will _ this _ do be _ this _ the right thing be you satisfy at last but in the midst of this i remember we all grow silent on hear the old cynical amateur l s -- that _ laudator tempori actus _ stump along with he wooden leg he enter the room with he usual scowl and as he advance he continue to growl and stutter the whole way -- not a original idea in the whole piece -- mere plagiarism -- base plagiarism from hint that i throw out besides he style be as hard as albert durer and as coarse as fuselus many think that this be mere jealousy and general waspishness but i confess that when the first glow of enthusiasm have subside i have find most judicious critic to agree that there be something _ falsetto _ in the style of thurtell the fact be he be a member of we society which naturally give a friendly bias to we judgment and he person be universally familiar to the cockney which give he with the whole london public a temporary popularity that he pretension be not capable of support for _ opinionum commenta delet die naturæ judicium confirmat _ there be however a unfinished design of thurtell 's for the murder of a man with a pair of dumb-bell which i admire greatly it be a mere outline that he never complete but to my mind it seem every way superior to he chief work i remember that there be great regret express by some amateur that this sketch should have be leave in a unfinished state : but there i can not agree with they for the fragment and first bold outline of original artist have often a felicity about they which be apt to vanish in the management of the detail the case of the m ` keands i consider far beyond the vaunted performance of thurtell -- indeed above all praise and bearing that relation in fact to the immortal work of william which the æneid bear to the iliad but it be now time that i should say a few word about the principle of murder not with a view to regulate you practice but you judgment : as to old woman and the mob of newspaper reader they be pleased with anything provide it be bloody enough but the mind of sensibility require something more _ first _ then let we speak of the kind of person who be adapt to the purpose of the murderer _ secondly _ of the place where _ thirdly _ of the time when and other little circumstance as to the person i suppose it be evident that he ought to be a good man because if he be not he might himself by possibility be contemplate murder at the very time and such diamond-cut-diamond tussle though pleasant enough where nothing better be stir be really not what a critic can allow himself to call murder i could mention some people -lrb- i name no name -rrb- who have be murder by other people in a dark lane and so far all seem correct enough but on look farther into the matter the public have become aware that the murder party be himself at the moment plan to rob he murderer at the least and possibly to murder he if he have be strong enough whenever that be the case or may be think to be the case farewell to all the genuine effect of the art for the final purpose of murder consider as a fine art be precisely the same as that of tragedy in aristotle 's account of it viz to cleanse the heart by means of pity and terror now terror there may be but how can there be any pity for one tiger destroy by another tiger it be also evident that the person select ought not to be a public character for instance no judicious artist would have attempt to murder abraham newland for the case be this everybody read so much about abraham newland and so few people ever see he that there be a fix belief that he be a abstract idea and i remember that once when i happen to mention that i have dine at a coffee-house in company with abraham newland everybody look scornfully at I as though i have pretend to have play at billiards with prester john or to have have a affair of honor with the pope and by the way the pope would be a very improper person to murder : for he have such a virtual ubiquity as the father of christendom and like the cuckoo be so often hear but never see that i suspect most people regard _ he _ also as a abstract idea where indeed a public character be in the habit of give dinner with every delicacy of the season the case be very different : every person be satisfy that _ he _ be no abstract idea and therefore there can be no impropriety in murder he only that he murder will fall into the class of assassination which i have not yet treat _ thirdly _ the subject choose ought to be in good health : for it be absolutely barbarous to murder a sick person who be usually quite unable to bear it on this principle no cockney ought to be choose who be above twenty-five for after that age he be sure to be dyspeptic or at least if a man will hunt in that warren he ought to murder a couple at one time if the cockney choose should be tailor he will of course think it he duty on the old established equation to murder eighteen and here in this attention to the comfort of sick people you will observe the usual effect of a fine art to soften and refine the feeling the world in general gentleman be very bloody-minded and all they want in a murder be a copious effusion of blood gaudy display in this point be enough for _ they _ but the enlighten connoisseur be more refine in he taste and from we art as from all the other liberal art when thoroughly cultivate the result be -- to improve and to humanize the heart so true be it that -- -- ingenuas didicisse fideliter arte emollit mores nec sinit esse fero a philosophic friend well know for he philanthropy and general benignity suggest that the subject choose ought also to have a family of young child wholly dependent on he exertion by way of deepen the pathos and undoubtedly this be a judicious caution yet i would not insist too keenly on this condition severe good taste unquestionably demand it but still where the man be otherwise unobjectionable in point of moral and health i would not look with too curious a jealousy to a restriction which might have the effect of narrow the artist 's sphere so much for the person as to the time the place and the tool i have many thing to say which at present i have no room for the good sense of the practitioner have usually direct he to night and privacy yet there have not be want case where this rule be depart from with excellent effect in respect to time mr ruscombe 's case be a beautiful exception which i have already notice and in respect both to time and place there be a fine exception in the annals of edinburgh -lrb- year 1805 -rrb- familiar to every child in edinburgh but which have unaccountably be defraud of its due portion of fame amongst english amateur the case i mean be that of a porter to one of the bank who be murder whilst carry a bag of money in broad daylight on turn out of the high street one of the most public street in europe and the murderer be to this hour undiscovered sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tcmpus singulum dum captus circumvectamur amore and now gentleman in conclusion let I again solemnly disclaim all pretension on my own part to the character of a professional man i never attempt any murder in my life except in the year 1801 upon the body of a tom-cat and _ that _ turn out differently from my intention my purpose i own be downright murder semper ego auditor tantum say i nunquamne reponam and i go down stair in search of tom at one o'clock on a dark night with the animus and no doubt with the fiendish look of a murderer but when i find he he be in the act of plunder the pantry of bread and other thing now this give a new turn to the affair for the time be one of general scarcity when even christian be reduce to the use of potato-bread rice-bread and all sort of thing it be downright treason in a tom-cat to be waste good wheaten-bread in the way he be do it instantly become a patriotic duty to put he to death and as i raise aloft and shake the glittering steel i fancy myself rise like brutus effulgent from a crowd of patriot and as i stab he i call aloud on tully 's name and bid the father of he country hail since then what wander thought i may have have of attempt the life of a ancient ewe of a superannuated hen and such small deer be lock up in the secret of my own breast but for the higher department of the art i confess myself to be utterly unfit my ambition do not rise so high no gentleman in the word of horace -- fungo vice coti excutum reddere ere quæ ferrum valet exsor ipsa secandus second paper on murder consider as one of the fine art doctor north : you be a liberal man : liberal in the true classical sense not in the slang sense of modern politician and education-monger be so i be sure that you will sympathize with my case i be a ill-used man dr north -- particularly ill use and with you permission i will briefly explain how a black scene of calumny will be lay open but you doctor will make all thing square again one frown from you direct to the proper quarter or a warning shake of the crutch will set I right in public opinion which at present i be sorry to say be rather hostile to I and mine -- all owe to the wicked art of slanderer but you shall hear a good many year ago you may remember that i come forward in the character of a _ dilettante _ in murder perhaps _ dilettante _ may be too strong a word _ connoisseur _ be better suit to the scruple and infirmity of public taste i suppose there be no harm in _ that _ at least a man be not bind to put he eye ear and understand into he breeches pocket when he meet with a murder if he be not in a downright comatose state i suppose he must see that one murder be better or worse than another in point of good taste murder have they little difference and shades of merit as well as statue picture oratorio cameo intaglio or what not you may be angry with the man for talk too much or too publicly -lrb- as to the too much that i deny -- a man can never cultivate he taste too highly -rrb- but you must allow he to think at any rate and you doctor you think i be sure both deeply and correctly on the subject well would you believe it all my neighbor come to hear of that little æsthetic essay which you have publish and unfortunately hear at the very same time of a club that i as connect with and a dinner at which i preside -- both tend to the same little object as the essay viz the diffusion of a just taste among she majesty 's subject they get up the most barbarous calumny against I in particular they say that i or that the club which come to the same thing have offer bounty on well conduct homicide -- with a scale of drawback in case of any one defect or flaw accord to a table issue to private friend now doctor i 'll tell you the whole truth about the dinner and the club and you 'll see how malicious the world be but first let I tell you confidentially what my real principle be upon the matter in question as to murder i never commit one in my life it be a well known thing amongst all my friend i can get a paper to certify as much sign by lot of people indeed if you come to that i doubt whether many people could produce as strong a certificate mine would be as big as a table-cloth there be indeed one member of the club who pretend to say that he catch I once make too free with he throat on a club night after every body else have retire but observe he shuffle in he story accord to he state of civilation when not far go he contents himself with say that he catch I ogle he throat and that i be melancholy for some week after and that my voice sound in a way express to the nice ear of a connoisseur _ the sense of opportunity lose _ -- but the club all know that he be a disappointed man himself and that he speak querulously at time about the fatal neglect of a man 's come abroad without he tool besides all this be a affair between two amateur and every body make allowance for little asperity and soreness in such a case but say you if no murderer my correspondent may have encourage or even have bespoke a murder no upon my honor -- nothing of the kind and that be the very point i wish to argue for you satisfaction the truth be i be a very particular man in everything relate to murder and perhaps i carry my delicacy too far the stagyrite most justly and possibly with a view to my case place virtue in the -lrb- greek : to meson -rrb- or middle point between two extreme a golden mean be certainly what every man should aim at but it be easier talking than do and my infirmity be notoriously too much milkiness of heart i find it difficult to maintain that steady equatorial line between the two pole of too much murder on the one hand and too little on the other i be too soft -- doctor too soft and people get excuse through I -- nay go through life without a attempt make upon they that ought not to be excuse i believe if i have the management of thing there would hardly be a murder from year 's end to year 's end in fact i be for virtue and goodness and all that sort of thing and two instance i 'll give you to what a extremity i carry my virtue the first may seem a trifle but not if you know my nephew who be certainly bear to be hang and would have be so long ago but for my restrain voice he be horribly ambitious and think himself a man of cultivate taste in most branch of murder whereas in fact he have not one idea on the subject but such as he have steal from I this be so well know that the club have twice blackball he though every indulgence be show to he as my relative people come to I and say -- now really president we would do much to serve a relative of yours but still what can be say you know yourself that he 'll disgrace we if we be to elect he why the next thing we should hear of would be some vile butcherly murder by way of justify we choice and what sort of a concern would it be you know as well as we do that it would be a disgraceful affair more worthy of the shambles than of a artist 's _ attelier _ he would fall upon some great big man some huge farmer return drunk from a fair there would be plenty of blood and _ that _ he would expect we to take in lieu of taste finish scenical grouping then again how would he tool why most probably with a cleaver and a couple of pave stone : so that the whole _ coup d'oeil _ would remind you rather of some hideous ogre or cyclops than of the delicate operator of the nineteenth century the picture be draw with the hand of truth _ that _ i could not but allow and as to personal feeling in the matter i dismiss they from the first the next morning i speak to my nephew -- i be delicately situate as you see but i determine that no consideration should induce I to flinch from my duty john say i you seem to I to have take a erroneous view of life and its duty push on by ambition you be dream rather of what it might be glorious to attempt than what it would be possible for you to accomplish believe I it be not necessary to a man 's respectability that he should commit a murder many a man have pass through life most respectably without attempt any species of homicide -- good bad or indifferent it be you first duty to ask yourself _ quid valeant humerus quid ferre recusent _ we can not all be brilliant man in this life and it be for you interest to be contented rather with a humble station well fill than to shock every body with failure the more conspicuous by contrast with the ostentation of they promise john make no answer he look very sulky at the moment and i be in high hope that i have save a near relation from make a fool of himself by attempt what be as much beyond he capacity as a epic poem other however tell I that he be meditate a revenge upon I and the whole club but let this be as it may _ liberavus animam meam _ and as you see have run some risk with a wish to diminish the amount of homicide but the other case still more forcibly illustrate my virtue a man come to I as a candidate for the place of my servant just then vacant he have the reputation of have dabble a little in we art some say not without merit what startle I however be that he suppose this art to be part of he regular duty in my service now that be a thing i would not allow so i say at once richard -lrb- or jame as the case might be -rrb- you misunderstand my character if a man will and must practice this difficult -lrb- and allow I to add dangerous -rrb- branch of art -- if he have a overrule genius for it why he might as well pursue he study whilst live in my service as in another 's and also i may observe that it can do no harm either to himself or to the subject on whom he operate that he should be guide by man of more taste than himself genius may do much but long study of the art must always entitle a man to offer advice so far i will go -- general principle i will suggest but as to any particular case once for all i will have nothing to do with it never tell I of any special work of art you be meditate -- i set my face against it _ in toto _ for if once a man indulge himself in murder very soon he come to think little of rob and from rob he come next to drinking and sabbath-breaking and from that to incivility and procrastination once begin upon this downward path you never know where you be to stop many a man have date he ruin from some murder or other that perhaps he think little of at the time _ principii obsta _ -- that be my rule such be my speech and i have always act up to it so if that be not be virtuous i should be glad to know what be but now about the dinner and the club the club be not particularly of my creation it arise pretty much as other similar association for the propagation of truth and the communication of new idea rather from the necessity of thing than upon any one man 's suggestion as to the dinner if any man more than another could be hold responsible for that it be a member know amongst we by the name of _ toad-in-the-hole _ he be so call from he gloomy misanthropical disposition which lead he into constant disparagement of all modern murder as vicious abortion belong to no authentic school of art the finest performance of we own age he snarl at cynically and at length this querulous humor grow upon he so much and he become so notorious as a _ laudator tentpori actus _ that few people care to seek he society this make he still more fierce and truculent he go about mutter and growl wherever you meet he he be soliloquize and say despicable pretender -- without group -- without two idea upon handling -- without -- and there you lose he at length existence seem to be painful to he he rarely speak he seem converse with phantom in the air he housekeeper inform we that he reading be nearly confine to _ god 's revenge upon murder _ by reynold and a more ancient book of the same title notice by sir walter scott in he _ fortune of nigel _ sometimes perhaps he might read in the newgate calendar down to the year 1788 but he never look into a book more recent in fact he have a theory with regard to the french revolution as have be the great cause of degeneration in murder very soon sir he use to say man will have lose the art of kill poultry : the very rudiment of the art will have perish in the year 1811 he retire from general society toad-in-the-hole be no more see in any public resort we miss he from he wonted haunt -- nor up the lawn nor at the wood be he by the side of the main conduit he listless length at noontide he would stretch and pore upon the filth that muddle by even dog be not what they be sir -- not what they should be i remember in my grandfather 's time that some dog have a idea of murder i have know a mastiff lie in ambush for a rival sir and murder he with please circumstance of good taste yes sir i know a tom-cat that be a assassin but now -- and then the subject grow too painful he dash he hand to he forehead and go off abruptly in a homeward direction towards he favorite conduit where he be see by a amateur in such a state that he think it dangerous to address he soon after he shut himself entirely up it be understand that he have resign himself to melancholy and at length the prevail notion be that toad-in-the-hole have hang himself the world be wrong _ there _ as it have be on some other question toad-in-the-hole might be sleep but dead he be not and of that we soon have ocular proof one morning in 1812 a amateur surprised we with the news that he have see toad-in-the-hole brushing with hasty step the dew away to meet the postman by the conduit side even that be something : how much more to hear that he have shave he beard -- have lay aside he sad-colored clothes and be adorn like a bridegroom of ancient day what could be the meaning of all this be toad-in-the-hole mad or how soon after the secret be explain -- in more than a figurative sense the murder be out for in come the london morning papers by which it appear that but three day before a murder the most superb of the century by many degree have occur in the heart of london i need hardly say that this be the great exterminate _ chef-d'oeuvre _ of william at mr marr 's no 29 ratcliffe highway that be the _ début _ of the artist at least for anything the public know what occur at mr williamson 's twelve night afterwards -- the second work turn out from the same chisel -- some people pronounce even superior but toad-in-the-hole always reclaim -- he be even angry at comparison this vulgar _ gout de comparaison _ as la bruyère call it he would often remark will be we ruin each work have its own separate characteristic -- each in and for itself be incomparable one perhaps might suggest the _ iliad _ -- the other the _ odyssey _ : what do you get by such comparison neither ever be or will be surpass and when you have talk for hour you must still come back to that vain however as all criticism might be he often say that volume might be write on each case for itself and he even propose to publish in quarto on the subject meantime how have toad-in-the-hole happen to hear of this great work of art so early in the morning he have receive a account by express dispatch by a correspondent in london who watch the progress of art on _ toady 's _ behalf with a general commission to send off a special express at whatever cost in the event of any estimable work appear -- how much more upon occasion of a _ ne plus ultra _ in art the express arrive in the night-time toad-in-the-hole be then go to bed he have be mutter and grumble for hour but of course he be call up on read the account he throw he arm round the express call he he brother and he preserver settle a pension upon he for three life and express he regret at not have it in he power to knight he we on we part -- we amateur i mean -- have hear that he be abroad and therefore have _ not _ hang himself make sure of soon see he amongst we accordingly he soon arrive knock over the porter on he road to the reading-room he seize every man 's hand as he pass he -- wring it almost frantically and keep ejaculate why now here 's something like a murder -- this be the real thing -- this be genuine -- this be what you can approve can recommend to a friend : this -- say every man on reflection -- this be the thing that ought to be then look at particular friend he say -- why jack how be you why tom how be you bless I you look ten year younger than when i last saw you no sir i reply it be you who look ten year younger do i well i should ` nt wonder if i do such work be enough to make we all young and in fact the general opinion be that toad-in-the-hole would have die but for this regeneration of art which he call a second age of leo the tenth and it be we duty he say solemnly to commemorate it at present and _ en attendant _ -- rather as a occasion for a public participation in public sympathy than as in itself any commensurate testimony of we interest -- he propose that the club should meet and dine together a splendid public dinner therefore be give by the club to which all amateur be invite from a distance of one hundred mile of this dinner there be ample short-hand note amongst the archive of the club but they be not extend to speak diplomatically and the reporter be miss -- i believe murder meantime in year long after that day and on a occasion perhaps equally interesting viz the turn up of thug and thuggism another dinner be give of this i myself keep note for fear of another accident to the short-hand reporter and i here subjoin they toad-in-the-hole i must mention be present at this dinner in fact it be one of its sentimental incident be as old as the valley at the dinner of 1812 naturally he be as old as the hill at the thug dinner of 1838 he have take to wear he beard again why or with what view it pass my persimmon to tell you but so it be and he appearance be most benign and venerable nothing could equal the angelic radiance of he smile as he inquire after the unfortunate reporter -lrb- whom as a piece of private scandal i should tell you that he be himself suppose to have murder in a rapture of creative art : -rrb- the answer be with roar of laughter from the under-sheriff of we county -- non est inventus toad-in-the-hole laugh outrageously at this : in fact we all think he be choke and at the earnest request of the company a musical composer furnish a most beautiful glee upon the occasion which be sing five time after dinner with universal applause and inextinguishable laughter the word be these -lrb- and the chorus so contrived as most beautifully to mimic the peculiar laughter of toad-in-the-hole : -rrb- -- et interrogatum est à toad-in-the hole -- ubus est ille reporter et responsum est cum cachinno -- non est inventus chorus deinde iteratum est ab omnibus cum cachinnatione undulante -- non est inventus toad-in-the-hole i ought to mention about nine year before when a express from edinburgh bring he the earliest intelligence of the burke-and-hare revolution in the art go mad upon the spot and instead of a pension to the express for even one life or a knighthood endeavor to burke he in consequence of which he be put into a strait waistcoat and that be the reason we have no dinner then but now all of we be alive and kick strait-waistcoater and other in fact not one absentee be report upon the entire roll there be also many foreign amateur present dinner be over and the cloth draw there be a general call make for the new glee of _ non est inventus _ but as this would have interfere with the requisite gravity of the company during the earlier toast i overrule the call after the national toast have be give the first official toast of the day be _ the old man of the mountain _ -- drunk in solemn silence toad-in-the-hole return thanks in a neat speech he liken himself to the old man of the mountain in a few brief allusion that make the company absolutely yell with laughter and he conclude with give the health of _ mr von hammer _ with many thanks to he for he learn history of the old man and he subject the assassin upon this i rise and say that doubtless most of the company be aware of the distinguished place assign by orientalist to the very learn turkish scholar von hammer the austrian that he have make the profoundest research into we art as connect with those early and eminent artist the syrian assassin in the period of the crusader that he work have be for several year deposit as a rare treasure of art in the library of the club even the author 's name gentleman point he out as the historian of we art -- von hammer -- yes yes interrupted toad-in-the-hole who never can sit still -- yes yes von hammer -- he be the man for a _ malleus hæreticorum _ : think rightly of we art or he be the man to tickle you catastrophe you all know what consideration william bestow on the hammer or the ship carpenter 's mallet which be the same thing gentleman i give you another great hammer -- charle the hammer the marteau or in old french the martel -- he hammer the saracen till they be all as dead as door-nail -- he do believe I _ charle martel _ with all the honor but the explosion of toad-in-the-hole together with the uproarious cheer for the grandpapa of charlemagne have now make the company unmanageable the orchestra be again challenge with shout the stormiest for the new glee i make again a powerful effort to overrule the challenge i might as well have talk to the wind i foresee a tempestuous evening and i order myself to be strengthen with three waiter on each side the vice-president with as many symptom of unruly enthusiasm be begin to show out and i own that i myself be considerably excite as the orchestra open with its storm of music and the impassioned glee begin -- _ et interrogatum est à toad-in-the-hole -- ubus est ille reporter _ and the frenzy of the passion become absolutely convulse as the full chorus fall in -- _ et iteratum est ab omnibus -- non est inventus _ by this time i see how thing be go : wine and music be make most of the amateur wild particularly toad-in-the-hole though considerably above a hundred year old be get as vicious as a young leopard it be a fix impression with the company that he have murder the reporter in the year 1812 since which time -lrb- viz twenty-six year -rrb- ille reporter have be constantly report non est inventus consequently the glee about himself which of itself be most tumultuous and jubilant carry he off he foot like the famous choral song amongst the citizen of abdera nobody could hear it without a contagious desire for fall back into the agitating music of et interrogatum est à toad-in-the-hole & c i enjoin vigilance upon my assessor and the business of the evening proceed the next toast be -- _ the jewish sicarius _ upon which i make the follow explanation to the company : -- gentleman i be sure it will interest you all to hear that the assassin ancient as they be have a race of predecessor in the very same country all over syrium but particularly in palestine during the early year of the emperor nero there be a band of murderer who prosecute they study in a very novel manner they do not practice in the night-time or in lonely place but justly consider that great crowd be in themselves a sort of darkness by means of the dense pressure and the impossibility of find out who it be that give the blow they mingle with mob everywhere particularly at the great paschal feast in jerusalem where they actually have the audacity as josephus assure we to press into the temple -- and whom should they choose for operate upon but jonathan himself the pontifex maximus they murder he gentleman as beautifully as if they have have he alone on a moonless night in a dark lane and when it be ask who be the murderer and where he be -- why then it be answer interrupted toad-in-the-hole _ non est inventus _ and then in spite of all i could do or say the orchestra open and the whole company begin -- et interrogatum est à toad-in-the-hole -- ubus est ille sicarius et responsum est ab omnibus -- _ non est inventus _ when the tempestuous chorus have subside i begin again : -- gentleman you will find a very circumstantial account of the sicarius in at least three different part of josephus once in book xx sect v c 8 of he _ antiquity _ once in book i of he _ war _ : but in sect 10 of the chapter first cite you will find a particular description of they tooling this be what he say -- ` they tool with small scymetar not much different from the persian _ acinacæ _ but more curved and for all the world most like the roman sickle or _ sicæ _ ' it be perfectly magnificent gentleman to hear the sequel of they history perhaps the only case on record where a regular army of murderer be assemble a _ justus exercitus _ be in the case of these _ sicarius _ they muster in such strength in the wilderness that festus himself be oblige to march against they with the roman legionary force upon which toad-in-the-hole that curse interrupter break out a-singing -- et interrogatum est à toad-in-the-hole -- ubus est ille exercitus et responsum est ab omnibus -- non est inventus no no toad -- you be wrong for once : that army _ be _ find and be all cut to piece in the desert heaven gentleman what a sublime picture the roman legion -- the wilderness -- jerusalem in the distance -- a army of murderer in the foreground mr r a member now give the next toast -- to the further improvement of tooling and thanks to the committee for they service mr l on behalf of the committee who have report on that subject return thanks he make a interesting extract from the report by which it appear how very much stress have be lay formerly on the mode of tooling by the father both greek and latin in confirmation of this please fact he make a very striking statement in reference to the earliest work of antediluvian art father mersenne that learn roman catholic in page one thousand four hundred and thirty-one -lrb- 1 -rrb- of he operose commentary on genesis mention on the authority of several rabbi that the quarrel of cain with abel be about a young woman that by various account cain have tool with he tooth -lrb- abelem fuisse _ morsibus _ dilaceratum à cain -rrb- by many other with the jaw-bone of a ass which be the tooling adopt by most painter but it be please to the mind of sensibility to know that as science expand sounder view be adopt one author contend for a pitchfork st chrysostom for a sword irenæus for a scythe and prudentius for a hedging-bill this last writer deliver he opinion thus : -- frater probatæ sanctitati æmulus germana curvo collum frangit sarculo : _ ie _ he brother jealous of he attested sanctity fracture he brotherly throat with a curved hedging-bill all which be respectfully submit by you committee not so much as decisive of the question -lrb- for it be not -rrb- but in order to impress upon the youthful mind the importance which have ever be attach to the quality of the tooling by such man as chrysostom and irenæus -lrb- footnote 1 : page one thousand four hundred and thirty-one -- _ literally _ good reader and no joke at all -rrb- dang irenæus say toad-in-the-hole who now rise impatiently to give the next toast : -- we irish friend and a speedy revolution in they mode of tooling as well as everything else connect with the art gentleman i 'll tell you the plain truth every day of the year we take up a paper we read the opening of a murder we say this be good this be charming this be excellent but behold you scarcely have we read a little farther before the word tipperary or ballina-something betray the irish manufacture instantly we loath it we call to the waiter we say waiter take away this paper send it out of the house it be absolutely offensive to all just taste ' i appeal to every man whether on find a murder -lrb- otherwise perhaps promising enough -rrb- to be irish he do not feel himself as much insult as when madeira be order he find it to be cape or when take up what he take to be a mushroom it turn out what child call a toad-stool tithe politics or something wrong in principle vitiate every irish murder gentleman this must be reform or ireland will not be a land to live in at least if we do live there we must import all we murder that be clear toad-in-the-hole sit down growl with suppress wrath and the universal hear hear sufficiently show that he speak the general feeling the next toast be -- the sublime epoch of burkism and harism this be drunk with enthusiasm and one of the member who speak to the question make a very curious communication to the company : -- gentleman we fancy burkism to be a pure invention of we own time : and in fact no pancirollus have ever enumerate this branch of art when write _ de rebus deperditis _ still i have ascertain that the essential principle of the art _ be _ know to the ancient although like the art of painting upon glass of make the myrrhine cup & c it be lose in the dark age for want of encouragement in the famous collection of greek epigram make by planude be one upon a very charming little case of burkism : it be a perfect little gem of art the epigram itself i can not lay my hand upon at this moment but the follow be a abstract of it by salmasius as i find it in he note on vopiscus : ` est et elegans epigramma lucilius -lrb- well he might call it elegan -rrb- ubus medicus et pollinctor de compacto sic egerunt ut medicus ægros omne curæ suæ commisso occideret : ' this be the basis of the contract you see that on the one part the doctor for himself and he assign doth undertake and contract duly and truly to murder all the patient commit to he charge : but why there lie the beauty of the case -- ` et ut pollinctori amico suo traderet pollingendo ' the _ pollinctor _ you be aware be a person whose business it be to dress and prepare dead body for burial the original ground of the transaction appear to have be sentimental : ` he be my friend ' say the murderous doctor ` he be dear to I ' in speaking of the pollinctor but the law gentleman be stern and harsh : the law will not hear of these tender motive : to sustain a contract of this nature in law it be essential that a ` consideration ' should be give now what _ be _ the consideration for thus far all be on the side of the pollinctor : he will be well pay for he service but meantime the generous the noble-minded doctor get nothing what _ be _ the little consideration again i ask which the law would insist on the doctor 's take you shall hear : ` et ut pollinctor vicissim -lrb- greek : telamona -rrb- quo furabatur de pollinctione mortuorum medico mitteret doni ad alliganda vulnera eorurn quos curabat ' now the case be clear : the whole go on a principle of reciprocity which would have keep up the trade for ever the doctor be also a surgeon : he could not murder _ all _ he patient : some of the surgical patient must be retain intact _ re infectâ _ for these he want linen bandage but unhappily the roman wear woollen on which account they bath so often meantime there _ be _ linen to be have in rome but it be monstrously dear and the -lrb- greek : telamone -rrb- or linen swathing bandage in which superstition oblige they to bind up corpse would answer capitally for the surgeon the doctor therefore contract to furnish he friend with a constant succession of corpse provide and be it understand always that he say friend in return should supply he with one half of the article he would receive from the friend of the party murder or to be murder the doctor invariably recommend he invaluable friend the pollinctor -lrb- whom let we call the undertaker -rrb- the undertaker with equal regard to the sacred rights of friendship uniformly recommend the doctor like pylade and oreste they be model of a perfect friendship : in they life they be lovely and on the gallows it be to be hope they be not divide gentleman it make I laugh horribly when i think of those two friend draw and redraw on each other : ` pollinctor in account with doctor debtor by sixteen corpse creditor by forty-five bandage two of which damage ' they name unfortunately be lose but i conceive they must have be quintus burkius and publius harius by the way gentleman have anybody hear lately of hare i understand he be comfortably settle in ireland considerably to the west and do a little business now and then but as he observe with a sigh only as a retailer -- nothing like the fine thrive wholesale concern so carelessly blow up at edinburgh ` you see what come of neglect business ' -- be the chief moral the -lrb- greek : epimutheon -rrb- as æsop would say which he draw from he past experience at length come the toast of the day -- _ thugdom in all its branch _ the speech _ attempt _ at this crisis of the dinner be past all count but the applause be so furious the music so stormy and the crash of glass so incessant from the general resolution never again to drink a inferior toast from the same glass that my power be not equal to the task of report besides which toad-in-the-hole now become quite ungovernable he keep firing pistol in every direction send he servant for a blunderbuss and talk of load with ball-cartridge we conceive that he former madness have return at the mention of burke and hare or that be again weary of life he have resolve to go off in a general massacre this we could not think of allow : it become indispensable therefore to kick he out which we do with universal consent the whole company lend they toe _ uno pede _ as i may say though pity he gray hair and he angelic smile during the operation the orchestra pour in they old chorus the universal company sing and -lrb- what surprise we most of all -rrb- toad-in-the-hole join we furiously in singing -- et interrogatum est ab omnibus -- ubus est ille toad-in-the-hole et responsum est ab omnibus -- non est inventus joan of arc -lrb- 1 -rrb- in reference to m michelet 's history of france what be to be think of _ she _ what be to be think of the poor shepherd girl from the hill and forest of

honor but she will be find _ en contumace _ when the thunder of universal france as even yet may happen shall proclaim the grandeur of the poor shepherd girl that give up all for she country -- thy ear young shepherd girl will have be deaf for five century to suffer and to do that be thy portion in this life to _ do _ -- never for thyself always for other to _ suffer _ -- never in the person of generous champion always in thy own -- that be thy destiny and not for a moment be it hide from thyself life thou saidst be short : and the sleep which be in the grave be long let I use that life so transitory for the glory of those heavenly dream destine to comfort the sleep which be so long this pure creature -- pure from every suspicion of even a visionary self-interest even as she be pure in sens more obvious -- never once do this holy child as regard herself relax from she belief in the darkness that be travel to meet she she might not prefigure the very manner of she death she see not in vision perhaps the aërial altitude of the fiery scaffold the spectator without end on every road pour into rouen as to a coronation the surge smoke the volley flame the hostile face all around the pity eye that lurk but here and there until nature and imperishable truth break loose from artificial restraint these might not be apparent through the mist of the hurrying future but the voice that call she to death _ that _ she hear for ever great be the throne of france even in those day and great be he that sate upon it : but well joanna know that not the throne nor he that sate upon it be for _ she _ but on the contrary that she be for _ they _ not she by they but they by she should rise from the dust gorgeous be the lily of france and for century have the privilege to spread they beauty over land and sea until in another century the wrath of god and man combine to wither they but well joanna know early at domrémy she have read that bitter truth that the lily of france would decorate no garland for _ she _ flower nor bud bell nor blossom would ever bloom for _ she _ but stop what reason be there for take up this subject of joanna precisely in this spring of 1847 might it not have be leave till the spring of 1947 or perhaps leave till call for yes but it _ be _ call for and clamorously you be aware reader that amongst the many original thinker whom modern france have produce one of the reputed leader be m michelet all these writer be of a revolutionary cast not in a political sense merely but in all sens mad oftentimes as march hare crazy with the laughing-gas of recover liberty drunk with the wine-cup of they mighty revolution snort whinnying throw up they heel like wild horse in the boundless pampas and run race of defiance with snipe or with the wind or with they own shadow if they can find nothing else to challenge some time or other i that have leisure to read may introduce _ you _ that have not to two or three dozen of these writer of whom i can assure you beforehand that they be often profound and at interval be even as impassioned as if they be come of we best english blood and sometimes -lrb- because it be not pleasant that people should be too easy to understand -rrb- almost as obscure as if they have be suckle by transcendental german nurse but now confine we attention to m michelet -- who be quite sufficient to lead a man into a gallop require two relay at least of fresh reader -- we in england -- who know he best by he worst book the book against priest & c which have be most circulate -- know he disadvantageously that book be a rhapsody of incoherence m michelet be light-headed i believe when he write it : and it be well that he keeper overtake he in time to intercept a second part but he _ history of france _ be quite another thing a man in whatsoever craft he sail can not stretch away out of sight when he be link to the winding of the shore by tow rope of history fact and the consequence of fact draw the writer back to the falconer 's lure from the giddiest height of speculation here therefore -- in he _ france _ -- if not always free from flightiness if now and then off like a rocket for a airy wheel in the cloud m michelet with natural politeness never forget that he have leave a large audience wait for he on earth and gaze upward in anxiety for he return : return therefore he do but history though clear of certain temptation in one direction have separate danger of its own it be impossible so to write a history of france or of england -- work become every hour more indispensable to the inevitably-political man of this day -- without perilous opening for assault if i for instance on the part of england should happen to turn my labor into that channel and -lrb- on the model of lord percy go to chevy chase -rrb- -- -- a vow to god should make my pleasure in the michelet wood three summer day to take -- probably from simple delirium i might hunt m michelet into _ delirium tremen _ two strong angel stand by the side of history whether french history or english as heraldic supporter : the angel of research on the left hand that must read million of dusty parchment and of page blot with lie the angel of meditation on the right hand that must cleanse these lie record with fire even as of old the drapery of _ asbestos _ be cleansed and must quicken they into regenerated life willingly i acknowledge that no man will ever avoid innumerable error of detail : with so vast a compass of ground to traverse this be impossible : but such error -lrb- though i have a bushel on hand at m michelet 's service -rrb- be not the game i chase : it be the bitter and unfair spirit in which m michelet write against england even _ that _ after all be but my secondary object : the real one be joanna the pucelle d'orlean for herself i be not go to write the history of _ la pucelle _ : to do this or even circumstantially to report the history of she persecution and bitter death of she struggle with false witness and with ensnare judge it would be necessary to have before we _ all _ the document and therefore the collection only now forthcoming in pari but _ my _ purpose be narrower there have be great thinker disdain the careless judgment of contemporary who have throw themselves boldly on the judgment of a far posterity that should have have time to review to ponder to compare there have be great actor on the stage of tragic humanity that might with the same depth of confidence have appeal from the levity of compatriot friend -- too heartless for the sublime interest of they story and too impatient for the labor of sift its perplexity -- to the magnanimity and justice of enemy to this class belong the maid of arc the roman be too faithful to the ideal of grandeur in themselves not to relent after a generation or two before the grandeur of hannibal mithridate -- a more doubtful person -- yet merely for the magic perseverance of he indomitable malice win from the same roman the only real honor that ever he receive on earth and we english have ever show the same homage to stubborn enmity to work unflinchingly for the ruin of england to say through life by word and by deed -- _ delenda est anglium victrix _ that one purpose of malice faithfully pursue have quarter some people upon we national fund of homage as by a perpetual annuity better than a inheritance of service render to england herself have sometimes prove the most insane hatred to england hyder alus even he far inferior son tippoo and napoleon have all benefit by this disposition amongst ourselves to exaggerate the merit of diabolic enmity not one of these man be ever capable in a solitary instance of praise a enemy -- -lrb- what do you say to _ that _ reader -rrb- and yet in _ they _ behalf we consent to forget not they crime only but -lrb- which be worse -rrb- they hideous bigotry and anti-magnanimous egotism for nationality it be not suffrein and some half dozen of other french nautical hero because rightly they do we all the mischief they could -lrb- which be really great -rrb- be name justly reverence in england on the same principle la pucelle d'orlean the victorious enemy of england have be destine to receive she deepest commemoration from the magnanimous justice of englishman joanna as we in england should call she but accord to she own statement jeanne -lrb- or as m michelet assert jean -lrb- 3 -rrb- -rrb- d'arc be bear at domrémy a village on the marsh of lorraine and champagne and dependent upon the town of vaucouleurs i have call she a lorrainer not simply because the word be prettier but because champagne too odiously remind we english of what be for _ we _ imaginary wine which undoubtedly _ la pucelle _ taste as rarely as we english we english because the champagne of london be chiefly grow in devonshire _ la pucelle _ because the champagne of champagne never by any chance flow into the fountain of domrémy from which only she drink m michelet will have she to be a _ champenoise _ and for no better reason than that she take after she father who happen to be a _ champenoise _ i be sure she do _ not _ : for she father be a filthy old fellow whom i shall soon teach the judicious reader to hate but -lrb- say m michelet argue the case physiologically -rrb- she have none of the lorrainian asperity no it seem she have only the gentleness of champagne its simplicity mingle with sense and acuteness as you find it in joinville all these thing she have and she be worth a thousand joinville mean either the prince so call or the fine old crusader but still though i love joanna dearly i can not shut my eye entirely to the lorraine element of asperity in she nature no really now she must have have a shade of _ that _ though very slightly develop -- a mere soupçon as french cook express it in speaking of cayenne pepper when she cause so many of we english throat to be cut but could she do less no i always say so but still you never see a person kill even a trout with a perfectly champagne face of gentleness and simplicity though often no doubt with considerable acuteness all you cook and butcher wear a _ lorraine _ cast of expression these dispute however turn on refinement too nice domrémy stand upon the frontier and like other frontier produce a _ mixed _ race represent the _ ci _ and the _ trans _ a river -lrb- it be true -rrb- form the boundary line at this point -- the river meuse and _ that _ in old day might have divide the population but in these day it do not -- there be bridge there be ferry and wedding cross from the right bank to the leave here lay two great road not so much for traveller that be few as for army that be too many by half these two road one of which be the great high road between france and germany _ decussate _ at this very point which be a learn way of say that they form a st andrew 's cross or letter x i hope the compositor will choose a good large x in which case the point of intersection the _ locus _ of conflux for these four diverge arm will finish the reader 's geographical education by show he to a hair 's breadth where it be that domrémy stand these road so grandly situate as great trunk artery between two mighty realm -lrb- 4 -rrb- and haunt for ever by war or rumor of war decussate -lrb- for anything i know to the contrary -rrb- absolutely under joanna 's bed-room window one roll away to the right past monsieur d'arc 's old barn and the other unaccountably prefer -lrb- but there be no dispute about taste -rrb- to sweep round that odious man 's odious pigstye to the left thing be situate as be here lay down viz in respect of the decussation and in respect of joanna 's bed-room it follow that if she have drop she glove by accident from she chamber window into the very bull 's eye of the target in the center of x not one of several great potentate could -lrb- though all animated by the sincerest desire for the peace of europe -rrb- have possibly come to any clear understanding on the question of whom the glove be mean for whence the candid reader perceive at once the necessity for at least four bloody war fall indeed a little farther as for instance into the pigstye the glove could not have furnish to the most peppery prince any shadow of excuse for arm : he would not have have a leg to stand upon in take such a perverse line of conduct but if it fall -lrb- as by the hypothesis it do -rrb- into the one sole point of ground common to four king it be clear that instead of no leg to stand upon eight separate leg would have have no ground to stand upon unless by tread on each other 's toe the philosopher therefore see clearly the necessity of a war and regret that sometimes nation do not wait for grounds of war so solid in the circumstance suppose though the four king might be unable to see they way clearly without the help of gunpowder to any decision upon joanna 's intention she -- poor thing -- never could mistake she intention for a moment all she love be for france and therefore any glove she might drop into the _ quadrivium _ must be wickedly missent by the post-office if it find its way to any king but the king of france on whatever side of the border chance have throw joanna the same love to france would have be nurture for it be a strange fact notice by m michelet and other that the duke of bar and lorraine have for generation pursue the policy of eternal warfare with france on they own account yet also of eternal amity and league with france in case anybody else presume to attack she let peace settle upon france and before long you might rely upon see the little vixen lorraine fly at the throat of france let franco be assail by a formidable enemy and instantly you see a duke of lorraine or bar insist on have he throat cut in support of france which favor accordingly be cheerfully grant to they in three great successive battle by the english and by the turkish sultan viz at crécy at nicopoli and at agincourt this sympathy with france during great eclipse in those that during ordinary season be always tease she with brawl and guerilla inroad strengthen the natural piety to france of those that be confessedly the child of she own house the outpost of france as one may call the great frontier province be of all locality the most devoted to the flour de ly to witness at any great crisis the generous devotion to these lily of the little fiery cousin that in gentler weather be for ever tilt at she breast could not bin fan the zeal of the legitimate daughter : whilst to occupy a post of honor on the frontier against a old hereditary enemy of france would naturally have stimulate this zeal by a sentiment of martial pride have there even be no other stimulant to zeal by a sense of danger always threaten and of hatred always smoulder that great four-headed road be a perpetual memento to patriotic ardor to say this way lie the road to paris -- and that other way to aix-la-chapelle this to prague that to vienna -- nourish the warfare of the heart by daily ministration of sense the eye that watch for the gleam of lance or helmet from the hostile frontier the ear that listen for the groaning of wheel make the high road itself with its relation to centre so remote into a manual of patriotic enmity the situation therefore _ locally _ of joanna be full of profound suggestion to a heart that listen for the stealthy step of change and fear that too surely be in motion but if the place be grand the time the burthen of the time be far more so the air overhead in its upper chamber be _ hurtle _ with the obscure sound be dark with sullen fermenting of storm that have be gather for a hundred and thirty year the battle of agincourt in joanna 's childhood have re-open the wound of france crécy and poictier those withering overthrow for the chivalry of france have be tranquillize by more than half a century but this resurrection of they trumpet wail make the whole series of battle and endless skirmish take they station as part in one drama the grave that have close sixty year ago seem to fly open in sympathy with a sorrow that echo they own the monarchy of france labor in extremity rock and reel like a ship fight with the darkness of monsoon the madness of the poor king -lrb- charle vi -rrb- fall in at such a crisis like the case of woman labor in childbirth during the storm of a city treble the awfulness of the time even the wild story of the incident which have immediately occasion the explosion of this madness -- the case of a man unknown gloomy and perhaps maniacal himself come out of a forest at noon-day lay he hand upon the bridle of the king 's horse check he for a moment to say oh king thou art betray and then vanish no man know whither as he have appear for no man know what -- fall in with the universal prostration of mind that lay france on she knee as before the slow unweaving of some ancient prophetic doom the famine the extraordinary disease the insurrection of the peasantry up and down europe these be chord strike from the same mysterious harp but these be transitory chord there have be other of deeper and more sonorous sound the termination of the crusade the destruction of the templar the papal interdict the tragedy cause or suffer by the house of anjou by the emperor -- these be full of a more permanent significance but since then the colossal figure of feudalism be see standing as it be on tiptoe at crécy for flight from earth : that be a revolution unparalleled yet _ that _ be a trifle by comparison with the more fearful revolution that be mine below the church by she own internal schism by the abominable spectacle of a double pope -- so that no man except through political bias could even guess which be heaven 's vicegerent and which the creature of hell -- she be already rehearse as in still earlier form she have rehearse the first rent in she foundation -lrb- reserve for the coming century -rrb- which no man should ever heal these be the loftiest peak of the cloudland in the sky that to the scientific gazer first catch the color of the _ new _ morning in advance but the whole vast range alike of sweeping gloom overhead dwelt upon all meditative mind even those that could not distinguish the altitude nor decipher the form it be therefore not she own age alone as affect by its immediate calamity that lay with such weight upon joanna 's mind but she own age as one section in a vast mysterious drama unweave through a century back and draw nearer continually to crisis after crisis cataract and rapid be hear roar ahead and sign be see far back by help of old man 's memory which answer secretly to sign now come forward on the eye even as lock answer to key it be not wonderful that in such a haunt solitude with such a haunted heart joanna should see angelic vision and hear angelic voice these voice whisper to she the duty impose upon herself of deliver france five year she listen to these monitory voice with internal struggle at length she could resist no longer doubt give way and she leave she home in order to present herself at the dauphin 's court the education of this poor girl be mean accord to the present standard : be ineffably grand accord to a purer philosophic standard and only not good for we age because for we it would be unattainable she read nothing for she could not read but she have hear other read part of the roman martyrology she weep in sympathy with the sad _ miserere _ of the romish chaunting she rise to heaven with the glad triumphant _ glorium in excelcis _ : she draw she comfort and she vital strength from the rite of she church but next after these spiritual advantage she owe most to the advantage of she situation the fountain of domrémy be on the brink of a boundless forest and it be haunt to that degree by fairy that the parish priest -lrb- _ curé _ -rrb- be oblige to read mass there once a year in order to keep they in any decent bound fairy be important even in a statistical view certain weed mark poverty in the soil fairy mark its solitude as surely as the wolf retire before city do the fairy sequester herself from the haunt of licensed victualler a village be too much for she nervous delicacy : at most she can tolerate a distant view of a hamlet we may judge therefore by the uneasiness and extra trouble which they give to the parson in what strength the fairy muster at domrémy and by a satisfactory consequence how thinly sow with man and woman must have be that region even in its inhabit spot but the forest of domrémy -- those be the glory of the land : for in they abide mysterious power and ancient secret that tower into tragic strength abbey there be and abbey window dim and dimly see -- as moorish temple of the hindoo that exercise even princely power both in lorraine and in the german diet these have they sweet bell that pierce the forest for many a league at matins or vespers and each its own dreamy legend few enough and scatter enough be these abbey in no degree to disturb the deep solitude of the region many enough to spread a network or awning of christian sanctity over what else might have seem a heathen wilderness this sort of religious talisman be secure a man the most afraid of ghost -lrb- like myself suppose or the reader -rrb- become armed into courage to wander for day in they sylvan recess the mountain of the vosge on the eastern frontier of france have never attract much notice from europe except in 1813-14 for a few brief month when they fall within napoleon 's line of defense against the ally but they be interesting for this amongst other feature -- that they do not like some loftier range repel wood : the forest and they be on sociable term _ live and let live _ be they motto for this reason in part these tract in lorraine be a favorite hunting ground with the carlovingian prince about six hundred year before joanna 's childhood charlemagne be know to have hunt there that of itself be a grand incident in the tradition of a forest or a chase in these vast forest also be to be find -lrb- if the race be not extinct -rrb- those mysterious fawn that tempt solitary hunter into visionary and perilous pursuit here be see at interval that ancient stag who be already nine hundred year old at the least but possibly a hundred or two more when meet by charlemagne and the thing be put beyond doubt by the inscription upon he golden collar i believe charlemagne knight the stag and if ever he be meet again by a king he ought to be make a earl -- or be upon the march of france a marquess observe i do not absolutely vouch for all these thing : my own opinion vary on a fine breezy forenoon i be audaciously sceptical but as twilight set in my credulity become equal to anything that could be desire and i have hear candid sportsman declare that outside of these very forest near the vosge they laugh loudly at all the dim tale connect with they haunt solitude but on reach a spot notoriously eighteen mile deep within they they agree with sir roger de coverley that a good deal might be say on both side such tradition or any other that -lrb- like the stag -rrb- connect distant generation with each other be for that cause sublime and the sense of the shadowy connect with such appearance that reveal themselves or not accord to circumstance leave a coloring of sanctity over ancient forest even in those mind that utterly reject the legend as a fact but apart from all distinct story of that order in any solitary frontier between two great empire as here for instance or in the desert between syrium and the euphrate there be a inevitable tendency in mind of any deep sensibility to people the solitude with phantom image of power that be of old so vast joanna therefore in she quiet occupation of a shepherdess would be lead continually to brood over the political condition of she country by the tradition of the past no less than by the memento of the local present m michelet indeed say that la pucelle be _ not _ a shepherdess i beg he pardon : she _ be _ what he rest upon i guess pretty well : it be the evidence of a woman call haumette the most confidential friend of joanna now she be a good witness and a good girl and i like she for she make a natural and affectionate report of joanna 's ordinary life but still however good she may be as a witness joanna be better and she when speak to the dauphin call herself in the latin report _ bergereta _ even haumette confess that joanna tend sheep in she girlhood and i believe that if miss haumette be take coffee alone with I this very evening -lrb- February 12 1847 -rrb- -- in which there would be no subject for scandal or for maiden blush because i be a intense philosopher and miss h would be hard upon four hundred and fifty year old -- she would admit the following comment upon she evidence to be right a frenchman about thirty year ago m simond in he _ travel _ mention incidentally the follow hideous scene as one steadily observe and watch by himself in france at a period some trifle before the french revolution : -- a peasant be plough and the team that draw he plough be a donkey and a woman both be regularly harness : both pull alike this be bad enough : but the frenchman add that in distribute he lash the peasant be obviously desirous of be impartial : or if either of the yoke-fellow have a right to complain certainly it be not the donkey now in any country where such degradation of female could be tolerate by the state of manners a woman of delicacy would shrink from acknowledge either for herself or she friend that she have ever be addict to any mode of labor not strictly domestic because if once own herself a prædial servant she would be sensible that this confession extend by probability in the hearer 's thought to have incur indignity of this horrible kind haumette clearly think it more dignified for joanna to have be darn the stocking of she horny-hoofed father monsieur d'arc than keep sheep lest she might then be suspect of have ever do something worse but luckily there be no danger of _ that _ : joanna never be in service and my opinion be that she father should have mend he own stocking since probably he be the party to make the hole in they as many a better man than d'arc do meaning by _ that _ not myself because though certainly a better man than d'arc i protest against do anything of the kind if i live even with Friday in juan fernandez either Friday must do all the darning or else it must go undo the better man that i mean be the sailor in the british navy every man of whom mend he own stocking who else be to do it do you suppose reader that the junior lord of the admiralty be under article to darn for the navy the reason meantime for my systematic hatred of d'arc be this there be a story current in france before the revolution frame to ridicule the pauper aristocracy who happen to have long pedigree and short rent roll viz that a head of such a house date from the crusade be overhear say to he son a chevalier of st loui _ chevalier as-tu donné au cochon à manger _ now it be clearly make out by the survive evidence that d'arc would much have prefer continue to say -- _ ma fille as-tu donné au cochon à manger _ to say _ pucelle d'orléans as-tu sauvé les fleurs-de-lys _ there be a old english copy of verse which argue thus : -- if the man that turnip cry cry not when he father die -- then ` tis plain the man have rather have a turnip than he father i can not say that the logic of these verse be ever _ entirely _ to my satisfaction i do not see my way through it as clearly as could be wish but i see my way most clearly through d'arc and the result be -- that he would greatly have prefer not merely a turnip to he father but the save a pound or so of bacon to save the oriflamme of france it be probable -lrb- as m michelet suggest -rrb- that the title of virgin or _ pucelle _ have in itself and apart from the miraculous stone about she a secret power over the rude soldiery and partisan chief of that period for in such a person they see a representative manifestation of the virgin mary who in a course of century have grow steadily upon the popular heart as to joanna 's supernatural detection of the dauphin -lrb- charle vii -rrb- amongst three hundred lord and knight i be surprise at the credulity which could ever lend itself to that theatrical juggle who admire more than myself the sublime enthusiasm the rapturous faith in herself of this pure creature but i admire not stage artifice which not _ la pucelle _ but the court must have arrange nor can surrender myself a dupe to a conjuror 's _ leger-de-main _ such as may be see every day for a shilling southey 's joan of arc be publish in 1796 twenty year after talk with southey i be surprise to find he still own a secret bias in favor of joan found on she detection of the dauphin the story for the benefit of the reader new to the case be this : -- _ la pucelle _ be first make know to the dauphin and present to he court at chinon : and here come she first trial she be to find out the royal personage amongst the whole ark of clean and unclean creature fail in this _ coup d'essaus _ she would not simply disappoint many a beating heart in the glitter crowd that on different motive yearn for she success but she would ruin herself -- and as the oracle within have tell she would ruin france we own sovereign lady victorium rehearse annually a trial not so severe in degree but the same in kind she prick for sheriff joanna prick for a king but observe the difference : we own lady prick for two man out of three joanna for one man out of three hundred happy lady of the island and the orient -- she _ can _ go astray in she choice only by one half to the extent of one half she _ must _ have the satisfaction of be right and yet even with these tight limit to the misery of a boundless discretion permit I liege lady with all loyalty to submit -- that now and then you prick with you pin the wrong man but the poor child from domrémy shrink under the gaze of a dazzling court -- not because dazzling -lrb- for in vision she have see those that be more so -rrb- but because some of they wear a scoff smile on they feature -- how should _ she _ throw she line into so deep a river to angle for a king where many a gay creature be sport that masquerade as king in dress nay even more than any true king would have do : for in southey 's version of the story the dauphin say by way of try the virgin 's magnetic sympathy with royalty -- on the throne i the while mingle with the menial throng some courtier shall he seat this usurper be even crown : the jeweled crown shine on a menial 's head but really that be _ un peu fort _ and the mob of spectator might raise a scruple whether we friend the jackdaw upon the throne and the dauphin himself be not grazing the shin of treason for the dauphin could not lend more than belong to he accord to the popular notion he have no crown for himself but at most a _ petit ecu _ worth thirty penny consequently none to lend on any pretence whatever until the consecrate maid should take he to rheim this be the _ popular _ notion in france the same notion as to the indispensableness of a coronation prevail widely in england but certainly it be the dauphin 's interest to support the popular notion as he mean to use the service of joanna for if he be king already what be it that she could do for he beyond orlean and above all if he be king without a coronation and without the oil from the sacred ampullum what advantage be yet open to he by celerity above he competitor the english boy now be to be a race for a coronation : he that should win _ that _ race carry the superstition of france along with he trouble we not lawyer with you quillet we be illegal blockhead so thoroughly without law that we do not know even if we have a right to be blockhead and we mind be make up -- that the first man draw from the oven of coronation at rheim be the man that be baked into a king all other be counterfeit make of base indian meal damage by sea-water la pucelle before she could be allow to practice as a warrior be put through she manual and platoon exercise as a juvenile pupil in divinity before six eminent man in wig accord to southey -lrb- v 393 book iii in the original edition of he joan of arc -rrb- she appall would the doctor it be not easy to do _ that _ : but they have some reason to feel bother as that surgeon would assuredly feel bother who upon proceed to dissect a subject should find the subject retaliate as a dissector upon himself especially if joanna ever make the speech to they which occupy v 354-391 b iii it be a double impossibility 1st because a piracy from tindal 's _ christianity as old as the creation : _ now a piracy _ à parte post

life attend -- 1st mass nor 2d the sacramental table nor 3d confession here be a precious windfall for the doctor they by snaky tortuosity have hope through the aid of a corkscrew -lrb- which every d d or stp be say to carry in he pocket -rrb- for the happiness of ultimately extract from joanna a few grain of heretical powder or small shot which might have justify they singe she a little and just at such a crisis expressly to justify they burn she to a cinder up gallop joanna with a brigade of gun unlimber and serve they out with heretical grape and deistical round-shot enough to lay a kingdom under interdict any miracle to which joanna might treat the grim d ds after _ that _ would go to the wrong side of she little account in the clerical book joanna would be create a _ dr _ herself but not of divinity for in the joanna page of the ledger the entry would be -- miss joanna in acct with the church _ dr _ by sundry diabolic miracle she have publicly preached heresy show herself a witch and even try hard to corrupt the principle of six church pillar in the mean time all this deistical confession of joanna 's besides be suicidal for the interest of she cause be oppose to the deposition upon _ both _ trial the very best witness call from first to last depose that joanna attend these rite of she church even too often be tax with do so and by blush own the charge as a fact though certainly not as a fault joanna be a girl of natural piety that see god in forest and hill and fountain but do not the less seek he in chapel and consecrate oratory this peasant girl be self-educated through she own natural meditativeness if the reader turn to that divine passage in _ paradise regain _ which milton have put into the mouth of we savior when first enter the wilderness and muse upon the tendency of those great impulse grow within himself -- oh what a multitude of thought arise & c he will have some notion of the vast reverie which brood over the heart of joanna in early girlhood when the wing be bud that should carry she from orlean to rheim when the golden chariot be dimly reveal itself that should carry she from the kingdom of _ france deliver _ to the eternal kingdom it be not requisite for the honor of joanna nor be there in this place room to pursue she brief career of _ action _ that though wonderful form the earthly part of she story : the intellectual part be the saintly passion of she imprisonment trial and execution it be unfortunate therefore for southey 's joan of arc -lrb- which however should always be regard as a _ juvenile _ effort -rrb- that precisely when she real glory begin the poem end but this limitation of the interest grow no doubt from the constraint inseparably attach to the law of epic unity joanna 's history bisect into two opposite hemisphere and both could not have be present to the eye in one poem unless by sacrifice all unity of theme or else by involve the earlier half as a narrative episode in the latter -- this might have be do -- it might have be communicate to a fellow-prisoner or a confessor by joanna herself in the same way that virgil have contrived to acquaint the reader through the hero 's mouth with earlier adventure that if tell by the poet speaking in he own person would have destroy the unity of he fable the romantic interest of the early and _ irrelate _ incident -lrb- last night of troy & c -rrb- be throw as a affluent into the general river of the personal narrative whilst yet the capital current of the _ epo _ as unfold ihe origin and _ incunabulum _ of rome be not for a moment suffer to be modify by event so subordinate and so obliquely introduce it be sufficient as concern _ this _ section of joanna 's life to say -- that she fulfil to the height of she promise the restoration of the prostrate throne france have become a province of england and for the ruin of both if such a yoke could be maintain dreadful pecuniary exhaustion cause the english energy to droop and that critical open _ la pucelle _ use with a corresponding felicity of audacity and suddenness -lrb- that be in themselves portentous -rrb- for introduce the wedge of french native resource for rekindle the national pride and for plant the dauphin once more upon he foot when joanna appear he have be on the point of give up the struggle with the english distressed as they be and of fly to the south of france she teach he to blush for such abject counsel she liberate orlean that great city so decisive by its fate for the issue of the war and then beleaguer by the english with a elaborate application of engineering skill unprecedented in europe enter the city after sunset on the 29th of April she sing mass on Sunday may 8 for the entire disappearance of the besiege force on the 29th of June she fight and gain over the english the decisive battle of patay on the 9th of July she take troye by a coup-de-main from a mixed garrison of english and burgundian on the 15th of that month she carry the dauphin into rheim on Sunday the 17th she crown he and there she rest from she labor of triumph what remain be -- to suffer all this forward movement be she own : except one man the whole council be against she she enemy be all that draw power from earth she supporter be she own strong enthusiasm and the headlong contagion by which she carry this sublime frenzy into the heart of woman of soldier and of all who live by labor henceforward she be thwart and the worst error that she commit be to lend the sanction of she presence to counsel which she disapprove but she have accomplish the capital object which she own vision have dictate these involve all the rest error be now less important and doubtless it have now become more difficult for herself to pronounce authentically what _ be _ error the noble girl have achieve as by a rapture of motion the capital end of clear out a free space around she sovereign give he the power to move he arm with effect and secondly the inappreciable end of win for that sovereign what seem to all france the heavenly ratification of he rights by crowning he with the ancient solemnity she have make it impossible for the english now to step before she they be catch in a irretrievable blunder owe partly to discord amongst the uncle of henry vi partly to a want of fund but partly to the very impossibility which they believe to press with tenfold force upon any french attempt to forestall theirs they laugh at such a thought and whilst they laugh she _ do _ it henceforth the single redress for the english of this capital oversight but which never _ could _ have redress it effectually be -- to vitiate and taint the coronation of charle vii as the work of a witch that policy and not malice -lrb- as m michelet be so happy to believe -rrb- be the move principle in the subsequent prosecution of joanna unless they unhinge the force of the first coronation in the popular mind by associate it with power give from hell they feel that the sceptre of the invader be break but she the child that at nineteen have work wonder so great for france be she not elate do she not lose as man so often _ have _ lose all sobriety of mind when stand upon the pinnaclè of success so giddy let she enemy declare during the progress of she movement and in the center of ferocious struggle she have manifest the temper of she feeling by the pity which she have every where express for the suffering enemy she forward to the english leader a touching invitation to unite with the french as brother in a common crusade against infidel thus open the road for a soldierly retreat she interpose to protect the captive or the wound -- she mourn over the excess of she countryman -- she throw herself off she horse to kneel by the die english soldier and to comfort he with such ministration physical or spiritual as he situation allow nolebat say the evidence utus onso suo aut quemquam interficere she sheltered the english that invoke she aid in she own quarter she weep as she behold stretch on the field of battle so many brave enemy that have die without confession and as regard herself she elation express itself thus : -- on the day when she have finish she work she weep for she know that when she task be do she end must be approach she aspiration point only to a place which seem to she more than usually full of natural piety as one in which it would give she pleasure to die and she utter between smile and tear as a wish that inexpressibly fascinate she heart and yet be half fantastic a broken prayer that god would return she to the solitude from which he have draw she and suffer she to become a shepherdess once more it be a natural prayer because nature have lay a necessity upon every human heart to seek for rest and to shrink from torment yet again it be a half-fantastic prayer because from childhood upward vision that she have no power to mistrust and the voice which sound in she ear for ever have long since persuade she mind that for _ she _ no such prayer could be grant too well she feel that she mission must be work out to the end and that the end be now at hand all go wrong from this time she herself have create the _ fund _ out of which the french restoration should grow but she be not suffer to witness they development or they prosperous application more than one military plan be enter upon which she do not approve but she still continue to expose she person as before severe wound have not teach she caution and at length in a sortie from compeigne whether through treacherous collusion on the part of she own friend be doubtful to this day she be make prisoner by the burgundian and finally surrender to the english now come she trial this trial moving of course under english influence be conduct in chief by the bishop of beauvai he be a frenchman sell to english interest and hope by favor of the english leader to reach the highest preferment _ bishop that art archbishop that shalt be cardinal that mayest be _ be the word that sound continually in he ear and doubtless a whisper of vision still higher of a triple crown and foot upon the neck of king sometimes steal into he heart m michelet be anxious to keep we in mind that this bishop be but a agent of the english true but it do not better the case for he countryman that be a accomplice in the crime make himself the leader in the persecution against the helpless girl he be willing to be all this in the spirit and with the conscious vileness of a catspaw never from the foundation of the earth be there such a trial as this if it be lay open in all its beauty of defense and all its hellishness of attack oh child of france shepherdess peasant girl trodden under foot by all around thee how i honor thy flash intellect quick as god 's lightning and true as that lightning to its mark that run before france and laggard europe by many a century confound the malice of the ensnarer and make dumb the oracle of falsehood be it not scandalous be it not humiliating to civilization that even at this day france exhibit the horrid spectacle of judge examine the prisoner against himself seduce he by fraud into treacherous conclusion against he own head use the terror of they power for extort confession from the frailty of hope nay -lrb- which be worse -rrb- use the blandishments of condescension and snaky kindness for thaw into compliance of gratitude those whom they have fail to freeze into terror wicked judge barbarian jurisprudence that sit in you own conceit on the summit of social wisdom have yet fail to learn the first principle of criminal justice sit ye humbly and with docility at the foot of this girl from domrémy that tear you web of cruelty into shred and dust would you examine I as a witness against myself be the question by which many time she defy they art continually she show that they interrogation be irrelevant to any business before the court or that enter into the ridiculous charge against she general question be propose to she on point of casuistical divinity two-edged question which not one of themselves could have answer without on the one side landing himself in heresy -lrb- as then interpret -rrb- or on the other in some presumptuous expression of self-esteem next come a wretched dominican that press she with a objection which if apply to the bible would tax every one of its miracle with unsoundness the monk have the excuse of never have read the bible m michelet have no such excuse and it make one blush for he as a philosopher to find he describe such a argument as weighty whereas it be but a varied expression of rude mahometan metaphysics she answer to this if there be room to place the whole in a clear light be as shatter as it be rapid another think to entrap she by ask what language the angelic visitor of she solitude have talk : as though heavenly counsel could want polyglott interpreter for every word or that god need language at all in whisper thought to a human heart then come a worse devil who ask she whether the archangel michael have appear naked not comprehend the vile insinuation joanna whose poverty suggest to she simplicity that it might be the _ costliness _ or suitable robe which cause the demur ask they if they fancy god who clothe the flower of the valley unable to find raiment for he servant the answer of joanna move a smile of tenderness but the disappointment of she judge make one laugh horribly other succeed by troops who upbraid she with leave she father as if that greater father whom she believe herself to have be serve do not retain the power of dispense with he own rule or have not say that for a less cause than martyrdom man and woman should leave both father and mother on easter Sunday when the trial have be long proceed the poor girl fall so ill as to cause a belief that she have be poison it be not poison nobody have any interest in hasten a death so certain m michelet whose sympathy with all feeling be so quick that one would gladly see they always as justly direct read the case most truly joanna have a two-fold malady she be visit by a paroxysm of the complaint call _ home-sickness _ the cruel nature of she imprisonment and its length could not but point she solitary thought in darkness and in chain -lrb- for chained she be -rrb- to domrémy and the season which be the most heavenly period of the spring add sting to this yearning that be one of she malady -- _ nostalgia _ as medicine call it the other be weariness and exhaustion from daily combat with malice she see that everybody hate she and thirst for she blood nay many kind-hearted creature that would have pity she profoundly as regard all political charge have they natural feeling warped by the belief that she have dealings with fiendish power she know she be to die that be _ not _ the misery the misery be that this consummation could not be reach without so much intermediate strife as if she be contend for some chance -lrb- where chance be none -rrb- of happiness or be dream for a moment of escape the inevitable why then _ do _ she contend know that she would reap nothing from answer she persecutor why do she not retire by silence from the superfluous contest it be because she quick and eager loyalty to truth would not suffer she to see it darken by fraud which _ she _ could expose but other even of candid listener perhaps could not it be through that imperishable grandeur of soul which teach she to submit meekly and without a struggle to she punishment but teach she _ not _ to submit -- no not for a moment -- to calumny as to fact or to misconstruction as to motive besides there be secretary all around the court take down she word that be mean for no good to _ she _ but the end do not always correspond to the meaning and joanna might say to herself -- these word that will be use against I to-morrow and the next day perhaps in some nobler generation may rise again for my justification yes joanna they _ be _ rise even now in pari and for more than justification woman sister -- there be some thing which you do not execute as well as you brother man no nor ever will pardon I if i doubt whether you will ever produce a great poet from you choir or a mozart or a phidia or a michael angelo or a great philosopher or a great scholar by which last be mean -- not one who depend simply on a infinite memory but also on a infinite and electrical power of combination bring together from the four wind like the angel of the resurrection what else be dust from dead man 's bone into the unity of breathing life if you _ can _ create yourselve into any of these great creator why have you not do not ask I to say otherwise because if you do you will lead I into temptation for i swear early in life never to utter a falsehood and above all a sycophantic falsehood and in the false homage of the modern press towards woman there be horrible sycophancy it be as hollow most of it and it be as fleeting as be the love that lurk in _ uxoriousness _ yet if a woman ask I to tell a faleshood i have long make up my mind -- that on moral consideration i _ will _ and _ ought _ to do so whether it be for any purpose of glory to _ she _ or of screen she foible -lrb- for she _ do _ commit a few -rrb- or of humbly as a vassal pay a peppercorn rent to she August privilege of caprice bar these case i must adhere to my resolution of tell no fib and i repeat therefore but not to be rude i repeat in latin -- excudent alius meliús spirantium signa credo equidem vivos ducent de marmore vultus : altius ascendent : at tu caput eva memento sandalo ut infringa referentus oraculum tanta -lrb- 6 -rrb- yet sister woman -- though i can not consent to find a mozart or a michael angelo in you sex until that day when you claim my promise as to falsehood -- cheerfully and with the love that burn in depths of admiration i acknowledge that you can do one thing as well as the best of we man -- a greater thing than even mozart be know to have do or michael angelo -- you can die grandly and as goddess would die be goddess mortal if any distant world -lrb- which _ may _ be the case -rrb- be so far ahead of we tellurian in optical resource as to see distinctly through they telescope all that we do on earth what be the grandest sight to which we ever treat they st peter 's at rome do you fancy on easter Sunday or luxor or perhaps the himalaya pooh pooh my friend : suggest something better these be bauble to _ they _ they see in other world in they own far better toy of the same kind these take my word for it be nothing do you give it up the finest thing then we have to show they be a scaffold on the morning of execution i assure you there be a strong muster in those fair telescopic world on any such morning of those who happen to find themselves occupy the right hemisphere for a peep at _ we _ telescope look up in the market on that morning and bear a monstrous premium for they cheat probably in those scientific world as well as we do how then if it be announce in some such telescopic world by those who make a livelihood of catch glimpse at we newspaper whose language they have long since decipher that the poor victim in the morning 's sacrifice be a woman how if it be publish on that distant world that the sufferer wear upon she head in the eye of many the garland of martyrdom how if it should be some marie antoinette the widow queen come forward on the scaffold and present to the morning air she head turn gray prematurely by sorrow daughter of cæsars kneel down humbly to kiss the guillotine as one that worship death how if it be the martyr wife of roland utter impassioned truth -- truth odious to the ruler of she country -- with she expire breath how if it be the noble charlotte corday that in the bloom of youth that with the loveliest of person that with homage wait upon she smile wherever she turn she face to scatter they -- homage that follow those smile as surely as the carol of bird after shower in spring follow the re-appearing sun and the racing of sunbeam over the hill -- yet think all these thing cheaper than the dust upon she sandal in comparison of deliverance from hell for she dear suffer france ah these be spectacles indeed for those sympathize people in distant world and some perhaps would suffer a sort of martyrdom themselves because they could not testify they wrath could not bear witness to the strength of love and to the fury of hatred that burn within they at such scene could not gather into golden urn some of that glorious dust which rest in the catacomb of earth on the Wednesday after trinity Sunday in 1431 be then about nineteen year of age the maid of arc undergo she martyrdom she be conduct before mid-day guard by eight hundred spearman to a platform of prodigious height construct of wooden billet support by occasional wall of lath and plaster and traverse by hollow space in every direction for the creation of air-current the pile strike terror say m michelet by its height and as usual the english purpose in this be view as one of pure malignity but there be two way of explain all that it be probable that the purpose be merciful on the circumstance of the execution i shall not linger yet to mark the almost fatal felicity of m michelet in find out whatever may injure the english name at a moment when every reader will be interested in joanna 's personal appearance it be really edifying to notice the ingenuity by which he draw into light from a dark corner a very unjust account of it and neglect though lie upon the high road a very please one both be from english pen grafton a chronicler but little read be a stiff-necked john bull think fit to say that no wonder joanna should be a virgin since she foule face be a satisfactory solution of that particular merit holinshead on the other hand a chronicler somewhat later every way more important and universally read have give a very please testimony to the interesting character of joanna 's person and engaging manners neither of these man live till the following century so that personally this evidence be none at all grafton sullenly and carelessly believe as he wish to believe holinshead take pain to inquire and report undoubtedly the general impression of france but i cite the case as illustrate m michelet 's candor -lrb- 7 -rrb- the circumstantial incident of the execution unless with more space than i can now command i should be unwilling to relate i should fear to injure by imperfect report a martyrdom which to myself appear so unspeakably grand yet for a purpose point not at joanna but at m michelet -- viz to convince he that a englishman be capable of think more highly of _ la pucelle _ than even she admiring countryman i shall in parting allude to one or two trait in joanna 's demeanor on the scaffold and to one or two in that of the bystander which authorize I in question a opinion of he upon this martyr 's firmness the reader ought to be remind that joanna d'arc be subject to a unusually unfair trial of opinion any of the elder christian martyr have not much to fear of _ personal _ rancor the martyr be chiefly regard as the enemy of cæsar at time also where any knowledge of the christian faith and moral exist with the enmity that arise spontaneously in the worldly against the spiritual but the martyr though disloyal be not suppose to be therefore anti-national and still less be _ individually _ hateful what be hate -lrb- if anything -rrb- belong to he class not to himself separately now joanna if hate at all be hate personally and in rouen on national grounds hence there would be a certainty of calumny arise against _ she _ such as would not affect martyr in general that be the case it would follow of necessity that some people would impute to she a willingness to recant no innocence could escape _ that _ now have she really testify this willingness on the scaffold it would have argue nothing at all but the weakness of a genial nature shrink from the instant approach of torment and those will often pity that weakness most who in they own person would yield to it least meantime there never be a calumny utter that draw less support from the record circumstance it rest upon no _ positive _ testimony and it have a weight of contradict testimony to stem and yet strange to say m michelet who at time seem to admire the maid of arc as much as i do be the one sole writer amongst she _ friend _ who lend some countenance to this odious slander he word be that if she do not utter this word _ recant _ with she lip she utter it in she heart whether she _ say _ the word be uncertain : but i affirm that she _ think _ it now i affirm that she do not not in any sense of the word _ think _ applicable to the case here be france calumniate _ la pucelle _ : here be england defend she m michelet can only mean that on _ a priori _ principle every woman must be presume liable to such a weakness that joanna be a woman _ ergo _ that she be liable to such a weakness that be he only suppose she to have utter the word by a argument which presume it impossible for anybody to have do otherwise i on the contrary throw the _ onus _ of the argument not on presumable tendency of nature but on the known fact of that morning 's execution as record by multitude what else i demand than mere weight of metal absolute nobility of deportment break the vast line of battle then array against she what else but she meek saintly demeanor win from the enemy that till now have believe she a witch tear of rapturous admiration ten thousand man say m michelet himself ten thousand man weep and of these ten thousand the majority be political enemy knit together by cord of superstition what else be it but she constancy unite with she angelic gentleness that drive the fanatic english soldier -- who have swear to throw a faggot on she scaffold as _ he _ tribute of abhorrence that _ do _ so that fulfil he vow -- suddenly to turn away a penitent for life say everywhere that he have see a dive rise upon wing to heaven from the ash where she have stand what else drive the executioner to kneel at every shrine for pardon to _ he _ share in the tragedy and if all this be insufficient then i cite the closing act of she life as valid on she behalf be all other testimony against she the executioner have be direct to apply he torch from below he do so the fiery smoke rise upward in billow volume a dominican monk be then stand almost at she side wrapt up in he sublime office he see not the danger but still persist in he prayer even then when the last enemy be race up the fiery stair to seize she even at that moment do this noblest of girl think only for _ he _ the one friend that would not forsake she and not for herself bid he with she last breath to care for he own preservation but to leave _ she _ to god that girl whose latest breath ascend in this sublime expression of self-oblivion do not utter the word _ recant _ either with she lip or in she heart no she do not though one should rise from the dead to swear it \* \* \* \* \* bishop of beauvai thy victim die in fire upon a scaffold -- thou upon a down bed but for the depart minute of life both be oftentimes alike at the farewell crisis when the gate of death be open and flesh be rest from its struggle oftentimes the tortured and the torturer have the same truce from carnal torment both sink together into sleep together both sometimes kindle into dream when the mortal mist be gather fast upon you two bishop and shepherd girl -- when the pavilion of life be close up they shadowy curtain about you -- let we try through the gigantic gloom to decipher the fly feature of you separate vision the shepherd girl that have deliver france -- she from she dungeon she from she baiting at the stake she from she duel with fire as she enter she last dream -- see domrémy see the fountain of domrémy see the pomp of forest in which she childhood have wander that easter festival which man have deny to she languish heart -- that resurrection of spring-time which the darkness of dungeon have intercept from _ she _ hunger after the glorious liberty of forest -- be by god give back into she hand as jewel that have be steal from she by robber with those perhaps -lrb- for the minute of dream can stretch into age -rrb- be give back to she by god the bliss of childhood by special privilege for _ she _ might be create in this farewell dream a second childhood innocent as the first but not like _ that _ sad with the gloom of a fearful mission in the rear this mission have now be fulfil the storm be weather the skirt even of that mighty storm be draw off the blood that she be to reckon for have be exact the tear that she be to shed in secret have be pay to the last the hatred to herself in all eye have be face steadily have be suffer have be survive and in she last fight upon the scaffold she have triumph gloriously victoriously she have taste the sting of death for all except this comfort from she farewell dream she have die -- die amidst the tear of ten thousand enemy -- die amidst the drum and trumpet of army -- die amidst peal redouble upon peal volley upon volley from the salute clarion of martyr bishop of beauvai because the guilt-burthened man be in dream haunt and waylay by the most frightful of he crime and because upon that fluctuate mirror -- rise -lrb- like the mock mirror of _ mirage _ in arabian desert -rrb- from the fen of death -- most of all be reflect the sweet countenance which the man have lay in ruin therefore i know bishop that you also enter you final dream see domrémy that fountain of which the witness speak so much show itself to you eye in pure morning dew but neither dew nor the holy dawn could cleanse away the bright spot of innocent blood upon its surface by the fountain bishop you see a woman seat that hide she face but as _ you _ draw near the woman raise she waste feature would domrémy know they again for the feature of she child ah but _ you _ know they bishop well oh mercy what a groan be _ that _ which the servant wait outside the bishop 's dream at he bedside hear from he labor heart as at this moment he turn away from the fountain and the woman seek rest in the forest afar off yet not so to escape the woman whom once again he must behold before he die in the forest to which he pray for pity will he find a respite what a tumult what a gathering of foot be there in glade where only wild deer should run army and nation be assemble towering in the fluctuate crowd be phantom that belong to depart hour there be the great english prince regent of france there be my lord of winchester the princely cardinal that die and make no sign there be the bishop of beauvai cling to the shelter of thicket what building be that which hand so rapid be raise be it a martyr 's scaffold will they burn the child of domrémy a second time no : it be a tribunal that rise to the cloud and two nation stand around it wait for a trial shall my lord of beauvai sit again upon the judgment-seat and again number the hour for the innocent ah no : he be the prisoner at the bar already all be wait the mighty audience be gather the court be hurry to they seat the witness be array the trumpet be sound the judge be go to take he place oh but this be sudden my lord have you no counsel counsel i have none : in heaven above or on earth beneath counsellor there be none now that would take a brief from _ I _ : all be silent be it indeed come to this alas the time be short the tumult be wondrous the crowd stretch away into infinity but yet i will search in it for somebody to take you brief : i know of somebody that will be you counsel who be this that cometh from domrémy who be she that cometh in bloody coronation robe from rheim who be she that cometh with blacken flesh from walk the furnace of rouen this be she the shepherd girl counsellor that have none for herself whom i choose bishop for yours she it be i engage that shall take my lord 's brief she it be bishop that would plead for you : yes bishop she -- when heaven and earth be silent note -lrb- note 1 _ arc _ : -- modern france that should know a great deal better than myself insist that the name be not d'arc _ ie _ of arc but _ darc _ now it happen sometimes that if a person whose position guarantee he access to the best information will content himself with gloomy dogmatism strike the table with he fist and say in a terrific voice -- it be so and there be a end of it -- one bow deferentially and submit but if unhappily for himself win by this docility he relent too amiably into reason and argument probably one raise a insurrection against he that may never be crush for in the field of logic one can skirmish perhaps as well as he have he confine himself to dogmatism he would have entrench he position in darkness and have hide he own vulnerable point but come down to base reason he let in light and one see where to plant the blow now the worshipful reason of modern france for disturb the old receive spelling be -- that jean hordal a descendant of _ la pucelle 's _ brother spell the name _ darc _ in 1612 but what of that beside the chance that m hordal might be a gigantic blockhead it be notorious that what small matter of spelling providence have think fit to disburse amongst man in the seventeenth century be all monopolize by printer : in france much more so -rrb- -lrb- note 2 _ those that share thy blood _ : -- a collateral relative of joanna 's be subsequently ennoble by the title of _ du lys _ -rrb- -lrb- note 3 _ jean _ -- m michelet assert that there be a mystical meaning at that era in call a child _ jean _ it imply a secret commendation of a child if not a dedication to st john the evangelist the beloved disciple the apostle of love and mysterious vision but really as the name be so exceedingly common few people will detect a mystery in call a _ boy _ by the name of jack though it _ do _ seem mysterious to call a girl jack it may be less so in france where a beautiful practice have always prevail of give to a boy he mother 's name -- precede and strengthen by a male name as _ charle anne _ _ victor victoire _ in case where a mother 's memory have be unusually dear to a son this vocal memento of she lock into the circle of he own name give to it the tenderness of a testamentary relique or a funeral ring i presume therefore that _ la

nymph anxious to see the equilibrium of advantage re-establish between the two sex -rrb- -lrb- note 7 amongst the many ebullition of m michelet 's fury against we poor english be four which will be likely to amuse the reader and they be the more conspicuous in collision with the justice which he sometimes do we and the very indignant admiration which under some aspect he grant to we 1 we english literature he admire with some gnashing of tooth he pronounce it fine and sombre but i lament to add sceptical judaic satanic -- in a word anti-christian that lord byron should figure as a member of this diabolical corporation will not surprise man it _ will _ surprise they to hear that milton be one of its satanic leader many be the generous and eloquent frenchman beside chateaubriand who have in the course of the last thirty year nobly suspend they own burning nationality in order to render a more rapturous homage at the foot of milton and some of they have raise milton almost to a level with angelic nature not one of they have think of look for he _ below _ the earth as to shakspeare m michelet detect in he a most extraordinary mare 's nest it be this : he do not recollect to have see the name of god in any part of he work on read such word it be natural to rub one 's eye and suspect that all one have ever see in this world may have be a pure ocular delusion in particular i begin myself to suspect that the word _ la gloire _ never occur in any parisian journal the great english nation say m michelet have one immense profound vice to wit pride why really that may be true but we have a neighbor not absolutely clear of a immense profound vice as like ours in color and shape as cherry to cherry in short m michelet think we by fit and start admirable only that we be detestable and he would adore some of we author be it not that so intensely he could have wish to kick they 2 m michelet think to lodge a arrow in we side by a very odd remark upon thomas à kempis : which be that a man of any conceivable european blood -- a finlander suppose or a zantiote -- might have write tom only not a englishman whether a englishman could have forge tom must remain a matter of doubt unless the thing have be try long ago that problem be intercept for ever by tom 's perverseness in choose to manufacture himself yet since nobody be better aware than m michelet that this very point of kempis _ have _ manufacture kempi be furiously and hopelessly litigate three or four nation claim to have forge he work for he the shocking old doubt will raise its snaky head once more -- whether this forger who rest in so much darkness might not after all be of english blood tom it may be fear be know to modern english literature chiefly by a irreverent mention of he name in a line of peter pindar 's -lrb- dr wolcot -rrb- fifty year back where he be describe as kempi tom who clearly show the way to kingdom come few in these day can have read he unless in the methodist version of john wesley amongst those few however happen to be myself which arise from the accident of have when a boy of eleven receive a copy of the _ de imitatione christus _ as a bequest from a relation who die very young from which cause and from the external prettiness of the book be a glasgow reprint by the celebrated fouli and gaily bind i be induce to look into it and finally read it many time over partly out of some sympathy which even in those day i have with its simplicity and devotional fervor but much more from the savage delight i find in laugh at tom 's latinity _ that _ i freely grant to m michelet be inimitable else as regard substance it strike I that i could forge a better _ de imitatione _ myself but there be no know till one try yet after all it be not certain whether the original _ be _ latin but however _ that _ may have be if it be possible that m michelet -lrb- a -rrb- can be accurate in say that there be no less than _ sixty _ french version -lrb- not edition observe but separate version -rrb- exist of the _ de imitatione _ how prodigious must have be the adaptation of the book to the religious heart of the fifteenth century except the bible but except that only in protestant land no book know to man have have the same distinction it be the most marvellous bibliographical fact on record -lrb- footnote a : if m michelet can be accurate however on consideration this statement do not depend on michelet the bibliographer barbier have absolutely _ specify _ sixty in a separate dissertation _ soixante traduction _ amongst those even that have not escape the search the italian translation be say to be thirty as to mere _ edition _ not count the early mss for half a century before printing be introduce those in latin amount to two thousand and those in french to one thousand meantime it be very clear to I that this astonishing popularity so entirely unparalleled in literature could not have exist except in roman catholic time nor subsequently have linger in any protestant land it be the denial of scripture fountain to thirsty land which make this slender rill of scripture truth so passionately welcome -rrb- 3 we english girl it seem be as faulty in one way as we english male in another none of we lad could have write the _ opera omnium _ of mr à kempi neither could any of we lass have assume male attire like _ la pucelle _ but why because say michelet english girl and german think so much of a indecorum well that be a good fault generally speak but m michelet ought to have remember a fact in the martyrology which justify both party -- the french heroine for do and the general choir of english girl for _ not _ do a female saint specially renown in france have for a reason as weighty as joanna 's viz expressly to shield she modesty amongst man wear a male military harness that reason and that example authorize _ la pucelle _ but we english girl as a body have seldom any such reason and certainly no such saintly example to plead this excuse _ they _ yet still if it be indispensable to the national character that we young woman should now and then trespass over the frontier of decorum it then become a patriotic duty in I to assure m michelet that we have such ardent female amongst we and in a long series -- some detect in naval hospital when too sick to remember they disguise some on field of battle multitude never detect at all some only suspect and other discharge without noise by war office and other absurd people in we navy both royal and commercial and generally from deep remembrance of slight love woman have sometimes serve in disguise for many year take contentedly they daily allowance of burgoo biscuit or cannon ball -- anything in short digestible or indigestible that it might please providence to send one thing at least be to they credit : never any of these poor mask with they deep silent remembrance have be detect through murmuring or what be nautically understand by skulk so for once m michelet have a _ erratum _ to enter upon the fly-leaf of he book in presentation copy 4 but the last of these ebullition be the most lively we english at orlean and after orlean -lrb- which be not quite so extraordinary if all be tell -rrb- flee before the maid of arc yes say m michelet you _ do _ : deny it if you can deny it my dear i do not mean to deny it run away in many case be a thing so excellent that no philosopher would at time condescend to adopt any other step all of we nation in europe without one exception have show we philosophy in that way at time even people _ quus ne se rendent pas _ have deign both to run and to shout _ sauve quus pent _ at odd time of sunset though for my part i have no pleasure in recall unpleasant remembrance to brave man and yet really be so philosophic they ought _ not _ to be unpleasant but the amusing feature in m michelet 's reproach be the way in which he _ improve _ and vary against we the charge of run as if he be sing a catch listen to he they _ show they back _ do these english -lrb- hip hip hurrah three time three -rrb- _ behind good wall they let themselves be take _ -lrb- hip hip nine time nine -rrb- they _ run as fast as they leg could carry they _ -lrb- hurrah twenty-seven time twenty-seven -rrb- they _ run before a girl _ they do -lrb- hurrah eighty-one time eighty-one -rrb- this remind one of criminal indictment on the old model in english court where -lrb- for fear the prisoner should escape -rrb- the crown lawyer vary the charge perhaps through forty count the law lay its gun so as to rake the accuse at every possible angle whilst the indictment be read he seem a monster of crime in he own eye and yet after all the poor fellow have but commit one offence and not always _ that _ nb -- not have the french original at hand i make my quotation from a friend 's copy of mr walter kelly 's translation which seem to I faithful spirited and idiomatically english -- liable in fact only to the single reproach of occasional provincialism the english mail-coach or the glory of motion some twenty or more year before i matriculated at oxford mr palmer mp for bath have accomplish two thing very hard to do on we little planet the earth however cheap they may happen to be hold by the eccentric people in comet : he have invent mail-coach and he have marry the daughter -lrb- 1 -rrb- of a duke he be therefore just twice as great a man as galileo who certainly invent -lrb- or _ discover _ -rrb- the satellite of jupiter those very next thing extant to mail-coach in the two capital point of speed and keep time but who do _ not _ marry the daughter of a duke these mail-coach as organize by mr palmer be entitle to a circumstantial notice from myself -- have have so large a share in develop the anarchy of my subsequent dream a agency which they accomplish first through velocity at that time unprecedented they first reveal the glory of motion : suggest at the same time a under-sense not unpleasurable of possible though indefinite danger secondly through grand effect for the eye between lamp-light and the darkness upon solitary road thirdly through animal beauty and power so often display in the class of horse select for this mail service fourthly through the conscious presence of a central intellect that in the midst of vast distance -lrb- 2 -rrb- of storm of darkness of night overrule all obstacle into one steady coöperation in a national result to my own feeling this post-office service recall some mighty orchestra where a thousand instrument all disregard each other and so far in danger of discord yet all obedient as slave to the supreme _ baton _ of some great leader terminate in a perfection of harmony like that of heart vein and artery in a healthy animal organization but finally that particular element in this whole combination which most impressed myself and through which it be that to this hour mr palmer 's mail-coach system tyrannize by terror and terrific beauty over my dream lay in the awful political mission which at that time it fulfil the mail-coach it be that distribute over the face of the land like the opening of apocalyptic vial the heart-shaking news of trafalgar of salamanca of vittorium of waterloo these be the harvest that in the grandeur of they reap redeem the tear and blood in which they have be sow neither be the meanest peasant so much below the grandeur and the sorrow of the time as to confound these battle which be gradually mould the destiny of christendom with the vulgar conflict of ordinary warfare which be oftentimes but gladiatorial trial of national prowess the victory of england in this stupendous contest rise of themselves as natural _ te deum _ to heaven and it be feel by the thoughtful that such victory at such a crisis of general prostration be not more beneficial to ourselves than finally to france and to the nation of western and central europe through whose pusillanimity it be that the french domination have prosper the mail-coach as the national organ for publish these mighty event become itself a spiritualize and glorified object to a impassioned heart and naturally in the oxford of that day all heart be awaken there be perhaps of we gownsmen two thousand _ resident _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- in oxford and disperse through five-and-twenty college in some of these the custom permit the student to keep what be call short term that be the four term of michaelma lend easter and act be keep severally by a residence in the aggregate of ninety-one day or thirteen week under this interrupted residence accordingly it be possible that a student might have a reason for go down to he home four time in the year this make eight journey to and fro and as these home lay disperse through all the shire of the island and most of we disdain all coach except he majesty 's mail no city out of london could pretend to so extensive a connection with mr palmer 's establishment as oxford naturally therefore it become a point of some interest with we whose journey revolve every six week on a average to look a little into the executive detail of the system with some of these mr palmer have no concern they rest upon bye-law not unreasonable enact by posting-house for they own benefit and upon other equally stern enact by the inside passenger for the illustration of they own exclusiveness these last be of a nature to rouse we scorn from which the transition be not _ very long _ to mutiny up to this time it have be the fix assumption of the four inside people -lrb- as a old tradition of all public carriage from the reign of charle ii -rrb- that they the illustrious quaternion constitute a porcelain variety of the human race whose dignity would have be compromise by exchange one word of civility with the three miserable delf ware outside even to have kick a outsider might have be hold to attaint the foot concern in that operation so that perhaps it would have require a act of parliament to restore its purity of blood what word then could express the horror and the sense of treason in that case which _ have _ happen where all three outside the trinity of pariah make a vain attempt to sit down at the same breakfast table or dinner table with the consecrate four i myself witness such a attempt and on that occasion a benevolent old gentleman endeavor to soothe he three holy associate by suggest that if the outside be indict for this criminal attempt at the next assizes the court would regard it as a case of lunacy -lrb- or _ delirium tremen _ -rrb- rather than of treason england owe much of she grandeur to the depth of the aristocratic element in she social composition i be not the man to laugh at it but sometimes it express itself in extravagant shape the course take with the infatuated outsider in the particular attempt which i have notice be that the waiter beckon they away from the privileged _ salle-à-manger _ sing out this way my good man and then entice they away off to the kitchen but that plan have not always answer sometimes though very rarely case occur where the intruder be stronger than usual or more vicious than usual resolutely refuse to move and so far carry they point as to have a separate table arrange for themselves in a corner of the room yet if a indian screen could be find ample enough to plant they out from the very eye of the high table or _ dai _ it then become possible to assume as a fiction of law -- that the three delf fellow after all be not present they could be ignore by the porcelain man under the maxim that object not appear and not exist be govern by the same logical construction such now be at that time the usage of mail-coach what be to be do by we of young oxford we the most aristocratic of people who be addict to the practice of look down superciliously even upon the inside themselves as often very suspicious character be we voluntarily to court indignity if we dress and bearing sheltered we generally from the suspicion of be raff -lrb- the name at that period for snob -lrb- 4 -rrb- -rrb- we really _ be _ such constructively by the place we assume if we do not submit to the deep shadow of eclipse we enter at least the skirt of its penumbra and the analogy of theater be urge against we where no man can complain of the annoyance incident to the pit or gallery have he instant remedy in pay the higher price of the box but the soundness of this analogy we dispute in the case of the theater it can not be pretend that the inferior situation have any separate attraction unless the pit suit the purpose of the dramatic reporter but the reporter or critic be a rarity for most people the sole benefit be in the price whereas on the contrary the outside of the mail have its own incommunicable advantage these we could not forego the higher price we should willingly have pay but that be connect with the condition of ride inside which be insufferable the air the freedom of prospect the proximity to the horse the elevation of seat -- these be what we desire but above all the certain anticipation of purchase occasional opportunity of drive under coercion of this great practical difficulty we institute a search inquiry into the true quality and valuation of the different apartment about the mail we conduct this inquiry on metaphysical principle and it be ascertain satisfactorily that the roof of the coach which some have affect to call the attic and some the garret be really the drawing-room and the box be the chief ottoman or sofa in that drawing-room whilst it appear that the inside which have be traditionally regard as the only room tenantable by gentleman be in fact the coal-cellar in disguise great wit jump the very same idea have not long before strike the celestial intellect of china amongst the present carry out by we first embassy to that country be a state-coach it have be specially select as a personal gift by george iii but the exact mode of use it be a mystery to pekin the ambassador indeed -lrb- lord macartney -rrb- have make some dim and imperfect explanation upon the point but as he excellency communicate these in a diplomatic whisper at the very moment of he departure the celestial mind be very feebly illuminate and it become necessary to call a cabinet council on the grand state question -- where be the emperor to sit the hammer-cloth happen to be unusually gorgeous and partly on that consideration but partly also because the box offer the most elevated seat and undeniably go foremost it be resolve by acclamation that the box be the imperial place and _ for the scoundrel who drive he might sit where he could find a perch _ the horse therefore be harness under a flourish of music and a salute of gun solemnly he imperial majesty ascend he new english throne have the first lord of the treasury on he right hand and the chief jester on he left pekin glory in the spectacle and in the whole flowery people constructively present by representation there be but one discontented person which be the coachman this mutinous individual look as blackhearted as he really be audaciously shout where be _ i _ to sit but the privy council incense by he disloyalty unanimously open the door and kick he into the inside he have all the inside place to himself but such be the rapacity of ambition that he be still dissatisfied i say he cry out in a extempore petition address to the emperor through the window how be i to catch hold of the rein any how be the answer do not trouble _ I _ man in my glory through the window through the key-hole -- how you please finally this contumacious coachman lengthen the checkstring into a sort of jury-rein communicate with the horse with these he drive as steadily as may be suppose the emperor return after the briefest of circuit he descend in great pomp from he throne with the severest resolution never to remount it a public thanksgiving be order for he majesty 's prosperous escape from the disease of a broken neck and the state-coach be dedicate for ever as a votive offering to the god fo fo -- whom the learn more accurately call fus fi a revolution of this same chinese character do young oxford of that era effect in the constitution of mail-coach society it be a perfect french revolution and we have good reason to say _ can ira _ in fact it soon become _ too _ popular the public a well known character particularly disagreeable though slightly respectable and notorious for affect the chief seat in synagogue have at first loudly oppose this revolution but when the opposition show itself to be ineffectual we disagreeable friend go into it with headlong zeal at first it be a sort of race between we and as the public be usually above thirty -lrb- say generally from thirty to fifty year old -rrb- naturally we of young oxford that average about twenty have the advantage then the public take to bribe give fee to horse-keeper & c who hire out they person as warming-pan on the box-seat _ that _ you know be shocking to we moral sensibility come to bribery we observe and there be a end to all morality aristotle 's cicero 's or anybody 's and besides of what use be it for _ we _ bribe also and as we bribe to those of the public be demonstrate out of euclid to be as five shilling to sixpence here again young oxford have the advantage but the contest be ruinous to the principle of the stable establishment about the mail the whole corporation be constantly bribe rebribed and often sur-rebribed so that a horse-keeper ostler or helper be hold by the philosophical at that time to be the most corrupt character in the nation there be a impression upon the public mind natural enough from the continually augment velocity of the mail but quite erroneous that a outside seat on this class of carriage be a post of danger on the contrary i maintain that if a man have become nervous from some gipsey prediction in he childhood allocate to a particular moon now approach some unknown danger and he should inquire earnestly whither can i go for shelter be a prison the safest retreat or a lunatic hospital or the british museum i should have reply oh no i 'll tell you what to do take lodgings for the next forty day on the box of he majesty 's mail nobody can touch you there if it be by bill at ninety day after date that you be make unhappy -- if noter and protester be the sort of wretch whose astrological shadow darken the house of life -- then note you what i vehemently protest viz that no matter though the sheriff in every county should be run after you with he _ posse _ touch a hair of you head he can not whilst you keep house and have you legal domicile on the box of the mail it be felony to stop the mail even the sheriff can not do that and a _ extra _ -lrb- no great matter if it graze the sheriff -rrb- touch of the whip to the leader at any time guarantee you safety in fact a bed-room in a quiet house seem a safe enough retreat yet it be liable to its own notorious nuisance to robber by night to rat to fire but the mail laugh at these terror to robber the answer be pack up and ready for delivery in the barrel of the guard 's blunderbuss rat again there _ be _ none about mail-coach any more than snake in van troil 's iceland except indeed now and then a parliamentary rat who always hide he shame in the coal cellar and as to fire i never know but one in a mail-coach which be in the exeter mail and cause by a obstinate sailor bind to devonport jack make light of the law and the lawgiver that have set they face against he offence insist on take up a forbid seat in the rear of the roof from which he could exchange he own yarn with those of the guard no greater offence be then know to mail-coach it be treason it be _ læsa majesta _ it be by tendency arson and the ash of jack 's pipe fall amongst the straw of the hinder boot contain the mail-bag raise a flame which -lrb- aid by the wind of we motion -rrb- threaten a revolution in the republic of letter but even this leave the sanctity of the box unviolated in dignified repose the coachman and myself sit on rest with benign composure upon we knowledge -- that the fire would have to burn its way through four inside passenger before it could reach ourselves with a quotation rather too trite i remark to the coachman -- -- jam proximus ardet ucalegon but recollect that the virgilian part of he education might have be neglect i interpret so far as to say that perhaps at that moment the flame be catch hold of we worthy brother and next-door neighbor ucalegon the coachman say nothing but by he faint sceptical smile he seem to be think that he know better for that in fact ucalegon as it happen be not in the way-bill no dignity be perfect which do not at some point ally itself with the indeterminate and mysterious the connection of the mail with the state and the executive government -- a connection obvious but yet not strictly define -- give to the whole mail establishment a grandeur and a official authority which do we service on the road and invest we with seasonable terror but perhaps these terror be not the less impressive because they exact legal limit be imperfectly ascertain look at those turnpike gate with what deferential hurry with what a obedient start they fly open at we approach look at that long line of cart and carter ahead audaciously usurp the very crest of the road ah traitor they do not hear we as yet but as soon as the dreadful blast of we horn reach they with the proclamation of we approach see with what frenzy of trepidation they fly to they horse ' head and deprecate we wrath by the precipitation of they crane-neck quartering treason they feel to be they crime each individual carter feel himself under the ban of confiscation and attainder : he blood be attaint through six generation and nothing be want but the headsman and he axe the block and the sawdust to close up the vista of he horror what shall it be within benefit of clergy to delay the king 's message on the high road -- to interrupt the great respiration ebb or flood of the national intercourse -- to endanger the safety of tiding run day and night between all nation and language or can it be fancy amongst the weakest of man that the body of the criminal will be give up to they widow for christian burial now the doubt which be raise as to we power do more to wrap they in terror by wrap they in uncertainty than could have be effect by the sharpest definition of the law from the quarter session we on we part -lrb- we the collective mail i mean -rrb- do we utmost to exalt the idea of we privilege by the insolence with which we wield they whether this insolence rest upon law that give it a sanction or upon conscious power haughtily dispense with that sanction equally it speak from a potential station and the agent in each particular insolence of the moment be view reverentially as one have authority sometimes after breakfast he majesty 's mail would become frisky : and in its difficult wheeling amongst the intricacy of early market it would upset a apple cart a cart load with egg & c huge be the affliction and dismay awful be the smash though after all i believe the damage might be levy upon the hundred i as far as possible endeavor in such a case to represent the conscience and moral sensibility of the mail and when wilderness of egg be lie poach under we horse ' hoof then would i stretch forth my hand in sorrow say -lrb- in word too celebrate in those day from the false -lrb- 5 -rrb- echo of marengo -rrb- -- ah wherefore have we not time to weep over you which be quite impossible for in fact we have not even time to laugh over they tie to post-office time with a allowance in some case of fifty minute for eleven mile could the royal mail pretend to undertake the office of sympathy and condolence could it be expect to provide tear for the accident of the road if even it seem to trample on humanity it do so i contend in discharge of its own more peremptory duty uphold the morality of the mail _ à fortiorus _ i uphold its rights i stretch to the uttermost its privilege of imperial precedency and astonished weak mind by the feudal power which i hint to be lurk constructively in the charter of this proud establishment once i remember be on the box of the holyhead mail between shrewsbury and oswestry when a tawdry thing from birmingham some _ tallyho _ or _ highflier _ all flaunt with green and gold come up alongside of we what a contrast to we royal simplicity of form and color be this plebeian wretch the single ornament on we dark ground of chocolate color be the mighty shield of the imperial arm but emblazon in proportion as modest as a signet-ring bear to a seal of office even this be display only on a single panel whisper rather than proclaim we relation to the state whilst the beast from birmingham have as much writing and painting on its sprawling flank as would have puzzle a decipherer from the tomb of luxor for some time this birmingham machine run along by we side -- a piece of familiarity that seem to we sufficiently jacobinical but all at once a movement of the horse announce a desperate intention of leave we behind do you see _ that _ i say to the coachman i see be he short answer he be awake yet he wait longer than seem prudent for the horse of we audacious opponent have a disagreeable air of freshness and power but he motive be loyal he wish be that the birmingham conceit should be full-blown before he freeze it when _ that _ seem ripe he unloose or to speak by a stronger image he spring he known resource he slip we royal horse like cheeta or hunting leopard after the affrighted game how they could retain such a reserve of fiery power after the work they have accomplish seem hard to explain but on we side besides the physical superiority be a tower of strength namely the king 's name which they upon the adverse faction want pass they without a effort as it seem we throw they into the rear with so lengthen a interval between we as prove in itself the bitterest mockery of they presumption whilst we guard blow back a shatter blast of triumph that be really too painfully full of derision i mention this little incident for its connection with what follow a welshman sit behind I ask if i have not feel my heart burn within I during the continuance of the race i say -- no because we be not race with a mail so that no glory could be gain in fact it be sufficiently mortifying that such a birmingham thing should dare to challenge we the welshman reply that he do not see _ that _ for that a cat might look at a king and a brummagem coach might lawfully race the holyhead mail _ race _ we perhaps i reply though even _ that _ have a air of sedition but not _ beat _ we this would have be treason and for its own sake i be glad that the tallyho be disappoint so dissatisfied do the welshman seem with this opinion that at last i be oblige to tell he a very fine story from one of we elder dramatist viz -- that once in some oriental region when the prince of all the land with he splendid court be fly they falcon a hawk suddenly fly at a majestic eagle and in defiance of the eagle 's prodigious advantage in sight also of all the astonished field sportsman spectator and follower kill he on the spot the prince be strike with amazement at the unequal contest and with burn admiration for its unparalleled result he command that the hawk should be bring before he caress the bird with enthusiasm and order that for the commemoration of he matchless courage a crown of gold should be solemnly place on the hawk 's head but then that immediately after this coronation the bird should be lead off to execution as the most valiant indeed of traitor but not the less a traitor that have dare to rise in rebellion against he liege lord the eagle now say i to the welshman how painful it would have be to you and I as man of refine feeling that this poor brute the tallyho in the impossible case of a victory over we should have be crown with jewellery gold with birmingham ware or paste diamond and then lead off to instant execution the welshman doubt if that could be warrant by law and when i hint at the 10th of edward iii chap 15 for regulate the precedency of coach as be probably the statute rely on for the capital punishment of such offence he reply drily -- that if the attempt to pass a mail be really treasonable it be a pity that the tallyho appear to have so imperfect a acquaintance with law these be among the gaiety of my earliest and boyish acquaintance with mail but alike the gayest and the most terrific of my experience rise again after year of slumber arm with preternatural power to shake my dream sensibility sometimes as in the slight case of miss fanny on the bath road -lrb- which i will immediately mention -rrb- through some casual or capricious association with image originally gay yet open at some stage of evolution into sudden capacity of horror sometimes through the more natural and fixed alliance with the sense of power so various lodge in the mail system the modern mode of travel can not compare with the mail-coach system in grandeur and power they boast of more velocity but not however as a consciousness but as a fact of we lifeless knowledge rest upon _ alien _ evidence as for instance because somebody _ say _ that we have go fifty mile in the hour or upon the evidence of a result as that actually we find ourselves in york four hour after leave london apart from such a assertion or such a result i be little aware of the pace but seat on the old mail-coach we need no evidence out of ourselves to indicate the velocity on this system the word be -- _ non magna loquimur _ as upon railway but _ magna vivimus _ the vital experience of the glad animal sensibility make doubt impossible on the question of we speed we hear we speed we see it we feel it as a thrilling and this speed be not the product of blind insensate agency that have no sympathy to give but be incarnate in the fiery eyeball of a animal in he dilated nostril spasmodic muscle and echo hoof this speed be incarnate in the _ visible _ contagion amongst brute of some impulse that radiate into _ they _ nature have yet its center and beginning in man the sensibility of the horse utter itself in the maniac light of he eye might be the last vibration of such a movement the glory of salamanca might be the first -- but the intervene link that connect they that spread the earthquake of the battle into the eyeball of the horse be the heart of man -- kindling in the rapture of the fiery strife and then propagate its own tumult by motion and gesture to the sympathy more or less dim in he servant the horse but now on the new system of travel iron tube and boiler have disconnect man 's heart from the minister of he locomotion nile nor trafalgar have power any more to raise a extra bubble in a steam-kettle the galvanic cycle be break up for ever : man 's imperial nature no longer send itself forward through the electric sensibility of the horse the inter-agency be go in the mode of communication between the horse and he master out of which grow so many aspect of sublimity under accident of mist that hide or sudden blaze that reveal of mob that agitate or midnight solitude that awed tiding fit to convulse all nation must henceforward travel by culinary process and the trumpet that once announce from afar the laurelled mail heart-shaking when hear scream on the wind and advance through the darkness to every village or solitary house on its route have now give way for ever to the pot-walloping of the boiler thus have perish multiform opening for sublime effect for interesting personal communication for revelation of impressive face that could not have offer themselves amongst the hurry and fluctuate group of a railway station the gathering of gazer about a mail-coach have one center and acknowledge only one interest but the crowd attend at a railway station have as little unity as run water and own as many centre as there be separate carriage in the train how else for example than as a constant watcher for the dawn and for the london mail that in summer month enter about dawn into the lawny thicket of marlborough forest couldst thou sweet fanny of the bath road have become know to myself yet fanny as the loveliest young woman for face and person that perhaps in my whole life i have behold merit the station which even _ she _ i could not willingly have spare yet -lrb- thirty-five year later -rrb- she hold in my dream : and though by a accident of fanciful caprice she bring along with she into those dream a troop of dreadful creature fabulous and not fabulous that be more abominable to a human heart than fanny and the dawn be delightful miss fanny of the bath road strictly speak live at a mile 's distance from that road but come so continually to meet the mail that i on my frequent transit rarely miss she and naturally connect she name with the great thoroughfare where i see she i do not exactly know but i believe with some burthen of commission to be execute in bath she own residence be probably the center to which these commission gather the mail coachman who wear the royal livery be one amongst the privileged few -lrb- 6 -rrb- happen to be fanny 's grandfather a good man he be that love he beautiful granddaughter and loving she wisely be vigilant over she deportment in any case where young oxford might happen to be concern be i then vain enough to imagine that i myself individually could fall within the line of he terror certainly not as regard any physical pretension that i could plead for fanny -lrb- as a chance passenger from she own neighborhood once tell I -rrb- count in she train a hundred and ninety-nine profess admirer if not open aspirant to she favor and probably not one of the whole brigade but excel myself in personal advantage ulyss even with the unfair advantage of he accursed bow could hardly have undertake that amount of suitor so the danger might have seem slight -- only that woman be universally aristocratic it be amongst she nobility of heart that she _ be _ so now the aristocratic distinction in my favor might easily with miss fanny have compensate my physical deficiency do i then make love to fanny why yes _ mais oui donc _ as much love as one _ can _ make whilst the mail be change horse a process which ten year later do not occupy above eighty seconds but _ then _ viz about waterloo it occupy five time eighty now four hundred seconds offer a field quite ample enough for whisper into a young woman 's ear a great deal of truth and -lrb- by way of parenthesis -rrb- some trifle of falsehood grandpapa do right therefore to watch I and yet as happen too often to the grandpapa of earth in a contest with the admirer of granddaughter how vainly would he have watch I have i meditate any evil whisper to fanny she it be my belief would have protect herself against any man 's evil suggestion but he as the result show could not have intercept the opportunity for such suggestion yet he be still active he be still bloom bloom he be as fanny herself say all we praise why should lord -- no that be not the line say all we rose why should girl engross the coachman show rosy blossom on he face deeper even than he granddaughter 's -- _ he _ be draw from the ale cask fanny 's from youth and innocence and from the fountain of the dawn but in spite of he bloom face some infirmity he have and one particularly -lrb- i be very sure no _ more _ than one -rrb- in which he too much resemble a crocodile this lay in a monstrous inaptitude for turn round the crocodile i presume owe that inaptitude to the absurd _ length _ of he back but in we grandpapa it arise rather from the absurd _ breadth _ of he back combined probably with some grow stiffness in he leg now upon this crocodile infirmity of he i plant a easy opportunity for tender my homage to miss fanny in defiance of all he honorable vigilance no sooner have he present to we he mighty jovian back -lrb- what a field for display to mankind he royal scarlet -rrb- whilst inspect professionally the buckle the strap and the silver turret of he harness than i raise miss fanny 's hand to my lip and by the mixed tenderness and respectfulness of my manner cause she easily to understand how happy it would have make I to rank upon she list as no 10 or 12 in which case a few casualty amongst she lover -lrb- and observe -- they _ hang _ liberally in those day -rrb- might have promote I speedily to the top of the tree as on the other hand with how much loyalty of submission i acquiesce in she allotment suppose that she have see reason to plant I in the very rearward of she favor as no 199 +1 it must not be suppose that i allow any trace of jest or even of playfulness to mingle with these expression of my admiration that would have be insulting to she and would have be false as regard my own feeling in fact the utter shadowyness of we relation to each other even after we meeting through seven or eight year have be very numerous but of necessity have be very brief be entirely on mail-coach allowance -- timid in reality by the general post-office -- and watch by a crocodile belong to the antepenultimate generation leave it easy for I to do a thing which few people ever _ can _ have do -- viz to make love for seven year at the same time to be as sincere as ever creature be and yet never to compromise myself by overture that might have be foolish as regard my own interest or mislead as regard hers most truly i love this beautiful and ingenuous girl and have it not be for the bath and bristol mail heaven only know what might have come of it people talk of be over head and ear in love -- now the mail be the cause that i sink only over ear in love which you know still leave a trifle of brain to overlook the whole conduct of the affair i have mention the case at all for the sake of a dreadful result from it in after year of dream but it seem _ ex abundanti _ to yield this moral -- viz that as in england the idiot and the half-wit be hold to be under the guardianship of chancery so the man make love who be often but a variety of the same imbecile class ought to be make a ward of the general post-office whose severe course of _ timing _ and periodical interruption might intercept many a foolish declaration such as lay a solid foundation for fifty year ' repentance ah reader when i look back upon those day it seem to I that all thing change or perish even thunder and lightning it pain I to say be not the thunder and lightning which i seem to remember about the time of waterloo rose i fear be degenerate and without a red revolution must come to the dust the fanny of we island -- though this i say with reluctance -- be not improve and the bath road be notoriously superannuated mr waterton tell I that the crocodile do _ not _ change -- that a cayman in fact or a alligator be just as good for ride upon as he be in the time of the pharaoh _ that _ may be but the reason be that the crocodile do not live fast -- he be a slow coach i believe it be generally understand amongst naturalist that the crocodile be a blockhead it be my own impression that the pharaoh be also blockhead now as the pharaoh and the crocodile domineer over egyptian society this account for a singular mistake that prevail on the nile the crocodile make the ridiculous blunder of suppose man to be mean chiefly for he own eating man take a different view of the subject naturally meet that mistake by another he view the crocodile as a thing sometimes to worship but always to run away from and this continue until mr waterton change the relation between the animal the mode of escape from the reptile he show to be not by run away but by leap on its back boot and spur the two animal have misunderstand each other the use of the crocodile have now be clear up -- it be to be ridden and the use of man be that he may improve the health of the crocodile by ride he a fox-hunting before breakfast and it be pretty certain that any crocodile who have be regularly hunt through the season and be master of the weight he carry will take a six-barred gate now as well as ever he would have do in the infancy of the pyramid perhaps therefore the crocodile do _ not _ change but all thing else _ do _ : even the shadow of the pyramid grow less and often the restoration in vision of fanny and the bath road make I too pathetically sensible of that truth out of the darkness if i happen to call up the image of fanny from thirty-five year back arise suddenly a rose in June or if i think for a instant of the rose in June up rise the heavenly face of fanny one after the other like the antiphony in the choral service rise fanny and the rose in June then back again the rose in June and fanny then come both together as in a chorus rose and fanny fanny and rose without end -- thick as blossom in paradise then come a venerable crocodile in a royal livery of scarlet and gold or in a coat with sixteen cape and the crocodile be drive four-in-hand from the box of the bath mail and suddenly we upon the mail be pull up by a mighty dial sculpture with the hour and with the dreadful legend of too late then all at once we be arrive at marlborough forest amongst the lovely household -lrb- 7 -rrb- of the roe-deer : these retire into the dewy thicket the thicket be rich with rose the rose call up -lrb- as ever -rrb- the sweet countenance of fanny who be the granddaughter of a crocodile awaken a dreadful host of wild semi-legendary animal -- griffin dragon basilisk sphinx -- till at length the whole vision of fight image crowd into one tower armorial shield a vast emblazonry of human charity and human loveliness that have perish but quarter heraldically with unutterable horror of monstrous and demoniac nature whilst over all rise as a surmount crest one fair female hand with the fore-finger point in sweet sorrowful admonition upward to heaven and have power -lrb- which without experience i never could have believe -rrb- to awaken the pathos that kill in the very bosom of the horror that madden the grief that gnaw at the heart together with the monstrous creation of darkness that shock the belief and make dizzy the reason of man this be the peculiarity that i wish the reader to notice as have first be make know to I for a possibility by this early vision of fanny on the bath road the peculiarity consist in the confluence of two different key though apparently repel each other into the music and govern principle of the same dream horror such as possess the maniac and yet by momentary transition grief such as may be suppose to possess the die mother when leave she infant child to the mercy of the cruel usually and perhaps always in a unshaken nervous system these two mode of misery exclude each other -- here first they meet in horrid reconciliation there be also a separate peculiarity in the quality of the horror this be afterwards develop into far more revolting complexity of misery and incomprehensible darkness and perhaps i be wrong in ascribe any value as a _ causative _ agency to this particular case on the bath road -- possibly it furnish merely a _ occasion _ that accidentally introduce a mode of horror certain to any rate to have grow up with or without the bath road from more advanced stage of the nervous derangement yet as the cub of tiger or leopard when domesticate have be observe to suffer a sudden development of they latent ferocity under too eager a appeal to they playfulness -- the gaiety of sport in _ they _ be too closely connect with the fiery brightness of they murderous instinct -- so i have remark that the caprice the gay arabesque and the lovely floral luxuriation of dream betray a shocking tendency to pass into finer maniacal splendor that gaiety for instance -lrb- for such as first it be -rrb- in the dream faculty by which one principal point of resemblance to a crocodile in the mail-coachman be soon make to clothe he with the form of a crocodile and yet be blended with accessory circumstance derive from he _ human _ function pass rapidly into a further development no longer gay or playful but terrific the most terrific that besiege dream viz -- the horrid inoculation upon each other of incompatible nature this horror have always be secretly feel by man it be feel even under pagan form of religion which offer a very feeble and also a very limited gamut for give expression to the human capacity of sublimity or of horror we read it in the fearful composition of the sphinx the dragon again be the snake inoculate upon the scorpion the basilisk unite the mysterious malice of the evil eye unintentional on the part of the unhappy agent with the intentional venom of some other malignant nature but these horrid complexity of evil agency be but _ objectively _ horrid they inflict the horror suitable to they compound nature but there be no insinuation that they _ feel _ that horror heraldry be so full of these fantastic creature that in some zoology we find a separate chapter or a supplement dedicate to what be denominate heraldic zoology and why not for these hideous creature however visionary -lrb- 8 -rrb- have a real traditionary ground in medieval belief -- sincere and partly reasonable though adulterate with mendacity blundering credulity and intense superstition but the dream-horror which i speak of be far more frightful the dreamer find house within himself -- occupy as it be some separate chamber in he brain -- hold perhaps from that station a secret and detestable commerce with he own heart -- some horrid alien nature what if it be he own nature repeat -- still if the duality be distinctly perceptible even _ that _ -- even this mere numerical double of he own consciousness -- might be a curse too mighty to be sustained but how if the alien nature contradict he own fight with it perplex and confound it how again if not one alien nature but two but three but four but five be introduce within what once he think the inviolable sanctuary of himself these however be horror from the kingdom of anarchy and darkness which by they very intensity challenge the sanctity of concealment and gloomily retire from exposition yet it be necessary to mention they because the first introduction to such appearance -lrb- whether causal or merely casual -rrb- lay in the heraldic monster -lrb- which monster be themselves introduce though playfully -rrb- by the transfigured coachman of the bath mail go down with victory but the grandest chapter of we experience within the whole mail-coach service be on those occasion when we go down from london with the news of victory a period of about ten year stretch from trafalgar to waterloo : the second and third year of which period -lrb- 1806 and 1807 -rrb- be comparatively sterile but the rest from 1805 to 1815 inclusively furnish a long succession of victory the least of which in a contest of that portentous nature have a inappreciable value of position -- partly for its absolute interference with the plan of we enemy but still more from its keep alive in central europe the sense of a deep-seated vulnerability in france even to tease the coast of we enemy to mortify they by continual blockade to insult they by capture if it be but a baubling schooner under the eye of they arrogant army repeat from time to time a sullen proclamation of power lodge in a quarter to which the hope of christendom turn in secret how much more loudly must this proclamation have speak in the audacity -lrb- 9 -rrb- of have beard the _ elite _ of they troops and have beat they in pitched battle five year of life it be worth pay down for the privilege of a outside place on a mail-coach when carry down the first tiding of any such event and it be to be note that from we insular situation and the multitude of we frigate disposable for the rapid transmission of intelligence rarely do any unauthorized rumor steal away a prelibation from the aroma of the regular dispatch the government official news be generally the first news from eight pm to fifteen or twenty minute later imagine the mail assemble on parade in lombard street where at that time be seat the general post-office in what exact strength we muster i do not remember but from the length of each separate _ attelage _ we fill the street though a long one and though we be draw up in double file on _ any _ night the spectacle be beautiful the absolute perfection of all the appointment about the carriage and the harness and the magnificence of the horse be what might first have fix the attention every carriage on every morning in the year be take down to a inspector for examination -- wheel axle linch-pin pole glass & c be all critically probe and test every part of every carriage have be clean every horse have be groom with as much rigor as if they belong to a private gentleman and that part of the spectacle offer itself always but the night before we be a night of victory and behold to the ordinary display what a heart-shaking addition -- horse man carriage -- all be dress in laurel and flower oak leave and ribbon the guard who be he majesty 's servant and the coachman who be within the privilege of the post-office wear the royal livery of course and as it be summer -lrb- for all the _ land _ victory be win in summer -rrb- they wear on this fine evening these livery expose to view without any cover of upper coat such a costume and the elaborate arrangement of the laurel in they hat dilate they heart by give to they openly a _ official _ connection with the great news in which already they have the general interest of patriotism that great national sentiment surmount and quell all sense of ordinary distinction those passenger who happen to be gentleman be now hardly to be distinguish as such except by dress the usual reserve of they manner in speak to the attendant have on this night melt away one heart one pride one glory connect every man by the transcendent bond of he english blood the spectator who be numerous beyond precedent express they sympathy with these fervent feeling by continual hurrah every moment be shout aloud by the post-office servant the great ancestral name of city know to history through a thousand year -- lincoln winchester portsmouth gloucester oxford bristol manchester york newcastle edinburgh perth glasgow -- express the grandeur of the empire by the antiquity of its town and the grandeur of the mail establishment by the diffusive radiation of its separate mission every moment you hear the thunder of lid lock down upon the mail-bag that sound to each individual mail be the signal for draw off which process be the finest part of the entire spectacle then come the horse into play -- horse can these be horse that -lrb- unless powerfully rein in -rrb- would bind off with the action and gesture of leopard what stir -- what sea-like ferment -- what a thunder of wheel what a trampling of horse -- what farewell cheer -- what redouble peal of brotherly congratulation connect the name of the particular mail -- liverpool for ever -- with the name of the particular victory -- badajoz for ever or salamanca for ever the half-slumbering consciousness that all night long and all the next day -- perhaps for even a longer period -- many of these mail like fire racing along a train of gunpowder will be kindle at every instant new succession of burn joy have a obscure effect of multiply the victory itself by multiply to the imagination into infinity the stage of its progressive diffusion a fiery arrow seem to be let loose which from that moment be destine to travel almost without intermission westward for three hundred -lrb- 10 -rrb- mile -- northwards for six hundred and the sympathy of we lombard street friend at parting be exalt a hundred fold by a sort of visionary sympathy with the approach sympathy yet unborn which we be go to evoke liberate from the embarrassment of the city and issue into the broad uncrowded avenue of the northern suburb we begin to enter upon we natural pace of ten mile a hour in the broad light of the summer evening the sun perhaps only just at the point of set we be see from every story of every house head of every age crowd to the window -- young and old understand the language of we victorious symbol -- and roll volley of sympathize cheer run along behind and before we course the beggar rear himself against the wall forget he lameness -- real or assume -- think not of he whine trade but stand erect with bold exult smile as we pass he the victory have heal he and say -- be thou whole woman and child from garret alike and cellar look down or look up with loving eye upon we gay ribbon and we martial laurel -- sometimes kiss they hand sometimes hang out as signal of affection pocket handkerchief apron duster anything that lie ready to they hand on the london side of barnet to which we draw near within a few minute after nine observe that private carriage which be approach we the weather be so warm the glass be all down and one may read as on the stage of a theater everything that go on within the carriage it contain three lady one likely to be mama and two of seventeen or eighteen who be probably she daughter what lovely animation what beautiful unpremeditated pantomime explain to we every syllable that pass in these ingenuous girl by the sudden start and raising of the hand on first discover we laurelled equipage -- by the sudden movement and appeal to the elder lady from both of they -- and by the heighten color on they animated countenance we can almost hear they say -- see see look at they laurel oh mama there have be a great battle in spain and it have be a great victory in a moment we be on the point of pass they we passenger -- i on the box and the two on the roof behind I -- raise we hat the coachman make he professional salute with the whip the guard even though punctilious on the matter of he dignity as a officer under the crown touch he hat the lady move to we in return with a win graciousness of gesture : all smile on each side in a way that nobody could misunderstand and that nothing short of a grand national sympathy could so instantaneously prompt will these lady say that we be nothing to _ they _ oh no they will not say _ that _ they can not deny -- they do not deny -- that for this night they be we sister : gentle or simple scholar or illiterate servant for twelve hour to come -- we on the outside have the honor to be they brother those poor woman again who stop to gaze upon we with delight at the entrance of barnet and seem by they air of weariness to be return from labor -- do you mean to say that they be washerwoman and char-woman oh my poor friend you be quite mistaken they be nothing of the kind i assure you they stand in a higher rank for this one night they feel themselves by birthright to be daughter of england and answer to no humbler title every joy however even rapturous joy -- such be the sad law of earth -- may carry with it grief or fear of grief to some three mile beyond barnet we see approach we another private carriage nearly repeat the circumstance of the former case here also the glass be all down -- here also be a elderly lady seat but the two amiable daughter be miss for the single young person sit by the lady 's side seem to be a attendant -- so i judge from she dress and she air of respectful reserve the lady be in mourning and she countenance express sorrow at first she do not look up so that i believe she be not aware of we approach until she hear the measure beating of we horse ' hoof then she raise she eye to settle they painfully on we triumphal equipage we decoration explain the case to she at once but she behold they with apparent anxiety or even with terror some time before this i find it difficult to hit a fly mark when embarrass by the coachman 's person and rein intervene have give to the guard a _ courier _ evening paper contain the gazette for the next carriage that might pass accordingly he toss it in so fold that the huge capital express some such legend as -- glorious victory might catch the eye at once to see the paper however at all interpret as it be by we ensign of triumph explain everything and if the guard be right in think the lady to have receive it with a gesture of horror it could not be doubtful that she have suffer some deep personal affliction in connection with this spanish war here now be the case of one who have formerly suffer might erroneously perhaps be distressing herself with anticipation of another similar suffering that same night and hardly three hour later occur the reverse case a poor woman who too probably would find herself in a day or two to have suffer the heaviest of affliction by the battle blindly allow herself to express a exultation so unmeasured in the news and its detail as give to she the appearance which amongst celtic highlander be call _ fey _ this be at some little town i forget what where we happen to change horse near midnight some fair or wake have keep the people up out of they bed we see many light move about as we draw near and perhaps the most impressive scene on we route be we reception at this place the flash of torch and the beautiful radiance of blue light -lrb- technically bengal light -rrb- upon the head of we horse the fine effect of such a showery and ghostly illumination fall upon flower and glitter laurel whilst all around the massy darkness seem to invest we with wall of impenetrable blackness together with the prodigious enthusiasm of the people compose a picture at once scenical and affect as we staid for three or four minute i alight and immediately from a dismantle stall in the street where perhaps she have be preside at some part of the evening advance eagerly a middle-aged woman the sight of my newspaper it be that have draw she attention upon myself the victory which we be carry down to the province on _ this _ occasion be the imperfect one of talavera i tell she the main outline of the battle but she agitation though not the agitation of fear but of exultation rather and enthusiasm have be so conspicuous when listen and when first apply for information that i could not but ask she if she have not some relation in the peninsular army oh yes : she only son be there in what regiment he be a trooper in the 23d dragoon my heart sink within I as she make that answer this sublime regiment which a englishman should never mention without raise he hat to they memory have make the most memorable and effective charge record in military annals they leap they horse -- _ over _ a trench where they could _ into _ it and with the result of death or mutilation when they could _ not _ what proportion clear the trench be nowhere state those who _ do _ close up and go down upon the enemy with such divinity of fervor -- -lrb- i use the word _ divinity _ by design : the inspiration of god must have prompt this movement to those whom even then he be call to he presence -rrb- -- that two result follow as regard the enemy this 23d dragoon not i believe originally three hundred and fifty strong paralyzed a french column six thousand strong then ascend the hill and fix the gaze of the whole french army as regard themselves the 23d be suppose at first to have be all but annihilate but eventually i believe not so many as one in four survive and this then be the regiment -- a regiment already for some hour know to myself and all london as stretch by a large majority upon one bloody aceldama -- in which the young trooper serve whose mother be now talk with myself in a spirit of such hopeful enthusiasm do i tell she the truth have i the heart to break up she dream no i say to myself to-morrow or the next day she will hear the worst for this night wherefore should she not sleep in peace after to-morrow the chance be too many that peace will forsake she pillow this brief respite let she owe this to _ my _ gift and _ my _ forbearance but if i tell she not of the bloody price that have be pay there be no reason for suppress the contribution from she son 's regiment to the service and glory of the day for the very few word that i have time for speak i govern myself accordingly i show she not the funeral banner under which the noble regiment be sleep i lift not the overshadow laurel from the bloody trench in which horse and rider lay mangled together but i tell she how these dear child of england private and officer have leap they horse over all obstacle as gaily as hunter to the morning 's chase i tell she how they ride they horse into the mist of death -lrb- say to myself but not say to _ she _ -rrb- and lay down they young life for thee o mother england as willingly -- pour out they noble blood as cheerfully -- as ever after a long day 's sport when infant they have rest they wearied head upon they mother 's knee or have sink to sleep in she arm it be singular that she seem to have no fear even after this knowledge that the 23d dragoon have be conspicuously engage for she son 's safety : but so much be she enrapture by the knowledge that _ he _ regiment and therefore _ he _ have render eminent service in the try conflict -- a service which have actually make they the foremost topic of conversation in london -- that in the mere simplicity of she fervent nature she throw she arm round my neck and poor woman kiss I note -lrb- note 1 lady madeline gordon -rrb- -lrb- note 2 _ vast distance _ -- one case be familiar to mail-coach traveller where two mail in opposite direction north and south start at the same minute from point six hundred mile apart meet almost constantly at a particular bridge which exactly bisect the total distance -rrb- -lrb- note 3 _ resident _ -- the number on the book be far greater many of whom keep up a intermitting communication with oxford but i speak of those only who be steadily pursue they academic study and of those who reside constantly as _ fellow _ -rrb- -lrb- note 4 _ snob _ and its antithesis _ nob _ arise among the internal fraction of shoemaker perhaps ten year later possibly enough the term may have exist much earlier but they be then first make known picturesquely and effectively by a trial at some assizes which happen to fix the public attention -rrb- -lrb- note 5 _ false echo _ -- yes false for the word ascribe to napoleon as breathe to the memory of desaix never be utter at all -- they stand in the same category of theatrical invention as the cry of the founder _ vengeur _ as the vaunt of general cambronne at waterloo _ la garde meurt mai ne se rend pas _ as the repartee of talleyrand -rrb- -lrb- note 6 _ privileged few _ the general impression be that this splendid costume belong of right to the mail-coachman as they professional dress but that be a error to the guard it _ do _ belong as a matter of course and be essential as a official warrant and a means of instant identification for he person in the discharge of he important public duty but the coachman and especially if he place in the series do not connect he immediately with london and the general post-office obtain the scarlet coat only as a honorary distinction after long or special service -rrb- -lrb- note 7 _ household _ -- roe-deer do not congregate in herd like the fallow or the red deer but by separate family parent and child which feature of approximation to the sanctity of human hearth add to they comparatively miniature and graceful proportion conciliate to they a interest of a peculiarly tender character if less dignified by the grandeur of savage and forest life -rrb- -lrb- note 8 _ however visionary _ -- but _ be _ they always visionary the unicorn the kraken the sea-serpent be all perhaps zoological fact the unicorn for instance so far from be a lie be rather _ too _ true for simply as a _ monokeras _ he be find in the himalaya in africa and elsewhere rather too often for the peace of what in scotland would be call the _ intend _ traveller that which really _ be _ a lie in the account of the unicorn -- viz he legendary rivalship with the lion -- which lie may god preserve in preserve the mighty imperial shield that embalm it -- can not be more destructive to the zoological pretension of the unicorn than be to the same pretension in the lion we many popular craze about he goodness and magnanimity or the old fancy -lrb- adopt by spenser and notice by so many among we elder poet -rrb- of he graciousness to maiden innocence the wretch be the basest and most cowardly among the forest tribe nor have the sublime courage of the english bull-dog ever be so memorably exhibit as in he hopeless fight at warwick with the cowardly and cruel lion call wallace another of the traditional creature still doubtful be the mermaid upon which southey once remark to I that if it have be differently name -lrb- as suppose a mer-ape -rrb- nobody would have question its existence any more than that of sea-cows sea-lion & c the mermaid have be discredit by she human name and she legendary human habit if she would not coquette so much with melancholy sailor and brush she hair so assiduously upon solitary rock she would be carry on we book for as honest a reality as decent a female as many that be assess to the poor-rate -rrb- -lrb- note 9 _ audacity _ -- such the french account it and it have strike I that soult would not have be so popular in london at the period of she present majesty 's coronation or in manchester on occasion of he visit to that town if they have be aware of the insolence with which he speak of we in note write at interval from the field of waterloo as though it have be mere felony in we army to look a french one in the face he say more than once -- here be the english -- we have they : they be catch _ en flagrant delit _ yet no man should have know we better no man have drunk deeper from the cup of humiliation than soult have in the north of portugal during the flight from a english army and subsequently at albuera in the bloodiest of recorded battle -rrb- -lrb- note 10 _ three hundred _ of necessity this scale of measurement to a american if he happen to be a thoughtless man must sound ludicrous accordingly i remember a case in which a american writer indulge himself in the luxury of a little lie by ascribe to a englishman a pompous account of the thame construct entirely upon american idea of grandeur and conclude in something like these term : -- and sir arrive at london this mighty father of river attain a breadth of at least two furlong have in its wind course traverse the astonishing distance of one hundred and seventy mile and this the candid american think it fair to contrast with the scale of the mississippus now it be hardly worth while to answer a pure falsehood gravely else one might say that no englishman out of bedlam ever think of look in a island for the river of a continent nor consequently could have think of look for the peculiar grandeur of the thame in the length of its course or in the extent of soil which it drain : yet if he _ have _ be so absurd the american might have recollect that a river not to be compare with the thame even as to volume of water -- viz the tiber -- have contrived to make itself hear of in this world for twenty-five century to a extent not reach nor likely to be reach very soon by any river however corpulent of he own land the glory of the thame be measure by the density of the population to which it minister by the commerce which it support by the grandeur of the empire in which though far from the largest it be the most influential stream upon some such scale and not by a transfer of columbian standard be the course of we english mail to be value the american may fancy the effect of he own valuation to we english ear by suppose the case of a siberian glorify he country in these term : -- these rascal sir in france and england can not march half a mile in any direction without find a house where food can be have and lodge whereas such be the noble desolation of we magnificent country that in many a direction for a thousand mile i will engage a dog shall not find shelter from a snow-storm nor a wren find a apology for breakfast -rrb- the vision of sudden death -lrb- the reader be to understand this present paper in its two section of _ the vision _ & c and _ the dream-fugue _ as connect with a previous paper on _ the english mail-coach _ the ultimate object be the dream-fugue as a attempt to wrestle with the utmost effort of music in deal with a colossal form of impassioned horror the vision of sudden death contain the mail-coach incident which do really occur and do really suggest the variation of the dream here take up by the fugue as well as other variation not now record confluent with these impression from the terrific experience on the manchester and glasgow mail be other and more general impression derive from long familiarity with the english mail as develop in the former paper impression for instance of animal beauty and power of rapid motion at that time unprecedented of connection with the government and public business of a great nation but above all of connection with the national victory at a unexampled crisis -- the mail be the privileged organ for publishing and disperse all news of that kind from this function of the mail arise naturally the introduction of waterloo into the fourth variation of the fogue for the mail itself have be carry into the dream by the incident in the vision naturally all the accessory circumstance of pomp and grandeur investing this national carriage follow in the train of the principal image -rrb- what be to be think of sudden death it be remarkable that in different condition of society it have be variously regard as the consummation of a earthly career most fervently to be desire and on the other hand as that consummation which be most of all to be deprecate cæsar the dictator at he last dinner party -lrb- _ coena _ -rrb- and the very evening before he assassination be question as to the mode of death which in _ he _ opinion might seem the most eligible reply -- that which should be most sudden on the other hand the divine litany of we english church when breathe forth supplication as if in some representative character for the whole human race prostrate before god place such a death in the very van of horror from lightning and tempest from plague pestilence and famine from battle and murder and from sudden death -- _ good lord deliver we _ sudden death be here make to crown the climax in a grand ascent of calamity it be the last of curse and yet by the noblest of roman it be treat as the first of blessing in that difference most reader will see little more than the difference between christianity and paganism but there i hesitate the christian church may be right in its estimate of sudden death and it be a natural feeling though after all it may also be a infirm one to wish for a quiet dismissal from life -- as that which _ seem _ most reconcilable with meditation with penitential retrospect and with the humility of farewell prayer there do not however occur to I any direct scriptural warrant for this earnest petition of the english litany it seem rather a petition indulge to human infirmity than exact from human piety and however _ that _ may be two remark suggest themselves as prudent restraint upon a doctrine which else _ may _ wander and _ have _ wander into a uncharitable superstition the first be this : that many people be likely to exaggerate the horror of a sudden death -lrb- i mean the _ objective _ horror to he who contemplate such a death not the _ subjective _ horror to he who suffer it -rrb- from the false disposition to lay a stress upon word or act simply because by a accident they have become word or act if a man die for instance by some sudden death when he happen to be intoxicate such a death be falsely regard with peculiar horror as though the intoxication be suddenly exalt into a blasphemy but _ that _ be unphilosophic the man be or he be not _ habitually _ a drunkard if not if he intoxication be a solitary accident there can be no reason at all for allow special emphasis to this act simply because through misfortune it become he final act nor on the other hand if it be no accident but one of he _ habitual _ transgression will it be the more habitual or the more a transgression because some sudden calamity surprising he have cause this habitual transgression to be also a final one could the man have have any reason even dimly to foresee he own sudden death there would have be a new feature in he act of intemperance -- a feature of presumption and irreverence as in one that by possibility feel himself draw near to the presence of god but this be no part of the case suppose and the only new element in the man 's act be not any element of extra immorality but simply of extra misfortune the other remark have reference to the meaning of the word _ sudden _ and it be a strong illustration of the duty which for ever call we to the stern valuation of word -- that very possibly cæesar and the christian church do not differ in the way suppose that be do not differ by any difference of doctrine as between pagan and christian view of the moral temper appropriate to death but that they be contemplate different case both contemplate a violent death a -lrb- greek : biathanato -rrb- -- death that be -lrb- greek : biaio -rrb- : but the difference be -- that the roman by the word sudden mean a _ unlinger _ death : whereas the christian litany by sudden means a death _ without warn _ consequently without any available summons to religious preparation the poor mutineer who kneel down to gather into he heart the bullet from twelve firelock of he pity comrade die by a most sudden death in cæsar 's sense : one shock one mighty spasm one -lrb- possibly _ not _ one -rrb- groan and all be over but in the sense of the litany he death be far from sudden he offence originally he imprisonment he trial the interval between he sentence and its execution have all furnish he with separate warning of he fate -- have all summon he to meet it with solemn preparation meantime whatever may be think of a sudden death as a mere variety in the mode of die where death in some shape be inevitable -- a question which equally in the roman and the christian sense will be variously answer accord to each man 's variety of temperament -- certainly upon one aspect of sudden death there can be no opening for doubt that of all agony incident to man it be the most frightful that of all martyrdom it be the most freezing to human sensibility -- namely where it surprise a man under circumstance which offer -lrb- or which seem to offer -rrb- some hurry and inappreciable chance of evade it any effort by which such a evasion can be accomplish must be as sudden as the danger which it affront even _ that _ even the sickening necessity for hurry in extremity where all hurry seem destine to be vain self-baffled and where the dreadful knell of _ too _ late be already sound in the ear by anticipation -- even that anguish be liable to a hideous exasperation in one particular case namely where the agonising appeal be make not exclusively to the instinct of self-preservation but to the conscience on behalf of another life besides you own accidentally cast upon _ you _ protection to fail to collapse in a service merely you own might seem comparatively venial though in fact it be far from venial but to fail in a case where providence have suddenly throw into you hand the final interest of another -- of a fellow-creature shuddering between the gate of life and death this to a man of apprehensive conscience would mingle the misery of a atrocious criminality with the misery of a bloody calamity the man be call upon too probably to die but to die at the very moment when by any momentary collapse he be self-denounced as a murderer he have but the twinkling of a eye for he effort and that effort might at the best have be unavailing but from this shadow of a chance small or great how if he have recoil by a treasonable _ lâcheté _ the effort _ might _ have be without hope but to have rise to the level of that effort would have rescue he though not from die yet from die as a traitor to he duty the situation here contemplate expose a dreadful ulcer lurk far down in the depths of human nature it be not that man generally be summon to face such awful trial but potentially and in shadowy outline such a trial be move subterraneously in perhaps all man 's nature -- mutter under ground in one world to be realize perhaps in some other upon the secret mirror of we dream such a trial be darkly project at interval perhaps to every one of we that dream so familiar to childhood of meet a lion and from languish prostration in hope and vital energy that constant sequel of lie down before he publish the secret frailty of human nature -- reveal its deep-seated pariah falsehood to itself -- record its abysmal treachery perhaps not one of we escape that dream perhaps as by some sorrowful doom of man that dream repeat for every one of we through every generation the original temptation in eden every one of we in this dream have a bait offer to the infirm place of he own individual will once again a snare be make ready for lead he into captivity to a luxury of ruin again as in aboriginal paradise the man fall from innocence once again by infinite iteration the ancient earth groan to god through she secret cave over the weakness of she child nature from she seat sigh through all she work again give sign of woe that all be lose and again the counter sigh be repeat to the sorrowing heaven of the endless rebellion against god many people think that one man the patriarch of we race could not in he single person execute this rebellion for all he race perhaps they be wrong but even if not perhaps in the world of dream every one of we ratify for himself the original act we english rite of confirmation by which in year of awaken reason we take upon we the engagement contract for we in we slumbering infancy -- how sublime a rite be that the little postern gate through which the baby in its cradle have be silently place for a time within the glory of god 's countenance suddenly rise to the cloud as a triumphal arch through which with banner display and martial pomp we make we second entry as crusading soldier militant for god by personal choice and by sacramental oath each man say in effect -- lo i rebaptise myself and that which once be swear on my behalf now i swear for myself even so in dream perhaps under some secret conflict of the midnight sleeper light up to the consciousness at the time but darken to the memory as soon as all be finish each several child of we mysterious race complete for himself the aboriginal fall as i draw near to the manchester post office i find that it be considerably past midnight but to my great relief as it be important for I to be in westmorland by the morning i saw by the huge saucer eye of the mail blaze through the gloom of overhang house that my chance be not yet lose past the time it be but by some luck very unusual in my experience the mail be not even yet ready to start i ascend to my seat on the box where my cloak be still lie as it have lie at the bridgewater arm i have leave it there in imitation of a nautical discoverer who leave a bit of bunt on the shore of he discovery by way of warn off the ground the whole human race and signalising to the christian and the heathen world with he best compliment that he have plant he throne for ever upon that virgin soil : henceforward claim the _ jus dominius _ to the top of the atmosphere above it and also the right of drive shaft to the center of the earth below it so that all people find after this warn either aloft in the atmosphere or in the shaft or squat on the soil will be treat as trespasser -- that be decapitate by they very faithful and obedient servant the owner of the say bunting possibly my cloak might not have be respect and the _ jus gentium _ might have be cruelly violate in my person -- for in the dark people commit deed of darkness gas be a great ally of morality -- but it so happen that on this night there be no other outside passenger and the crime which else be but too probable miss fire for want of a criminal by the way i may as well mention at this point since a circumstantial accuracy be essential to the effect of my narrative that there be no other person of any description whatever about the mail -- the guard the coachman and myself be allow for -- except only one -- a horrid creature of the class know to the world as insider but whom young oxford call sometimes trojan in opposition to we grecian self and sometimes vermin a turkish effendi who pique himself on good breeding will never mention by name a pig yet it be but too often that he have reason to mention this animal since constantly in the street of stamboul he have he trousers derange or polluted by this vile creature run between he leg but under any excess of hurry he be always careful out of respect to the company he be dine with to suppress the odious name and to call the wretch that other creature as though all animal life beside form one group and this odious beast -lrb- to whom as chrysippus observe salt serve as a apology for a soul -rrb- form another and alien group on the outside of creation now i who be a english effendi that think myself to understand good-breeding as well as any son of othman beg my reader 's pardon for have mention a insider by he gross natural name i shall do so no more and if i should have occasion to glance at so painful a subject i shall always call he that other creature let we hope however that no such distressing occasion will arise but by the way a occasion arise at this moment for the reader will be sure to ask when we come to the story be this other creature present he be _ not _ or more correctly perhaps _ it _ be not we drop the creature -- or the creature by natural imbecility drop itself -- within the first ten mile from manchester in the latter case i wish to make a philosophic remark of a moral tendency when i die or when the reader die and by repute suppose of fever it will never be know whether we die in reality of the fever or of the doctor but this other creature in the case of drop out of the coach will enjoy a coroner 's inquest consequently he will enjoy a epitaph for i insist upon it that the verdict of a coroner 's jury make the best of epitaph it be brief so that the public all find time to read it be pithy so that the survive friend -lrb- if any _ can _ survive such a loss -rrb- remember it without fatigue it be upon oath so that rascal and dr johnson can not pick hole in it die through the visitation of intense stupidity by impinge on a moonlight night against the off hind wheel of the glasgow mail deodand upon the say wheel -- two-penny what a simple lapidary inscription nobody much in the wrong but a off-wheel and with few acquaintance and if it be but render into choice latin though there would be a little bother in find a ciceronian word for off-wheel marcellus himself that great master of sepulchral eloquence could not show a better why i call this little remark _ moral _ be from the compensation it point out here by the supposition be that other creature on the one side the beast of the world and he -lrb- or it -rrb- get a epitaph you and i on the contrary the pride of we friend get none but why linger on the subject of vermin have mount the box i take a small quantity of laudanum have already travel two hundred and fifty mile -- viz from a point seventy mile beyond london upon a simple breakfast in the taking of laudanum there be nothing extraordinary but by accident it draw upon I the special attention of my assessor on the box the coachman and in _ that _ there be nothing extraordinary but by accident and with great delight it draw my attention to the fact that this coachman be a monster in point of size and that he have but one eye in fact he have be foretell by virgil as -- monstrum horrendum informe ingen cui luman adempium he answer in every point -- a monster he be -- dreadful shapeless huge who have lose a eye but why should _ that _ delight I have he be one of the calendar in the arabian night and have pay down he eye as the price of he criminal curiosity what right have i to exult in he misfortune i do _ not _ exult : i delighted in no man 's punishment though it be even merit but these personal distinction identify in a instant a old friend of mine whom i have know in the south for some year as the most masterly of mail-coachmen he be the man in all europe that could best have undertake to drive six-in-hand full gallop over _ al sirat _ -- that famous bridge of mahomet across the bottomless gulf backing himself against the prophet and twenty such fellow i use to call he _ cyclop mastigophorus _ cyclop the whip-bearer until i observe that he skill make whip useless except to fetch off a impertinent fly from a leader 's head upon which i change he grecian name to cyclops _ diphrélates _ -lrb- cyclops the charioteer -rrb- i and other know to I study under he the diphrelatic art excuse reader a word too elegant to be pedantic and also take this remark from I as a _ gage d'amitié _ -- that no word ever be or _ can _ be pedantic which by support a distinction support the accuracy of logic or which fill up a chasm for the understanding as a pupil though i pay extra fee i can not say that i stand high in he esteem it show he dogged honesty -lrb- though observe not he discernment -rrb- that he could not see my merit perhaps we ought to excuse he absurdity in this particular by remember he want of a eye _ that _ make he blind to my merit irritating as this blindness be -lrb- surely it could not be envy -rrb- he always court my conversation in which art i certainly have the whip-hand of he on this occasion great joy be at we meeting but what be cyclops do here have the medical man recommend northern air or how i collect from such explanation as he volunteer that he have a interest at stake in a suit-at-law pend at lancaster so that probably he have get himself transfer to this station for the purpose of connect with he professional pursuit a instant readiness for the call of he lawsuit meantime what be we stop for surely we have be wait long enough oh this procrastinating mail and oh this procrastinate post-office can not they take a lesson upon that subject from _ I _ some people have call _ I _ procrastinate now you be witness reader that i be in time for _ they _ but can _ they _ lay they hand on they heart and say that they be in time for I i during my life have often have to wait for the post-office the post-office never wait a minute for I what be they about the guard tell I that there be a large extra accumulation of foreign mail this night owe to irregularity cause by war and by the packet service when as yet nothing be do by steam for a _ extra _ hour it seem the post-office have be engage in thresh out the pure wheaten correspondence of glasgow and winnowing it from the chaff of all baser intermediate town we can hear the flail go at this moment but at last all be finish sound you horn guard manchester good bye we have lose a hour by you criminal conduct at the post-office which however though i do not mean to part with a serviceable ground of complaint and one which really be such for the horse to I secretly be a advantage since it compel we to recover this last hour amongst the next eight or nine off we be at last and at eleven mile a hour and at first i detect no change in the energy or in the skill of cyclops from manchester to kendal which virtually -lrb- though not in law -rrb- be the capital of westmoreland be at this time seven stage of eleven mile each the first five of these date from manchester terminate in lancaster which be therefore fifty-five mile north of manchester and the same distance exactly from liverpool the first three terminate in preston -lrb- call by way of distinction from other town of that name _ proud _ preston -rrb- at which place it be that the separate road from liverpool and from manchester to the north become confluent within these first three stage lay the foundation the progress and termination of we night 's adventure during the first stage i find out that cyclops be mortal : he be liable to the shocking affection of sleep -- a thing which i have never previously suspect if a man be addict to the vicious habit of sleep all the skill in aurigation of apollo himself with the horse of aurora to execute the motion of he will avail he nothing oh cyclops i exclaim more than once cyclop my friend thou art mortal thou snorest through this first eleven mile however he betray he infirmity -- which i grieve to say he share with the whole pagan pantheon -- only by short stretch on wake up he make a apology for himself which instead of mend the matter lay a ominous foundation for come disaster the summer assizes be now proceed at lancaster : in consequence of which for three night and three day he have not lie down in a bed during the day he be wait for he uncertain summons as a witness on the trial in which he be interested or he be drink with the other witness under the vigilant surveillance of the attorney during the night or that part of it when the least temptation exist to conviviality he be drive throughout the second stage he grow more and more drowsy in the second mile of the third stage he surrender himself finally and without a struggle to he perilous temptation all he past resistance have but deepen the weight of this final oppression seven atmosphere of sleep seem rest upon he and to consummate the case we worthy guard after singing love amongst the rose for the fiftieth or sixtieth time without any invitation from cyclops or myself and without applause for he poor labor have moodily resigned himself to slumber -- not so deep doubtless as the coachman 's but deep enough for mischief and have probably no similar excuse and thus at last about ten mile from preston i find myself leave in charge of he majesty 's london and glasgow mail then run about eleven mile a hour what make this negligence less criminal than else it must have be think be the condition of the road at night during the assizes at that time all the law business of populous liverpool and of populous manchester with its vast cincture of populous rural district be call up by ancient usage to the tribunal of lilliputian lancaster to break up this old traditional usage require a conflict with powerful established interest a large system of new arrangement and a new parliamentary statute as thing be at present twice in the year so vast a body of business roll northwards from the southern quarter of the county that a fortnight at least occupy the severe exertion of two judge for its dispatch the consequence of this be -- that every horse available for such a service along the whole line of road be exhaust in carry down the multitude of people who be party to the different suit by sunset therefore it usually happen that through utter exhaustion amongst man and horse the road be all silent except exhaustion in the vast adjacent county of york from a contest election nothing like it be ordinarily witness in england on this occasion the usual silence and solitude prevail along the road not a hoof nor a wheel be to be hear and to strengthen this false luxurious confidence in the noiseless road it happen also that the night be one of peculiar solemnity and peace i myself though slightly alive to the possibility of peril have so far yield to the influence of the mighty calm as to sink into a profound reverie the month be August in which lay my own birth-day a festival to every thoughtful man suggest solemn and often sigh-born thought -lrb- 1 -rrb- the county be my own native county -- upon which in its southern section more than upon any equal area know to man past or present have descend the original curse of labor in its heaviest form not master the body of man only as of slave or criminal in mine but work through the fiery will upon no equal space of earth be or ever have be the same energy of human power put forth daily at this particular season also of the assizes that dreadful hurricane of flight and pursuit as it might have seem to a stranger that sweep to and from lancaster all day long hunting the county up and down and regularly subside about sunset unite with the permanent distinction of lancashire as the very metropolis and citadel of labor to point the thought pathetically upon that counter vision of rest of saintly repose from strife and sorrow towards which as to they secret haven the profounder aspiration of man 's heart be continually travel obliquely we be near the sea upon we left which also must under the present circumstance be repeat the general state of halcyon repose the sea the atmosphere the light bear a orchestral part in this universal lull moonlight in the first timid trembling of the dawn be now blend : and the blending be bring into a still more exquisite state of unity by a slight silvery mist motionless and dreamy that cover the wood and field but with a veil of equable transparency except the foot of we own horse which run on a sandy margin of the road make little disturbance there be no sound abroad in the cloud and on the earth prevail the same majestic peace and in spite of all that the villain of a schoolmaster have do for the ruin of we sublimer thought which be the thought of we infancy we still believe in no such nonsense as a limited atmosphere whatever we may swear with we false feign lip in we faithful heart we still believe and must for ever believe in field of air traverse the total gulf between earth and the central heaven still in the confidence of child that tread without fear _ every _ chamber in they father 's house and to whom no door be close we in that sabbatic vision which sometimes be reveal for a hour upon night like this ascend with easy step from the sorrow-stricken field of earth upward to the sandal of god -lrb- footnote 1 : sigh-born : i owe the suggestion of this word to a obscure remembrance of a beautiful phrase in giraldus gambrensis viz _ suspiriosæ cogilatione _ -rrb- suddenly from thought like these i be awaken to a sullen sound as of some motion on the distant road it steal upon the air for a moment i listen in awe but then it die away once rouse however i could not but observe with alarm the quicken motion of we horse ten year ' experience have make my eye learn in the value of motion and i see that we be now run thirteen mile a hour i pretend to no presence of mind on the contrary my fear be that i be miserably and shamefully deficient in that quality as regard action the palsy of doubt and distraction hang like some guilty weight of dark unfathomed remembrance upon my energy when the signal be fly for _ action _ but on the other hand this accursed gift i have as regard _ think _ that in the first step towards the possibility of a misfortune i see its total evolution : in the radix i see too certainly and too instantly its entire expansion in the first syllable of the dreadful sentence i read already the last it be not that i fear for ourselves what could injure _ we _ we bulk and impetus charm we against peril in any collision and i have ride through too many hundred of peril that be frightful to approach that be matter of laughter as we look back upon they for any anxiety to rest upon _ we _ interest the mail be not build i feel assure nor bespoke that could betray _ I _ who trust to its protection but any carriage that we could meet would be frail and light in comparison of ourselves and i remark this ominous accident of we situation we be on the wrong side of the road but then the other party if other there be might also be on the wrong side and two wrong might make a right _ that _ be not likely the same motive which have draw _ we _ to the right-hand side of the road viz the soft beaten sand as contrast with the paved center would prove attractive to other we lamp still light would give the impression of vigilance on we part and every creature that meet we would rely upon _ we _ for quartering -lrb- 1 -rrb- all this and if the separate link of the anticipation have be a thousand time more i saw -- not discursively or by effort -- but as by one flash of horrid intuition -lrb- footnote 1 : _ quarter _ -- this be the technical word and i presume derive from the french _ carlayer _ to evade a rut or any obstacle -rrb- under this steady though rapid anticipation of the evil which _ might _ be gather ahead ah reader what a sullen mystery of fear what a sigh of woe seem to steal upon the air as again the far-off sound of a wheel be hear a whisper it be -- a whisper from perhaps four mile off -- secretly announce a ruin that be foresee be not the less inevitable what could be do -- who be it that could do it -- to check the storm-flight of these maniacal horse what could i not seize the rein from the grasp of the slumbering coachman you reader think that it would have be in _ you _ power to do so and i quarrel not with you estimate of yourself but from the way in which the coachman 's hand be vice between he upper and lower thigh this be impossible the guard subsequently find it impossible after this danger have pass not the grasp only but also the position of this polyphemus make the attempt impossible you still think otherwise see then that bronze equestrian statue the cruel rider have keep the bit in he horse 's mouth for two century unbridle he for a minute if you please and wash he mouth with water or stay reader unhorse I that marble emperor knock I those marble foot from those marble stirrup of charlemagne the sound ahead strengthen and be now too clearly the sound of wheel who and what could it be be it industry in a tax cart be it youthful gaiety in a gig whoever it be something must be attempt to warn they upon the other party rest the active responsibility but upon _ we _ -- and woe be I that _ we _ be my single self -- rest the responsibility of warn yet how should this be accomplish might i not seize the guard 's horn already on the first thought i be make my way over the roof to the guard 's seat but this from the foreign mail be pile upon the roof be a difficult and even dangerous attempt to one cramp by nearly three hundred mile of outside travel and fortunately before i have lose much time in the attempt we frantic horse sweep round a angle of the road which open upon we the stage where the collision must be accomplish the party that seem summon to the trial and the impossibility of save they by any communication with the guard before we lay a avenue straight as a arrow six hundred yard perhaps in length and the umbrageous tree which rise in a regular line from either side meeting high overhead give to it the character of a cathedral aisle these tree lend a deeper solemnity to the early light but there be still light enough to perceive at the further end of this gothic aisle a light reedy gig in which be seat a young man and by he side a young lady ah young sir what be you about if it be necessary that you should whisper you communication to this young lady -- though really i see nobody at this hour and on this solitary road likely to overhear you conversation -- be it therefore necessary that you should carry you lip forward to hers the little carriage be creep on at one mile a hour and the party within it be thus tenderly engage be naturally bend down they head between they and eternity to all human calculation there be but a minute and a half what be it that i shall do strange it be and to a mere auditor of the tale might seem laughable that i should need a suggestion from the _ iliad _ to prompt the sole recourse that remain but so it be suddenly i remember the shout of achille and its effect but could i pretend to shout like the son of peleus aid by palla no certainly : but then i need not the shout that should alarm all asia militant a shout would suffice such as should carry terror into the heart of two thoughtless young people and one gig horse i shout -- and the young man hear I not a second time i shout -- and now he hear I for now he raise he head here then all have be do that by I _ could _ be do : more on _ my _ part be not possible mine have be the first step : the second be for the young man : the third be for god if say i the stranger be a brave man and if indeed he love the young girl at he side -- or loving she not if he feel the obligation press upon every man worthy to be call a man of do he utmost for a woman confide to he protection -- he will at least make some effort to save she if _ that _ fail he will not perish the more or by a death more cruel for have make it and he will die as a brave man should with he face to the danger and with he arm about the woman that he seek in vain to save but if he make no effort shrink without a struggle from he duty he himself will not the less certainly perish for this baseness of poltroonery he will die no less : and why not wherefore should we grieve that there be one craven less in the world no _ let _ he perish without a pity thought of ours waste upon he and in that case all we grief will be reserve for the fate of the helpless girl who now upon the least shadow of failure in _ he _ must by the fiercest of translation -- must without time for a prayer -- must within seventy seconds stand before the judgment-seat of god but craven he be not : sudden have be the call upon he and sudden be he answer to the call he see he hear he comprehend the ruin that be come down : already its gloomy shadow darken above he and already he be measure he strength to deal with it ah what a vulgar thing do courage seem when we see nation buy it and sell it for a shill a day : ah what a sublime thing do courage seem when some fearful crisis on the great deep of life carry a man as if run before a hurricane up to the giddy crest of some mountainous wave from which accordingly as he choose he course he describe two course and a voice say to he audibly this way lie hope take the other way and mourn for ever yet even then amidst the raving of the sea and the frenzy of the danger the man be able to confront he situation -- be able to retire for a moment into solitude with god and to seek all he counsel from _ he _ for seven seconds it might be of he seventy the stranger settle he countenance steadfastly upon we as if to search and value every element in the conflict before he for five seconds more he sate immovably like one that muse on some great purpose for five he sate with eye upraise like one that pray in sorrow under some extremity of doubt for wisdom to guide he towards the better choice then suddenly he rise stand upright and by a sudden strain upon the rein raise he horse 's forefoot from the ground he slew he round on the pivot of he hind leg so as to plant the little equipage in a position nearly at right angle to ours thus far he condition be not improve except as a first step have be take towards the possibility of a second if no more be do nothing be do for the little carriage still occupy the very center of we path though in a altered direction yet even now it may not be too late : fifteen of the twenty seconds may still be unexhausted and one almighty bind forward may avail to clear the ground hurry then hurry for the fly moment -- _ they _ hurry oh hurry hurry my brave young man for the cruel hoof of we horse -- _ they _ also hurry fast be the fly moment faster be the hoof of we horse fear not for _ he _ if human energy can suffice : faithful be he that drive to he terrific duty faithful be the horse to _ he _ command one blow one impulse give with voice and hand by the stranger one rush from the horse one bind as if in the act of rise to a fence land the docile creature 's forefoot upon the crown or arch center of the road the larger half of the little equipage have then clear we over-towering shadow : _ that _ be evident even to my own agitate sight but it matter little that one wreck should float off in safety if upon the wreck that perish be embark the human freightage the rear part of the carriage -- be _ that _ certainly beyond the line of absolute ruin what power could answer the question glance of eye thought of man wing of angel which of these have speed enough to sweep between the question and the answer and divide the one from the other light do not tread upon the step of light more indivisibly than do we all-conquering arrival upon the escape effort of the gig _ that _ must the young man have feel too plainly he back be now turn to we not by sight could he any longer communicate with the peril but by the dreadful rattle of we harness too truly have he ear be instruct -- that all be finish as regard any further effort of _ he _ already in resignation he have rest from he struggle and perhaps in he heart he be whisper -- father which art above do thou finish in heaven what i on earth have attempt we run past they faster than ever mill-race in we inexorable flight oh rave of hurricane that must have sound in they young ear at the moment of we transit either with the swingle-bar or with the haunch of we near leader we have strike the off-wheel of the little gig which stand rather obliquely and not quite so far advance as to be accurately parallel with the near wheel the blow from the fury of we passage resound terrifically i rise in horror to look upon the ruin we might have cause from my elevated station i look down and look back upon the scene which in a moment tell its tale and write all its record on my heart for ever the horse be plant immovably with he fore-foot upon the paved crest of the central road he of the whole party be alone untouched by the passion of death the little cany carriage -- partly perhaps from the dreadful torsion of the wheel in its recent movement partly from the thunder blow we have give to it -- as if it sympathize with human horror be all alive with trembling and shivering the young man sit like a rock he stir not at all but _ he _ be the steadiness of agitation freeze into rest by horror as yet he dare not to look round for he know that if anything remain to do by he it could no longer be do and as yet he know not for certain if they safety be accomplish but the lady -- but the lady -- oh heaven will that spectacle ever depart from my dream as she rise and sink upon she seat sink and rise throw up she arm wildly to heaven clutch at some visionary object in the air fainting pray rave despairing figure to yourself reader the element of the case suffer I to recall before you mind the circumstance of the unparalleled situation from the silence and deep peace of this saintly summer night -- from the pathetic blending of this sweet moonlight dawnlight dreamlight -- from the manly tenderness of this flattering whisper murmur love -- suddenly as from the wood and field -- suddenly as from the chamber of the air opening in revelation -- suddenly as from the ground yawn at she foot leap upon she with the flash of cataract death the crown phantom with all the equipage of he terror and the tiger roar of he voice the moment be number in the twinkling of a eye we fly horse have carry we to the termination of the umbrageous aisle at right angle we wheel into we former direction the turn of the road carry the scene out of my eye in a instant and sweep it into my dream for ever

full face and even she profile imperfectly -rrb- 1 lo it be summer almighty summer the everlasting gate of life and summer be throw open wide and on the ocean tranquil and verdant as a savanna the unknown lady from the dreadful vision and i myself be float : she upon a fairy pinnace and i upon a english three-decker but both of we be woo gale of festal happiness within the domain of we common

to the weather side and the summer have depart the sea be rock and shake with gathering wrath upon its surface sate mighty mist which group themselves into arch and long cathedral aisle down one of these with the fiery pace of a quarrel from a cross-bow run a frigate right athwart we course be they mad some voice exclaim from we deck be they blind do they woo they ruin but in a moment as she be close upon we some impulse of a heady current or sudden vortex give a wheeling bias to she course and off she forge without a shock as she run past we high aloft amongst the shroud stand the lady of the pinnace the deep open ahead in malice to receive she towering surge of foam run after she the billow be fierce to catch she but far away she be bear into desert space of the sea : whilst still by sight i follow she as she run before the howling gale chase by angry sea-bird and by maddening billow still i see she as at the moment when she run past we amongst the shroud with she white drapery streaming before the wind there she stand with hair dishevelled one hand clutch amongst the tackle -- rise sink flutter tremble pray -- there for league i see she as she stand raise at interval one hand to heaven amidst the fiery crest of the pursue wave and the raving of the storm until at last upon a sound from afar of malicious laughter and mockery all be hide for ever in drive shower and afterwards but when i know not and how i know not 3 sweet funeral bell from some incalculable distance wail over the dead that die before the dawn awaken I as i sleep in a boat moor to some familiar shore the morning twilight even then be break and by the dusky revelation which it spread i see a girl adorn with a garland of white rose about she head for some great festival run along the solitary strand with extremity of haste she running be the running of panic and often she look back as to some dreadful enemy in the rear but when i leap ashore and follow on she step to warn she of a peril in front alas from I she flee as from another peril and vainly i shout to she of quicksand that lay ahead faster and faster she run round a promontory of rock she wheel out of sight in a instant i also wheel round it but only to see the treacherous sand gather above she head already she person be bury only the fair young head and the diadem of white rose around it be still visible to the pity heaven and last of all be visible one marble arm i saw by the early twilight this fair young head as it be sink down to darkness -- see this marble arm as it rise above she head and she treacherous grave toss faultering rise clutch as at some false deceiving hand stretch out from the cloud -- see this marble arm utter she die hope and then she die despair the head the diadem the arm -- these all have sink at last over these also the cruel quicksand have close and no memorial of the fair young girl remain on earth except my own solitary tear and the funeral bell from the desert sea that rise again more softly sing a requiem over the grave of the bury child and over she blighted dawn i sate and weep in secret the tear that man have ever give to the memory of those that die before the dawn and by the treachery of earth we mother but the tear and funeral bell be hushed suddenly by a shout as of many nation and by a roar as from some great king 's artillery advance rapidly along the valley and hear afar by its echo among the mountain hush i say as i bent my ear earthwards to listen -- hush -- this either be the very anarchy of strife or else -- and then i listen more profoundly and say as i raise my head -- or else oh heaven it be _ victory _ that swallow up all strife 4 immediately in trance i be carry over land and sea to some distant kingdom and place upon a triumphal car amongst companion crown with laurel the darkness of gather midnight brooding over all the land hide from we the mighty crowd that be weave restlessly about we carriage as a center -- we hear they but we see they not tiding have arrive within a hour of a grandeur that measure itself against century too full of pathos they be too full of joy that acknowledge no fountain but god to utter themselves by other language than by tear by restle anthem by reverberation rise from every choir of the _ glorium in excelsis _ these tiding we that sate upon the laurelled car have it for we privilege to publish amongst all nation and already by sign audible through the darkness by snorting and trampling we angry horse that know no fear of fleshly weariness upbraid we with delay wherefore _ be _ it that we delay we wait for a secret word that should bear witness to the hope of nation as now accomplish for ever at midnight the secret word arrive which word be -- waterloo and recover christendom the dreadful word shone by its own light before we it go high above we leader ' head it ride and spread a golden light over the path which we traverse every city at the presence of the secret word throw open its gate to receive we the river be silent as we cross all the infinite forest as we run along they margin shiver in homage to the secret word and the darkness comprehend it two hour after midnight we reach a mighty minster its gate which rise to the cloud be close but when the dreadful word that ride before we reach they with its golden light silently they move back upon they hinge and at a fly gallop we equipage enter the grand aisle of the cathedral headlong be we pace and at every altar in the little chapel and oratory to the right hand and left of we course the lamp die or sicken kindle anew in sympathy with the secret word that be fly past forty league we might have run in the cathedral and as yet no strength of morning light have reach we when we see before we the aërial gallery of the organ and the choir every pinnacle of the fretwork every station of advantage amongst the tracery be crest by white-robed chorister that sing deliverance that weep no more tear as once they father have weep but at interval that sing together to the generation say -- chaunt the deliverer 's praise in every tongue and receive answer from afar -- such as once in heaven and earth be sing and of they chaunting be no end of we headlong pace be neither pause nor remission thus as we run like torrent -- thus as we sweep with bridal rapture over the campo santo -lrb- 1 -rrb- of the cathedral grave -- suddenly we become aware of a vast necropolis rise upon the far-off horizon -- a city of sepulchre build within the saintly cathedral for the warrior dead that rest from they feud on earth of purple granite be the necropolis yet in the first minute it lay like a purple stain upon the horizon -- so mighty be the distance in the second minute it tremble through many change grow into terrace and tower of wondrous altitude so mighty be the pace in the third minute already with we dreadful gallop we be enter its suburb vast sarcophagus rise on every side have tower and turret that upon the limit of the central aisle stride forward with haughty intrusion that run back with mighty shadow into answer recess every sarcophagus show many bas-relief -- bas-relief of battle -- bas-relief of battle-field of battle from forget age -- of battle from yesterday -- of battle-field that long since nature have heal and reconcile to herself with the sweet oblivion of flower -- of battle-field that be yet angry and crimson with carnage where the terrace run there do _ we _ run where the tower curve there do _ we _ curve with the flight of swallow we horse sweep round every angle like river in flood wheeling round headland like hurricane that side into the secret of forest faster than ever light unwove the maze of darkness we fly equipage carry earthly passion -- kindle warrior instinct -- amongst the dust that lay around we dust oftentimes of we noble father that have sleep in god from créci to trafalgar and now have we reach the last sarcophagus now be we abreast of the last bas-relief already have we recover the arrow-like flight of the illimitable central aisle when come up this aisle to meet we we behold a female infant that ride in a carriage as frail as flower the mist which go before she hide the fawn that draw she but could not hide the shell and tropic flower with which she play -- but could not hide the lovely smile by which she utter she trust in the mighty cathedral and in the cherubim that look down upon she from the topmast shaft of its pillar face to face she be meet we face to face she ride as if danger there be none oh baby i exclaimed shalt thou be the ransom for waterloo must we that carry tiding of great joy to every people be messenger of ruin to thee in horror i rise at the thought but then also in horror at the thought rise one that be sculpture on the bas-relief -- a die trumpeter solemnly from the field of battle he rise to he foot and unsling he stony trumpet carry it in he die anguish to he stony lip -- sound once and yet once again proclamation that in _ thy _ ear oh baby must have speak from the battlements of death immediately deep shadow fall between we and aboriginal silence the choir have cease to sing the hoof of we horse the rattle of we harness alarm the grave no more by horror the bas-relief have be unlock into life by horror we that be so full of life we man and we horse with they fiery fore-leg rise in mid air to they everlasting gallop be freeze to a bas-relief then a third time the trumpet sound the seal be take off all pulse life and the frenzy of life tear into they channel again again the choir burst forth in sunny grandeur as from the muffling of storm and darkness again the thundering of we horse carry temptation into the grave one cry burst from we lip as the cloud draw off from the aisle show it empty before we -- whither have the infant flee -- be the young child catch up to god lo afar off in a vast recess rise three mighty window to the cloud : and on a level with they summit at height insuperable to man rise a altar of purest alabaster on its eastern face be tremble a crimson glory whence come _ that _ be it from the reddening dawn that now stream _ through _ the window be it from the crimson robe of the martyr that be paint _ on _ the window be it from the bloody bas-relief of earth whencesoever it be -- there within that crimson radiance suddenly appear a female head and then a female figure it be the child -- now grow up to woman 's height cling to the horn of the altar there she stand -- sink rise tremble faint -- rave despairing and behind the volume of incense that night and day stream upward from the altar be see the fiery font and dimly be descry the outline of the dreadful be that should baptize she with the baptism of death but by she side be kneel she better angel that hide he face with wing that weep and plead for _ she _ that pray when _ she _ could _ not _ that fight with heaven by tear for _ she _ deliverance which also as he raise he immortal countenance from he wing i saw by the glory in he eye that he have win at last -lrb- footnote 1 : _ campo santo _ -- it be probable that most of my reader will be acquaint with the history of the campo santo at pisa -- compose of earth bring from jerusalem for a bed of sanctity as the highest prize which the noble piety of crusader could ask or imagine there be another campo santo at naple form however -lrb- i presume -rrb- on the example give by pisa possibly the idea may have be more extensively copy to reader who be unacquainted with england or who -lrb- be english -rrb- be yet unacquainted with the cathedral city of england it may be right to mention that the grave within-side the cathedral often form a flat pavement over which carriage and horse might roll and perhaps a boyish remembrance of one particular cathedral across which i have see passenger walk and burden carry may have assist my dream -rrb- 5 then rise the agitation spread through the infinite cathedral to its agony then be complete the passion of the mighty fugue the golden tube of the organ which as yet have but sob and mutter at interval -- gleaming amongst cloud and surge of incense -- throw up as from fountain unfathomable column of heart-shattering music choir and anti-choir be fill fast with unknown voice thou also die trumpeter -- with thy love that be victorious and thy anguish that be finish didst enter the tumult : trumpet and echo -- farewell love and farewell anguish -- ring through the dreadful _ sanctus _ we that spread flight before we hear the tumult as of flight muster behind we in fear we look round for the unknown step that in flight or in pursuit be gather upon we own who be these that follow the face which no man could count -- whence be _ they _ oh darkness of the grave i exclaimed that from the crimson altar and from the fiery font wert visit with secret light -- that wert search by the effulgence in the angel 's eye -- be these indeed thy child pomp of life that from the burial of century rise again to the voice of perfect joy could it be _ ye _ that have wrap I in the reflux of panic what ail I that i should fear when the triumph of earth be advance ah pariah heart within I that couldst never hear the sound of joy without sullen whisper of treachery in ambush that from six year old didst never hear the promise of perfect love without see aloft amongst the star finger as of a man 's hand write the secret legend -- _ ash to ash dust to dust _ -- wherefore shouldst _ thou _ not fear though all man should rejoice lo as i look back for seventy league through the mighty cathedral and see the quick and the dead that sing together to god together that sing to the generation of man -- ah rave as of torrent that open on every side : trepidation as of female and infant step that flee -- ah rush as of wing that chase but i hear a voice from heaven which say -- let there be no reflux of panic -- let there be no more fear and no more sudden death cover they with joy as the tide cover the shore _ that _ hear the child of the choir _ that _ hear the child of the grave all the host of jubilation make ready to move like army that ride in pursuit they move with one step we that with laurell head be pass from the cathedral through its eastern gate they overtake and as with a garment they wrap we round with

death -- suddenly do god relent suffer thy angel to turn aside he arm and even in thee sister unknown show to I for a moment only to be hide for ever find a occasion to glorify he goodness a thousand time amongst the phantom of sleep have he show thee to I stand before the golden dawn and ready to enter its gate -- with the dreadful word go before thee -- with the army of the grave behind thee show thee to I sink rise flutter fainting but then suddenly reconcile adoring : a thousand time have he follow thee in the world of sleep -- through storm through desert sea through the darkness of quicksand through fugue and the persecution of fugue through dream and the dreadful resurrection that be in dream -- only that at the last with one motion of he victorious arm he might record and emblazon the endless resurrection of he love dinner real and reputed great misconception have always prevail about the roman _ dinner _ dinner -lrb- _ coena _ -rrb- be the only meal which the roman as a nation take it be no accident but arise out of they whole social economy this we shall show by run through the history of a roman day _ ridentem dicere verum quid vetat _ and the course of this review will expose one or two important truth in ancient political economy which have be wholly overlook with the lark it be that the roman rise not that the earliest lark rise so early in latium as the earliest lark in england that be during summer : but then on the other hand neither do it ever rise so late the roman citizen be stir with the dawn -- which allow for the shorter longest-day and longer shortest-day of rome you may call about four in summer -- about seven in winter why do he do this because he go to bed at a very early hour but why do he do that by backing in this way we shall surely back into the very well of truth : always if it be possible let we have the _ pourquoi _ of the _ pourquoi _ the roman go to bed early for two special reason 1st because in rome which have be build for a martial destiny every habit of life have reference to the usage of war every citizen if he be not a mere proletarian animal keep at the public cost hold himself a sort of soldier-elect : the more noble he be the more be he liability to military service : in short all rome and at all time be consciously in procinct -lrb- 1 -rrb- now it be a principle of ancient warfare that every hour of daylight have a triple worth if value against hour of darkness that be one reason -- a reason suggest by the understanding but there be a second reason far more remarkable and this be a reason dictate by a blind necessity it be a important fact that this planet on which we live this little industrious earth of ours have develop she wealth by slow stage of increase she be far from be the rich little globe in cæsar 's day that she be at present the earth in we day be incalculably richer as a whole than in the time of charlemagne : at that time she be richer by many a million of acre than in the era of augustus in that augustan era we descry a clear belt of cultivation average about six hundred mile in depth run in a ring-fence about the mediterranean this belt _ and no more _ be in decent cultivation beyond that belt there be only a wild indian cultivation at present what a difference we have that very belt but much richer all thing consider _ æquatis æquandis _ than in the roman era the reader must not look to single case as that of egypt or other part of africa but take the whole collectively on that scheme of valuation we have the old roman belt the mediterranean riband not much tarnish and we have all the rest of europe to boot -- or speak in scholar 's language as a _ lucro ponamus _ we say nothing of remoter gain such be the case we mother the earth be -lrb- as a whole -rrb- so incomparably poorer could not in the pagan era support the expense of maintain great empire in cold latitudes she purse would not reach that cost wherever she undertake in those early age to rear man in great abundance it must be where nature would consent to work in partnership with herself where _ warmth _ be to be have for nothing where _ clothes _ be not so entirely indispensable but that a ragged fellow might still keep himself warm where slight _ shelter _ might serve and where the _ soil _ if not absolutely richer in reversionary wealth be more easily culture nature must come forward liberally and take a number of share in every new joint-stock concern before it could move man therefore go to bed early in those age simply because he worthy mother earth could not afford he candle she good old lady -lrb- or good young lady for geologist know not -lrb- 2 -rrb- whether she be in that stage of she progress which correspond to gray hair or to infancy or to a _ certain _ age -rrb- -- she good lady would certainly have shudder to hear any of she nation ask for candle candle she would have say who ever hear of such a thing and with so much excellent daylight run to waste as i have provide _ grati _ what will the wretch want next the daylight furnished _ grati _ be certainly neat and undeniable in its quality and quite sufficient for all purpose that be honest seneca even in he own luxurious period call those man _ lucifugæ _ and by other ugly name who live chiefly by candle-light none but rich and luxurious man nay even amongst these none but idler _ do _ live much by candle-light a immense majority of man in rome never light a candle unless sometimes in the early dawn and this custom of rome be the custom also of all nation that live round the great pond of the mediterranean in athen egypt palestine asia minor everywhere the ancient go to bed like good boy from seven to nine o'clock -lrb- 3 -rrb- the turk and other people who have succeed to the station and the habit of the ancient do so at this day the roman therefore who see no joke in sit round a table in the dark go off to bed as the darkness begin everybody do so old numa pompilius himself be oblige to trundle off in the dusk tarquinius might be a very superb fellow but we doubt whether he ever see a farthing rushlight and though it may be think that plot and conspiracy would flourish in such a city of darkness it be to be consider that the conspirator themselves have no more candle than honest man : both party be in the dark be up then and stir not long after the lark what mischief do the roman go about first now-a-day he would have take a pipe or a cigar but alas for the ignorance of the poor heathen creature they have neither one nor the other in this point we must tax we mother earth with be really _ too _ stingy in the case of the candle we approve of she parsimony much mischief be brew by candle-light but it be come it too strong to allow no tobacco many a wild fellow in rome you gracchus sylla catiline would not have play h -- and tommy in the way they do if they could have soothe they angry stomach with a cigar -- a pipe have intercept many a evil scheme but the thing be past help now at rome you must do as they do at rome so after shave -lrb- suppose the age of the _ barbatus _ to be pass -rrb- what be the first business that we roman will undertake forty to one he be a poor man bear to look upward to he fellow-men -- and not to look down upon anybody but slave he go therefore to the palace of some grandee some top-sawyer of the senatorian order this great man for all he greatness have turn out even sooner than himself for he also have have no candle and no cigar and he well know that before the sun look into he portal all he hall will be overflow and buzz with the matin susurrus of courtier -- the mane salutante -lrb- 4 -rrb- it be as much as he popularity be worth to absent himself or to keep people wait but surely the reader may think this poor man he might keep wait no he might not for though poor be a citizen he be a gentleman that be the consequence of keep slave wherever there be a class of slave he that enjoy the _ jus suffragius _ -lrb- no matter how poor -rrb- be a gentleman the true latin word for a gentleman be _ ingentius _ -- a freeman and the son of a freeman yet even here there _ be _ distinction under the emperor the courtier be divide into two class : with respect to the superior class it be say of the sovereign -- that he _ saw _ they -lrb- _ videbat _ -rrb- with respect to the other -- that he _ be see _ -lrb- _ videbatur _ -rrb- even plutarch mention it as a common boast in he time -lrb- greek : aema eiden ho basileus -rrb- -- _ cæsar be in the habit of see I _ or as a common plea for evade a suit -lrb- greek : os mallon -rrb- -- _ i be sorry to say he be more inclined to look upon other _ and this usage derive itself -lrb- mark that well -rrb- from the _ republican _ era the aulic spirit be propagate by the empire but from a republican root have pay he court you will suppose that we friend come home to breakfast not at all : no such discovery as breakfast have then be make : breakfast be not invent for many century after that we have always admire and always shall admire as the very best of all human story charle lamb 's account of the origin of _ roast pig _ in china ching ping it seem have suffer he father 's house to be burn down the outhouse be burn along with the house and in one of these the pig by accident be roasted to a turn memorable be the result for all future china and future civilization ping who -lrb- like all china beside -rrb- have hitherto eat he pig raw now for the first time taste it in a state of torrefaction of course he make he peace with he father by a part -lrb- tradition say a leg -rrb- of the new dish the father be so astounded with the discovery that he burn he house down once a year for the sake of come at a annual banquet of roast pig a curious prying sort of fellow one chang pang get to know of this he also burn down a house with a pig in it and have he eye open the secret be ill keep -- the discovery spread -- many great conversion be make -- house be blaze in every part of the celestial empire the insurance office take the matter up one chong pong detect in the very act of shut up a pig in he drawing-room and then firing a train be indict on a charge of arson the chief justice of pekin on that occasion request a officer of the court to hand he a piece of the roast pig the _ corpus delictus _ for pure curiosity lead he to taste but within two day after it be observe that he lordship 's town-house be burn down in short all china apostatize to the new faith and it be not until some century have pass that a great genius arise who establish the second era in the history of roast pig by show that it could be have without burn down a house no such genius have yet arise in rome breakfast be not suspect no prophecy no type of breakfast have be publish in fact it take as much time and research to arrive at that great discovery as at the copernican system true it be reader that you have hear of such a word as _ jentaculum _ and you dictionary translate that old heathen word by the christian word _ breakfast _ but dictionary one and all be dull deceiver between _ jentaculum _ and _ breakfast _ the difference be as wide as between a horse-chestnut and chestnut horse difference in the _ time when _ in the _ place where _ in the _ manner how _ but preeminently in the _ thing which _ galen be a good authority upon such a subject since if -lrb- like other pagan -rrb- he eat no breakfast himself in some sense he may be call the cause of breakfast to other man by treat of those thing which could safely be take upon a empty stomach as to the time he -lrb- like many other author -rrb- say -lrb- peri tritaen ae -lrb- to makroteron -rrb- perus tetartaen -rrb- about the third or at farthest about the fourth hour : and so exact be he that he assume the day to lie exactly between six and six o'clock and to be divide into thirteen equal portion so the time will be a few minute before nine or a few minute before ten in the forenoon that seem fair enough but it be not time in respect to its location that we be so much concern with as time in respect to its duration now heap of authority take it for grant that you be not to sit down -- you be to stand and as to the place that any place will do -- any corner of the forum say galen any corner that you fancy which be like refer a man for he _ salle à manger _ to westminster hall or fleet street augustus in a letter still survive tell we that he _ jentabat _ or take he _ jentaculum _ in he carriage now in a wheel carriage -lrb- _ in essedo _ -rrb- now in a litter or palanquin -lrb- _ in lecticâ _ -rrb- this careless and disorderly way as to time and place and other circumstance of haste sufficiently indicate the quality of the meal you be to expect already you be sagacious of you quarry from so far not that we would presume excellent reader to liken you to death or to insinuate that you be a grim feature but would it not make a saint grim to hear of such preparation for the morning meal and then to hear of such consummation as _ pani siccus _ dry bread or -lrb- if the learn reader think it will taste better in greek -rrb- -lrb- greek : arto xaero -rrb- and what may this word _ dry _ happen to mean do it mean stale bread say salmasius shall we suppose say he in querulous word _ mollus et recenti opponi _ and from that antithesis conclude it to be _ durum et non recen coctum eoque sicciorem _ hard and stale and for that reason the more arid not quite so bad as that we hope or again -- _ siccum pro biscocto ut hodie vocamus sumemus _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- by _ hodie _ salmasius mean amongst he countryman of france where _ biscoctus _ be verbatim reproduce in the word _ bis _ -lrb- twice -rrb- _ cuit _ -lrb- baked -rrb- whence we own _ biscuit _ biscuit might do very well could we be sure that it be cabin biscuit : but salmasius argue -- that in this case he take it to mean _ buccellatum qui est panis nauticus _ that be the ship company 's biscuit break with a sledge-hammer in greek for the benefit again of the learn reader it be term -lrb- greek : dipuro -rrb- indicate that it have pass twice under the action of fire well you say no matter if it have pass fifty time -- and through the fire of moloch only let we have this biscuit such as it be in good faith then fast reader you be not likely to see much more than you _ have _ see it be a very barmecide feast we do assure you -- this same jentaculum at which abstinence and patience be much more exercise than the tooth : faith and hope be the chief grace cultivate together with that species of the _ magnificum _ which be found on the _ ignotum _ even this biscuit be allow in the most limited quantity for which reason it be that the greek call this apology for a a meal by the name of -lrb- greek : bouchismo -rrb- a word form -lrb- as many word be in the post-augustan age -rrb- from a latin word -- viz _ buccea _ a mouthful not literally such but so much as a polished man could allow himself to put into he mouth at once we take a mouthful say sir william waller the parliamentary general take a mouthful pay we reckoning mount and be off but there sir william mean by he plausible mouthful something very much beyond either nine or nineteen ordinary quantity of that denomination whereas the roman jentaculum be literally such and accordingly one of the variety under which the ancient vocabulary express this model of evanescent quantity be _ gustatio _ a mere tasting and again it be call by another variety _ gustus _ a mere taste : -lrb- whence by the usual suppression of the _ s _ come the french word for a collation or luncheon viz _ gouter _ -rrb- speaking of he uncle pliny the younger say -- post solem plerumque lavabatur deinde gustabat dormiebat minimum mox quasus alio die studebat in coenæ tempus after take the air he bath after that he break he fast on a bit of biscuit and take a very slight _ siesta _ : which do as if awake to a new day he set in regularly to he study and pursue they to dinner-time _ gustabat _ here mean that nondescript meal which arise at rome when _ jentaculum _ and _ prandium _ be fuse into one and that only a _ taste _ or mouthful of biscuit as we shall show farther on possibly however most excellent reader like some epicurean traveller who in cross the alp find himself weather-bound at st bernard 's on ash-wednesday you surmise a remedy : you descry some opening from the loophole of retreat through which a few delicacy might be insinuate to spread verdure on this arid desert of biscuit casuistry can do much a dead hand at casuistry have often prove more than a match for lend with all he quarantine but sorry we be to say that in this case no relief be hint at in any ancient author a grape or two -lrb- not a bunch of grape -rrb- a raisin or two a date a olive -- these be the whole amount of relief -lrb- 6 -rrb- which the chancery of the roman kitchen grant in such case all thing here hang together and prove each other the time the place the mode the thing well might man eat standing or eat in public such a trifle as this go home to such a breakfast as this you would as soon think of order a cloth to be lay in order to eat a peach or of ask a friend to join you in a orange no man make two bite of a cherry so let we pass on to the other stage of the day only in take leave of this morning stage throw you eye back with we christian reader upon this truly heathen meal fit for idolatrous dog like you greek and you roman survey through the vista of age that thrice-cursed biscuit with half a fig perhaps by way of garnish and a huge hammer by its side to secure the certainty of mastication by previous comminution then turn you eye to a christian breakfast -- hot roll egg coffee beef but down down rebellious vision : we need say no more you reader like ourselves will breathe a malediction on the classical era and thank you star for make you a romanticist every morning we thank ours for keep we back and reserve we to a age in which breakfast have be already invent in the word of ovid we say : -- prisca juvent alio : ego I nunc denique natum gratulor hæc ætas moribus apta mei we friend the roman cit have therefore thus far in he progress through life obtain no breakfast if he ever contemplate a idea so frantic but it occur to you we faithful reader that perhaps he will not always be thus unhappy we could bring waggon-load of sentiment greek as well as roman which prove more clearly than the most eminent pikestaff that as the wheel of fortune revolve simply out of the fact that it have carry a man downward it must subsequently carry he upwards no matter what dislike that wheel or any of its spoke may bear to that man : non si male nunc sit et olim sic erit : and that if a man through the madness of he nation miss coffee and hot roll at nine he may easily run into a leg of mutton at twelve true it be he may do so : truth be commendable and we will not deny that a man may sometimes by lose a breakfast gain a dinner such thing have be in various age and will be again but not at rome there be reason against it we have hear of man who consider life under the idea of a wilderness -- dry as a remainder biscuit after a voyage : and who consider a day under the idea of a little life life be the macrocosm or world at large day be the microcosm or world in miniature consequently if life be a wilderness then day as a little life be a little wilderness and this wilderness can be safely traverse only by have relay of fountain or stage for refreshment such stage they conceive be find in the several meal which providence have station at due interval through the day whenever the perverseness of man do not break the chain or derange the order of succession these be the anchor by which man ride in that billowy ocean between morning and night the first anchor viz breakfast have give way in rome the more need there be that he should pull up by the second and that be often repute to be dinner and as you dictionary good reader translate _ breakfast _ by that vain word _ jentaculum _ so doubtless it will translate _ dinner _ by that still vainer word _ prandium _ sincerely we hope that you own dinner on this day and through all time come may have a better root in fact and substance than this most visionary of all baseless thing -- the roman _ prandium _ of which we shall presently show you that the most approved translation be _ moonshine _ reader we be not jest here in the very spirit of serious truth we assure you that the delusion about jentaculum be even exceed by this other delusion about prandium salmasius himself for whom a natural prejudice of place and time partially obscure the truth admit however that _ prandium _ be a meal which the ancient rarely take he very word be -- _ raro prandebant vetere _ now judge for yourself of the good sense which be show in translate by the word _ dinner _ which must of necessity mean the chief meal -- a roman word which represent a fancy meal a meal of caprice a meal which few people take at this moment what be the single point of agreement between the noon meal of the english laborer and the evening meal of the english gentleman what be the single circumstance common to both which cause we to denominate they by the common name of _ dinner _ it be that in both we recognize the _ principal _ meal of the day the meal upon which be throw the _ onus _ of the day 's support in everything else they be as wide asunder as the pole but they agree in this one point of they function be it credible that to represent such a meal amongst ourselves we select a roman word so notoriously express a mere shadow a pure apology that very few people ever taste it -- nobody sate down to it -- not many wash they hand after it and gradually the very name of it become interchangeable with another name imply the slightest possible act of try or sip _ post larationem sine mensâ prandium _ say seneca _ post quod non sunt lavandæ manus _ that be after bathing i take a _ prandium _ without sit down to table and such a _ prandium _ as bring after itself no need of wash the hand no moonshine as little soil the hand as it oppress the stomach reader we as well as pliny have a uncle a east indian uncle doubtless you have such a uncle everybody have a indian uncle generally such a person be rather yellow rather yellow -lrb- to quote canning _ versus _ lord durham : -rrb- that be the chief fault with he physics but as to he moral he be universally a man of princely aspiration and habit he be not always so orientally rich as he be reputed but he be always orientally munificent call upon he at any hour from two to five he insist on you take _ tiffin _ : and such a tiffin the english corresponding term be luncheon : but how meager a shadow be the european meal to its glowing asiatic cousin still gloriously as tiffin shine do anybody imagine that it be a vicarious dinner or ever mean to be the substitute of dinner wait till eight and you will have you eye open on that subject so of the roman _ prandium _ : have it be as luxurious as it be simple still it be always view as something mean only to stay the stomach as a prologue to something beyond the _ prandium _ be far enough from give the feeblest idea of the english luncheon yet it stand in the same relation to the roman day now to english_men _ that meal scarcely exist and be it not for woman whose delicacy of organization do not allow they to fast so long as man would probably be abolish it be singular in this as in other point how nearly england and ancient rome approximate we all know how hard it be to tempt a man generally into spoil he appetite by eat before dinner the same dislike of violate what they call the integrity of the appetite -lrb- _ integram famem _ -rrb- exist at rome every man who know anything of latin critically see the connection of the word _ integer _ with _ in _ and _ tetigus _ : _ integer _ mean what be _ intact _ unviolated by touch cicero when protest against spoil he appetite for dinner by tasting anything beforehand say _ integram famem ad coenam afferam _ i shall bring to dinner a appetite untampered with nay so much stress do the roman lay on maintain this primitive state of the appetite undisturbed that any prelusion with either _ jentaculum _ or _ prandium _ be say by a very strong phrase indeed _ polluere famem _ to pollute the sanctity of the appetite the appetite be regard as a holy vestal flame soar upward towards dinner throughout the day : if undebauched it tend to its natural consummation in _ coena _ : expire like a phoenix to rise again out of its own ash on this theory to which language have accommodate itself the two prelusive meal of nine o'clock be and of one pm so far from be ratify by the public sense and adopt into the economy of the day be regard gloomily as gross irregularity enormity debaucher of the natural instinct and in so far as they thwart that instinct lessen it or depraved it be universally hold to be full of pollution and finally to _ profane _ a motion of nature such be the language but we guess what be pass in the reader 's mind he think that all this prove the _ prandium _ to have be a meal of little account and in very many case absolutely unknown but still he think all this might happen to the english dinner -- _ that _ might be neglect supper might be generally prefer and nevertheless dinner would be as truly entitle to the name of dinner as before many a student neglect he dinner enthusiasm in any pursuit must often have extinguish appetite for all of we many a time and oft do this happen to sir isaac newton evidence be on record that such a deponent at eight o'clock be find sir isaac with one stock on one off at two say deponent call he to dinner be interrogate whether sir isaac have pull on the _ minus _ stock or garter the _ plus _ stock witness reply that he have not be ask if sir isaac come to dinner reply that he do not be again ask at sunset do you look in on sir isaac witness reply i do and now upon you conscience sir by the virtue of you oath in what state be the stocking _ an in statu quo ante bellum _ it seem sir isaac have fight through that whole battle of a long day so try a campaign to many people -- be have traverse that whole sandy zaarah without call or need to call at one of those fountain stage or _ mansione _ -lrb- 7 -rrb- by which -lrb- accord to we former explanation -rrb- providence have relieve the continuity of arid soil which else disfigure that long dreary level this happen to all but be dinner not dinner and do supper become dinner because sir isaac newton eat nothing at the first and throw the whole day 's support upon the last no you will say a rule be not defeat by one casual deviation nor by one person 's constant deviation everybody else be still dine at two though sir isaac might not and sir isaac himself on most day no more defer he dinner beyond two than he sate with one stock off but what if everybody sir isaac include have defer he substantial meal until night and take a slight refection only at two the question put do really represent the very case which have happen with we in england in 1700 a large part of london take a meal at two pm and another at seven or eight pm in 1839 a large part of london be still do the very same thing take one meal at two and another at seven or eight but the name be entirely change : the two o'clock meal use to be call _ dinner _ and be now call _ luncheon _ the eight o'clock meal use to be call _ supper _ and be now call _ dinner _ now the question be easily solve : because upon review the idea of dinner we soon perceive that time have little or no connection with it : since both in england and france dinner have travel like the hand of a clock through _ every _ hour between ten be and ten pm we have a list well attest of every successive hour between these limit have be the known established hour for the royal dinner-table within the last three hundred and fifty year time therefore vanish from the equation : it be a quantity as regularly exterminate as in any algebraic problem the true element of the idea be evidently these : -- 1 that dinner be that meal no matter when take which be the principal meal _ ie _ the meal on which the day 's support be throw 2 that it be the meal of hospitality 3 that it be the meal -lrb- with reference to both no 1 and 2 -rrb- in which animal food predominate 4 that it be that meal which upon necessity arise for the abolition of all _ but _ one would naturally offer itself as that one apply these four test to _ prandium _ : -- how could that meal answer to the first test as _ the day 's support _ which few people touch how could that meal answer to the second test as the _ meal of hospitality _ at which nobody sate down how could that meal answer to the third test as the meal of animal food which consist exclusively and notoriously of bread or to the fourth test of the meal _ entitle to survive the abolition of the rest _ which be itself abolish at all time in practice try therefore by every test _ prandium _ vanish but we have something further to communicate about this same _ prandium _ i it come to pass by a very natural association of feeling that _ prandium _ and _ jentuculum _ in the latter century of rome be generally confound this result be inevitable both profess the same basis both come in the morning both be fiction hence they be confound that fact speak for itself -- breakfast and luncheon never could have be confound but who would be at the pain of distinguish two shadow in a gambling-house of that class where you be at liberty to sit down to a splendid banquet anxiety probably prevent you sit down at all but if you do the same cause prevent you notice what you eat so of the two _ pseudo _ meal of rome they come in the very midst of the roman business viz from nine be to two pm nobody could give he mind to they have they be of better quality there lay one cause of they vagueness viz -- in they position another cause be the common basis of both bread be so notoriously the predominate feature in each of these prelusive banquet that all foreigner at rome who communicate with roman through the greek language know both the one and the other by the name of -lrb- greek : artosito -rrb- or the _ bread repast _ originally this name have be restrict to the earlier meal but a distinction without a difference could not sustain itself : and both alike disguise they emptiness under this pompous quadrisyllable in the identity of substance therefore lay a second ground of confusion and then thirdly even as to the time which have ever be the sole real distinction there arise from accident a tendency to converge for it happen that while some have _ jentaculum _ but no _ prandium _ other have _ prandium _ but no _ jentaculum _ a third party have both a fourth party by much the largest have neither out of which variety -lrb- who would think that a nonentity could cut up into so many something -rrb- arise a fifth party of compromiser who because they could not afford a regular _ coena _ and yet be hospitably disposed fuse the two idea into one and so because the usual time for the idea of a breakfast be nine to ten and for the idea of a luncheon twelve to one compromise the rival pretension by what diplomatist call a _ mezzo termine _ bisect the time at eleven and melt the two idea into one but by thus merge the separate time of each they abolish the sole real difference that have ever divide they lose that they lose all perhaps as two negative make one affirmative it may be think that two layer of moonshine might coalesce into one pancake and two barmecide banquet might compose one poached egg of that the company be the best judge but probably as a rump and dozen in we land of wager be construe with a very liberal latitude as to the material so martial 's invitation to take bread with he at eleven might be understand by the -lrb- greek : sunetous -rrb- as significant of something better than -lrb- greek : artosito -rrb- otherwise in good truth moonshine and turn-out at eleven be would be even worse than tea and turn-out at eight pm which the fervida juventus of young england so loudly detest but however that might be in this convergement of the several frontier and the confusion that ensue one can not wonder that whilst the two bladder collapse into one idea they actually expand into four name two latin and two greek _ gustus _ and _ gustatio _ -lrb- greek : geusis -rrb- and -lrb- greek : geusma -rrb- which all alike express the merely tentative or exploratory act of a _ prægustator _ or professional taster in a king 's household : what if apply to a fluid we should denominate sip at last by so many step all in one direction thing have come to such a pass -- the two prelusive meal of the roman morning each for itself separately vague from the beginning have so communicate and interfuse they several and joint vagueness that at last no man know or care to know what any other man include in he idea of either how much or how little and you might as well have hunt in the wood of ethiopium for prester john or fix the parish of the everlasting jew -lrb- 8 -rrb- as have attempt to say what jentaculum might be or what prandium only one thing be clear -- what they be _ not _ neither be or wish to be anything that people care for they be both empty shadow but shadow as they be we find from cicero that they have a power of pollute and profane better thing than themselves we presume that no rational man will henceforth look for dinner -- that great idea accord to dr johnson -- that sacred idea accord to cicero -- in a bag of moonshine on one side or a bag of pollution on the other _ prandium _ so far from be what we foolish dictionary pretend -- dinner itself -- never in its palmiest day be more or other than a miserable attempt at be _ luncheon _ it be a _ conatus _ what physiologist call a _ nisus _ a struggle in a very ambitious spark or _ scintilla _ to kindle into a fire this _ nisus _ go on for some century but finally issue in smoke if _ prandium _ have work out he ambition have the great stream of tendency accomplish all he wish _ prandium _ never could have be more than a very indifferent luncheon but now ii we have to offer another fact ruinous to we dictionary on another ground various circumstance have disguise the truth but a truth it be that prandium in its very origin and _ incunabulum _ never be a meal know to the roman _ culina _ in that court it be never recognize except as a alien it have no original domicile in the city of rome it be a _ vot casfren-si _ a word and a idea purely martial and point to martial necessity amongst the new idea proclaim to the recruit this be one -- look for no ' _ coenu _ ' no regular dinner with we resign these unwarlike notion it be true that even war have its respite in these it would be possible to have we roman _ coena _ with all its equipage of ministration such luxury untune the mind for do and suffer let we voluntarily renounce it that when a necessity of renounce it arrive we may not feel it among the hardship of war from the day when you enter the gate of the camp reconcile yourself tyro to a new fashion of meal to what in camp dialect we call _ prandium _ this prandium this essentially military meal be take standing by way of symbolize the necessity of be always ready for the enemy hence the posture in which it be take at rome the very counter-pole to the luxurious posture of dinner a writer of the third century a period from which the roman naturally look back upon everything connect with they own early habit and with the same kind of interest as we extend to we alfr -lrb- separate from we as romulus from they by just a thousand year -rrb- in speaking of _ prandium _ say quod dictum est _ parandium _ ab eo quod milite ad bellum _ paret _ isidorus again say proprie apud vetere prandium vocatum fuisse oinnem militum cibum ante pugnam ie that properly speak amongst we ancestor every military meal take before battle be term _ prandium _ accord to isidore the proposition be reciprocate viz that as every _ prandium _ be a military meal so every military meal be call _ prandium _ but in fact the reason of that be apparent whether in the camp or the city the early roman have probably but one meal in a day that be true of many a man amongst ourselves by choice it be true also to we knowledge of some horse regiment in we service and may be of all this meal be call _ coena _ or dinner in the city -- _ prandium _ in camp in the city it would always be tend to one fixed hour in the camp innumerable accident of war would make it very uncertain on this account it would be a established rule to celebrate the daily meal at noon if nothing hinder not that a later hour would not have be prefer have the choice be free but it be better to have a certainty at a bad hour than by wait for a better hour to make it a uncertainty for it be a camp proverb -- _ pransus paratus _ arm with he daily meal the soldier be ready for service it be not however that all meal as isidore imagine be indiscriminately call _ prandium _ but that the one sole meal of the day by accident of war might and do revolve through all hour of the day the first introduction of this military meal into rome itself would be through the honorable pedantry of old centurion & c delighting -lrb- like the _ trunnion _ & c of we navy -rrb- to keep up in peaceful life some image or memorial of they past experience so wild so full of peril excitement and romance as roman warfare must have be in those age many non-military people for health 's sake many as a excuse for eat early many by way of interpose some refreshment between the stage of forensic business would adopt this hurry and informal meal many would wish to see they son adopt such a meal as a training for foreign service in particular and for temperance in general it would also be maintain by a solemn and very interesting commemoration of this camp repast in rome this commemoration because it have be grossly misunderstand by salmasius -lrb- whose error arise from not mark the true point of a particular antithesis -rrb- and still more because it be a distinct confirmation of all we have say as to the military nature of _ prandium _ we shall detach from the series of we illustration by place it in a separate paragraph on a set day the officer of the army be invite by cæsar to a banquet it be a circumstance expressly notice in the invitation by the proper officer of the palace that the banquet be not a coena but a prandium what follow in consequence why that all the guest sate down in full military accoutrement whereas observe the historian have it be a coena the officer would have unbelted they sword for he add even in cæsar 's presence the officer lay aside they sword the word _ prandium _ in short convert the palace into the imperial tent and cæsar be no longer a civil emperor and _ princep senatûs _ but become a commander-in-chief amongst a council of he staff all belt and plume and in full military fig on this principle we come to understand why it be that whenever the latin poet speak of a army as take food the word use be always _ pranden _ and _ pransus _ and when the word use be _ pranden _ then always it be a army that be concerned thus juvenal in a well-known satire -- -- credimus alto desiccasse amne epotaque ftumina medo _ prandente _ not _ coenante _ observe : you might as well talk of a army take tea and toast nor be that word ever apply to army it be true that the converse be not so rigorously observe : nor ought it from the explanation already give though no soldier dine -lrb- _ coenabat _ -rrb- yet the citizen sometimes adopt the camp usage and take a _ prandium _ but generally the poet use the word merely to mark the time of day in that most humorous appeal of perseus -- cur quis non prandeat hoc est be this a sufficient reason for lose one 's _ prandium _ he be oblige to say _ prandium _ because no exhibition ever could cause a man to lose he _ coenia _ since none be display at a time of day when anybody in rome would have attend just as in allude to a parliamentary speech notoriously deliver at midnight a english satirist must have say be this a speech to furnish a argument for leave one 's bed -- not as what stand foremost in he regard but as the only thing that _ could _ be lose at the time of night on this principle also viz by go back to the military origin of _ prandium _ we gain the interpretation of all the peculiarity attach to it viz -- 1 its early hour -- 2 its be take in a standing posture -- 3 in the open air -- 4 the humble quality of its material -- bread and biscuit -lrb- the main article of military fare -rrb- in all these circumstance of the meal we read most legibly write the exotic and military character of the meal thus we have bring down we roman friend to noonday or even one hour later than noon and to this moment the poor man have have nothing to eat for suppose he to be not _ impransus _ and suppose he _ jentâsse _ beside yet it be evident -lrb- we hope -rrb- that neither one nor the other mean more than what it be often call viz -lrb- greek : bouchismo -rrb- or in plain english a mouthful how long do we intend to keep he wait reader he will dine at three or -lrb- suppose dinner put off to the latest -rrb- at four dinner be never know to be later than the tenth hour in rome which in summer would be past five but for a far greater proportion of day would be near four in rome except for one or two of the emperor whom the mere business attach to they unhappy station keep sometimes dinnerless till six and so entirely be a roman the creature of ceremony that a national mourning would probably have be celebrate and the sad augur would have be call in to expiate the prodigy have the general dinner linger beyond four but meantime what have we friend be about since perhaps six or seven in the morning after pay he little homage to he _ patronus _ in what way have he fight with the great enemy time since then why reader this illustrate one of the most interesting feature in the roman character the roman be the idlest of man man and boy he be a idler in the land he call himself and he pal rerum domino gentemque togatam _ the gentry that wear the toga _ yes and a pretty affair that toga be just figure to yourself reader the picture of a hardworking man with horny hand like we hedger ditcher weaver porter & c setting to work on the highroad in that vast sweeping toga fill with a strong gale like the mainsail of a frigate conceive the roar with which this magnificent figure would be receive into the bosom of a poor-house detachment send out to attack the stone on some new line of road or a fatigue party of dustman send upon secret service have there be nothing leave as a memorial of the roman but that one relic -- they immeasurable toga -lrb- 9 -rrb- -- we should have know that they be bear and breed to idleness in fact except in war the roman never do anything at all but sun himself _ ut se apricaret _ be the final cause of peace in he opinion in literal truth that he might make a _ apricot _ of himself the public ration at all time support the poorest inhabitant of rome if he be a citizen hence it be that hadrian be so astonished with the spectacle of alexandrium _ civita opulenta fæcunda in qua nemo vivat otiosus _ here first he see the spectacle of a vast city second only to rome where every man have something to do _ podagrosus quod agant habent habent cæci quod faciant ne chiragricus _ -lrb- those with gout in the finger -rrb- _ apud eo otiosi vivunt _ no poor rate levy upon the rest of the world for the benefit of they own pauper be there distribute _ grati _ the prodigious spectacle -lrb- so it seem to hadrian -rrb- be exhibit in alexandrium of all man earn they bread in the sweat of they brow in rome only -lrb- and at one time in some of the grecian state -rrb- it be the very meaning of _ citizen _ that he could vote and be idle in these circumstance where the whole sum of life 's duty amount to vote all the business a man _ could _ have be to attend the public assembly electioneer or factious these and any judicial trial -lrb- public or private -rrb- that might happen to interest he for the person concern or for the question amuse he through the morning that be from eight till one he might also extract some diversion from the _ columnæ _ or pillar of certain portico to which they paste advertisement these _ affich _ must have be numerous for all the girl in rome who lose a trinket or a pet bird or a lap-dog take this mode of angling in the great ocean of the public for the miss article but all this time we take for grant that there be no show in a course of exhibition either the dreadful one of the amphitheatre or the bloodless one of the circus if there be then that become the business of all roman and it be a business which would have occupy he from daylight until the light begin to fail here we see another effect from the scarcity of artificial light amongst the ancient these magnificent show go on by daylight but how incomparably greater would have be the splendor by lamp-light what a gigantic conception eighty thousand human face all reveal under one blaze of lamp-light lord bacon see the mighty advantage of candle-light for the pomp and glory of this world but the poverty of the earth be the ultimate cause that the pagan show proceed by day not that the master of the world who rain arabian odor and perfumed water of the most costly description from a thousand fountain simply to cool the summer heat would have regard the expense of light cedar and other odorous wood burn upon vast altar together with every variety of fragrant torch would have create light enough to shed a new day over the distant adriatic however as there be no public spectacles we will suppose and the court or political meeting -lrb- if not close altogether by superstition -rrb- would at any rate be close in the ordinary course by twelve or one o'clock nothing remain for he to do before return home except perhaps to attend the _ palæstra _ or some public recitation of a poem write by a friend but in any case to attend the public bath for these the time vary and many people have think it tyrannical in some of the cæsars that they impose restraint on the time open for the bath some for instance would not suffer they to open at all before two and in any case if you be later than four or five in summer you would have to pay a fine which most effectually clean out the bath of all raff since it be a sum that _ john quire _ could not have produce to save he life but it should be consider that the emperor be the steward of the public resource for maintain the bath in fuel oil attendance repair we be prepare to show on a fitting occasion that every fourth person -lrb- 10 -rrb- amongst the citizen bath daily and non-citizen of course pay a _ extra _ sum now the population of rome be far larger than have ever be hint at except by lipsius but certain it be that during the long peace of the first cæsars and after the _ annonarium prorisio _ -lrb- that great pledge of popularity to a roman prince -rrb- have be increase by the corn tribute from the nile the roman population take a immense lurch ahead the subsequent increase of bath whilst no old one be neglect prove _ that _ decisively and as citizenship expand by means of the easy term on which it could be have so do the bather multiply the population of rome in the century after augustus be far greater than during that era and this still act as a vortex to the rest of the world may have be one great motive with constantine for transfer the capital eastward in reality for break up one monster capital into two of more manageable dimension two o'clock be often the earliest hour at which the public bath be open but in martial 's time a man could go without blush -lrb- _ salvâ fronte _ -rrb- at eleven though even then two o'clock be the meridian hour for the great uproar of splashing and swimming and larking in the endless bath of endless rome and now at last bathing finish and the exercise of the _ palæstra _ at half-past two or three we friend find he way home -- not again to leave it for that day he be now a new man refresh oil with perfume he dust wash off by hot water and ready for enjoyment these be the thing that determine the time for dinner have there be no other proof that _ coena _ be the roman dinner this be a ample one now first the roman be fit for dinner in a condition of luxurious ease business ever -- that day 's load of anxiety lay aside -- he _ cuticle _ as he delight to talk cleansed and polished -- nothing more to do or to think of until the next morning he might now go and dine and get drunk with a safe conscience besides if he do not get dinner now when will he get it for most demonstrably he have take nothing yet which come near in value to that basin of soup which many of ourselves take at the roman hour of bathing no we have keep we man fast as yet it be to be hope that something be come at last it _ do _ come -- dinner the great meal of coena the meal sacred to hospitality and genial pleasure come now to fill up the rest of the day until light fail altogether many people be of opinion that the roman only understand what the capability of dinner be it be certain that they be the first great people that discover the true secret and meaning of dinner the great office which it fulfil and which we in england be now so generally act on barbarous nation -- and none be in that respect more barbarous than we own ancestor -- make this capital blunder the brute if you ask they what be the use of dinner what it be mean for stare at you and reply -- as a horse would reply if you put the same question about he provender -- that it be to give he strength for finish he work therefore if you point you telescope back to antiquity about twelve or one o'clock in the daytime you will descry we most worthy ancestor all eating for they very live eating as dog eat viz in bodily fear that some other dog will come and take they dinner away what swell of the vein in the temple -lrb- see boswell 's natural history of dr johnson at dinner -rrb- what intense and rapid deglutition what odious clatter of knife and plate what silence of the human voice what gravity what fury in the libidinous eye with which they contemplate the dish positively it be a _ indecent _ spectacle to see dr johnson at dinner but above all what maniacal haste and hurry as if the fiend be wait with red-hot pincers to lay hold of the hindermost oh reader do you recognize in this abominable picture you respect ancestor and ours excuse we for say -- what monster we have a right to call we own ancestor monster and if so we must have the same right over yours for dr southey have show plainly in the doctor that every man have four grand parent in the second stage of ascent -lrb- each of whom have four therefore -rrb- sixteen in the third and so on long before you get to the conquest every man and woman then live in england will be want to make up the sum of my separate ancestor consequently you must take you ancestor out of the very same fund or -lrb- if you be too proud for that -rrb- you must go without ancestor so that you ancestor be clearly mine i have a right in law to call the whole kit of they monster _ quod erat demonstrandum _ really and upon we honor it make one for the moment ashamed of one 's descent one would wish to disinherit one 's - self backwards and -lrb- as sheridan say in the _ rival _ -rrb- to cut the connection wordsworth have a admirable picture in peter bell of a snug party in a parlor remove into _ limbus patrum _ for they offence in the flesh : -- cram as they on earth be cramm would all sip wine all sip tea but as you by they face see all silent and all d -- d how well do that one word describe those venerable ancestral dinner -- all silent contrast this infernal silence of voice and fury of eye with the risus amabili the festivity the social kindness the music the wine the dulci insanium of a roman coena we mention four test for determine what meal be and what be not dinner we may now add a fifth viz the spirit of festal joy and elegant enjoyment of anxiety lay aside and of honorable social pleasure put on like a marriage garment and what cause the difference between we ancestor and the roman simply this -- the error of interpose dinner in the middle of business thus court all the breeze of angry feeling that may happen to blow from the business yet to come instead of finish absolutely close the account with this world 's trouble before you sit down that unhappy interpolation ruin all dinner be a ugly little parenthesis between two still uglier clause of a tee-totally ugly sentence whereas with we they enlighten posterity to whom they have the honor to be ancestor dinner be a great reaction there lie we conception of the matter it grow out of the very excess of the evil when business be moderate dinner be allow to divide and bisect it when it swell into that vast strife and agony as one may call it that boil along the tortured street of modern london or other capital man begin to see the necessity of a adequate counterforce to push against this overwhelming torrent and thus maintain the equilibrium be it not for the soft relief of a six o'clock dinner the gentle manner succeed to the boisterous hubbub of the day the soft glowing light the wine the intellectual conversation life in london be now come to such a pass that in two year all nerve would sink before it but for this periodic reaction the modern business which draw so cruelly on the brain and so little on the hand would overthrow that organ in all but those of coarse organization dinner it be -- meaning by dinner the whole complexity of attendant circumstance -- which save the modern brain-working man from go mad this revolution as to dinner be the greatest in virtue and value ever accomplish in fact those be always the most operative revolution which be bring about through social or domestic change a nation must be barbarous neither could it have much intellectual business which dine in the morning they could not be at ease in the morning so much must be grant : every day have its separate _ quantum _ its dose -lrb- as the doctrinist of rent phrase it -rrb- of anxiety that could not be digest so soon as noon no man will say it he therefore who dine at noon be willing to sit down squalid as he be with he dress unchanged he care not wash off and what follow from that why that to he to such a canine or cynical specimen of the genus _ homo _ dinner exist only as a physical event a mere animal relief a mere carnal enjoyment for what we demand do this fleshly creature differ from the carrion crow or the kite or the vulture or the cormorant a french judge in a action upon a wager lay it down in law that man only have a _ bouche _ all other animal have a _ gueule _ : only with regard to the horse in consideration of he beauty nobility use and in honor of the respect with which man regard he by the courtesy of christendom he might be allow to have a _ bouche _ and he reproach of brutality if not take away might thus be hide but surely of the rabid animal who be catch dining at noonday the _ homo ferus _ who affront the meridian sun like thyeste and atreus by he inhuman meal we be by parity of reason entitle to say that he have a maw -lrb- so have milton 's death -rrb- but nothing resemble stomach and to this vile man a philosopher would say -- go away sir and come back to I two or three century hence when you have learn to be a reasonable creature and to make that physico-intellectual thing out of dinner which it be mean to be and be capable of become in henry vii 's time the court dine at eleven in the forenoon but even that hour be consider so shockingly late in the french court that loui xii actually have he gray hair bring down with sorrow to the grave by change he regular hour of half-past nine for eleven in gallantry to he young english bride -lrb- 11 -rrb- he fall a victim to late hour in the forenoon in cromwell 's time they dine at one pm one century and a half have carry they on by two hour doubtless old cook and scullion wonder what the world would come to next we french neighbor be in the same predicament but they far surpass we in veneration for the meal they actually date from it dinner constitute the great era of the day _ l'apre diner _ be almost the sole date which you find in cardinal de retz 's memoirs of the _ fronde _ dinner be they _ hegira _ -- dinner be they _ line _ in traverse the ocean of day : they cross the equator when they dine we english revolution come next it make some little difference we have hear people say in church and state but its great effect be perceive in dinner people now dine at two so dine addison for he last thirty year so dine pope who be coeval with the revolution through he entire life precisely as the rebellion of 1745 arise do people -lrb- but observe very great people -rrb- advance to four pm philosopher who watch the semina rerum and the first symptom of change have perceive this alteration singing in the upper air like a come storm some little time before about the year 1740 pope complain to a friend of lady suffolk 's dining so late as four young people may bear those thing he observe but as to himself now turn of fifty if such doings go on if lady suffolk would adopt such strange hour he must really absent himself from marble hill lady suffolk have a right to please herself : he himself love she but if she would persist all which remain for a decayed poet be respectfully to cut he stick and retire whether pope ever put up with four o'clock dinner again we have vainly seek to fathom some thing advance continuously like a flood or a fire which always make a end of a eat and digest it before they go on to b other thing advance _ per saltum _ -- they do not silently cancer they way onward but lie as still as a snake after they have make some notable conquest then when unobserved they make themselves up for mischief and take a fly bind onward thus advance dinner and by these fit get into the territory of evening and ever as it make a motion onward it find the nation more civilized -lrb- else the change would not have be effect -rrb- and raise they to a still higher civilization the next relay on that line of road the next repeat frigate be cowper in he poem on _ conversation _ he speak of four o'clock as still the elegant hour for dinner -- the hour for the _ lautiore _ and the _ lepidus homine _ now this be write about 1780 or a little earlier perhaps therefore just one generation after pope 's lady suffolk but then cowper be live amongst the rural gentry not in high life yet again cowper be nearly connect by blood with the eminent whig house of cowper and acknowledge as a _ kinsman _ about twenty-five year after this we may take oxford as a good exponent of the national advance as a magnificent body of foundation endow by king and resort to by the flower of the national youth oxford be always elegant and even splendid in she habit yet on the other hand as a grave seat of learning and feel the weight of she position in the commonwealth she be slow to move : she be inert as she should be have the function of _ resistance _ assign to she against the popular instinct of _ movement _ now in oxford about 1804-5 there be a general move in the dinner hour those college who dine at three of which there be still several now dine at four those who have dine at four now translate they hour to five these continue good general hour but still amongst the more intellectual order till about waterloo after that era six which have be somewhat of a gala hour be promote to the fix station of dinner-time in ordinary and there perhaps it will rest through century for a more festal dinner seven eight nine ten have all be in requisition since then but we have not yet hear of any man 's dining later than 10 pm except in that single classical instance -lrb- so well remember from we father joe -rrb- of a irishman who must have dine _ much _ later than ten because he servant protest when other be enforce the dignity of they master by the lateness of they dinner hour that _ he _ master dine to-morrow be the roman not as barbarous as we own ancestor at one time most certainly they be in they primitive age they take they _ coena _ at noon -lrb- 12 -rrb- _ that _ be before they have lay aside they barbarism before they shave : it be during they barbarism and in consequence of they barbarism that they time they _ coena _ thus unseasonably and this be make evident by the fact that so long as they err in the hour they err in the attend circumstance at this period they have no music at dinner no festal grace and no repose upon sofa they sate bolt upright in chair and be as grave as we ancestor as rabid and doubtless as furiously in haste with we the revolution have be equally complex we do not indeed adopt the luxurious attitude of semi-recumbency we climate make that less requisite and moreover the roman have no knife and fork which could scarcely be use in that posture : they eat with they finger from dish already cut up -- whence the peculiar force of seneca 's post quod non sunt lavandæ manus but exactly in proportion as we dinner have advance towards evening have we and have that advance in circumstance of elegance of taste of intellectual value that by itself would be much infinite would be the gain for any people that it have cease to be brutal animal fleshly cease to regard the chief meal of the day as a ministration only to a animal necessity that they have raise it to a far higher standard associate it with social and humanize feeling with manners with grace both moral and intellectual moral in the self-restraint intellectual in the fact notorious to all man that the chief arena for the _ easy _ display of intellectual power be at we dinner table but dinner have _ now _ even a greater function than this as the fervor of we day 's business increase dinner be continually more need in its office of a great _ reaction _ we repeat that at this moment but for the daily relief of dinner the brain of all man who mix in the strife of capital would be unhinge and throw off its center if we should suppose the case of a nation take three equidistant meal all of the same material and the same quantity all milk for instance it would be impossible for thoma aquina himself to say which be or be not dinner the case would be that of the roman _ ancile _ which drop from the sky to prevent its ever be steal the priest make eleven _ facsimile _ of it that the thief see the hopelessness of distinguish the true one might let all alone and the result be that in the next generation nobody could point to the true one but we dinner the roman _ coena _ be distinguish from the rest by far more than the hour it be distinguish by great function and by still greater capacity it _ be _ most beneficial it may become more so in say this we point to the lighter grace of music and conversation _ more varied _ by which the roman _ coena _ be chiefly distinguish from we dinner we be far from agree with mr croly that the roman meal be more intellectual than ours on the contrary ours be the more intellectual by much we have far greater knowledge far greater means for make it such in fact the fault of we meal be -- that it be _ too _ intellectual of too severe a character too political too much tend in many hand to disquisition reciprocation of question and answer variety of topic shift of topic be point not sufficiently cultivate in all else we assent to the following passage from mr croly 's eloquent salathiel : -- if a ancient roman could start from he slumber into the midst of european life he must look with scorn on its absence of grace elegance and fancy but it be in its festivity and most of all in its banquet that he would feel the incurable barbarism of the gothic blood contrast with the fine display that make the table of the roman noble a picture and throw over the indulgence of appetite the color of the imagination with what eye must he contemplate the tasteless and commonplace dress the coarse attendant the meager ornament the want of mirth music and intellectual interest -- the whole heavy machinery that convert the feast into the mere drudgery of devour thus far the reader know already that we dissent violently and by look back he will see a picture of we ancestor at dinner in which they rehearse the very part in relation to ourselves that mr croly suppose all modern to rehearse in relation to the roman but in the rest of the beautiful description the positive though not the comparative part we must all concur : -- the guest before I be fifty or sixty splendidly dress man -lrb- they be in fact titus and he staff then occupy with the siege of jerusalem -rrb- attend by a crowd of domestic attire with scarcely less splendor for no man thought of come to the banquet in the robe of ordinary life the embroidered couch themselves striking object allow the ease of position at once delightful in the relaxing climate of the south and capable of combine with every grace of the human figure at a slight distance the table load with plate glittering under a profusion of lamp and surround by couch thus cover by rich drapery be like a central source of light radiate in broad shaft of every brilliant hue the wealth of the patrician and they intercourse with the greek make they master of the first performance of the art copy of the most famous statue and group of sculpture in the precious metal trophy of victory model of temple be mingle with vase of flower and light perfume finally cover and close all be a vast scarlet canopy which combine the group beneath to the eye and throw the whole into the form that a painter would love mr croly then go on to insist on the intellectual embellishment of the roman dinner they variety they grace they adaptation to a festive purpose the truth be we english imagination more profound than the roman be also more gloomy less gay less _ riante _ that account for we want of the gorgeous _ trictinium _ with its scarlet drapery and for many other difference both to the eye and to the understanding but both we and the roman agree in the main point we both discover the true purpose which dinner might serve -- 1 to throw the grace of intellectual enjoyment over a animal necessity 2 to relieve and antagonize the toil of brain incident to high form of social life we object have be to point the eye to this fact to show use imperfectly suspect in a recur accident of life to show a steady tendency to that consummation by hold up as in a mirror -lrb- together with occasional glimpse of hidden corner in history -rrb- the corresponding revolution silently go on in a great people of antiquity note -lrb- note 1 _ in procinct _ -- milton 's translation -lrb- somewhere in the paradise regain -rrb- of the technical phrase in procinctu -rrb- -lrb- note 2 _ geologist know not _ -- observe reader we be not at all question the scriptural chronology of the earth as a _ habitation for man _ for on the pre-human earth scripture be silent : not upon the six thousand year do we doubt revolve but upon a very different thing viz to what age in man these six thousand year correspond by analogy in a planet in man the sixtieth part be a very venerable age but as to a planet as to we little earth instead of argue dotage six thousand year may have scarcely carry she beyond babyhood some people think she be cut she first tooth some think she in she teens but seriously it be a very interesting problem do the sixty century of we earth imply youth maturity or dotage -rrb- -lrb- note 3 _ everywhere the ancient go to bed like good boy from seven to nine o'clock _ -- as we be perfectly serious we must beg the reader who fancy any joke in all this to consider what a immense difference it must have make to the earth consider as a steward of she own resources-whether great nation in a period when they resource be so feebly develop do or do not for many century require candle and we may add fire the five head of human expenditure be -- 1 food 2 shelter 3 clothing 4 fuel 5 light all be pitch on a lower scale in the pagan era and the two last be almost banish from ancient housekeeping what a great relief this must have be to we good mother the earth who at _ first _ be oblige to request of she child that they would settle round the mediterranean she could not even afford they water unless they would come and fetch it themselves out of a common tank or cistern -rrb- -lrb- note 4 _ the manesalutante _ -- there can be no doubt that the _ levee _ of modern prince and minister have be inherit from this ancient usage of rome one which belong to rome republican as well as rome imperial the fiction in we modern practice be -- that we wait upon the _ levé _ or rise of the prince in france at one era this fiction be realize : the courtier do really attend the king 's dress and as to the queen even up to the revolution marie antoinette almost from necessity give audience at she toilette -rrb- -lrb- note 5 _ or again ` siccum pro biscodo ut hodie vocamus sumemus _ ' -- it be odd enough that a scholar so complete as salmasius whom nothing ever escape should have overlook so obvious a alternative as that of _ siccus _ meaning without _ opsonium -- scoticè _ without kitchen -rrb- -lrb- note 6 _ the whole amount of relief _ -- from which it appear how grossly locke -lrb- see he _ education _ -rrb- be deceive in fancy that augustus practice any remarkable abstinence in take only a bit of bread and a raisin or two by way of luncheon augustus do no more than most people do secondly he abstain only with a view to dinner and thirdly for this dinner he never wait longer than up to four o'clock -rrb- -lrb- note 7 _ mansione _ -- the halt of the roman legion the stationary place of repose which divide the march be so call -rrb- -lrb- note 8 _ the everlasting jew _ -- the german name for what we english call the wander jew the german imagination have be most strike with the duration of the man 's life and he unhappy sanctity from death the english by the unrestingness of the man 's life he incapacity of repose -rrb- -lrb- note 9 _ immeasurable toga _ -- it be very true that in the time of augustus the _ toga _ have disappear amongst the lowest pleb and greatly augustus be shock at that spectacle it be a very curious fact in itself especially as expound the main cause of the civil war mere poverty and the absence of bribery from rome whilst all popular competition for office droop can alone explain this remarkable revolution of dress -rrb- -lrb- note 10 that boy in the prætexta do not bathe in the public bath be certain and most unquestionably that be the meaning of the expression in juvenal so much dispute -- nisi quus nondum _ ære _ lavantur by _ æs _ he mean the _ ahenum _ a common name for the public bath which be make of copper in we navy the _ copper _ be a name for the boiler nobody believe in such tale except child be the meaning this one exclusion cut off three eighth of the roman male -rrb- -lrb- note 11 _ he young -- english bride _ -- the case of a old man or one reputed old marry a very girlish wife be always too much for the gravity of history and rather than lose the joke the historian prudently disguise the age which after all be little above fifty and the very person who insist on the late dinner as the proximate cause of death elsewhere insinuate something else not so decorously express it be odd that this amiable prince so memorable as have be a martyr to late dining at eleven be be the same person who be so equally memorable for the noble answer about a king of france not remember the wrong of a duke of orlean -rrb- -lrb- note 12 _ take they coena at noon _ -- and by the way in order to show how little _ coena _ have to do with any evening hour -lrb- though in any age but that of we father four in the afternoon would never have be think a evening hour in the sense imply by _ supper _ -rrb- -- the roman _ gourmand _ and _ bon vivant _ continue through the very last age of rome to take they coena when more than usually sumptuous at noon this indeed all people do occasionally just as we sometimes give a dinner even now so early as four pm under the name of a _ dejeuner à la fourchette _ those who take they _ coena _ so early as this be say _ de die coenare _ -- to begin dine from high day just as the line in horace -- ut jugulent homine surgunt _ de nocte _ latrone do not mean that the robber rise when other be go to bed viz at nightfall but at midnight for say one of the three best scholar of this earth _ de die de nocte _ mean from that hour which be most fully most intensely day or night viz the center the meridian this one fact be surely a clencher as to the question whether _ coena _ mean dinner or supper -rrb- end of project gutenberg 's miscellaneous
