still in he bunk when the ship come to she mooring at algier and he get up with a sudden jerk under the impression that the zouave be sink seize he many weapon he rush on deck to find it be not

carry to bed where he snore very soundly until it be striking three o'clock he have sleep all the evening through the night and morning and well into the next afternoon he awaken refresh and the first thought in he mind be i be in lion-land at last but the thought send a cold shiver through he and he dive under the bedclothes a moment later he determine to be up exclaim now for the lion he jump on the floor and begin he preparation he plan be to get out at once into the country take ambush for the night shoot the first lion that come along and then back to the hotel for breakfast so off he go carry not only he usual arsenal but the marvellous patent tent strap to he back he attract no little attention as he trudge along and catch sight of a very fine camel he heart beat fast for he think the lion could not be far off now it be quite dark by the time he have get only a little way beyond the outskirts of the town scramble over ditch and bramble-hedge after much hard work of this kind the mighty hunter suddenly stop whisper to himself i seem to smell a lion hereabouts he sniff keenly in all direction to he excited imagination it seem a likely place for a lion so drop on one knee and lay one of he gun in front of he he wait he wait very patiently one hour two hour but nothing stir then he suddenly remember that great lion-hunter take a little young goat with they to attract the lion by its bleat have forget to supply himself with one tartarin conceive the happy idea of bleat like a kid he start softly call meh meh he be really afraid that a lion might hear he but as no lion seem to be pay attention he become bolder in he meh until the noise he make be more like the bellowing of a bull but hush what be that a huge black object have for the moment loom up against the dark blue sky it stoop sniff the ground then seem to move away again only to return suddenly it must be the lion at last so take a steady aim bang go the gun of tartarin and a terrible howling come in response clearly he shot have tell the wound lion have make off he would now wait for the female to appear as he have read in book but two or more hour pass and she do not come and the ground be damp and the night air cold so the hunter think he would camp for the night after much struggle he could not get he patent tent to open finally he throw it on the ground in a rage and lay on the top of it thus he sleep until the bugle in the barracks near by waken he in the morning for behold instead of find himself out on the sahara he be in the kitchen garden of some suburban algerian these people be mad he growl to himself to plant they artichoke where lion be roam about surely i have be dream lion do come here there be proof positive from artichoke to artichoke from field to field he follow the thin trail of blood and come at length to a poor little donkey he have wound tartarin 's first feeling be one of vexation there be such a difference between a lion and a ass and the poor little creature look so innocent the great hunter kneel down and try to stanch the donkey 's wound and it seem grateful to he for it feebly flap its long ear two or three time before it lay still for ever suddenly a voice be hear call noiraud noiraud it be the female she come in the form of a old french woman with a large red umbrella and it would have be better for tartarin to have face a female lion when the unhappy man try to explain how he have mistake she little donkey for a lion she think he be make fun of she and belabour he with she umbrella when she husband come on the scene the matter be soon adjust by tartarin agree to pay eight pound for the damage he have do the price of the donkey be really something like eight shilling the donkey owner be a inn-keeper and the sight of tartarin 's money make he quite friendly he invite the lion-hunter to have some food at the inn with he before he leave and as they walk thither he be amaze to be tell by the inn-keeper that he have never see a lion there in twenty year clearly the lion be to be look for further south i 'll make track for the south too say tartarin to himself but he first of all return to he hotel in a omnibus think of it but before he be to go south on the high adventure he loaf about the city of algier for some time go to the theater and other place of amusement where he meet prince gregory of montenegro with whom he make friend one day the captain of the zouave come across he in the town and show he a note about himself in a tarascon newspaper this speak of the uncertainty that prevail as to the fate of the great hunter and wind up with these word : some negro trader state however that they meet in the open desert a european whose description answer to that of tartarin and who be make track for timbuctoo may heaven guard for we we hero tartarin go red and white by turn as he read this and realize that he be in for it he very much wish to return to he beloved tarascon but to go there without have shoot some lion -- one at least -- be impossible and so it be southward ho _ iii -- tartarin 's adventure in the desert _ the lion-hunter be keenly disappoint after a very long journey in the stage-coach to be tell that there be not a lion leave in all algerium though a few panther might still be find worth shooting he get out at the town of milianah and let the coach go on as he think he might as well take thing easily if after all there be no lion to be shoot to he amazement however he come across a real live lion at the door of a café what make they say there be no more lion he cry astounded at the sight the lion lift in its mouth a wooden bowl from the pavement and a pass arab throw a copper in the bowl at which the lion wag its tail suddenly the truth dawn on tartarin he be a poor blind tame lion which a couple of negro be take through the street just like a perform dog he blood be up at the very idea shout you scoundrel to humiliate these noble beast so he rush and take the degrading bowl from the royal jaw of the lion this lead to a quarrel with the negro at the height of which prince gregory of montenegro come upon the scene the prince tell he a most untrue story about a convent in the north of africa where lion be keep to be send out with priest to beg for money he also assure he that there be lot of lion in algerium and that he would join he in he hunt thus it be in the company of prince gregory and with a following of half a dozen negro porter that tartarin set off early next morning for the shereef plain but they very soon have trouble both with the porter and with the provision tartarin have bring for he great journey the prince suggest dismiss the negro and buy a couple of donkey but tartarin could not bear the thought of donkey for a reason with which we be acquaint he readily agree however to the purchase of a camel and when he be safely help up on its hump he sorely wish the people of tarascon could see he but he pride speedily have a fall for he find the movement of the camel worse than that of the boat in cross the mediterranean he be afraid he might disgrace france indeed if truth must out france be disgrace so for the remainder of they expedition which last nearly a month tartarin prefer to walk on foot and lead the camel one night in the desert tartarin be sure he hear sound just like those he have study at the back of the travel menagerie at tarascon he be positive they be in the neighborhood of a lion at last he prepare to go forward and stalk the beast the prince offer to accompany he but tartarin resolutely refuse he would meet the king of beast alone entrust he pocket-book full of precious document and bank-note to the prince in case he might lose it in a tussle with the lion he move forward he tooth be chatter in he head when he lay down tremble to await the lion it must have be two hour before he be sure that the beast be move quite near he in the dry bed of a river firing two shot in the direction whence the sound come he get up and bolt back to where he have leave the camel and the prince -- but there be only the camel there now the prince have wait a whole month for such a chance in the morning he realize that he have be rob by a thief who pretend to be a prince and here he be in the heart of savage africa with a little pocket money only much useless luggage a camel and not a single lion-skin for all he trouble sit on one of the desert-tomb erect over pious mohammedan the great man fall to weep bitterly but even as he weep the bush be push aside a little in front of he and a huge lion present itself to he honor be it say tartarin never move a muscle but breathe a fervent at last he leap to he foot and level he rifle plant two explosive bullet in the lion 's head all be over in a moment for he have nearly blow the king of beast to piece but in another moment he see two tall enraged negro bear down upon he he have see they before at milianah and this be they poor blind lion fortunately for tartarin he be not so deeply in the desert as he have think but merely outside the town of orleansville and a policeman now come up attract by the firing and take full particulars the upshot of it be that he have to suffer much delay in orleansville and be eventually fine one hundred pound how to pay this be a problem which he solve by sell all he extensive outfit bit by bit when he debt be pay he have nothing but the lion 's skin and the camel the former he dispatch to major bravida at tarascon nobody would buy the camel and its master have to face all the journey back to algier in short stage on foot _ iv -- the home-coming of the hero _ the camel show a curious affection for he and follow he as faithfully as a dog when at the end of eight day ' weary tramp he come at

lion and he offer tartarin a free passage home the zouave be get up steam next day as the dejected tartarin have just step into the captain 's long-boat when lo he faithful camel come tear down the quay and gaze affectionately at its friend tartarin pretend not to notice it but the animal seem to implore he with he eye to be take away you be the last turk it seem to say i be the last camel let we never part again o my tartarin but the lion-hunter pretend to know nothing of this ship of the desert as the boat pull off to the zouave the camel jump into the water and swam after it and be take aboard at last tartarin have the joy of hear the zouave cast anchor at marseille and have no luggage to trouble he he rush off the boat at once and hasten through the town to the railway station hope to get ahead of the camel he book third class and quickly hide himself in a carriage off go the train but it have not go far when everybody be look out of the window and laugh behind the train run the camel -- hold he own too what a humiliating home-coming all he weapon of the chase leave on moorish soil not a lion with he nothing but a silly camel tarascon tarascon shout the porter as the train slow up at the station and the hero get out he have hope to slink home unobserved but to he amazement he be receive with shout of long live tartarin three cheer for the lion-slayer the people be wave they cap in the air it be no joke they be serious there be major bravida and there the more noteworthy cap-hunter who cluster round they chief and carry he in triumph down the stair now all this be

goodness in you sowing corn for you own eating that be no more than all the people round here continually do and if they do not do it they would be oblige to fast but then say tommy they be not gentleman as i be what answer mr barlow must not gentleman eat as well as other and therefore be it not for they interest to know how to procure food as well as other people yes sir answer tommy but they can have other people to raise it for they how do that happen why they pay other people to work for they or buy bread when it be make then they pay for it with money yes sir then they must have money before they can buy corn certainly sir but have all gentleman money tommy hesitate some time and at last say i believe not always sir why then say mr barlow if they have not money they will find it difficult to procure corn unless they raise it for themselves and he proceed to recount the history of the two brother pizarro and alonzo the former of whom set out on a gold-hunting expedition prevail upon the latter to accompany he and become dependent upon alonzo who instead of take gold-seeking implement provide himself with the necessaries for stock a farm _ iii -- town life and country life _ this story be follow by other describe life in different and distant part of the world and in addition to the knowledge they acquire in this way tommy and harry in they intercourse with they neighbor and in the cultivation of they garden learn a great deal tommy in particular grow much kinder towards the poor and towards dumb animal as well as grow in physical well-being mr barlow 's young pupil be gradually teach many interesting and useful fact about natural history they learn to cultivate they power of observation also by study the heaven from a study of the star they tutor draw they on to a acquaintance with the compass the telescope the magic lantern the magnet and the wonder of arithmetic the story of foreign land be intersperse with other illustrate the habit of society one for example tell how a certain rich man be cure of the gout show how while most of the disease of the poor originate in the want of food and necessaries the rich be generally the victim of they own sloth and intemperance dear I say tommy on one occasion what a number of accident people be subject to in this world it be very true say mr barlow but as that be the case it be necessary to improve ourselves in every manner that we may be able to struggle against they tommy : indeed sir i begin to believe it be for when i be younger than i be now i remember i be always fretful and hurt myself though i have two or three people constantly to take care of I at present i seem quite another thing i do not mind fall down and hurt myself or cold or scarcely anything that happen mr barlow : and which do you prefer -- to be as you be now or as you be before tommy : as i be now a great deal sir for then i always have something or another the matter with I at present i think i be ten time stronger and healthier than ever i be in my life all the same tommy find it difficult at first to understand how people who live in country where they have to undergo great hardship could be so attach to they own land as to prefer it to any other country in the world i have he say see a great many lady and little miss at we house and whenever they be talk of the place where they should like to live i have always hear they say that they hate the country of all thing though they be bear and breed there mr barlow : and yet there be thousand who bear to live in it all they life and have no desire to change should you harry like to go to live in some town harry : indeed sir i should not for then i must leave everything i love in the world tommy : and have you ever be in any large town harry : once i be in exeter but i do not much like it the house seem to I to stand too thick and close and then there be little narrow alley where the poor live and the house be so high that neither light nor air can ever get to they and they most of they appear so dirty and unhealthy that it make my heart ache to look at they i go home the next day and never be better pleased in my life when i come to the top of the great hill from which you have a prospect of we house i really think i should have cry with joy the field look all so pleasant and the very cattle when i go about to see they all seem glad that i be come home again mr barlow : you see by this that it be very possible for people to like the country and to be happy in it but as to the fine young lady you talk of the truth be that they neither love nor would be contented in any place it be no wonder they dislike the country where they find neither employment nor amusement they wish to go to london because they there meet with number of people as idle and as frivolous as themselves and these people assist each other to talk about trifle and to waste they time tommy : that be true sir really for when we have a great deal of company i have often observe that they never talk about anything but eat or dress or man and woman that be pay to make face at the playhouse or a great room call ranelagh where everybody go to meet they friend which discourse lead on to a story of the ancient spartan and they superiority to the luxury-loving persian _ iv -- the bull-baiting _ the time have now arrive when tommy be by appointment to go home and spend some time with he parent mr barlow have be long afraid of this visit as he know he pupil would meet a great deal of company there who would give he impression of a nature very different from those he have with so much assiduity be labor to excite however the visit be unavoidable and mr merton send so press a invitation for harry to accompany he friend after have obtain the consent of he father that mr barlow with much regret take leave of he pupil when the boy arrive at mr merton 's they be introduce into a crowded drawing-room full of the most elegant company which that part of the country afford among whom be several young gentleman and lady of different age who have be purposely invite to spend they holiday with master merton as soon as master merton enter every tongue be let loose in he praise as to harry he have the good fortune to be take notice of by nobody except mr merton who receive he with great cordiality and a miss simmon who have be bring up by a uncle who endeavor by a hardy and robust education to prevent in he niece that sickly delicacy which be consider so great a ornament in fashionable life harry and this young lady become great friend though to a considerable extent they be the butt of the other a lady who sit by mr merton ask she in a whisper loud enough to be hear all over the room whether -lrb- indicate harry -rrb- that be the little ploughboy whom she have hear mr barlow be attempt to bring up like a gentleman mr merton answer yes indeed say the lady i should have think so by he plebeian look and vulgar air but i wonder my dear madam that you will suffer you son who without flattery be one of the most accomplished child i ever see with quite the air of fashion to keep such company whilst tommy be be estrange from he friend by a constant succession of flattery from he elder and the example of other of he own age harry who never say any of those brilliant thing that render a boy the darling of the lady and who have not that vivacity or rather impertinence which frequently pass for wit with superficial people pay the greatest attention to what be say to he and make the most judicious observation upon subject he understand for this reason miss simmon although much older and better inform receive great satisfaction from converse with he and think he infinitely more agreeable and sensible than any of the smart young gentleman she have hitherto see one morning the young gentleman agree to take a walk in the country harry go with they as they walk across a common they see a great number of people move forward towards a bull-baiting instantly they be seize with a desire to see the diversion one obstacle alone present itself they parent particularly mr merton have make they promise to avoid every kind of danger however all except harry agree to go insist among themselves that there be no danger master harry say one have not say a word surely he will not tell of we harry say he do not wish to tell but if he add he be ask he would have to tell the truth a quarrel follow in which tommy strike he friend in the face with he fist this add to tommy 's recent conduct towards he cause the tear to start to harry 's eye whereupon the other assail he with cry of coward blackguard and so on master mash go further and slap he in the face harry though master mash 's inferior in size and strength return this by a punch and a fight ensue from which though severely punish himself harry emerge the victor to be assail with a chorus of congratulation from those who before be load he with taunt and outrage the young gentleman persist in they intention to see the bull-baiting harry follow at some distance decide not to quit he friend till he have once more see he in a place of safety as it happen the bull after dispose of he early tormentor break loose when three fierce dog be set upon it at once in the stampede little tommy fall right in the path of the infuriate animal and would have lose he life have not harry with a courage and presence of mind above he year suddenly seize a prong which one of the fugitive have drop and at the very moment when the bull be stop to gore he defenceless friend advance and wound it in the flank the bull turn and with redoubled rage make at he new assailant and it be probable that notwithstanding he intrepidity harry would have pay with he own life the price of he assistance to he friend have not a poor negro whom he have help earlier in the day come opportunely to he aid and by he promptitude and address secure the animal the gratitude of mr merton for he son 's escape be unbounded and even mr merton be ashamed of she disparage remark about harry as for tommy he go to he friend 's home to seek reconciliation reflect with shame and contempt upon the ridiculous prejudice he have once entertain he have now learn to consider all man as he brethren not forget the poor negro and that as he say it be much better to be useful than rich or fine \* \* \*

bear of a good family in the city of york where my father -- a foreigner of breman -- settle after have retire from business my father have give I a competent share of learning and design I for the law but i would be satisfy in nothing but go to sea my mind be fill with thought of see the world and nothing could persuade I to give up my desire at length on September 1 1651 i leave home and go on board a ship bind for london the ship be no sooner out of the humber than the wind begin to blow and the sea to rise in a most frightful manner and as i have never be at sea before i be most inexpressibly sick in body and terrify in mind the next day however the wind abate and for several day the weather continue calm my fear be forget and the current of my desire return i entirely forget the vow to return home that i make in my distress the sixth day of we be at sea we come into yarmouth road and cast anchor we trouble be not yet over however for a few day later the wind increase till it blow a terrible storm indeed i begin to see terror in the face even of the seaman themselves and as the captain pass I i could hear he softly to himself say several time we shall be all lose my horror of mind put I into such a condition that i can by no word describe it the storm increase and the seaman every now and then cry out the ship would founder one of the man cry out that we have spring a leak and all hand be call to the pump but the water increase in the hold it be apparent that the ship would founder we fire gun for help and a ship who have rid it out just ahead of we venture a boat out it be with the utmost hazard the boat come near we but at last we get all into it and get into shore though not without much difficulty and walk afterwards on foot to yarmouth have some money in my pocket i travel to london and there get acquaint with the master of a ship which trade on the coast of guinea this captain take a fancy to my conversation tell I if i would make a voyage with he i might do some trading on my own account i embrace the offer and go the voyage with he with the help of some of my relation i raise # 40 which i lay out in toy bead and such trifle as my friend the captain say be most in demand on the guinea coast it be a prosperous voyage it make I both a sailor and a merchant for my adventure yield I on my return to london almost # 300 and this fill I with those aspire thought which have since so complete my ruin i be now set up as a guinea trader and make up my mind to go the same voyage again in the same ship but this be the unhappiest voyage ever man make for as we be off the african shore we be surprise by a moorish rover of salee who give chase with all sail about three in the afternoon he come up with we and after a great fight we be force to yield and be carry all prisoner into the port of salee where we be sell as slave i be fortunate enough to fall into the hand of a master who treat I with no little kindness he frequently go fishing and as i be dexterous in catch fish he never go without I one day he send I out with a moor to catch fish for he then notion of deliverance dart into my thought and i prepare not for fishing but for a voyage when everything be ready we sail away to the fishing-grounds purposely catch nothing i say we have better go farther out the moor agree and i run the boat out near a league farther then i bring to as if i would fish instead of that however i step forward and stoop behind the moor take he by surprise and toss he overboard he rise to the surface and call on I to take he in for reply i present a gun at he and tell he if he come nearer the boat i would shoot he and that as the sea be calm he might easily swim ashore so he turn about and swam for the shore and i make no doubt but he reach it with ease about ten day afterwards as i be steer out to double a cape i come in sight of a portuguese ship on come nearer they hail I but i understand not a word at last a scotch sailor call to I and i answer i be a englishman and have make my escape from the moor of salee they then bid I come on board and very kindly take I in with all my goods we have a very good voyage to the brazil and when we reach we destination the captain recommend I to a honest man who have a sugar plantation here i settle down for a while and learn the planting of sugar then i take a piece of land and become a planter myself my affair prosper and have i continue in the station i be now in i have room for many happy thing to have yet befall I but i be still to be the agent of my own misery _ ii -- lord of a island and alone _ some of my neighbor hear that i have a knowledge of guinea trading propose to fit out a vessel and send she to the coast of guinea to purchase negro to work in we plantation i be well please with the idea and when they ask I to go to manage the trading part i forget all the peril and hardship of the sea and agree to go a ship be fit out we set sail on September 1 1659 we have very good weather for twelve day but after cross the line violent hurricane take we and drive we out of the way of all human commerce in this distress one morning there be a cry of land and almost at the same moment the ship strike against a sandbank we take to a boat and work towards the land but before we could reach it a rage wave come roll astern of we and overset the boat we be all throw into the sea and out of fifteen who be on board none escape but myself i manage somehow to scramble to shore and clamber up the cliff and sit I down on the grass half-dead night come on I i take up my lodging in a tree when i wake it be broad day the weather clear and the storm abate what surprise I most be that in the night the ship have be lift from the bank by the swell tide and drive ashore almost as far as the place where i have land i see that if we have all keep on board we have be all safe and i have not be so miserable as to be leave entirely destitute of all company as i now be i swam out to the ship and find that she stern lay lift up on the bank all the ship 's provision be dry and be well disposed to eat i fill my pocket and eat as i go about other thing for i have no time to lose we have several spare yard and plank and with these i make a raft i empty three of the seaman 's chest and let they down upon the raft and fill they with provision i also let down the carpenter 's chest and some arm and ammunition -- all of which after much labor i get safely to land my next work be to view the country where i be i yet know not but after i have with great labor get to the top of a hill which rise up very steep and high i see my fate to my great affliction -- _ viz _ that i be in a island uninhabited except by wild beast i now begin to consider that i might yet get a great many thing out of the ship which would be useful to I so every day at low water i go on board and bring away something or other until i have the biggest magazine that be ever lay up i believe for one man i verily believe have the calm weather hold i should have bring away the whole ship piece by piece but on the fourteenth day it blow a storm and next morning behold no more ship be to be see i must not forget that i bring on shore two cat and a dog he be a trusty servant to I many year i want nothing that he could fetch I nor any company i only want he to talk to I but that he could not do later i manage to catch a parrot which do much to cheer my loneliness i teach he to speak and it would have do you heart good to have hear the pity tone in which he use to say robin -- poor robin crusoe i now go in search of a place where to fix my dwelling i find a little plain on the side of a rise hill which be there as steep as a house-side so that nothing could come down on I from the top on the side of this rock be a hollow space like the entrance of a cave before which i resolve to pitch my tent before i set up my tent i draw a half-circle before the hollow place which extend backwards about twenty yard in this half-circle i plant two row of strong stake drive they into the ground like pile above five foot and a half high and sharpen at the top then i take some piece of cable i have find in the ship and lay they in row one upon another between the stake and this fence be so strong that neither man nor beast could get into it or over it the entrance i make to be by a short ladder to go over the top and when i be in i lift the ladder after I inside the fence with infinite labor i carry all my riches provision ammunition and store and i make I a large tent also to preserve I from the rain when i have do this i begin to work my way into the rock all the earth and stone i dig out i lay up within my fence and thus i make I a cave just behind my tent which serve I like a cellar in the middle of my labor it happen that rummage in my thing i find a little bag with but husk of corn and dust in it wish to make use of the bag i shake it out on one side of my fortification it be a little before the great rain that i throw this stuff away not remember that i have throw anything there about a month after i see some green stalk shoot up i be perfectly astonish when after a little longer time i see ten or twelve ear of barley i know not how it come there at last it occur to I that i have shake out the bag there besides the barley there be also a few stalk of rice i carefully save the ear of this corn you may be sure and resolve to sow they all again when my corn be ripe i use a cutlass as a scythe and cut off the ear and rub they out with my hand at the end of my harvesting i have nearly two bushel of rice and two bushel and a half of barley i keep all this for seed and bear the want of bread with patience i soon find that i need many thing to make I comfortable first i want a chair and a table for without they i must live like a savage so i set to work i have never handle a tool in my life but i have a saw a axe and several hatchet and i soon learn to use they all if i want a board i have to chop down a tree from the trunk of the tree i cut a log of the length my board be to be then i split the log and with infinite labor hew it flat till it be as thin as a board i make myself a table and a chair out of short piece of board and from the large board i make some wide shelf on these i lay my tool and other thing from time to time i make many useful thing from a piece of ironwood cut in the forest with great labor i make a spade to dig with then i want a pick-axe but for long i could not think how i be to get one at length i make use of crowbar from the wreck these i heat in the fire and little by little shaped they till i make a pick-axe proper enough though heavy at first i feel the need of basket in which to carry thing so i set to work as a basket-maker it come to my mind that the twig of the tree whence i cut my stake might serve i find they to my purpose as much as i could desire and during the next rainy season i employ myself in make a great many basket though i do not finish they handsomely yet i make they sufficiently serviceable i have however one want greater than all the other -- bread my barley be very fine the grain be large and smooth but before i could make bread i must grind the grain into flour i spend many a day to find out a stone to cut hollow and make fit for a mortar and could find none nor be the rock of the island of hardness sufficient so i give it over and round a great block of hard wood and with the help of fire and great labor make a hollow in it i make a great heavy pestle of the wood call ironwood the bake part be the next thing to be consider for first i have no yeast as to that there be no supply the want so i do not concern myself much about it but for a oven i be indeed in great pain at length i find out a experiment for that also i make some earthen vessel broad but not deep about two foot across and about nine inch deep these i burn in the fire till they be as hard as nail and as red as tile and when i want to bake i make a great fire upon a hearth which i pave with some square tile of my own making when the fire have all burn i draw the ember forward upon my hearth and let they be there till the hearth be very hot my loaf be ready i sweep the hearth and set they on the hottest part of it over each loaf i place one of the large earthen pot and draw the ember all round to keep in and add to the heat and thus i baked my barley loaf and become in a little time a good pastrycook into the bargain it need not be wonder at if all these thing take up most of the third year of my abode in the island i have now bring my state of life to be much easier than it be at first and i learn to look more upon the bright side of my condition and less on the dark have anyone in england meet such a man as i be it must have frighten they or raise great laughter on my head i wear a great high shapeless cap of goat 's skin stocking and shoe i have none but i have make a pair of something i scarce know what to call they to slip over my leg a jacket with the skirt come down to the middle of my thigh and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same complete my outfit i have a broad belt of goat 's skin and in this i hang on one side a saw on the other a hatchet under my arm hang two pouch for shot and powder at my back i carry my basket on my shoulder my gun and over my head a great clumsy goat 's skin umbrella a stoic would have smile to have see I at dinner there be my majesty prince and lord of the whole island how like a king i dine too all alone attend by my servant poll my parrot as if he have be my favorite be the only person permit to talk to I my old dog sit at my right hand and two cat on each side of the table expect a bit from my hand as a mark of special favor _ iii -- the footprint _ it be my custom to make daily excursion to some part of the island one day walk along the beach i be exceedingly surprise with the print of a man 's naked foot plainly impressed on the sand i stand like one thunderstruck i listen i look around but i could hear nothing nor see anything i go up to a rise ground to look further i walk backwards and forwards on the shore but i could see only that one impression i go to it again there be exactly a foot -- toe heel and every part of a foot how it come thither i know not but i hurry home look behind I at every two or three step and mistake every bush and tree fancy every stump to be a man i have no sleep that night but my terror gradually wear off and after some day i venture down to the beach to take measure of the footprint by my own i find it much larger this fill I again with all manner of fear and when i go home i begin to prepare against a attack i get out my musket load they and go to a enormous amount of labor and trouble -- all because i have see the print of a naked foot on the sand there seem to I then no labor too great no task too toilsome and i make I a second fortification and plant a vast number of stake on the outside of my outer wall which grow and become a thick grove of tree entirely conceal the place of my retreat and add greatly to my security i have now be twenty-two year on the island and have grow so accustomed to the place that have i feel myself secure from the attack by savage i fancied i could have be contented to remain there till i die of old age for many month the perturbation of my mind be very great in the day great trouble overwhelm I and in the night i dream often of kill savage about two year after i first know these fear i be surprised one morning by see five canoe on the shore i could not tell what to think of it so go and lay in my castle perplexed and discomfort at length become very impatient i clamber up to the top of the hill and perceive by the help of my perspective glass no less than thirty man dance round a fire with barbarous gesture while i be look two miserable wretch be drag from the boat one be immediately knock down while the other see himself a little at liberty start away from they and run along the sand directly towards I i be dreadfully frighten that i must acknowledge when i perceive he run my way especially when as i think i see he pursue by the whole body but my spirit begin to recover when i find that but three man follow he and that he outstrip they exceedingly in run presently he come to a creek and make nothing of it plunge in land and run on with exceed strength two of the pursuer swim the creek but the third go no farther and soon after go back again i immediately take my two gun run down the hill and clap myself in the way between the pursuer and the pursued hallooing aloud to he that flee then rush on the foremost of the pursuer i knock he down with the stock of my piece the other stop as if frightened but as i come nearer i perceive he be fitting a bow and arrow to shoot at I so i be then oblige to shoot at he first which i do and kill he the poor savage who flee be so frightened with the noise of my piece that he seem incline still to fly i give he all the sign of encouragement i could think of and he come nearer kneel down every ten or twelve step i take he up and make much of he and comfort he then beckon he to follow I i take he to my cave on the farther part of the island here have refresh he i make sign for he to lie down to sleep which the poor creature do after he have slumber about half a hour he come out of the cave run to I lay himself down and set my foot upon he head to let I know he would serve I so long as he live in a little time i begin to speak to he and teach he to speak to I and first i let he know he name should be Friday which be the day i save he life i likewise teach he to say master and then let he know that be to be my name i make a little tent for he and take in my ladder at night so that he could no way come at I but i need not this precaution for never man have a more faithful loving servant than Friday be to I i make it my business to teach he everything that be proper to make he useful especially to make he speak and he be the aptest scholar that ever be indeed this be the pleasantest year of all the life i lead in this place i begin now to have some use for my tongue again and besides the pleasure of talk to Friday i have a singular satisfaction in the fellow himself he simple unfeigned honesty appear to I more and more every day and i begin really to love the creature and i believe he love I more than it be possible for he ever to love anything before _ iv -- the end of captivity _ i be now enter on the seven-and-twentieth year of my captivity on the island one morning i bade Friday go to the seashore and see if he could find a turtle he have not be go long when he come run back like one that feel not the ground or the step he set he foot on and cry out to I o master o sorrow o bad what be the matter Friday say i o yonder there say he one two three canoe well say i do not be frightened however i see the poor fellow be most terribly scare for nothing run in he head but that the savage be come back to look for he and would cut he in piece and eat he i comfort he and tell he i be in as much danger as he then i go up the hill and find quickly by my glass that there be one-and-twenty savage whose business seem to be a triumphant banquet upon three human body i come down again to Friday and go towards the wretch send Friday a little ahead to see what they be do he come back and tell I that they be eat the flesh of one of they prisoner and that a bearded man lay bind whom he say they would kill next this fire the very soul within I and go to a little rise ground i turn to Friday and say now Friday do exactly as you see I do so with a musket i take aim at the savage Friday do the like and we fire kill three of they and wound five more they be in a dreadful consternation and after we fire again among the amaze wretch i make directly towards the poor victim who be lie upon the beach loose he i find he be a spaniard he take pistol and sword from I thankfully and fly upon he murderer and Friday pursue the fly wretch in the end but four of the twenty-one escape in a canoe i be mind to pursue they lest they should return with a greater force and devour we by mere multitude so run to a canoe i bade Friday follow I but be surprise to find another poor creature lie therein bind hand and foot i immediately cut he fastening and bid Friday tell he of he deliverance but when Friday come to hear he speak and to look in he face it would have move anyone to tear to have see how Friday kiss he embrace he hug he cry dance sing and then cry again it be a good while before i could make he tell I what be the matter but when he come a little to himself he tell I it be he father he sit down by the old man a long while and take he arm and ankle which be numb with the binding and chafe and rub they with he hand my island be now people and i think myself rich in subject the spaniard and the old savage have be with we about seven month share in we labor when be unable to keep means of deliverance out of my thought i give they leave to go over in one of the canoe to the mainland where some of the spaniard 's shipmate be cast away give they provision sufficient for themselves and all the spaniard for eight day it be no less than eight day i have wait for they return when Friday come to I and call aloud master master they be come i jump up and climb to the top of the hill and with my glass plainly make out a english ship and its long-boat standing in for the shore i can not express the joy i be in at see a ship and one that be man by my own countryman but yet i have some secret doubt bid I keep on my guard presently the boat be run upon the beach and in all eleven man land whereof three be unarmed and bind whom i could perceive use passionate gesture of entreaty and despair presently the seaman be all go straggling in the wood leave the three distressed man under a tree a little distance from I i resolve to discover myself to they and march with Friday towards they and call aloud in spanish what be ye gentleman they start up at the noise and i perceive they about to fly from I when i speak to they in english gentleman say i do not be surprise at I perhaps you may have a friend near when you do not expect it can you not put a stranger in the way to help you one of they look like one astonished return sir i be captain of that ship my man have mutiny against I and have set I on shore in this desolate place with these two man -- my mate and a passenger he then tell I that if two among the mutineer who be desperate villain be secure he believe the rest on shore would return to they duty he anticipate my proposal in venture they deliverance by tell I that both he and the ship if recover should be wholly direct by I in everything then i give they musket and the mutineer return the two villain be kill and the rest beg for mercy and join we more of they come ashore we fall upon they at night so that at the captain 's call they lay down they arm trust to the mercy of the governor of the island for such they suppose I to be it now occur to I that the time of my deliverance be come and that it would be easy to bring these fellow in to be hearty in get possession of the ship and so it prove for the ship be board next morning and the new rebel captain shoot the rest yield without any more life lose when i see my deliverance then put visibly into my hand i be ready to sink down with the surprise and it be a good while before i could speak a word to the captain who be in as great a ecstasy as i after some time i come dress in a new habit of the captain 's be still call governor be all meet and the captain with I i cause the prisoner to be bring before I tell they i have get a full account of they villainous behavior to the captain and ask of they what they have to say why i should not execute they as pirate i tell they i have resolve to quit the island but that they if they go could only go as prisoner in iron so that i could not tell what be the best for they unless they have a mind to take they fate in the island they seem thankful for this and say they would much rather venture to stay than be carry to england to be hang so i leave it on that issue when the captain be go i send for the man up to I in my apartment and let they into the story of my living there show they my fortification the way i make my bread plant my corn and in a word all that be necessary to make they easy i tell they the story also of the spaniard that be to be expect and make they promise to treat they in common with themselves i leave the next day and go on board the ship with Friday and thus i leave the island the 19th of December in the year 1686 after eight and twenty year and after a long voyage i arrive in england the 11th of June 1687

well as i could when we come to anchor on the coast of madagascar to repair some damage to the ship there happen a most desperate mutiny among the man upon account of a deficiency in they allowance and i be full of mischief in my head readily join though i be but a boy as they call I yet i prompt the mischief all i could and embark in it so openly that i escape very little be hang in the first and most early part of my life for the captain get wind of the plot bring two fellow to confess the particulars and presently no less than sixteen man be seize and put into iron whereof i be one the captain who be make desperate by he danger try we all and we be all condemn to die the gunner and purser be hang immediately and i expect it with the rest i do not remember any great concern i be under about it only that i cry very much for i know little then of this world and nothing at all of the next however the captain contented himself with execute these two and some of the rest upon they humble submission be pardon but five be order to be set on shore on the island and leave there of which i be one at we first come into the island we be terrify exceedingly with the sight of the barbarous people but when we come to converse with they awhile we find they be not cannibal as be report but they come and sit down by we and wonder much at we clothes and arm nor do we suffer any harm from they during we whole stay on the island before the ship sail twenty-three of the crew decide to join we and the captain not unwilling to lose they send we two barrel of powder and shot and lead as well as a great bag of bread be now a considerable number and in condition to defend ourselves the first thing we do be to give everyone he hand that we would not separate from one another but that we would live and die together that we would be in all thing guide by the majority that we would appoint a captain among we to be we leader and that we would obey he on pain of death _ ii -- a mad venture _ for two year we remain on the island of madagascar for at the beginning we have no vessel large enough to pass the ocean i never propose to speak in the general consultation but one day i tell the company that we best plan be to cruise along the coast in canoe and seize upon the first vessel we could get that be better than we own and so from that to another till perhaps we might at last get a good ship to carry we wherever we please to go excellent advice say one of they admirable advice say another yes yes say the third -lrb- which be a gunner -rrb- the english dog have give excellent advice but it be just the way to bring we all to the gallows to go a-thieving till from a little vessel we come to a great ship and so shall we turn downright pirate the end of which be to be hang you may call we pirate say another if you will and if we fall into bad hand we may be use like pirate but i care not for that i 'll be a pirate or anything rather than starve here and so they cry all let we have a canoe the gunner overrule by the rest submit but as we break up the council he come to I and very gravely my lad say he thou art bear to do a world of mischief thou hast commence pirate very young but have a care of the gallows young man have a care i say for thou wilt be a eminent thief i laugh at he and tell he i do not know what i might come to hereafter but as we case be now i should make no scruple to take the first ship i come at to get we liberty i only wish we could see one and come at she when we have make three canoe of some size we set out on as odd a voyage as ever man go we be a little fleet of three ship and a army of between twenty and thirty as dangerous fellow as ever live we be bind somewhere and nowhere for though we know what we intend to do we really do not know what we be do we cruise up and down the coast but no ship come in sight and at last with more courage than discretion more resolution than judgment we launch for the main coast of africa the voyage be much longer than we expect and when we be land upon the continent it seem the most desolate desert and inhospitable country in the world it be here that we take one of the rashest and wildest and most desperate resolution that ever be take by man this be to travel overland through the heart of the country from the coast of mozambique to the coast of angolum or guinea a continent of land of at least 1800 mile in which journey we have excessive heat to support impassable desert to go over no carriage camel or beast of any kind to carry we baggage innumerable wild and ravenous beast to encounter such as lion leopard tiger lizard and elephant we have nation of savage to encounter barbarous and brutish to the last degree hunger and thirst to struggle with and in one word terror enough to have daunt the stoutest heart that ever be place in case of flesh and blood yet fearless of all these we resolve to adventure and not only do we accomplish we journey but we come to a river where there be vast quantity of gold the hardship and difficulty of we march be much mitigate by a method which i propose and be find very convenient this be to quarrel with some of the negro native take they as prisoner and bind they as slave cause they to travel with we and make they carry we baggage accordingly we secure about sixty lusty young fellow as prisoner for the native stand in great awe of we because of we firearm and they not only serve we faithfully -- the more so as we treat they without harshness -- but be of great help in show we the way and in converse with the savage we afterwards meet when we reach the country where the gold be we at once agree in order that the good harmony and friendship of we company might be maintain that however much gold be get it should be bring into one common stock and equally divide at last the negro share with the rest this be do and at the end of we long journey we find each man 's share amount to many pound of gold we also get a cargo of elephant ' tooth we part at the gold coast from we black companion on the best of term then most of my comrade go off to the portuguese factory near gambium and i go to cape coast castle and get passage for england where i arrive in September _ iii -- quaker and pirate _ i have neither friend nor relation in england though it be my native country i have not a person to trust with what i have or to counsel I to secure or save it but fall into ill company and trust the keeper of a public-house in rotherhithe with a great part of my money all that great sum which i get with so much pain and hazard be go in little more than two year ' time -- spend in all kind of folly and wickedness then i begin to see it be time to think of further adventure and i next ship myself in a evil hour to be sure on a voyage to cadiz on the coast of spain i fall in with some master of mischief and among they one forwarder than the rest name harri who begin a intimate confidence with I so that we call one another brother this harri be afterwards capture by a english man-of-war and be lay in iron die of grief and anger when we be together he ask I if i have a mind for a adventure that might make amends for all past misfortune i tell he yes with all my heart for i do not care where i go have nothing to lose and no one to leave behind I he tell I then there be a brave fellow whose name be wilmot in another english ship which ride in the harbor who have resolve to mutiny the next morning and run away with the ship and that if we could get strength enough among we ship 's company we might do the same i like the proposal very well but we could not bring we part to perfection for there be but eleven in we ship who be in the conspiracy nor could we get any more that we could trust so that when wilmot begin he work and secure the ship and give the signal to we we all take a boat and go off to join he be well prepare for all manner of roguery without the least check of conscience i thus embark with this crew which at last bring I to consort with the most famous pirate of the age i that be a original thief and a pirate even by inclination before be now in my element and never undertake anything in my life with more particular satisfaction captain wilmot -- for so we now call he -- at once stand out for sea steering for the canary and thence onward to the west indy we ship have twenty-two gun and we obtain plenty of ammunition from the spaniard in exchange for bale of english cloth we cruise near two year in those sea of the west indy chiefly upon the spaniard -- not that we make any difficulty of take english ship or dutch or french if they come in we way but the reason why we meddle as little with english vessel as we could be first because if they be ship of any force we be sure of more resistance from they and secondly because we find the english ship have less booty when take for the spaniard generally have money on board and that be what we best know what to do with we increase we stock considerably in these two year have take 60000 piece of gold in one vessel and 100000 in another and be thus first grow rich we resolve to be strong too for we have take a brigantine a excellent sea-boat able to carry twelve gun and a large spanish frigate-built ship which afterwards by the help of good carpenter we fit up to carry twenty-eight gun we have also take two or three sloop from new england and new york laden with flour pea and barrel beef and pork go for jamaica and barbado and for more beef we go on shore on the island of cuba where we kill as many black cattle as we please though we have very little salt to cure they out of all the prize we take here we take they powder and bullet they small-arm and cutlass and as for they man we always take the surgeon and the carpenter as person who be of particular use to we upon many occasion nor be they always unwilling to go with we we have one very merry fellow here a quaker whose name be william walter whom we take out of a sloop bind from pennsylvanium to barbado he be a surgeon and they call he doctor and we make he go with we and take all he implement with he he be a comic fellow indeed a man of very good solid sense and a excellent surgeon but what be worth all very good-humoured and pleasant in he conversation and a bold stout brave fellow too as any we have among we i find william not very averse to go along with we and yet resolve to do it so that it might be apparent he be take away by force friend he say thou sayest i must go with thee and it be not in my power to resist thee if i would but i desire thou wilt oblige the master of the sloop to certify under he hand that i be take away by force and against my will so i draw up a certificate myself wherein i write that he be take away by main force as a prisoner by a pirate ship and this be sign by the master and all he man thou hast deal friendly by I say he when we have bring he aboard and i will be plain with thee whether i come willingly to thee or not but thou knowest it be not my business to meddle when thou art to fight no no say the captain but you may meddle a little when we share the money those thing be useful to furnish a surgeon 's chest say william and smile but i shall be moderate in short william be a most agreeable companion but he have the better of we in this part that if we be take we be sure to be hang and he be sure to escape but he be a sprightly fellow and fitter to be captain than any of we _ iv -- a respectable merchant _ we cruise the sea for many year and after a time william and i have a ship to ourselves with 400 man in authority under we as for captain wilmot we leave he with a large company at madagascar while we go on to the east indy at last we have get so rich for we trade in clove and spice to the merchant that william one day propose to I that we should give up the kind of life we have be lead we be then off the coast of persium most people say william leave off trade when they be satisfied of get and be rich enough for nobody trade for the sake of trading much less do man rob for the sake of thieve it be natural for man that be abroad to desire to come home again at last especially when they be grow rich and so rich as they would know not what to do with more if they have it well william say i but you have not explain what you mean by home why man i be at home here be my habitation i never have any other in my lifetime i be a kind of charity school-boy so that i can have no desire of go anywhere for be rich or poor for i have nowhere to go why say william look a little confused hast thou no relative or friend in england no acquaintance none that thou hast any kindness or any remains of respect for not i william say i no more than i have in the court of the great mogul yet i do not say i like this rove cruise life so well as never to give it over say anything to I i will take it kindly for i could see he be trouble and i begin to be move by he gravity there be something to be think of beyond this way of life say william why what be that say i except it be death it be repentance why say i do you ever know a pirate repent at this he be startle a little and return at the gallows i have know one and i hope thou wilt be the second he speak this very affectionately with a appearance of concern for I my proposal william go on be for thy good as well as my own we may put a end to this kind of life and repent look you william say i let I have you proposal for put a end to we present way of live first and you and i will talk of the other afterwards nay say william thou art in the right there we must never talk of repent while we continue pirate well say i william that be what i mean for if we must not reform as well as be sorry for what be do i have no notion what repentance mean : the nature of the thing seem to tell I that the first step we have to take be to break off this wretched course dost thou think it practicable for we to put a end to we unhappy way of living and get off yes say he i think it very practicable we be then anchor off the city of bassorah and one night william and i go ashore and send a note to the boatswain tell he we be betray and bid he make off with the ship by this mean we fright the rogue we comrade and we have nothing to do then but to consider how to convert we treasure into thing proper to make we look like merchant as we be now to be and not like freebooter as we really have be then we clothe ourselves like armenian merchant and after many day reach venice and at last we agree to go to london for william have a sister whom he be anxious to see once more so we come to england and some time later i marry william 's sister with whom i be much more happy than i deserve \* \* \* \* \* charle dickens barnaby rudge charle dickens son of a clerk in the navy pay office be bear at landport on February 7 1812 soon afterwards

the very next morning i be install as housekeeper and present with two bunch of key -- a large bunch for the housekeeping and a little bunch for the cellar i could not help tremble when i meet mr jarndyce for i know it be he who have do everything for I since my godmother 's death nonsense he say i hear of a good little orphan girl without a protector and i take it into my head to be that protector she grow up and more than justify my good opinion and i remain she guardian and she friend what be there in all this he soon begin to talk to I confidentially as if i have be in the habit of converse with he every morning for i do not know how long of course esther he say you do not understand this chancery business i shake my head i do not know who do he return the lawyer have twist it into such a state of bedevilment that the original merit of the case have long disappear its about a will and the trust under a will -- or it be once it be about nothing but cost now it be about a will when it be about anything a certain jarndyce in a evil hour make a great fortune and make a great will in the question how the trust under that will be to be administer the fortune leave by the will be squander away the legatee under the will be reduce to such a miserable condition that they would be sufficiently punish if they have commit a enormous crime in have money leave they and the will itself be make a dead letter all through the deplorable cause everybody must have copy over and over again of everything that have accumulate about it in the way of cartload of papers and must go down the middle and up again through such a infernal country-dance of cost and fee and nonsense and corruption as be never dream of in the wildest vision of a witch 's sabbath and we can not get out of the suit on any term for we be make party to it and _ must be _ party to it whether we like it or not but it will not do to think of it think of it drive my great-uncle poor tom jarndyce to blow he brain out i hope sir -- say i i think you have better call I guardian my dear i hope guardian say i give the housekeeping key the least shake in the world that you may not be trust too much to my discretion i be not clever and that be the truth you be clever enough to be the good little woman of we life here my dear he return playfully the little old woman of the rhyme who sweep the cobweb of the sky and you will sweep they out of _ we _ sky in the course of you housekeeping esther this be the beginning of my be call old woman and mother hubbard and dame durden and so many name of that sort that my own soon become quite lose one of the thing i notice from the first about my guardian be that though he be always do a thousand act of kindness he could not bear any acknowledgment we have somehow get to see more of miss flite on we visit to london : for the lord chancellor always have to be consult before richard could settle in any profession and as richard first want to be a doctor and then tire of that in favor of the army there be several consultation i remember one visit because it be the first time we meet mr woodcourt my guardian and ada and i hear of miss flite have be ill and when we call we find a medical gentleman attend she in she garret in lincoln 's inn miss flite drop a general curtsy honor indeed she say by another visit from the ward in jarndyce very happy to receive jarndyce of bleak house beneath my humble roof have she be very ill ask mr jarndyce in a whisper of the doctor oh decidedly unwell she answer confidentially not pain you know -- trouble only mr woodcourt know how much my physician mr woodcourt -- with great stateliness -- the ward in jarndyce jarndyce of bleak house the kindest physician in the college she whisper to I i expect a judgment on the day of judgment and shall then confer estate she will be as well in a day or two say mr woodcourt with a observant smile as she ever will be have you hear of she good fortune most extraordinary say miss flite every Saturday kenge and carboy place a paper of shilling in my hand always the same number one for every day in the week _ i _ think that the lord chancellor forwards they until the judgment i expect be give my guardian be contemplate miss flite 's bird and i have no need to look beyond he _ iii -- i be make happy _ i sometimes think that mr woodcourt love I and that if he have be richer he would perhaps have tell I that he love I before he go away i have think sometimes that if he have do so i should have be glad as it be he go to the east indy and later we read in the papers of a great shipwreck that allan woodcourt have work like a hero to save the drowning and succor the survivor i have be ill when my dear guardian ask I one day if i would care to read something he have write and i say yes there be estrangement at that time between richard and mr jarndyce for the unhappy boy have take it into he head that the case of jarndyce and jarndyce would yet be settle and would bring he fortune and this keep he from devote himself seriously to any profession of course he and my darling ada have fall in love and my guardian insist on they wait till richard be earn some income before any engagement could be recognize increase the estrangement i know to my distress that richard suspect my guardian of have a conflict claim in the horrible lawsuit and this make he think unjustly of mr jarndyce i read the letter it be so impressive in its love for I and in the unselfish caution it give I that my eye be too often blind to read much at a time but i read it through three time before i lay it down it ask I would i be the mistress of bleak house it be not a love-letter though it express so much love but be write just as he would at any time have speak to I i feel that to devote my life to he happiness be to thank he poorly for all he have do for I still i cry very much not only in the fulness of my heart after read the letter but as if something for which there be no name or distinct idea be lose to I i be very happy very thankful very hopeful but i cry very much on enter the breakfast-room next morning i find my guardian just as usual quite as frank as open as free i think he might speak to I about the letter but he never do at the end of a week i go to he and say rather hesitate and tremble guardian when would you like to have the answer to the letter when it be ready my dear he reply i think it be ready say i and i have bring it myself i put my two arm around he neck and kiss he and he say be this the mistress of bleak house and i say yes and it make no difference presently and i say nothing to my pet ada about it it be a few day after this when mr vhole the attorney whom richard employ to watch he interest call at bleak house and tell we that he client be very embarrassed financially and so thought of throw up he commission in the army to avert this i go down to deal and find richard alone in the barracks he be write at a table with a great confusion of clothes tin case book boot and brush strew all about the floor so worn and haggard he look even in the fulness of he handsome youth my mission be quite fruitless no dame durden two subject i forbid the first be john jarndyce the second you know what call it madness and i tell you i can not help it now and can not be sane but it be no such thing it be the one object i have to pursue he go on to tell I that it be impossible to remain a soldier that apart from debt and dun he take no interest in he employment and be not fit for it he show I papers to prove that he retirement be arrange know i have do no good by come down i prepare to return to london on the morrow there be some excitement in the town by reason of the

meet richard again too and promise on my ask he to befriend richard in london _ iv -- end of jarndyce and jarndyce _ richard always declare that it be ada he mean to see right no less than himself and he anxiety on that point so impressed mr woodcourt that he tell I about it it revive a fear i have have before that my dear girl 's little property might be absorb by mr vhole and that richard 's justification to himself would be this so i go up to london to see richard who now live in symond 's inn and my darling ada go with I he be pore over a table cover with dusty papers but he receive we very affectionately i notice as he pass he two hand over he head how sunken and how large he eye appear and how dry he lip be he speak of the case half-hopefully half-despondently either the suit must

in my breast and it be in danger of burst my salary be six or seven shilling a week -- i think it be six at first and seven afterwards -- and i have to support myself on that money all the week my breakfast be a penny loaf and a pennyworth of milk and i keep another small loaf and a modicum of cheese to make my supper on at night i be so young and childish and so little qualified to undertake the whole charge of my existence that often of a morning i could not resist the stale pastry put out for sale at half price at the pastry-cook ' door and spend on that the money i should have keep for my dinner on those day i either go without my dinner or buy a roll or a slice of pudding i be such a child and so little that frequently when i go into the bar of a strange public-house for a glass of ale or porter to moisten what i have for dinner they be afraid to give it I i know i do not exaggerate the scantiness of my resource or the difficulty of my life i know that if a shilling be give I at any time i spend it in a dinner or a tea i know that i work from morning until night a shabby child and that i lounge about the street insufficiently and unsatisfactorily feed i know that but for the

youth of fifteen but look much older whose hair be crop as close as the closest stubble who have hardly any eyebrow and no eyelash and eye of a red-brown he be high-shouldered and bony dress in decent black with a white wisp of a neck-cloth button up to the throat and have a long lank skeleton hand heep be mr wickfield 's clerk and i often see he of a evening in the little round office reading and from time to time stray in to talk to he he tell I one night he be not do office work but be improve he legal knowledge i suppose you be quite a great lawyer i say after look at he for some time I master copperfield say uriah oh no i be a very ` umble person i be well aware that i be the ` umblest person go let the other be where he may my mother be likewise a very ` umble person we live in a ` umble abode master copperfield but have much to be thankful for my father 's former calling be ` umble he be a sexton what be he now i ask he be a partaker of glory at present master copperfield say uriah heep but we have much to be thankful for how much have i to be thankful for in live with mr wickfield i ask uriah if he have be with mr wickfield long i have be with he go on four year master copperfield say uriah since a year after my father 's death how much i have to be thankful for in that how much have i to be thankful for in mr wickfield 's kind intention to give I my article which would otherwise not lay within the ` umble means of mother and self perhaps when you be a regular lawyer you 'll be a partner in mr wickfield 's business one of these day i say to make myself agreeable and it will be wickfield and heep or heep late wickfield oh no master copperfield return uriah shake he head i be much too ` umble for that it must have be five or six year later when i be in london that uriah recall my prophecy to I agne have notice as i have notice long before this a gradual alteration in mr wickfield he sit longer and longer over he wine and it be at such time when he hand tremble and he speech be not plain that uriah be most certain to want he on some business so it come about that agne have to tell I that uriah have make himself indispensable to she father he be subtle and watchful she say he have master papa 's weakness foster they and take advantage of they until papa be afraid of he if i be indignant to hear that uriah have worm himself into such promotion i restrain my feeling when we meet for agne have bid I not to repel he for she father 's sake and for she own what a prophet you have show yourself master copperfield say uriah remind I of my early word you may not recollect it but when a person be ` umble a person treasure such thing up but the ` umblest person master copperfield may be instrument of good i be glad to think i have be the instrument of good to mr wickfield and that i may be more so oh what a worthy man he be but how imprudent he have be when the rascal go on to tell I confidentially that he love the ground he agne walk on and that he think she might come to be kind to he know he usefulness to she father i have a delirious idea of seize the red-hot poker out of the fire and run he through with it however i thought of agne and could say nothing in the end all the evil machination of uriah heep be frustrate by my old friend mr micawber who visit canterbury on the chance of something suitable turn up and meeting I in heep 's company be subsequently engage by heep as a clerk at twenty-two and sixpence per week it be only after micawber have find that uriah heep have forge mr wickfield 's name to various document and have fraudulently speculate with money entrust by my aunt amongst other to he partner that he turn upon he and denounce he and accomplish what he call the final pulverisation of keep mr micawber be once more in pecuniary shackle my aunt so grateful as we all be for the service he have render suggest emigration to australia to he he at once respond to the idea the climate i believe be healthy say mr micawber then the question arise : now _ be _ the circumstance of the country such that a man of mr micawber 's ability would have a fair chance of rise -- i will not say at present to be governor or anything of that sort but would there be a reasonable opening for he talent to develop themselves if so it be evident to I that australium be the legitimate sphere of action for mr micawber i entertain the conviction say mr micawber that it be under exist circumstance the land the only land for myself and family and that something of a extraordinary nature will turn up on that shore but the defeat of heep and micawber 's departure belong to the day of my manhood let I look back at intervene year _ v -- i achieve manhood _ my school-day the silent glide on of my existence -- the unseen unfelt progress of my life -- from childhood up to youth time have steal on unobserved and _ i _ be the head boy now in the school and look down on the line of boy below I with

the last number be issue in April 1848 its success be striking and immediate the sale of its first number exceed that of martin chuzzlewit by more than 12000 copy -- a remarkable thing consider the immense superiority of chuzzlewit dombey and son indeed be by no means one of dickens 's best book though little paul will always retain the sympathy of the reader and the story of he short life for ever move we with its pathos the popularity of dombey and son provoke a impudent publication call dombey and daughter which be start in January 1847 and be issue monthly at a penny two stage version of dombey appear -- in london in 1873 and in new york in 1888 but in neither case be the adaptation particularly successful what be the wild wave say be make the subject of a song -- a duet -- which at one time be widely sing but be now happily forget _ i -- dombey and son _ dombey sit in the corner of the darkened room in the great armchair by the bedside and son lay tuck up warm in a little basket-bedstead dombey be about eight-and-forty year of age son about eight-and-forty minute dombey be rather bald rather red and though a handsome well-made man too stern and pompous in appearance to be prepossessing son be very bald and very red and somewhat crushed and spotted in he general effect as yet the house will once again mr dombey say mr dombey be not only in name but in fact dombey and son dombey and son he will be christen paul mr dombey of course the sick lady feebly echo of course and close she eye again he father 's name mr dombey and he grandfather 's i wish he grandfather be alive this day and again he say dombey and son in exactly the same tone as before and then go downstairs to learn what that fashionable physician dr parker pep have to say for mr dombey lay very weak and still dombey and son -- those three word convey the idea of mr dombey 's life the earth be make for dombey and son to trade in and the sun and moon be make to give they light he have rise as he father have before he in the course of life and death from son to dombey and for nearly twenty year have be the sole representative of the firm of those year he have be marry ten -- marry as some say to a lady with no heart to give he but such idle talk never reach the ear of mr dombey dombey and son often deal in hide never in heart mr dombey would have reason that a matrimonial alliance with himself _ must _ in the nature of thing be gratifying and honorable to any woman of commonsense one drawback only could be admit until the present day there have be no issue -- to speak of there have be a girl some six year before a child who now crouch by she mother 's bed unobserved but what be that girl to dombey and son nature must be call upon to make a vigorous effort in this instance say doctor parker pep refer to mr dombey mr chick mr dombey 's married sister emphasise this opinion now my dear paul say mr chick you may rest assure that there be nothing want but a effort on fanny 's part they return to the sick-room and its stillness in vain mr chick exhort she sister-in-law to make a effort no sound come in answer but the loud ticking of mr dombey 's watch and dr parker pep 's watch which seem in the silence to be run a race fanny say mr chick only look at I only open you eye to show I that you hear and understand I still no answer mr dombey lay motionless clasp she little daughter to she breast mamma cry the child sob aloud oh dear mamma thus cling fast to that slight spar within she arm the mother drift out upon the dark and unknown sea that roll round all the world mr dombey in the day to come could not forget that close scene -- that he have have no part in it that he have stand a mere spectator while those two figure lay clasp in each other 's arm he previous feeling of indifference towards he little daughter florence change into a uneasiness of a extraordinary kind he have never conceive a aversion to she it have not be worth he while or in he humor but now he be ill at ease about she he read nothing in she glance when he see she later in the solemn house of the passionate desire to run cling to he and the dread of a repulse the pitiable need in which she stand of some assurance and encouragement he see nothing of this _ ii -- mr pipchin 's _ in spite of he early promise all the vigilance and care bestow upon he could not make little paul a thrive boy there be something wan and wistful in he look and he have a strange old-fashioned thoughtful way of sit brooding in he miniature armchair the medical practitioner recommend sea-air and mrs pipchin who conduct a infantile board house of a very select description at brighton and whose scale of charge be high be entrust with the care of paul 's health when he be little more than five year old mr pipchin be a marvellous ill-favoured ill-conditioned old lady with a mottled face like bad marble a hook nose and a hard gray eye it be generally say that mr pipchin be a woman of system with child and no doubt she be certainly the wild one go home tame enough after sojourn for a few month beneath she hospitable roof at this exemplary old lady paul would sit stare in he little armchair by the fire for any length of time he be not fond of she he be not afraid of she once she ask he when they be alone what he be think about you say paul without the least reserve i be think how old you must be you must not say such thing as that young gentleman return the dame why not ask paul because it be not polite say mr pipchin snappishly not polite say paul no and remember the story of the little boy that be gore to death by a mad bull for ask question if the bull be mad say paul how do _ he _ know that the boy have ask question nobody can go and whisper secret to a mad bull i do not believe that story you do not believe it sir no say paul not if it should happen to have be a tame bull you little infidel say mr pipchin as paul have not consider the subject in that light he allow himself to be put down for the present mr dombey come down to brighton every Sunday and florence be she brother 's constant companion at first paul get no stronger and a little carriage be procure for he in which he could lie at he ease and be wheel down to the sea-side there he would sit or lie for hour together never so distressed as by the company of child -- florence alone except always go away if you please he would say to any child who come up to he thank you but i do not want you i think you have better go and play if you please he favorite spot be quite a lonely one far away from most lounger and with florence sit by he side and the wind blow on he face and the water near the wheel of he bed he want nothing more i want to know what it say he say once look steadily in she face the sea floy what be it that it keep on say she tell he that it be only the noise of the rolling wave yes yes he say but i know that they be always say something always the same thing what place be over there he rise up look eagerly at the horizon she tell he that there be another country opposite but he say he do not mean that he mean farther away -- farther away very often afterwards in the midst of they talk he would break off to try to understand what it be that the wave be always say and would rise up on he couch to look at that invisible region far away at the end of twelve month at mr pipchin 's paul have grow strong enough to dispense with he little carriage though he still look thin and delicate mr dombey therefore decide to remove he not from brighton but to doctor blimber 's educational establishment i fear say mr dombey address mr pipchin that my son in he study be behind many child of he age now instead of be behind he peer my son ought to be before they -- far before they there be a eminence ready for he to mount upon the education of my son must not be delay it must not be leave imperfect doctor blimber only undertake the charge of ten young gentleman and he establishment be a great hot-house in which there be a force apparatus incessantly at work florence would remain at mr pipchin 's and for the first six month paul would return there for the Sunday now paul say mr dombey exultingly when they stand on the doctor 's doorstep this be the way indeed to be dombey and son and have money you be almost a man already almost return the child _ iii -- doctor blimber 's academy _ the doctor be a portly gentleman in a suit of black with string at he knee and stocking below they he have a bald head highly polish a deep voice and a chin so very double that it be a wonder how he ever manage to shave into the crease mr blimber be not learn herself but she pretend to be and that do quite as well as to miss blimber there be no light nonsense about she she be dry and sandy with work in the grave of dead language mr feeder ba dr blimber 's assistant be a kind of human barrel - organ with a list of tune at which he be continually work over and over again without any variation under the force system at dr blimber 's a young gentleman usually take leave of he spirit in three week he have all the care of the world on he head in three month and he conceive bitter sentiment against he parent or guardian in four the doctor be sit in he study when mr dombey and paul arrive and how do you do sir he say to mr dombey and how be my little friend it seem to paul as if the great clock in the hall take this up and go on say how be my lit-tle friend how be my lit-tle friend over and over again paul be hand over to miss blimber at once to be bring on cornelium say the doctor dombey will be you charge at first bring he on cornelium bring he on it be hard work for no sooner have paul master subject a than he be immediately provide with subject b from which we pass to c and even d often he feel giddy and confused and drowsy and dull but there be always the saturday when florence come at noon to fetch he and never would she in any weather stay away florence bring the school-book he be study and every Saturday night would patiently assist he through so much as they could anticipate together of he next week 's work and this save he possibly from sink underneath the burden which the fair cornelium blimber pile upon he back it be not that miss blimber mean to be too hard upon he or that dr blimber mean to bear too heavily on the young gentleman in general but when dr blimber say that paul make great progress and be naturally clever mr dombey be more bent than ever on he be force and cram such spirit as he have at the outset paul soon lose of course but he retain all that be strange and odd and thoughtful in he character and mr blimber think he odd and whisper that he be old fashion and that be all between little paul dombey the youngest and mr toot the oldest of dr blimber 's young gentleman a strong attachment exist toot have go through so much that he have leave off grow and be free to pursue he own course of study which be chiefly to write long letter to himself from person of distinction address p toot esquire brighton to preserve they in he desk with great care how be you toot would say to paul fifty time a day quite well sir thank you paul would answer shake hand would be toot 's next advance which paul of course would immediately do i say cry toot one evening finding paul look out of the window i say what do you think about oh i think about a great many thing reply paul do you though say toot appear to consider that fact in itself surprising if you have to die say paul do not you think you would rather die on a moonlight night when the sky be quite clear and the wind blow as it do last night mr toot look doubtfully at paul say he do not know about that it be a beautiful night say paul there be a boat over there in the full light of the moon a boat with a sail mr toot feel call upon to say something suggest smuggler and then add or preventive a boat with a sail repeat paul it go away into the distance and what do you think it seem to do as it move with the wave pitch say mr toot it seem to beckon say the child to beckon I to come certainly people find he a old-fashioned child at the end of the term dr and mr blimber give a early party to they pupil and they parent and guardian and it be a day or two before this event when paul be take ill this illness release he from he book and make he think the more of florence they all love dombey 's sister at that party and paul sit in a cushion corner hear she praise constantly there be a half-intelligible sentiment too diffuse around refer to florence and himself and breathing sympathy for both that soothed and touch he he do not know why but it seem to have something to do with he old-fashioned reputation the time arrive for take leave good-bye doctor blimber say paul stretch out he hand good-bye my little friend return the doctor dombey dombey you have always be my favorite pupil god bless you say cornelium take both paul 's hand in hers and it show paul think how easily one might do injustice to a person for miss blimber mean it -- though she _ be _ a forcer -- and feel it there be a general move after paul and florence down the staircase in which the whole blimber family be include such a circumstance mr feeder say aloud as have never happen in the case of any former young gentleman within he experience the servant with the butler -- a stern man -- at they head have all a interest in see little dombey go while the young gentleman press to shake hand with he cry individually dombey do not forget I once for a last look paul turn and gaze upon the face address to he and from that time whenever he think of dr blimber 's it come back as he have see it in this last view and it never seem to be a real place but always a dream full of face _ iv -- paul go out with the stream _ from the night they bring he home from dr blimber 's paul have never rise from he little bed he lay there listen to the noise in the street quite tranquilly not care much how the time go but watch it and watch everywhere about he with observe eye when the sunbeam strike into he room through the rustling blind and quiver on the opposite wall like golden water he know that evening be come on by little and little he get tire of the bustle of the day the noise of the carriage and cart and people pass and repass and would fall asleep or be trouble with a restless and uneasy sense of a rush river why will it never stop floy he would sometimes ask she it be bear I away i think but floy could always soothe he he be visit by as many as three grave doctor and the room be so quiet and paul be so observant of they that he even know the difference in the sound of they watch but he interest centre in sir parker pep for paul have hear they say long ago that that gentleman have be with he mamma when she clasp florence in she arm and die and he could not forget it now he like he for it he be not afraid the people in the room be always change and in the night-time paul begin to wonder languidly who the figure be with its head upon its hand that return so often and remain so long floy he say what be that -- there at the bottom of the bed there be nothing there except papa the figure lift up its head and rise and say my own boy do not you know I paul look it in the face and thought be that he father the next time he observe the figure at the bottom of the bed he call to it do not be sorry for I dear papa indeed i be quite happy that be the beginning of he always say in the morning that he be a great deal better and that they be to tell he father so how many time the golden water dance upon the wall how many night the dark dark river roll towards the sea paul never count never seek to know one night he have be think of he mother and she picture in the drawing-room downstair floy do i ever see mamma no darling the river be run very fast now and confuse he mind paul fall asleep and when he awake the sun be high floy come close to I and let I see you sister and brother wind they arm around each other and the golden light come streaming in and fall upon they lock together how fast the river run between its green bank and the rush floy but it be very near the sea i hear the wave they always say so presently he tell she that the motion of the boat upon the stream be lull he to rest now the boat be out at sea but glide smoothly on and now there be a shore before he who stand on the bank he put he hand together as he have be use to do at he prayer he do not remove he arm to do it but they see he fold they so behind she neck mamma be like you floy i know she by the face the light about she head be shine on I as i go the golden ripple on the wall come back again and nothing else stir in the room the old old fashion the fashion that come in with we first parent and will last unchanged until we race have run its course and the wide firmament be roll up like a scroll the old old fashion -- death _ v -- the end of dombey and son _ the stonemason to whom mr dombey give he order for a tablet in the church in memory of little paul call he attention to the inscription beloved and only child and say it should be ` son ' i think sir you be right of course make the correction and there come a time when it be to florence and florence only that mr dombey turn for the great house of dombey and son fall

for the stain of he domestic shame there be no purification in he pride -- for he be proud yet -- he let the world go from he freely as it fall away he shake it off he know now what it be to be reject and desert dombey and son be no more -- he child no more he daughter florence have marry -- marry a young sailor once a boy in the office of dombey and son -- and thinking of she dombey in the solitude of he dismantle home remember that she have never change to he through all those year and the mist through which he have see she clear and show he she true self he wander through the room and thought of suicide a guilty hand be grasp what be in he breast it be arrest by a cry -- a wild loud loving rapturous cry and he see he daughter papa dearest papa unchanged still of all the world

the ruin place and as the morning mist have rise long ago when i first leave the forge so the evening mist be rise now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they show to I i see no shadow of another parting from she \* \* \* \* \* hard time hard time be not one of the longest but it be one of the most powerful of dickens 's work john ruskin go so far as to call it in several respects the greatest book dickens have write it be of course a fierce attack on the early victorian school of political economist the bounderby and gradgrind be typical of certain character and though they change they form of speech be still recognisable to-day as a study of social and industrial life in england in the manufacturing district fifty year ago hard time will always be valuable though allowance must be make here as elsewhere for the novelist 's tendency to exaggeration -- exaggeration of virtue no less than of vice or weakness in josiah bounderby and stephen blackpool this characteristic be pronounced the first accord to john ruskin be a dramatic monster and the second a dramatic perfection the story first appear serially in household word between April 1 and August 12 1854 _ i -- mr thoma gradgrind _ thoma gradgrind sir a man of fact and calculation with a rule and a pair of scale and the multiplication table always in he pocket sir ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature and tell you exactly what it come to in such term mr gradgrind always mentally introduce himself whether to he private circle of acquaintance or to the public in general in such term thoma gradgrind present himself to the schoolmaster and child before he it be he school and he intend it to be a model now what i want be fact teach these boy and girl nothing but fact fact alone be want in life you can only form the mind of reasoning animal upon fact this be the principle on which i bring up my own child and this be the principle on which i bring up these child stick to fact sir mr gradgrind have wait to hear a model lesson deliver by the school master walk home in a considerable state of satisfaction there be five young gradgrind and they be model every one they have be lecture at from they tenderest year course like little hare almost as soon as they could run they have be make to run to the lecture-room to he matter-of-fact home which be call stone lodge mr gradgrind direct he step the house be situate on a moor within a mile or two of a great town call coketown on the outskirts of this town a travel circus -lrb- sleary 's horse-riding -rrb- have pitch its tent and to he amazement mr gradgrind observe he two eldest child try to obtain a peep at the back of the booth of the hidden glory within mr gradgrind lay he hand upon the shoulder of each err child and say louisa thoma i want to see what it be like say louisa shortly i bring he i be tired father i have be tire a long time tired of what ask the astonished father i do not know of what -- of everything i think they walk on in silence for some half a mile before mr gradgrind gravely break out with what would you best friend say louisa what would mr bounderby say all the way to stone lodge he repeat at interval what would mr bounderby say at the first mention of the name he daughter a child of fifteen or sixteen now but at no distant day to become a woman all at once steal a look at he remarkable for its intense and search character he see nothing of it for before he look at she she have again cast down she eye mr bounderby be at stone lodge when they arrive he stand before the fire on the hearth rug deliver some observation to mr gradgrind on the circumstance of its be he birthday it be a commanding position from which to subdue mr gradgrind he stop in he harangue which be entirely concern with the story of he early disadvantage at the entrance of he eminently practical friend and the two young culprit well bluster mr bounderby what be the matter what be young thoma in the dump about he speak of young thoma but he look at louisa we be peep at the circus mutter louisa haughtily and father catch we and mr gradgrind say she husband in a lofty manner i should as soon have expect

you instead of circus i be sure you have enough to do if that be what you want with my head in its present state i could not remember the mere name of half the fact you have get to attend to that be the reason pout louisa do not tell I that be the reason because it can be nothing of the sort say mrs gradgrind go and be something logical directly mr gradgrind not be a scientific character usually dismiss she child to they study with the general injunction that they be to choose they own pursuit _ ii -- mr bounderby of coketown _ mr josiah bounderby be as near be mr gradgrind 's bosom friend as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can be to another man perfectly devoid of sentiment he be a rich man -- banker merchant manufacturer and what not a big loud man with a stare and a metallic laugh a man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself -- a self-made man a man who be always proclaim through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of he he early ignorance and poverty a man who be the bully of humility he be fond of tell be mr bounderby how he be bear in a ditch and abandon by he mother how he run away from he grandmother who starve and ill-use he and so become a vagabond i pull through it he would say though nobody throw I out a rope vagabond errand-boy labourer porter clerk chief manager small partner -- josiah bounderby of coketown this myth of he early life be dissipate later and it turn out that he mother a respectable old woman whom bounderby pension off with thirty pound a year on condition she never come near he have pinch herself to help he out in life and put

in round number fifty there be some disparity in you respective year but in you means and position there be none on the contrary there be a great suitability confine yourself rigidly to fact the question of fact be : ` do mr bounderby ask I to marry he ' ` yes he do ' and ` shall i marry he ' shall i marry he repeat louisa with great deliberation there be silence between the two before louisa

most thing and find they a bear be send down to coketown to study the neighborhood with a view to enter parliament mr bounderby at once pounce upon he and jame harthouse be introduce to mr bounderby and she brother tom gradgrind junior bring up under a continuous system of restraint be a hypocrite a thief and to mr jame harthouse a whelp yet the visitor see at once that the whelp be the only creature mr bounderby care for and it occur to he as time go on that to win mr bounderby 's affection -lrb- for he make no secret of he contempt for politics -rrb- he must devote himself to the whelp mr bounderby be proud to have mr jame harthouse under he roof proud to show off he greatness and self-importance to this gentleman from london you be a gentleman and i do not pretend to be one you be a man of family i be a bit of dirty riff-raff and a genuine scrap of rag tag and bobtail say mr bounderby at the same time mr bounderby bluster at he wife and bully he hand so that mr harthouse might understand he independence one of these hand stephen blackpool a old steady faithful workman who have be boycott by he fellow for refuse to join a trade union be summon to mr bounderby 's presence in order that harthouse might see a specimen of the people that have to be deal with blackpool say he have nought to say about the trade union business he have give a promise not to join that be all not to I you know say bounderby oh no sir not to you here be a gentleman from london present mr bounderby say point at harthouse a parliament gentleman now what do you complain of i ha ' not come here sir to complain i be send for indeed we be in a muddle sir look round town -- so rich as ` tis look how we live and where we live a ' in what number and look how the mill be always a-goin ' and how they never work we no nigher to any distant object ` cepting always death sir i can not wi ' my little learning tell the gentleman what will better this though some work man o ' this town could but the strong hand will never do ' t nor yet lettin ' alone will never do ' t ratin ' we as so much power and reg ` latin ' we as if we be figure in a sum will never do ' t now it be clear to I say mr bounderby that you be one of those chap who have always get a grievance and you be such a raspish ill-conditioned chap that even you own union -- the man who know you best -- will have nothing to do with you and i tell you what i go so far along with they for a novelty that i 'll have nothing to do with you either you can finish off what you be at and then go elsewhere thus jame harthouse learn how mr bounderby deal with hand mr harthouse however only feel bored and take the earliest opportunity to explain to mr bounderby that he really have no opinion and that he be go in for she father 's opinion because he might as well back they as anything else the side that can prove anything in a line of unit ten hundred and thousand mr bounderby seem to I to afford the most fun and to give a man the best chance i be quite ready to go in for it to the same extent as if i believe it and what more could i possibly do if i do believe it you be a singular politician say louisa pardon I i have not even that merit we be the largest party in the state i assure you if we all fall out of we adopt rank and be review together the more mr harthouse 's interest wane in politics the greater become he interest in mr bounderby and he cultivate the whelp cultivate he earnestly and by so do learn from the graceless youth that loo never care anything for old bounderby and have marry he to please she brother gradually bit by bit jame harthouse establish a confidence with the whelp 's sister from which she husband be exclude he establish a confidence with she that absolutely turn upon she indifference towards she husband and the absence at all time of any congeniality between they he have artfully but plainly assure she that he know she heart in its last most delicate recess and the barrier behind which she live have melt away and yet he have not even now any earnest wickedness of purpose in he so drift iceberg set with a current wreck the ship _ iv -- mr gradgrind and he daughter _ mr gradgrind die while she husband be up in london and louisa be with she mother when death come you learn a great deal louisa and so do you brother say mr gradgrind when she be die ology

in life that the object he have lately pursue turn worthless beside she the success that be almost within he grasp he fling away from he like the dirt it be compare with she all this and more he say and plead for a further meeting not here louisa say calmly they part at the beginning of a heavy shower of rain and the fall jame harthouse have ride for be avert mr bounderby leave she husband 's house leave it for good not to share mr harthouse 's life but to return to she father mr gradgrind release from parliament for a time be alone in he study when he eldest daughter enter what be the matter louisa father i want to speak to you you have train I from my cradle yes louisa i curse the hour in which i be bear to such a destiny how could you give I life and take from I all the thing that raise it from the state of conscious death now hear what i have come to say with a hunger and a thirst upon I father which have never be for a moment appease in a condition where it seem nothing

know and he know that i never do i be not wholly indifferent for i have a hope of be pleasant and useful to tom but tom have be the subject of all the little tenderness of my life perhaps he become so because i know so well how to pity he it matter little now except as it may dispose you to think more leniently of he error what can i do child ask I what you will i be come to it father chance have throw into my way a new acquaintance a man such as i have have no experience of -- light polished easy i only wonder it should be worth he while who care for nothing else to care so much for I it

and it come to thoma gradgrind that night and on the morrow when he sit beside he daughter 's bed that there be a wisdom of the heart no less than a wisdom of the head and that in suppose the latter to be all sufficient he have err but no such change of mind take place in mr bounderby find he wife absent he go at once to stone lodge and bluster in he usual way mr gradgrind try to make he understand that the best thing to do be to leave thing as they be for a time and that louisa who have be so try should stay on a visit to she father and be treat with tenderness and consideration it be all waste on blunderby now i do not want to quarrel with you tom gradgrind he retort if you daughter whom i make loo bounderby and might have do better by leave loo gradgrind do not come home at

will be this : i be josiah bounderby she be the daughter of tom gradgrind and the two horse would not pull together i be pretty well know to be rather a uncommon man and most people will understand that it must be a woman rather out of the common who would come up to my mark i have get no more to say good-night at five minute past twelve next day mr bounderby direct he wife 's property to be carefully pack up and send to tom gradgrind 's and then resume a bachelor 's life mr jame harthouse learning from louisa 's maid -- a young woman greatly attach to she mistress -- that he attention be altogether undesirable and that he would never see mr bounderby again decide to throw up politics and leave coketown at once which he do into how much of futurity do mr bounderby see as he sit alone have he any prescience of the day five year to come when josiah bounderby of coketown be to die in a fit in the coketown street could he foresee mr gradgrind a white-haired man make he fact and figure subservient to faith hope and charity and no longer try to grind that heavenly trio in he dusty little mill these thing be to be could louisa sit alone in she father 's house and gaze into the fire foresee the childless year before she could she picture a lonely brother fly from england after robbery and die in a strange land conscious of he want of love and penitent these thing be to be herself

pecuniarily the least successful of dickens 's serial though popular as a book it be he first novel after he american tour and the storm of resentment that have hail the appearance of american note in 1842 be intensify by he merciless satire of american characteristic and institution in martin chuzzlewit despite all adverse criticism however chuzzlewit be worthy to rank with anything that ever come from the pen of the great victorian novelist it be a very long story and a very full one the canvas be crowd with a gallery of typical dickensian people through mr gamp dickens deal a death-blow to the drunken nurse of the period the name pecksniff have become synonymous with a certain type of hypocrite and the adjective pecksniffian be in common use wherever the english language be speak charge with exaggeration regard mr pecksniff dickens write in the preface to martin chuzzlewit all the pecksniff family upon earth be quite agree i believe that no such character ever exist i will not offer any plea on he behalf to so powerful and genteel a body mr gamp though one of the humorous type that have perhaps contribute most largely to the fame of dickens do not appear in this epitome the character be a minor one in the development of the story _ i -- mr pecksniff 's new pupil _ mr pecksniff live in a little wiltshire village within a easy journey of salisbury the brazen plate upon he door bear the inscription pecksniff architect to which mr pecksniff on he card of business add and land surveyor of he architectural doings nothing be clearly know except that he have never design or build anything mr pecksniff 's professional engagement indeed be almost if not entirely confine to the reception of pupil he genius lay in ensnare parent and guardian and pocket premium mr pecksniff be a moral man perhaps there never be a more moral man than mr pecksniff especially in he conversation and correspondence some people liken he to a direction-post which be always tell the way to a place and never go there but these be he enemy into mr pecksniff 's house come young martin chuzzlewit a relation of the architect 's tom pinch mr pecksniff 's assistant have drive over to salisbury for the new pupil and have already discourse to martin on mr pecksniff and he family -lrb- for mr pecksniff have two daughter -- mercy and charity -rrb- in whose good quality he have a profound and pathetic belief festive preparation on a rather extensive scale be already complete for martin 's benefit on the night of he arrival there be two bottle of currant wine white and red a dish of sandwich very long and very slim another of apple another of captain 's biscuit a plate of orange cut up small and gritty with powdered sugar and a highly geological home-made cake the magnitude of these preparation quite take away tom pinch 's breath for though the new pupil be usually let down softly particularly in the wine department still this be a banquet a sort of lord mayor 's feast in private life a something to think of and hold on by afterwards to this entertainment mr pecksniff beseech the company to do full justice martin he say address he daughter will seat himself between you two my dear and mr pinch will come by I this be a mingle that repay one for much disappointment and vexation let we be merry here he take a captain 's biscuit it be a poor heart that never rejoice and we heart be not poor no the follow morning mr pecksniff announce that he must go to london on professional business my dear martin strictly on professional business and i promise my girl long ago that they should accompany I we shall go forth to-night by the heavy coach -- like the dive of old my dear martin -- and it will be a week before we again deposit we olive-branch in the passage when i say olive branch observe mr pecksniff in explanation i mean we unpretending luggage and now let I see say mr pecksniff presently how can you best employ yourself martin while i be absent suppose you be to give I you idea of a monument to a lord mayor of london or a tomb for a sheriff or you notion of a cow-house to be erect in a nobleman 's park a pump be a very chaste practice i have find that a lamp-post be calculate to refine the mind and give it a classical tendency a ornamental turnpike have a remarkable effect upon the imagination what do you say to begin with a ornamental turnpike whatever mr pecksniff please say martin doubtfully stay say that gentleman come as you be ambitious and be a very neat draughtsman you shall try you hand on these proposal for a grammar-school when you mind require to be refresh by change of occupation thoma pinch will instruct you in the art of survey the back-garden or in ascertain the dead level of the road between this house and the finger-post or in any other practical and please pursuit there be a cart-load of loose brick and a score or two of old flower-pot in the back-yard if you could pile they up my dear martin into any form which would remind I on my return say of st peter 's at rome or the mosque of st sophium at constantinople it would be at once improve to you and agreeable to my feeling the coach have roll away with the olive-branch in the boot and the family of dove inside martin chuzzlewit and tom pinch be leave together now there be something in the very simplicity of pinch that invite confidence and young martin could not refrain from tell he story i must talk openly to somebody he begin i 'll talk openly to you you must know then that i have be breed up from childhood with great expectation and have always be teach to believe that one day i should be very rich certain thing however have lead to my be disinherit by you father inquire tom by my grandfather i have have no parent these many year

in love with one of the most beautiful girl the sun ever shine upon but she be wholly and entirely dependent upon the pleasure of my grandfather and if he be to know that she favor my passion she would lose she home and everything she possess in the world my grandfather although i have conduct myself from the first with the utmost circumspection be full of jealousy and mistrust and suspect I of love she he say nothing to she but attack I in private and charge I with design to corrupt the fidelity to himself -- observe he selfishness -- of a young creature who be he only disinterested and faithful companion the upshot of it be that i be to renounce she or be renounce by he of course i be not go to yield to he and here i be mr pinch after stare at the fire say pecksniff of course you know before only by name my grandfather keep not only himself but I aloof from all he relation but we separation take place in a town in the neighbouring county i see pecksniff 's advertisement in the

interpose tom rub he hand why not so much on that account return martin as because my grandfather have a inveterate dislike to he and after the old man 's arbitrary treatment of I i have a natural desire to run as directly counter to all he opinion as i could _ ii -- mr pecksniff discharge he duty _ mr pecksniff and he daughter take up they lodging in london at mr todger 's commercial board house and it be at that favored abode that old martin chuzzlewit whose grandson have just enter mr pecksniff 's house seek he out i very much regret say old martin that you and i hold such a

have make he matrimonial choice surely not without he grandfather 's consent and approbation my dear sir cry mr pecksniff do not tell I that for the honor of human nature say you be not about to tell I that i think he have suppress it the indignation feel by mr pecksniff at this terrible disclosure be only to be equal by the kindling anger of he daughter what have they take to they hearth and home

above the blue sea that lave its base be a small plain hem in by pinnacle of rock in the center of the plain be a cypress tree and a fountain this be the traditional scene of the greatest event in the history of mankind it be here that mose receive the divine law on which the civilisation of the world be base tancr of montacute kneel down on the sacred soil and bow he head in prayer far below he in one of the green-valley slope down to the sea fakredeen and a band of bedouin pitch they tent for the night and talk in awed tone of they strange companion wonderful be the power of soul with which a great idea endue a man the young emir of lebanon and he man be no longer the captor of tancr but he follower he have preach to they with the eye of flame and the word of fire of a prophet and they now ask of he not a ransom but a revelation they want he to bring down from sinaus the new word of power which would bind they scatter tribe into a mighty nation with a divine mission for all the world what be this word to be tancr do not know any more than he follower and he kneel all day long under the arabian sun wait for the divine revelation the sunlight fade and the shadow fall around he and he still remain bow in a strange quiet ecstasy of expectation but at last lifting up he eye to the clear starry sky of arabium he pray : o lord god of israel i come to thine ancient dwelling-place to pour forth the heart of tortured europe why do no impulse from thy renovate will strike again into the soul of man faith fade and duty die and a profound melancholy fall upon the world we king can not rule we priest doubt and we multitude toil and moan and call in they madness upon unknown god if this transfigured mount may not again behold thee if thou wilt not again descend to teach and console we send oh send one of the starry messenger that guard thy throne to save thy creature from they terrible despair as he pray all the star of arabium grow strangely dim the wild peak of sinaus standing sharp and black in the lucid purple air melt into shadowy change mass the huge branch of the cypress-tree move mysteriously above he head and he fall upon the earth senseless and in a trance it seem to tancr that a mighty form be bend over he with a countenance like a oriental night dark yet lustrous mystical yet clear the solemn eye of the shadowy apparition be full of the brightness and energy of youth and the calm wisdom of the age i be the angel of arabium say the spectral figure wave a sceptre fashion like a palm-tree the guardian spirit of the land which govern the world for its power lie neither in the sword nor in the shield for these pass away but in idea which be divine all the thought of every nation come from a higher power than man but the thought of arabium come directly from the most high you want a new revelation to christendom listen to the ancient message of arabium you people now hanker after other god than the god of sinaus and calvary but the eternal principle of that arabian faith which mould they from savage into civilised man when they descend from they northern forest fifteen hundred year ago and spread all over the world can alone breathe new vigor into they now that they be decay in the dust and fever of they great city tell they that they must cease from seek in they vain philosophy for the solution of they social problem they longing for the

boxtel creation he almost choke with envy and from the moment of he discovery live under continual fear the healthy pastime of tulip grow become under these condition a morbid and evil occupation for boxtel while van baerle on the other hand totally unaware of the enmity brewing throw himself into the business with the keenest zest take for he motto the old aphorism to despise flower be to insult

though they make havoc of many precious plant before they break the string leave the four finest tulip untouched shortly afterwards the haarlem tulip society offer a prize of 100000 guilder to whomsoever should produce a large black tulip without spot or blemish van baerle at once think out the idea of the black tulip he have already achieve a dark brown one while boxtel who have only

together reconquer england and place he securely on the throne and he shall make we duke and peer say portho joyfully at this cheerful prospect or he will forget we add d'artagnan then say atho offer he hand to d'artagnan i swear to you my friend by the god who hear we i believe there be a power watch over we and i look forward to we all meeting in france again so be it say d'artagnan but i confess i have quite a contrary conviction however ` tis settle but i stay in england only on one condition that i do not have to learn the language the attempt to rescue charle from he guard on the way to london be only frustrate by the sudden arrival of general harrison with a large body of soldier and d'artagnan and he friend make they escape by a hasty flight and follow to london we must see this tragedy play out to the end say atho do not let we leave england while any hope remain and the other agree _ iv -- at whitehall _ the intrepid four be present at the trial of charle i and it be the voice of atho that call out you lie when the prosecutor declare that the accusation against the king be put forward by the english people fortunately d'artagnan manage to get atho out of the court quickly and then follow by portho and arami they mingle in the crowd outside undetected sentence have be pronounce against the king the only thing to be do by the four be to get rid of the london executioner this mean at least a few day delay while another executioner be be procure d'artagnan undertake this difficult task while arami be to personate bishop juxon the royal chaplain and explain to charle the attempt be make to save he atho engage to get everything ready for leave england on the very night before the execution arami bring the king a message from d'artagnan tell the king that to-morrow at ten o'clock at night we shall carry he off aramis add he have say it and he will do it the scaffold be already be construct in whitehall as he speak but d'artagnan have the london executioner fast bind under lock and key in a cellar and atho have a light skiff wait at greenwich not only this but at midnight these four wonderful man thanks to atho who speak excellent english be also at work at the scaffold -- have bribe the carpenter in charge to let they assist -- and at the same time bore a hole in the wall the scaffold which have two lower story and be cover with black serge be at the height of twenty foot on a level with the window in the king 's room and the hole communicate with a narrow loft between the floor of the king 's room and the ceiling of the one below it the plan be to pass through the hole into the loft and cut out from below a piece of the flooring of the king 's room so as to form a kind of trap-door the king be to escape through this on the follow night and hide by the black covering of the scaffold be then to change he dress for that of a workman and so pass the sentinel on duty and reach the skiff that be wait for he at greenwich at nine o'clock in the morning arami this time in attendance on bishop juxon be once more in the king 's room sire he say you be save the london executioner have vanish and there be no executioner nearer at hand than bristol the count de la fère be two foot below you take the poker from the fireplace and strike three time on the floor he will answer you he have the path ready for you majesty to escape by the king do as arami suggest and in reply come three dull knock from below the count de la fère say aramis all be ready nothing as far as d'artagnan and atho could see have be overlook twenty-four hour hence would see the king beyond the reach of he adversary and then just as charle have satisfy himself that he life be save a parliamentary officer and a file of soldier enter the king 's room to announce he immediate execution then it be for to-day ask the king be not you warn that it be to take place this morning then i must die like a common criminal by the hand of the london executioner the london executioner have disappear but a man have offer he service instead the execution will therefore take place at the appoint hour a fanatical puritan nephew of lord de winter -- whom he slew at newcastle -- and a trust lieutenant of cromwell 's do the work of the headsman and upon atho wait in concealment beneath the scaffold fall drop of the king 's blood when all be over the four hasten away in deep dejection to the skiff at greenwich and so to france but when they have land at dunkirk it be plain to d'artagnan that they trouble be not yet at a end portho and i be send by cardinal mazarin to fight for cromwell instead of fight for cromwell we have serve charle i that be not the same thing at all however d'artagnan and portho on they return to pari render such signal service to mazarin and to the queen by guard they from the violence of the mob and by quell a riot that d'artagnan receive he commission as captain of musketeer and portho he barony the four old friend meet once more in pari before they separate arami be return to he convent atho and portho to they estate as war have just break out in flander d'artagnan make ready to go thither then all four embrace with tear
