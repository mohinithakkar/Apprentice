produce by josh cogliatus and pg distribute proofreader supply and demand by hubert d henderson ma with a introduction by jm keyne ma cb 1922 introduction the theory of economics do not furnish a body of settle conclusion immediately applicable to policy it be a method rather than a doctrine a apparatus of the mind a technique of think which help its possessor to draw correct conclusion it be not difficult in the sense in which mathematical and scientific technique be difficult but the fact that its mode of expression be much less precise than these render decidedly difficult the task of convey it correctly to the mind of learner before adam smith this apparatus of thought scarcely exist between he time and this it have be steadily enlarged and improve nor be there any branch of knowledge in the formation of which englishman can claim a more predominant part it be not complete yet but important improvement in its element be become rare the main task of the professional economist now consist either in obtain a wide knowledge of _ relevant _ fact and exercise skill in the application of economic principle to they or in expound the element of he method in a lucid accurate and illuminating way so that through he instruction the number of those who can think for themselves may be increase this series be direct towards the latter aim it be intend to convey to the ordinary reader and to the uninitiated student some conception of the general principle of thought which economist now apply to economic problem the writer be not concern to make original contribution to knowledge or even to attempt a complete summary of all the principle of the subject they have be more anxious to avoid obscure form of expression than difficult idea and they object have be to expound to intelligent reader previously unfamiliar with the subject the most significant element of economic method most of the omission of matter often treat in textbook be intentional for as a subject develop it be important especially in book mean to be introductory to discard the mark of the chrysalid stage before thought have wing even on matter of principle there be not yet a complete unanimity of opinion amongst professor generally speak the writer of these volume believe themselves to be orthodox member of the cambridge school of economics at any rate most of they idea about the subject and even they prejudice be traceable to the contact they have enjoy with the writings and lecture of the two economist who have chiefly influence cambridge thought for the past fifty year dr

theory and fact _ the controversy between the theorist and the practical man be common to all branch of human affair but it be more than usually prevalent and perhaps more than usually acrid in the economic sphere it be always a rather foolish controversy and i have no intention of enter into it but its prevalence make it desirable to emphasize a platitude economic theory must be base upon actual fact : indeed it must be essentially a attempt like all theory to _ describe _ the actual fact in proper sequence and in true perspective and if it do not do this it be a imposture moreover the fact which economic theory seek to describe be primarily economic fact fact that be to say which emerge in and be concern with the ordinary business world and it be therefore mainly upon such fact that the theory must be base people sometimes speak as though they suppose the economist to start from a few psychological assumption -lrb- e g that a man be actuate mainly by he own self-interest -rrb- and to build up he theory upon such foundation by a process of pure reasoning when therefore some advance in the study of psychology throw into apparent disrepute such ancient maxim about human nature these people be dispose to conclude that the old economic theory be explode since its psychological premise have be show to be untrue such a attitude involve a complete misunderstanding not merely of economics but of the process of human thought it be quite true that the various branch of knowledge be interrelate very intimately and that a advance in one will often suggest a development in another by all mean let the economist and psychologist avoid a pedantic specialism and let each stray into the other 's province whenever he think fit but the fact remain that they be primarily concern with different thing : and that each be most to be trust when he be upon he own ground when therefore the economist indulge in a generalization about psychology even when he give it as a reason for a economic proposition in nine case out of ten the economics will not depend upon the psychology the psychology will rather be a inference -lrb- and very possibly a crude and hasty one -rrb- from the economic fact of which he be tolerably sure but the purpose of economic theory be not merely to describe the fact of the economic world it be to describe they in they proper sequence and true perspective it must begin with those fact which be most general and which have the widest possible significance those be not likely to be the fact which we practical experience force most insistently upon we notice for it be the particular and not the general the difference between thing rather than they resemblance that concern we most in daily life nor be we likely to find the universal fact which we require in the sphere of public controversy we must rather look for they in the dark recess of we consciousness where be store those truth which be so obvious that we hardly notice they which be so indisputable that we seldom examine they which seem so trite that we be apt to miss they full significance § 2 _ the division of labor _ there be one such truth in the economic sphere which it be essential to appreciate vividly and fully with the widest sweep of the imagination and the sharpest clarity of think man life by cooperate with he fellow-man in the modern world that cooperation be of a boundless range and a indescribable complexity yet it be essentially undesigned and uncontrolled by man the humblest inhabitant of the united state or great britain depend for the satisfaction of he simplest need upon the activity of innumerable people in every walk of life and in every corner of the globe the ordinary commodity which appear upon he dinner table represent the final product of the labor of a medley of merchant farmer seamen engineer worker of almost every craft but there be no human authority preside over this great complex of labor organize the various unit and direct they towards the common end which they subserve wheel upon wheel in a ceaseless succession of interdependent process the business world revolve : but no one have plan and no one guide the intricate mechanism whose smooth working be so vital to we all man indeed can organize and have organize much within a large factory the effort of thousand of work-people each engage on the repetition of a single small process be fit together so as to form a order whole by the conscious direction of the management sometimes factory be join with factory with farm fishery mine with transport and distributing agency as one gigantic business unit control by a common will these giant business be remarkable achievement of man 's organize gift the individual who control they wield a immense power which so impress the public imagination that we dub they king supermen napoleon of industry but how small a portion of man 's economic life be dominate by such man even as regard the affair of they own business how narrow after all be the limit of they influence the price at which they can buy they material and borrow they capital the quantity of they product which the public will consume be factor at once vital to they prosperity and outside they own control a great business like a nation may cherish vision of self-sufficiency may stretch its tentacle forward to the consumer and backwards to its supplies of raw material but each fresh extension of its activity serve only to multiply its point of contact with the outside world when those point be reach the largest business like the smallest be out on the open sea of a economic system immeasurably larger and more powerful than itself there it must meet -- the better perhaps for its inherent strength and accumulate knowledge -- the impact of rude force which it be powerless to control beneath the blast of a trade depression or some other tendency of world-wide scope the authority of the mightiest industrial magnate and equally of any government assume the same essential insignificance as the pride of a man humble by contact with the elemental power of nature § 3 _ the existence of order _ the parallel can be pursue further with advantage just as in the world of natural phenomenon which for long seem to man so wayward and inexplicable we have come gradually to perceive a all-pervading uniformity and order so there be manifest in the economic world uniformity order of a similar if less majestic kind upon the cooperation of he fellowmen man depend for the very mean of life : yet he take this cooperation for grant with a complacent confidence and often with a naive unconsciousness as he take the rising of to-morrow 's sun the reliability of this unorganized cooperation have powerfully impressed the imagination of many observer on enter pari which i have come to visit exclaimed bastiat some seventy year ago i say to myself -- here be a million of human being who would all die in a short time if provision of every kind cease to flow towards this great metropolis imagination be baffle when it try to appreciate the vast multiplicity of commodity which must enter to-morrow through the barrier in order to preserve the inhabitant from fall a prey to the convulsion of famine rebellion and pillage and yet all sleep at this moment and they peaceful slumber be not disturb for a single instant by the prospect of such a frightful catastrophe on the other hand eighty department have be labor to-day without concert without any mutual understanding for the provision of paris the theme may well excite wonder but wonder should always be watch with a wary eye for he be apt to bring in he train a hanger-on call worship who can do nothing but mischief here it be a short step from a passage like that quote above to a glorification of the exist system of society to a defense of all manner of indefensible thing and a cross-grained attitude towards all project of reform it be a short step but it be one which it be quite unjustifiable to take for the evil of we economic system be too plain to be ignore too many people have harsh personal experience of the wastefulness of its production the injustice of its distribution of its sweating its unemployment and slum and when the attempt be make to plaster over evil such as these with obsequious rhetoric about the majesty of economic law it be not surprising that the spirit of many man should revolt and that they should retort by deny the existence of order in the business world by declare that the spectacle which _ they _ see be one of discord confusion and chaos and then we be engulf in a controversy as stale flat and unprofitable as that between the theorist and the practical man the truth be that the language of praise and obloquy be quite inappropriate in the first place it may be well to note that the order of which i have speak manifest itself not merely in those economic phenomenon which be beneficial to man but hardly less in those which work to he hurt even in those alternation of good and bad trade which spell so much unemployment and misery there be discernible a rhythmic regularity like that of the process of the season or the ebb and flow of the tide this be not a elegance to be admire furthermore in so far as the order comprise adjustment and tendency which be beneficial -lrb- as indeed be mainly true -rrb- there be no warrant for assume that these be either adequate to secure a prosperous community or dependent upon the social arrangement which happen to exist let we therefore refrain from premature polemic and examine in a spirit of detachment some further aspect of the elaborate but yet unorganized cooperation of which so much have be already say § 4 _ some reflection upon joint product _ a quite inadequate idea of the complexity of this coöperation be obtain by dwelling on the number of people who participate in it or the immense distance over which it extend the deficiency can be partially supply by refer to some of the more obvious of the many subtle interconnection which exist between different commodity and different trade there be innumerable group of commodity -lrb- which it be customary to term joint product -rrb- such that the production of one commodity belong to the group necessarily imply or very greatly facilitate the production of the other wool and mutton beef and hide cotton and cotton-seed be a few familiar illustration the important feature of these joint product be the fairly precise relation which must exist between the quantity in which the different product be supply if you plant a certain crop of cotton it will yield you so much cotton lint and so much cotton-seed you can of course if you choose throw away part of the seed as indeed at one time planter use to do but unless you do this you can not vary the proportion of the two thing which you will have for sale similarly if you keep a flock of sheep or a herd of cattle you will obtain wool and mutton in the one case or beef and hide in the other in proportion which indeed you can vary within certain limit by choose a different breed -lrb- 1 -rrb- but which you can not radically transform when however we turn to the use to which these product be put no similar relation be to be discover cotton lint be use chiefly for make article of clothing cotton-seed for crush into oil on the one hand and cake for cattle fodder on the other there be no apparent connection of any kind between the demand for these different thing and still less be there any obvious reason why these demand should bear to one another the particular proportion which characterize they respective supplies it be very much the same with wool and mutton with beef and hide with all joint product why should we consume mutton on the one hand and woolen clothing on the other in a ratio at all commensurate with that in which they be yield by the sheep -lrb- footnote 1 : these possibility of small variation be of very great importance as will be show in chapter v but they do not affect the present argument -rrb- what then might we expect to find if order be nonexistent in the economic world surely that some thing such as wool would be produce in quantity many time in excess of the demand for they quite possibly five ten or twenty time in excess while conversely the supplies of other such as mutton might fall far short of what be require but in practice we find nothing of the sort somehow it come about that a equilibrium be establish between the demand for and the supply of every commodity and that this apply to wool and mutton to beef and hide as surely as to commodity which be produce quite independently it be true that this equilibrium be a rough imperfect one and it may happen that what be call a glut of wool may co-exist for a short period with what be call a scarcity of mutton but qualification of this nature be in the strictest sense of the phrase the exception which prove the rule for the departure from equilibrium which glut and scarcity represent be always transient and be usually confine within narrow limit a strong prevailing trend towards a adjustment of demand and supply be unmistakably manifest amid all the vagary of change circumstance let I carry the argument a step further for the benefit of any reader who be restrain by a repugnance too deep and instinctive to be readily overcome from admit fairly to he mind that conception of order which i be endeavor to emphasize he will in all probability be one who cherish ideal of a better and fairer system of society look forward to a time when a organize coöperation will be substitute for what he regard as the exist chaos let we suppose that he vision be fulfil as completely as he could desire and that a immense system of socialism be in existence embrace not one country only but the whole world suppose all the difficulty of human perversity and administrative technique to have be surmount and a wise disinterested executive to be in supreme control of we business life let we suppose all this and ask only the question : how would this executive treat the humdrum case of wool and mutton how would it decide the number of sheep it would maintain shall we suppose that it be inspire by the ideal to each accord to he need and that it resolve accordingly that the commodity which people require for a decent standard of life shall be supply to they as a matter of course how then would it proceed it might estimate the amount of woolen clothing which a normal family require allow for difference in climate and possibly indulge somewhat the caprice of human taste on this basis a certain number of sheep would be indicate it might perform a similar calculation for mutton and again a certain number of sheep would be indicate but it would be a extraordinary coincidence if the number which result from these independent calculation be nearly equal to one another or be even of the same order of magnitude and if they differ widely what number would we world executive select would it decide to waste a immense quantity of either wool or mutton or would it decide that it could not after all supply the full human need for one or other of the commodity of course if the executive be sensible it could solve the problem satisfactorily enough it could retain the monetary system we know to-day and it could supply the commodity to the consumer not as a matter of right but by sell they to they _ at a price _ this price it could then move upwards or downwards raise say the price of mutton and reduce that of wool until it find that the consumption of the two thing be adjust in the require ratio but if it act in this manner what essentially would it be do it would be seek by deliberate contrivance to reproduce in respect of this particular problem the very condition which occur to-day without aim or effort on the part of anyone at all the moral of this illustration must not be misinterpret it do not show the folly of socialism or the superiority of laissez-faire what it do show be the existence in the economic world of a order more profound and more permanent than any of we social scheme and equally applicable to they all § 5 _ some reflection upon capital _ another aspect of the great cooperation be of even greater significance it embrace not only a multitude of live man but it link the present together with the future and the past the goods and service which we enjoy to-day we owe only in part to the labor of the week the month or the year only in part even to the effort of we contemporary the man long since dead and forget who build we railway or sink we coal mine or engage in any of a great variety of task be still contribute to the satisfaction of we daily want the expression be not altogether fanciful for have it not be reasonable to expect that those labor would be of use to we to-day many of they in all probability would never have be undertake it be to meet we present want and even we future want that many man toil on monotonous task ten twenty thirty year ago and yet of course we should deceive ourselves if we suppose that this be the motive of these man that we welfare be the center of they heart 's desire we in we turn dedicate to the future and often to a distant future a immense portion of we energy let any reader who doubt this study the statistics of the occupation of the people and reflect on how long a period must elapse before the labor of this trade or that can fulfil they ultimate function how long would the period be in the case of a man make brick which will later be employ in the erection of a factory where machinery will be make to equip a electrical generate station design to supply over a period of many year light heat and power to people live in a remote continent a longer time it may be hazard than he be accustom to look ahead like the daily cooperation of live man this cooperation of past present and future be essential to the well-being of mankind and yet it be undesigned and unorganized as private individual man do indeed deliberately provide for they own future and for that of they kith and kin : as the director of business they try to forecast the trend of demand but such conscious calculation and deliberate act would avail little if they stand alone they be hardly more than the necessary spoke in the great wheel which regulate the relation of past present and future the hub of the wheel be a elaborate system of borrowing and lending essentially similar to the buying and selling of commodity the private individual in order to provide for he family or for he old age save and invest but what exactly do this mean it mean that he transfer so much purchasing power which he might have spend on he personal pleasure to some one else in return for the expectation of receive year by year in the future he and he heir after he a certain smaller quantity of purchase power the other party to the transaction will be we may suppose a business man who enter into it because he see the opportunity of a promising industrial development to undertake which he require more purchase power than he himself possess and because this transaction be enter into a smaller number of we will shortly be engage in make motorcar or gramaphone and a larger number of we in make factory and machinery which will later enhance the world 's productive power many transaction of the kind take place daily in modern community and they multiplicity give rise to a mass of phenomenon with which we be all tolerably familiar we recognize a short-loan market a stock exchange a number of market where lender and borrower be bring together by the aid of various intermediary such as bank bill broker and stock jobber who correspond to dealer in commodity between these different specialized market we be aware of a interconnection so close and strong that we speak more generally of a capital market of which the stock exchange the short-loan market and so forth be the component part now market be a word which be originally use to denote a place where tangible commodity be buy and sell and the more closely we examine the phenomenon of the capital market the more closely do we perceive the profound resemblance between the mechanism of borrowing and lending and that of buying and sell correspond to the price of a commodity be the rate of interest -lrb- in the short-loan market we actually call the rate of discount the price of money and speak of money be cheap or dear -rrb- and between the rate of interest the demand for and the supply of capital there exist relation precisely similar to those between price demand and supply in commodity market above all there be the same strong prevailing trend towards a adjustment of demand and supply this fundamental resemblance between two such apparently incommensurable thing as the buying of material commodity and the borrowing of capital be highly significant it be another instance of that order in the economic world of which the reader may now be grow weary but so difficult be it to see clearly and fully something which one see as it be every day of one 's life that a few more moment of reflection on the special case of capital will be time well spend let we revert then to we fantasy of a world socialist commonwealth and humbly submit another poser to its supreme executive the question this time will be whether some great constructional work such let we say as the recently moot severn barrage scheme should or should not be undertake let we suppose that the cost and future benefit of the undertaking can be estimate accurately and that the problem reduce itself to one of expend now a sum let we say of $ 100000000 with the prospects of obtain in the future a income of power or whatever it may be worth $ 5000000 per annum i have assume for the sake of simplicity that we shall still be reckon in term of money though possibly the executive may have substitute marxian labor unit but it be quite immaterial to the present argument what the measure rod may be the point to be observe be that it be impossible to tackle the problem at all without the conception of a rate of interest for suppose that you try to do without it and say we shall take a long view the interest of the future be no less we concern than those of the present we shall not discriminate between they we shall regard as a enterprise worthy to be undertake whatever promise to yield in the course of time a return larger than the outlay where will this lead you the particular proposal set out above would clearly pass the test for in twenty year the resultant benefit would have add up to a figure equivalent to the initial cost but equally clearly the cost might have be more than $ 100000000 it might have be $ 250000000 $ 500000000 whatever figure you care to take and if you extend the period similarly to fifty or one hundred year sooner or later the gain would top the cost now there be no limit to the enterprise which would pay they way on this basis and it would be quite impossible to undertake they all for they would swallow up all and more than all you labor and you material and would leave you with no resource with which to meet the recurrent daily want of man clearly then in some way or other you must pick and choose you must reject some enterprise as _ insufficiently _ worth while but how would you proceed to choose without a clear principle a simple criterion to guide you you would be plunge in utter chaos you could not say let all proposal involve capital expenditure be submit to a central committee who shall compare they with one another in a sort of competitive examination and after decide the number of application they can pass on the basis of the volume of resource which they can devote to the future award the place to those which head the list such a prospect be a nightmare of officialism and delay you would be drive to formulate a simple intelligible rule or measure and leave that rule to be apply by the unfettered judgment of innumerable man to individual problem as and when they arise and for such a rule or measure you could not do better than a rate of interest you would have to lay it down that only those project should be approve which promise a return of 6 per cent or whatever it might be even in decide what it should be the limit of you choice would be narrowly confine if for instance you fix on 1 or 2 per cent you would probably discover that you have not achieve you object that the undertaking for distant return which pass this test still consume far more resource than you could spare you would be compel then to raise the rate until it have cut these enterprise down within manageable limit but once more what essentially would you be do you would be use the instrument of the rate of interest to adjust the demand for and supply of capital though indeed the interest might not be pay away as now to private individual you would be reproduce by the method of deliberate trial and error the adjustment which occur automatically as thing be in the actual world once again the most perfectly contrived utopia would be compel to pay to the unorganized coöperation of we epoch the sincerest flattery of imitation § 6 _ the fundamental character of many economic law _ but again perhaps a word of warning may be desirable there be much controversy in these day about something call capitalism or the capitalist system when these word be use with any precision they usually refer to the arrangement so prevalent at present whereby the ownership and sole ultimate control of a business rest with those who hold its stock and share there be much to be say upon the merit and demerit of this system something will perhaps be say upon the matter in the fifth volume of this series but i shall not discuss it here nothing that i have say so far have any real bearing on it whatsoever to suppose that it have be indeed to miss the whole point of this chapter the order which i have seek to reveal pervading and move the most diverse phenomenon of the economic world would be a far less noteworthy and impressive thing be it merely the peculiar product of capitalism merchant adventurer company and trust guild government and soviet may come and go but under they all and if need be in spite of they all the profound adjustment of supply and demand will work themselves out and work themselves out again for so long as the lot of man be darken by the curse of adam chapter ii the general law of supply and demand § 1 _ preliminary statement of three law _ the recognition of order in any branch of natural phenomenon be but the prelude to the formulation of a set of law the simpler as the order be more universal which describe and as we say explain it thus the perception of the even elliptical course of the heavenly body lead to the statement of the law of gravitation and the law of motion in economics similar law have long since be enunciate and have prove themselves such valuable instrument for the understanding of the daily problem of the workaday world that they have be weave into the texture of we ordinary speech and think i have already touch upon they in the precede chapter but it be now desirable to set they out in order in the most concise and formal manner possible law i when at the price ruling demand exceed supply the price tend to rise conversely when supply exceed demand the price tend to fall law ii a rise in price tend sooner or later to decrease demand and to increase supply conversely a fall in price tend sooner or later to increase demand and to decrease supply law iii price tend to the level at which demand be equal to supply these three law be the cornerstone of economic theory they be the framework into which all analysis of special detailed problem must be fit they scope be very wide i have purposely refrain from introduce into my statement of they any reference to commodity for they extend far beyond commodity subject to a important qualification they apply to capital the price pay for the use of capital be what we call the rate of interest they apply hardly less to service to the remuneration of labor of every kind and grade people sometimes protest warmly against the idea of treat labor like a commodity if this indignation express no more than a belief that in matter concern condition of work and relation between employee and the management the sensibility of human nature should be take into due account it be base on elementary decency and commonsense but if as sometimes appear it be direct against the fact that the remuneration of labor be control by the law of supply and demand it be a mere bay at the moon with singularly little provocation for these law be in no way peculiar to commodity and it be no one 's fault that they include commodity too within they scope but let we go back to the law themselves and probe they and dissect they and turn they this way and that so that we may perceive they full content and grasp it firmly in we mind the third law imply a prevail tendency for demand to be equal to supply this tendency as be suggest in chapter i can be verify by anyone from he experience and observation -lrb- provide he be a reasonable person and not the tiresome kind who would dispute the law of gravitation because he see that a feather fall to the ground more slowly than a stone -rrb- but it can also be deduce as a corollary from the two precede law and to regard it in this way will help we to appreciate its significance start for instance by suppose that demand be in excess of supply then the price will tend to rise after the price have rise the supply will become larger while the demand will fall away the excess of demand with which we start will thus clearly be diminish but if there remain any portion of this excess the same reaction will continue the price will rise further and for the same reason demand will be further check and supply further stimulate in other word these force must persist until the entire excess of demand over supply be eliminate if we start by suppose supply to exceed demand the converse chain of sequence will operate now these very simple step of reasoning illuminate the nature of the normal equilibrium of demand and supply they reveal that the equilibrium be establish and maintain by the agency of _ change in price _ and they enable we to lay it down as perhaps the most important thing that can be say about the price of anything that it will tend to be such as will equate demand and supply but that be not all that they reveal they reveal also the extreme dependence of both demand and supply upon price now this be a fact which it be most important to realize vividly it be apt to be obscure by customary mode of speech in ordinary time the price of most commodity and service do not change by very much unless indeed over a long period of year the amount demand and supply may therefore seem to maintain a fairly constant level and we may be tempt to speak of great britain produce so many million ton of coal or america consuming so many million of motor-car per annum almost as though these quantity be independent of price consideration but we should never forget that there be no service or commodity produce by man however essential it may seem the demand for or the supply of which might not be reduce to nothing if the price be sufficiently raise on the one hand or lower on the other how easy it be sometimes to forget this simple truth may be see from the mistake so commonly make of suppose because the people of central europe be leave on the cessation of the war starve and destitute of the means of life and the material of work that they must necessarily become heavy purchaser of import goods without pause to consider whether the price be such as they could afford to pay § 2 _ diagram and they use _ it will help to prevent mistake like this and more generally to make sharp and clear the fundamental relation which exist between demand supply and price if we exhibit they pictorially in the form of a diagram such diagram be of great service in many part of economic theory not because they can prove anything which could not be prove otherwise but because be really a simpler medium of expression than word they enable the mind to grasp more readily and to retain more vividly the essential fact of complex relation figure 1 : y | | s ' | \* d

will be the amount supply and _ kr _ the amount demand the demand will thus exceed the supply and the price will tend to rise ie to move upwards towards o_m _ similarly if we suppose the price to be o_l _ which be larger than o_m _ the supply -lrb- _ l_r -rrb- will exceed the demand -lrb- _ l_q -rrb- and the price will fall downward towards o_m _ thus again we have deduce law iii from law i and ii with the form and precision of a proposition in euclid now when once the eye have become familiar with this diagram it ought to be impossible for the mind to lose even momentarily its grip on the fact that demand and supply be both dependent upon price for these curve do not represent any particular amount they represent a series of _ relation _ between amount and price if the price be qn the amount demand be on and so forth the term demand and supply in the sense in which i have be use they of the respective amount demand and supply be indeed strictly meaningless without reference to some particular price the reference may sometimes be implicit but whenever there be a chance of ambiguity it should be explicitly make § 3 _ ambiguity of the expression increase in demand etc _ it be the more important to be precise upon this point in that there be a further possible confusion which we have now to consider demand and supply as we have see be dependent upon price but equally clearly they be dependent upon other thing as well demand depend upon the need taste and habit of the people as well as upon the length of they purse supply depend upon such thing as the cost of production in the case of commodity none of these thing be constant factor all of they be liable to change and it may well happen that we shall want to consider in some concrete problem the probable consequence of such a change now the most usual and natural way of describe such change in the medium of word be to use the expression increase or decrease in demand and increase or decrease in supply the same expression which we employ before to describe the consequence of a change in price this identity of language conceal a fundamental distinction between the phenomenon describe and to make this distinction plain we can not do better than revert to we diagrammatic presentation of the law figure 2 : y | | _ d _ | | | | _ s ' _ | d | | \*\* \* s ' | \*\* \* | \*\* \* | \*\* \* | \* \*\* | \*\*

--------------------------------------------------------- m ' m _ m _ figure 2 in fig 2 we start as before with we demand curve and supply curve cut one another at the point p we then suppose that some alteration take place in the condition of demand there have be a growth in the general taste for the commodity or service and the demand as we say have increase accordingly how be this fact to be represent in the diagram plainly not by take another point on the curve dd ' at a further distance from oy for this would merely indicate the larger amount that would be take if the condition of demand have remain unaltered but the seller have reduce they price the correct way of represent the change we have suppose be to construct a new demand curve -lrb- in the figure the dot curve _ dd ' _ -rrb- lie at every point above the old demand curve for this indicate that larger quantity will be purchase at the old price which be exactly what we want to represent similiarly if we wish to represent a change in the condition of supply such as might result in the case of a commodity from a tax impose on its production we must draw a new supply curve _ ss ' _ which in the case suppose must lie everywhere above the old supply curve on the other hand the decrease or increase in demand or supply _ result _ from a change in price be represent simply by a shift of the equilibrium from one point to another on the same curve the striking pictorial contrast between a movement from one curve to another and a movement along the same curve should help to make vivid to we mind the fundamental distinction between a change in the _ condition _ of demand arise from new taste enhance purchase power etc and a mere change in the amount purchase result from a alteration in the price which the seller ask word as this necessarily cumbrous sentence show be a clumsy instrument for the expression of abstract relation it be not very easy to see which word in a sentence be the significant commanding one and which be perform as it be ordinary routine duty a diagram be not expose to similar ambiguity of emphasis the particular distinction to which attention have be call be important the reader who have grasp it clearly will be able to perceive many instance of the confusion arise out of its neglect in the ordinary discussion of economic question which take place in the press and on the platform it be not uncommon for instance for a argument to run something like this : the effect of a tax on this commodity might seem at first sight to be a advance in price but a advance in price will diminish the demand and a reduce demand will send the price down again it be not certain therefore after all that the tax will really raise the price a glance at the diagram will keep we out of such a bog of sophistry and muddle for if we suppose the amount of the tax per unit of the commodity to be represent by s_s _ the curve _ ss ' _ -lrb- draw as it be roughly parallel to ss ' -rrb- will represent the new condition of supply after the tax have be impose the new position of equilibrium will be give by the point p ' where _ ss ' _ cut dd ' the demand curve now p ' lie to the left of p the old point of equilibrium hence since dd ' _ must _ slope downward from leave to right it be clear that if as it be fair here to assume the _ condition _ of demand have remain unaltered the new price p be ' must be greater than the old § 4 _ reaction of change in demand and supply on price _ have now make clear the meaning that must be attach to the term let we consider the question which naturally arise whether we can lay down any general proposition or law as to the effect upon price of a increase or decrease in demand or supply another glance at the diagram suggest that we can a increase in demand be represent in fig 2 by a movement from dd ' to _ dd ' _ which cut the supply curve ss ' at _ p _ to the right of p since the supply curve -lrb- draw as it be best to draw it to represent the amount which will be supply in response to a give price -rrb- must always slope upward from leave to right the new price _ pm _ must be greater than the old pm conversely a decrease in demand be represent by a movement from _ dd ' _ to dd ' and the new price be see to be less than the old we have already see that a decrease in supply which be represent by a movement from ss ' to _ ss ' _ result in a higher price and it be the obvious converse that a increase in supply will have the opposite effect it would seem then that we might lay down quite generally that a increase in demand or a decrease in supply will raise the price while a decrease in demand or a increase in supply will lower it but here it be necessary to be cautious all conclusion as to the effect of cause be necessarily base implicitly if not explicitly upon the assumption other thing be equal this method of reasoning which some people appear to find so irritating in the economic sphere and as they say so theoretical and unreal be one which they adopt readily enough in every other department of life no one for instance object to the statement that the sun when it come out make a room warmer although it may very well happen if a fire be die at the same time that the room grow colder in point of fact for in we general statement we assume implicitly that other thing such as fire be unchanged but assumption of this kind be legitimate only when there be no reason to suppose that the cause the effect of which be be study will itself produce a change in the other thing if -lrb- as i have often be tell i really do not know if it be true -rrb- the ray of the sun help to put a fire out the statement make above would be the better for some qualification now we can only say that a increase in demand raise price if we assume the condition of supply -lrb- as represent by the supply curve -rrb- to remain unchanged but in practice a increase in demand may cause a change in the _ condition _ of supply a increase for instance in the demand for a commodity may give rise to a revolution in the method of production to the introduction of labor-saving machinery and so forth which will eventually result in the commodity be produce more cheaply it will certainly take a considerable time before reaction of this kind can exert a appreciable influence and we can therefore feel reasonably sure that over a short period a increase in demand will raise the price but we can not be sure what the ultimate effect will be a similar alteration in the condition of demand be less likely to result from a increase or decrease in supply but it may conceivably occur we must therefore be careful to qualify any general proposition which we lay down in this connection by explicit reference to a short period of time we can add the follow to we body of law : -- law iv a increase in demand or a decrease in supply will tend to raise the price for a short period at least conversely a decrease in demand or a increase in supply will tend to lower the price for a short period at least this law like the other apply to commodity service capital to anything which can be say literally or by analogy to have a price a short period be however a vague expression and since precision be the hallmark of a important law we must accord to this one a status inferior to that which the precede three can rightly claim § 5 _ some paradoxical reaction of price change on supply _ let we turn though once more to these earlier law and with a heighten critical sense let we submit they to the test of the whole gamut of we experience and see if in any of they we can find the smallest flaw the first of they will pass through the ordeal -- let each reader prove it for himself -- unscathed the second will emerge with a few hair as it be singe it tell we for instance that a rise in price will tend to augment the supply now there be some thing the supply of which can not possibly be augmented these be the capital resource of nature of which land be the most important for we present purpose land be buy and sell it command a price in a certain sense it may be say to be possible to increase the supply of land in response to a rise in price by drainage and reclamation scheme and it will certainly happen that a rise in the price which land can command for any particular purpose will increase the amount which be devote to that purpose but speak broadly the supply of land available for purpose of every kind be a fixed unvarying factor with a inertia which the cajolery of price-change be powerless to disturb this be a most important fact and it give rise to some peculiar feature of the price and rent of land which we shall have to consider later as a separate problem it constitute a limit case rather than a exception to the general law but we have not yet do with the reaction of price upon supply in the case of capital the nature of those reaction have be much discuss as a highly controversial question that a rise in the rate of interest will cause some people to save more than before be generally admit but it be point out that the effect upon other may be the exact opposite because it mean that they do not need to save so much to acquire the same future annual income it be unwise to say dogmatically that the former tendency outweigh the latter though upon the whole it seem highly probable that it do we can not therefore in this case feel confident that a change in price will react upon supply in the manner which we law indicate similarly it be possible to argue that a rise in the general level of real wages may reduce the supply of labor even or some might say particularly if the term be use to denote not the number of workpeople but the quantity of work do for there may be a tendency for workpeople when more comfortably off to work less regularly or less hard here again we can not be sure in none of these case however include that of land be there any reason to doubt that a rise in price will diminish _ demand _ or conversely that a fall will increase it since therefore in the reasoning by which we deduce the third law the conclusion will hold good even if the effect of price-change on supply be of the above paradoxical kind provide that they do not continually outweigh the effect upon demand there be no reason to cast doubt on the solidity of law iii which indeed as we suggest before commend itself directly to experience but law ii seem now perhaps somewhat the worse for wear the damage however be not considerable for in each case the uncertainty arise only when we be deal with one of the factor of production land labor or capital _ regard as a whole _ if we be deal with the capital available for a particular industry a rise in the rate of profit in that industry will certainly increase the supply of capital available there for it will tend to attract savings that might otherwise have be employ elsewhere we can even be fairly sure that a increase in the general rate of interest prevail in any particular country will increase the total supply of capital available for the business of that country since capital have in modern time acquire a considerable migratory power in the case of labor we can not go so far as this but here too there be no doubt that a increase in the remuneration offer in any particular occupation will attract a increase labor supply -lrb- always suppose of course that other thing be equal -rrb- no similar difficulty arise for land labor or capital as regard the effect of price-change on demand while for ordinary commodity there be no such difficulty on the side either of demand or of supply hence the only qualification which the strictest accuracy would require we in this connection to attach to we statement of law ii be the postscript : -- except that in the case of land the aggregate supply be unalterable while in the case of capital or labor we can not be sure how price-change will affect the aggregate supply much significance attach to these exception as later will appear § 6 _ the disturbance of monetary change _ but let we still keep a critical eye on law ii and submit it to another flashlight from we practical experience the recent world war make we all acutely aware of a remarkable rise in the price of almost everything which yet do not seem to diminish appreciably the demand the explanation of this paradox be not difficult to find there be a immense increase in the volume of nominal purchase power due to a complex set of cause of which currency inflation may be take as the symbol now perhaps we be entitle to assume the absence of such currency change as part of the other thing be equal which be always understand as imply but it be rash to take this particular assumption for grant more especially in these day already people be too apt to speak as though the trade depression -lrb- which as these page be write hold we in its grip -rrb- can not pass away until pre-war price be restore ignore altogether the great and probably permanent increase in nominal purchase power which the war have leave behind it it would be safer therefore to add explicitly to law ii the reservation assume that there be no change in the general volume of purchase power monetary and ally question will form the subject of the second volume of this series it must not be suppose that we general law have no bearing on they on the contrary law i which all this time have remain serene and undisturbed by the occasional discomfiture of law ii be the gateway through which all question of currency banking and the foreign exchange should be approach it be well to note as a inexorable corollary of law i that price can rise _ only _ if demand exceed supply and fall _ only _ if supply exceed demand and hence that it be only through the agency of change in the demand for and supply of commodity and service that a inflation or deflation of the currency can influence the price level further since a condition of thing in which supply generally exceed demand spell what we know and fear as a trade depression it may be well to note at once that fall price and unemployment be inseparable bedfellow for we be far too apt to shut we eye to these unpleasant truth but we can not pursue they further here and in the remainder of this volume we shall not be concern -lrb- except perhaps incidentally -rrb- with question affect the general level of price or of purchase power but rather with the relation which the price of one commodity bear to that of another with the rate of interest -lrb- which be a rate per cent be not essentially dependent on the price level -rrb- with real wages -lrb- as distinct from money wages -rrb- and the like § 7 _ the trade cycle _ but we reference to trade depression suggest a final comment on law ii one small qualification be embody in we original statement of it namely the word sooner or later a rise in price may not check the demand immediately -lrb- even if the printing press be stand idle in the treasury -rrb- it may actually stimulate it for a time for people may fear that the price will rise further still and hasten to buy what they _ must _ buy before very long seller may share the same opinion and be reluctant on they side to part when price be fall the role be reverse and we be likely to see the seller tumble over one another in a frantic eagerness to sell the buyer wary and aloof sooner or later indeed these tendency must dissolve and disappear but they may persist for a longer period than might seem probable at first for the raw material of one trade be as we say the finish product of another the demand for one thing give rise to a demand for other thing for the labor with which to make they and so on in a expand circle a sympathy subtle and intense unite the business world and a wave of depression or animation arise in any quarter may spread itself far and wide heighten by the gust of human hope and fear and continue long before its influence be spend here we be upon the threshold of one of the most striking and formidable of economic fact the regular alternation of period of good and bad trade each very widespread if not world-wide in its range each comprise certain regular phase of acceleration and decay and each infallibly yield sooner or later to the other the detail of these phenomenon be highly complex some of they obscure a immense literature have already be devote to the subject yet its systematic study be hardly more than begin the account give in the precede paragraph be incomplete and meager it be insert here in the hope that it will impress the reader with a sense both of the fact of these alternation and of the deeply rooted nature of the cause from which they spring they take a heavy toll of human happiness and wealth and there be no object that more urgently call for concerted human effort than that of mitigate they and of alleviate the misery which they bring in they train still better of eradicate they if that be possible but let none suppose that it can be lightly do meanwhile let we always remember that they form the atmosphere and medium in which the endure tendency of the business world must work themselves out it be often convenient to speak of normal condition in this trade or that but hardly ever can it be truly say of a particular moment that condition be normal the normal be rather a mean level about which oscillation to and fro round and about be constantly take place but which itself be reach only by accident if at all whenever we say that some new factor should in the long run lower the price of this or that commodity or service the picture which these word should convey to we mind be one of the price rise less on time of boom and fall more in time of depression than be the case with other thing and if ever we faith in some honor economic law be shake by the apparent ease with which perhaps in time of active trade seller be able to advance they price to whatever figure -lrb- so it almost seem -rrb- they choose to name let we rally we sense of economic rhythm and reserve we judgment until the trade cycle have run its course chapter iii utility and the margin of consumption § 1 _ the force behind supply and demand _ the law enunciate in the precede chapter constitute the framework and skeleton of all economic analysis but they do not carry we very far it be only through the agency of these law that any influence can affect the price of anything : but what influence may so affect it be a question which we have still to consider let we begin with ordinary commodity and ask ourselves in the light of experience and common sense upon what factor they price seem mainly to depend two factor spring to mind at once they cost of production and they usefulness as regard the former the case seem clear enough we may indeed sometimes grumble that the price of this or that commodity be unconscionably high in comparison with its cost but this only go to show that we conceive a relation between price and cost as the normal governing rule if one commodity cost only a half as much to produce as another we should think that something have go very wrong indeed if the former commodity be sell for the higher price but when we turn to the usefulness of commodity the case be not so clear usefulness have some connection with price so much be certain for a entirely useless thing fit only for the dust-bin -lrb- and know to be such it may be well to add -rrb- will fetch no price at all however costly it may be to produce but it be not easy to express the connection in quantitative term it seem reasonable enough to say that the price of commodity be roughly proportionate to they cost of production but directly we contemplate say a similar thing of they usefulness we be pull up short as we look round the world and enumerate the commodity which by common consent be the most useful salt water bread and so forth the striking paradox present itself that these be among the cheapest of all commodity far cheaper than champagne motor-car or ball-dress which we could very well get on without as thing be of course a ball-dress or a motor-car cost more to produce than a loaf of bread or a packet of salt and the common-sense explanation of the paradox seem therefore to be that the cost of production be a more weighty influence than the usefulness or utility as we will henceforth call it -lrb- so as to include the satisfaction we derive from not strictly useful thing -rrb- we be thus tempt to conclude that provide a commodity possess some utility its price will be determine by the cost of production the degree of utility be unimportant this be exactly how the position be gummed up for many year in systematic treatise upon political economy and it be not until fully half a century after the _ wealth of nation _ that a discovery be make which throw a fresh light on the whole matter first of all let it be clearly observe how very unsatisfactory be the above account in chapter ii where we be tread surely with a sense of solid ground beneath we we draw no such invidious distinction between supply and demand they seem then to possess a equal status but cost of production be the chief factor which in the case of commodity ultimately determine the condition of supply utility similarly be the chief factor which ultimately determine the condition of demand must not then the symmetrical relation between demand and supply be reflect in a corresponding symmetry between the utility and the cost which underlie they demand spring obviously from utility the only motive for buy anything be that it will serve some real or fancied use can we then accord to demand so dignified and to utility so subordinate a place there be here a inconsistency which we must somehow reconcile it will not serve as a solution to distinguish between different period of time and to say as economist use to say not very long ago that price be govern over a short period by demand and supply but in the long run by the cost of production this still leave we sense of symmetry unsatisfied moreover the conception of cost of production when we consider it as ruling over a long period frequently seem to lose any precision as a independent factor which it may otherwise possess motor-car we have agree be more costly to produce than loaf of bread but as we know well the cost of produce motor-car vary enormously accordingly as they be produce on a small or a large scale by the method of mass production they can be turn out at a relatively low cost per car but this require that they should be purchase in large number and this in turn throw we back to the demand for motor-car and plainly enough to people 's judgment as to they utility in some case the opposite phenomenon occur in the case of british coal for instance the average cost of production would be much lower than it be if the output be reduce to a fraction of its present volume and if only the richer seam of the more fertile mine be work once again therefore it be difficult to measure the cost of production until we know the magnitude of the demand which in a manner which we have still to elucidate clearly depend upon the utility if we take the problem of joint product the conception of cost of production fail we still more conspicuously for what be the cost of produce wool or the cost of produce mutton we can speak of the cost of rear sheep : but it be hardly possible to allot this cost except quite arbitrarily between the two product how then can we explain the separate price of these thing by reference to cost alone instance of joint production be become so common in the modern world or at least with the grow attention to the utilization of by-product be assume so much more heighten a significance that a explanation of price which do not apply to they be a very feeble one indeed § 2 _ the law of diminish utility _ let we turn back then to the factor of utility and see if we can not put on a more satisfactory basis the relation between utility and price the clue to the puzzle be to be find in a brief reflection on the implication of the second general law propound in chapter ii a rise in price it be there state will sooner or later diminish the demand this be assert as a matter of fact observe from and confirm by experience but what do it signify to what cause be this familiar fact to be attribute the first stage of the answer be very ample the many individual whose purchase make up the demand for the commodity will buy smaller quantity now that the price be higher possibly some of they may cease to buy it altogether but as a rule it would be reasonable to suppose that most people continue to buy a certain amount though a smaller amount than hitherto let we turn we attention then to the individual purchaser and ask ourselves why he -lrb- or let we say she -rrb- act in the manner indicate the obvious answer be that the more she already have of anything the less urgently do she require a little more of it if she buy 6 pound of sugar every week when the price be 7 cent a pound but only 5 pound when the price be 8 cent she show by she action that she do not consider that the additional utility she will derive from buy 6 pound a week rather then 5 pound be worth as much as 8 cent but she show at the same time that she think it worth 7 cent for when the price be 7 cent no one compel she to buy that sixth pound she could stop if she choose at five and it may serve to make the point quite plain if we suppose she actually to hesitate before she buy the sixth she have hitherto let we say be buy 5 pound a week at 8 cent to-day she enter the shop and find the price be down to 7 cent she ask for she customary 5 pound then she pause and a minute later turn she order into six what be the alternative which she have be weigh one against the other in that momentary pause not the utility of the whole 6 pound of sugar against the total price of 42 cent for she have already order the first 5 pound and the decision to buy the sixth be take independently and subsequently she have be size up the _ increment _ of utility which a sixth pound would yield and she decide that this be worth the expenditure of a further 7 cent again when the price be 8 cent she need not have buy as many as 5 pound she could have stop at 4 have she choose and the fact that she do buy 5 pound show that the increment of utility derive from buy a fifth pound when she might be say already to have 4 be worth at least 8 cent in she judgment this trite illustration enable we to lay down two important law relate to utility to state they shortly it be convenient to employ one or two technical term which unlike every term employ hitherto be not very commonly use in they present sense in everyday life they adoption be desirable not merely for the sake of convenience but because they help to stamp clearly on the mind a most illuminating conception that of the margin which supply the clue to many complicated problem the last pound of sugar which the housewife purchase the fifth pound when the price be 8 cent or the sixth pound when the price be 7 cent we call the marginal pound of sugar and the increment of utility which she derive from buy this marginal pound we call the marginal utility of sugar to she we be thus able to state the fact that the more a person have of anything the less urgently do he require a little more of it in the follow formal term : -- law v the marginal utility of a commodity to anyone diminish with every increase in the amount he have the total utility will of course increase with a increase in the amount but at a diminish rate this law be usually call the law of diminish utility § 3 _ relation between price and marginal utility _ but this be not all we be now in a position to perceive the true relation between utility and price the relation be one which exist not between price and total utility but between price and marginal utility if we know only that a housewife will buy weekly 5 pound of sugar at 8 cent per pound but 6 pound at 7 cent we know nothing of the total utility of sugar to she we do not know how much she might be prepare to pay rather than go without 3 pound 2 pound or any sugar at all but we do know that when she buy 6 pound the marginal utility of sugar be in she judgment worth something which do not differ greatly from the price we can therefore say in general term that the price of a commodity measure approximately its marginal utility to the purchaser this statement be perfectly consistent with the paradox note above that the most useful commodity such as bread salt and water be very cheap for when we say that these commodity be supremely useful we mean only that they total utility be very great that rather than do without they altogether we would offer for they a large proportion of we means but we would not value very highly a small addition to the bread water or salt that we habitually consume nor would most of we feel it as a very serious deprivation if we consumption of these thing be curtail by a small percentage in other word they _ marginal _ utility be small and it be only the _ marginal _ utility that have any relation to price § 4 _ the marginal purchaser _ a possible objection to the precede argument deserve to be consider some reader may find the picture i have draw of the hesitate housewife entirely unconvincing they may declare that she mind do not work at all in the manner i have indicate she will have form certain habit in regard to she weekly purchase of sugar which be connect very vaguely if at all with any conscious process of thought she will buy so many pound of sugar weekly without trouble she head over the specific utility of the last pound she buy when the price fall she may indeed buy more but it will not be because she separate out and consider by itself the extra utility of a additional pound she may buy more because she have form the habit of spending so much money on sugar and now that the price have fall the same amount of money will enable she to buy more pound or perhaps she may be move by instinctive and irresistible attraction to buy more of a thing when it be cheaper similar to that which inspire so many people to face with ardor the horror of a bargain sale in any case the fine calculation i have imagine convey a fantastic picture of she state of mind and how much more fantastic the critic may continue of the state of mind in which thing of a different kind be buy by less careful people when for instance one of we happy-go-lucky male -lrb- more liberally supply perhaps than the housewife with the necessary cash -rrb- decide to buy a motor bicycle or to replenish he stock of collar or tie do the above analysis bear any resemblance to the actual fact in the case of the motor bicycle the purchaser may indeed weigh the price fairly carefully against the pleasure and benefit though contrariwise he may be a rich enough gentleman hardly to bother about this but one motor bicycle be as much as he be at all likely to buy and what become then of the distinction between total and marginal utility in the case of the tie and collar the vagueness of many of we about the price will be extreme we probably have be uneasily conscious for some time of a inconvenient shortage of these troublesome article and eventually will go off -lrb- or perhaps will be send off with ignominy -rrb- to the nearest suitable shop to make good the deficiency how can we speak here with a straight face of the relation between marginal utility and price these be very pertinent criticism but they do not make nearly as much nonsense of the notion of marginal utility as may seem at first the last point indeed serve rather to give it a fresh aspect of much significance those of we who do not bother about the price we pay for we tie and collar owe a debt of gratitude of which we be insufficiently conscious to the more careful people who do as well as to the custom which prevail in shop in western country -lrb- as distinct from the bazaar of the east -rrb- of charge as a rule a uniform price to all customer if _ we _ be the only people who buy these thing a enterprising salesman would be able to charge we very much what he choose he could put up he price and we would hardly be aware of it and as by lower he price he could not tempt we to buy any more price reduction would be few and far between but fortunately there be always some people who do know what the price be even when they be buy collar and tie and who will adjust the amount they buy in accordance with the price it be these worthy people who make the law of demand work out as we well know they do it be they who will curtail they consumption if the price have fall and it be they who constitute the seller 's problem and help to keep down price for the rest of we the rest of we -- it be well to be quite blunt about it -- simply do not count in this connection we have no cause then to plume ourselves that we have disprove the truth of economic law when we declare that we seldom weigh the utility of anything against its price all that this show be that we action be too insignificant to be describe by economic law since they exert no appreciable influence on the price of anything and this in turn show the extreme importance of grasp clearly the conception of the margin just as it be the marginal purchase so it be the marginal purchaser who matter it be the man who before he buy a motor bicycle weigh the matter up very carefully indeed and only just decide to buy it whose demand affect the price of motor bicycle it be the utility which _ he _ derive that constitute the marginal utility which be roughly measure by the price as to the housewife i be not prepare to concede that my picture be in essential very fanciful she may be a creature of habit and instinct like the rest of we but most habit and instinct affect household expenditure be base ultimately on _ some _ calculation if not one 's own and reason have a way of pay as it be periodic visit of inspection and pull we habit and instinct into line if they have go far astray i be not satisfy that the housewife do not envisage the utility of a sixth pound of sugar as something distinct from the utility of the other five she may buy it for example with the definite object of give the child some sugar on they bread and she may have a very clear idea as to the price which sugar must not exceed before she will do any such thing possibly i may exaggerate i have the profound respect of the incorrigibly wasteful male for the care and skill she display in lay out she money to the best advantage § 5 _ the business man as purchaser _ but if the reader still find the picture unconvincing let we shift the scene from domestic economy to commerce and substitute for the careful housewife a enterprising business man now as anyone who have a business man for he father will have often hear he say the vagueness and caprice which characterize we personal expenditure would be quite intolerable in business affair there you must weigh and measure with the utmost possible precision you must be for ever watch the several channel of you expenditure careful to see that in none do the stream rise higher than the level at which further expenditure cease to be profitable you will not even engage typist or install a telephone in you office without weigh up fairly carefully the number of typist or the number of switch that it be worth you while to have and in decide whether to employ say five typist or six you will not vaguely lump the service of the whole six typist together and consider whether as a whole they be worth to you the wages you must give they you will in the most direct and literal manner weigh up the _ additional _ benefit you would derive from a sixth typist and if that do not seem to you equivalent to she wage you will not engage she however essential it may be to you to have one or two typist in you office if on the other hand the utility of have a sixth typist seem to you worth much more than she pay the chance be that you will be well advise to consider the employment of a seventh and so where you stop employ further typist the utility to you of the last one of the marginal typist as it be be unlikely to differ greatly from she pay now this be not a fancy picture of some remote abstraction call a economic man allow for the over-emphasis which be necessary to drive home the central point it be a bald account of the aim and method of the actual man of business to ascertain the margin of profitable expenditure in each direction to go thus and no further be the very essence of the business spirit as the business man himself conceive it when he condemn the extravagance of government department it be they lack of just this marginal sense that he chiefly have in mind the lore of nicely calculate less or more may be reject by high heaven and whitehall but no one can afford to despise it in the business world the transition from household to business expenditure involve a extended use of the word utility which be worth note commodity like bread sugar or privately own motor-car be sometimes call consumer ' goods in contrast to producer ' goods which comprise thing such as raw material machinery the service of typist and so forth which be buy by business man for business purpose the line of division between the two class be not a sharp one and we need not trouble with fine-spun question as to whether a particular commodity should in certain circumstance be include under the one head or the other but broadly speak thing of the former type yield a direct utility they contribute directly to the satisfaction of we pleasure or we want thing of the latter type yield rather a indirect utility they utility to the business man who buy they lie in the assistance they give he in make something else from which he will derive a profit the utility of these thing be therefore say to be _ derive _ from that of the consumer ' goods or service to which they ultimately contribute this conception of derive utility lead to certain complication which we shall have to notice later § 6 _ the diminish utility of money _ but one important point must be emphasize in this chapter the utility which a business man derive from the thing which he buy for business purpose be the extra receipt which he obtain thereby derive utility in other word be express in term of money and the idea of its relation to price present no difficulty but the utility of thing which be buy for personal consumption mean the _ satisfaction _ which they yield and this be clearly not a thing which be commensurable with money when therefore it be say that the price measure they respective marginal utility what exactly be mean what be it that the argument of § 3 go to show that the utility of the marginal pound of sugar would seem to the housewife just worth the price that she must pay for it in other word that it would be roughly equal to the utility she could obtain by spend the money in other way the respective marginal utility which _ she _ obtain from the different thing she buy will thus be proportionate to they price but if she be to receive a legacy which give she a much larger income to spend she might buy larger quantity of practically every commodity and though she would obtain a greater total utility thereby the marginal utility she would obtain in each direction would be smaller in accordance with the law of diminish utility the price might not have change the respective marginal utility to she of the different thing would again be proportionate to they price but they would constitute a smaller satisfaction than before thus we can only say that the price of commodity will be proportionate to they real marginal utility when we be consider the different purchase of one and the same individual the amount of money which different people be prepare to pay for different consumer ' goods be no reliable indication of the real utility the amount of human satisfaction which they yield here we must take account not only of vary need and capacity for enjoyment but of the very unequal manner in which purchasing power be distribute among the people the cigar which a rich man may buy will yield he a immeasurably smaller satisfaction than that which a poor family could obtain by spend the same amount of money on boot or clothes or milk when therefore we compare commodity which be buy by essentially different consuming public they respective price may bear no close relation to they _ real _ utility whether marginal or otherwise thus the law of diminish utility apply to money or purchase power as well as to particular commodity the more money a man have the less be the marginal utility which it yield he and where the marginal utility of money to a man be small so also will be the real marginal utility he derive in each direction of he expenditure the extreme inequality of the distribution of wealth give immense importance to this consideration its practical implication will be discuss in chapter v meanwhile we may express the conclusion of the present chapter by the statement that the price of a commodity tend to equal its marginal utility _ as measure in term of money _ ie relatively to the marginal utility of money to its purchaser chapter iv cost and the margin of production § 1 _ a illustration from coal _ we have already have occasion to note the symmetry which characterize the relation of demand and supply to price this symmetry be apparent throughout the argument of chapter ii and it be a striking feature of the diagram which we employ to illustrate the argument we shall do well to cultivate a lively sense of this symmetry for it will frequently save we from ignore factor which have a vital bearing on the problem we be consider we should never leave a important feature of demand without turn to see whether it have a counterpart on the supply side though indeed we may not always find one in the last chapter we examine the relation between utility and price and find that the true relation be between the price and what we term the marginal utility correspond to utility on the demand side be cost of production on the supply side the question should thus at once suggest itself -- can we speak appropriately of the marginal cost of production and will this serve to make clear the relation between cost and price to answer these question let we take one of the instance in which we find that price could not be explain satisfactorily by the bare phrase cost of production a important feature of the coal industry which recent event have bring into sharp prominence be the great diversity of condition between different coalfield and different colliery we speak of rich seam and poor seam of fertile and unfertile mine and we be aware that the cost of raise coal to the surface differ very widely in accordance with these diverse natural condition nor must we confine we attention to the cost price at the pit-head if we wish to speak of cost of production as a factor determine price we must use the term in a broad sense to include the transport and other charge necessary to bring the coal to market in this respect also one coalfield differ greatly from another some be well situated close to a large market or within easy reach of the seaboard other must incur very heavy transport charge to bring they coal to any considerable center of consumption these vary condition lead as we well know to great variation in the financial prosperity of different colliery concern in great britain under the abnormal condition which prevail during the war and subsequently these variation be so huge as to constitute a most formidable embarrassment and to contribute more perhaps than any other single factor to the unrest and instability by which the industry have be afflict but they be always with we if usually upon a more modest scale what then be the normal relation between price and cost in the case of coal should we direct we attention to the average cost over the whole industry or the cost incur by the richer and better situate mine or lastly that of the poorer and worse situate now as thing be it be clear enough that no concern will continue indefinitely produce at a loss it may do so for a time rather than close down altogether hope to recoup itself later when the market have take a more favorable turn but in the long run take good year with bad it must expect to obtain receipt sufficient not only to cover its necessary expenditure but to provide also a reasonable profit on the capital employ of course once the capital have be sink and embody in plant and building which be of little use for any other purpose a business may continue for many year with a rate of profit far below what it have anticipate but plant and building gradually wear out and need to be replace the course of technical improvement call continually for fresh capital outlay which a business in a bad way be reluctant to undertake the tendency therefore when profit rule low over a considerable period be for the plant to fall gradually into disrepair and obsolescence and finally for the business to disappear we can thus include a ordinary rate of profit under the head of cost of production and say with substantial accuracy that for no business can this cost for long exceed the price if the business be to continue to exist if then the relatively poor and badly situate mine be to be work the price of coal take good year together with bad must cover the cost at which these mine can produce if the price rule lower than this sooner or later they will close down and we will be leave with a smaller number of mine among which great variation of condition will still prevail once more the price must cover the cost incur by the least profitable of these remain mine unless they number be still further to be diminish thus we can conceive of a margin of production which will shift backwards to more profitable or forwards to include less profitable mine accord as the demand for coal contract or expand but wherever this margin may be there be no escape the conclusion that it be the cost of production of the marginal mine of those that be to say which it be only just worth while to work to which the price of coal will approximate it follow that there be no real connection between price and cost of production throughout the industry as a whole it follow incidentally that those concern which can market they coal at a appreciably lower cost than the marginal concern be likely to reap more than a ordinary rate of profit though royalty may absorb part of the excess § 2 _ the various aspect of marginal cost _ this relation cut much deeper than the particular system under which the mine be at present own and work if for instance we suppose that the various mine be amalgamate together in a few giant concern each of which comprise some of the richer and some of the poorer mine the precede argument would need to be recast in form but its substance would be unaffected for though a great coal trust could in a sense _ afford _ to sell at a price lower than the marginal cost set its loss on the poorer against its gain on the better pit be it likely it would do so why should it dissipate its profit in this way it be clearly more reasonable to suppose that it would close down the poorer pit -lrb- unless it could advance the price of coal -rrb- and thereby maintain its profit at a higher figure if indeed the mine be nationalize the deliberate policy might be pursue of sell coal at a price which leave the industry no more than self-supporting as a whole some coal might thus be sell at less than its cost price and the selling price would conform roughly to the _ average _ cost but such a policy though in special circumstance it might be justified would represent a very dangerous principle which could not be apply widely without the most serious result nothing could be more fatal to any enterprise whether it be in the hand of a individual a joint-stock company a state department or a guild than that the management should content themselves with result which in the lump seem satisfactory and regard loss here or there with a indifferent eye that way lie stagnation waste progressive inefficiency and ultimate disaster to inquire searchingly into every nook and cranny of the business to construct as it be for each part a separate balance-sheet of profit and loss to expand in those direction where further development promise good result and to curtail activity where loss be already evident be the very essence of good management here it will be observe we be use language very similar to that in which we describe the principle which govern a business man 's expenditure the resemblance be inevitable and significant for we be deal here with what be essentially another aspect of the same thing the object be to secure that nowhere do expenditure fail to yield a commensurate return this we express when we consider a business in its aspect as a consumer by say that its consumption of anything will not be carry beyond the point at which the marginal utility exceed the price it will have to pay when we consider it as a producer we say that its production of anything will not be carry beyond the point at which the marginal cost exceed the price it will obtain § 3 _ the danger of ignore the margin _ this at least be the general rule a business may decide deliberately to sell part of its output below cost because for instance this will serve as a advertisement bring it connection and enable it to obtain a larger profit at a later date or immediately on other portion of its sale in so act it recognize that the price obtain for a thing may be a inadequate measure of the real return it yield in the same way though for different reason a nationalize coal industry might conceivably be justify in sell some coal below cost price because let we say it hold that the price which the immediate purchaser be willing to pay be a inadequate measure of the utility of coal to the community as a whole but in all such case it be essential to be very clear as to what exactly you be do so that you may be at least moderately clear as to whether the policy be well advise it may be sound enough to lose on the swing and make good this loss on the roundabout but only if you loss on the swing _ help _ you to a larger profit on the roundabout if you would get the same return on the roundabout in any case it would be better to cut the swing out altogether so if you be direct the policy of a nationalize coal industry and decide to make a loss on a portion of you sale you will need to know that the indirect benefit which the community will derive from this particular part of you coal output be worth the loss which you incur you will certainly come to grief if you pursue a vague ideal of lump all result together and regard a profit somewhere as a sufficient excuse or a positive reason for make a loss elsewhere it be quite true that in big undertaking where there be large standing charge and where the organization possess some of the characteristic of a integral whole it be not easy to measure accurately the specific cost which should be assign to any particular portion of the output but this difficulty be one of the most serious weakness of large undertaking precise detailed measurement be the great prophylactic of business efficiency and where it be lack the bacillus of waste will enter in and multiply so clearly be this recognize that the development of large scale business have lead to the evolution of new method of accountancy design to make detailed mensuration possible we have most of we hear of they vaguely under such name as comparative costing but too few of we appreciate they full significance it be hardly too much to say that the issue as to whether the size of the typical business unit will continue to become larger and larger or whether it have already overshoot the point of maximum efficiency will turn largely upon the capacity of accountancy to supply large and complex undertaking with more accurate instrument of detailed financial measurement § 4 _ a misinterpretation _ the price then of a commodity tend roughly to equal its marginal cost of production and this marginal cost -lrb- in perfect symmetry with what we observe as regard marginal utility -rrb- may be conceive as apply either to the marginal producer or to the marginal output of any producer in the former aspect it be open to a misinterpretation against which it will be well to guard some advocate of socialism have argue as one of the count in they indictment of the present industrial system that the price of a commodity be determine by the cost at which the least efficient concern in the industry can produce they say in effect under the present competitive regime you have to pay for everything you buy a price which far exceed the necessary cost to a concern which be manage with ordinary ability for as economic theory have show it be the cost of the _ marginal _ concern ie the concern manage by the most incompetent and half-witted fellow in the trade it be the cost incur by he together with a profit on he capital that the price have get to cover the producer of no more than average capacity be therefore make out of you a surplus profit which would be quite unnecessary in any well-arranged society such a argument be a gross caricature of the marginal conception the half-witted incompetent will as we know well enough speedily disappear under the stress of competition and he place will be take by more efficient man there be a essential difference between he and the marginal coal mine of which we speak above for the probability be that of the coal resource whose existence be clearly know the more fertile and better situate part will already be in process of exploitation and there be not likely therefore to be a supply of substantially better seam which can be substitute for the worst of those in actual use there _ be _ likely on the other hand to be available a supply of decent business capacity which can be substitute for the most inefficient of exist business man the marginal concern in other word must be conceive as that work under the least advantageous condition in respect of the assistance it derive from the strictly limited resource of nature but under average condition as regard managerial capacity and human quality in general thus in agriculture we can speak of a marginal farm which we should conceive as the least fertile and worst situate farm which it be just worth while to cultivate -lrb- of which more will be say when we come to the phenomenon of rent -rrb- but we must assume it to be cultivate by a farmer of average ability § 5 _ some consequence of a higher price level _ the foregoing controversy will be of service to we if it make clear the manner and the spirit in which the marginal conception should be handle it should be regard not as a rigid formulum which we can apply to diverse problem without consider the special feature they present but rather as a signpost which will enable we to find we way a compass by which we may steer between the shoal of triviality and sophistry to the crux of any problem with which we have to deal let we illustrate its practical use by a example which be of great interest and far-reaching practical importance at the present day as have be already observe the war have leave behind it in all country a great and almost certainly permanent increase in nominal purchase power since the armistice price have move upward and downward with unprecedented violence and it would be very rash to prophesy the precise level at which they will ultimately settle -lrb- use that word with considerable relativity -rrb- but for reason for which the reader be refer to volume ii in this series it be safe enough to say that the general level of post-war will greatly exceed that of pre-war price now this will apply not only to consumer ' goods like milk and clothes or to raw material like pig-iron and cotton but in very much the same degree to thing like factory and machinery thing of this last type be sometimes call capital goods because it be in they that a large part of the capital of a business be embody now the fact that it will cost much more than it do before the war to construct fresh capital goods have a significance which very few people appreciate a exist factory cost let we say $ 500000 to build and equip with machinery before the war to construct a similar factory to-day would cost let we assume -lrb- it be probably a moderate assumption -rrb- $ 1000000 suppose 10 per cent to be the gross profit that be necessary to attract capital to the particular industry then it will not pay to construct this new factory unless the trade prospects point to the probability of a profit of about $ 100000 per annum but if the old factory be equally well manage it too should be able to earn this $ 100000 which upon the capital actually sink would represent a rate of 20 per cent the particular figure give be of course purely illustrative the conclusion to which they point be that if new enterprise be to be undertake pre-war enterprise be likely to yield a rate of profit on they fixed capital at least increase in rough proportion to the price-level of course in year when trade be bad the factory which date from pre-war time will not earn a profit of this kind it may very likely make a actual loss at those time it be very certain that few new factory will be erect but it be difficult to reconcile a condition of trade activity in which the constructional industry be busily employ with a rate of profit to pre-war business on the fixed part of they capital of a lesser order of magnitude than have be indicate it make no difference it should be observe whether we suppose the new enterprise to take the form of start of new concern or extend old one in neither case will they be undertake unless there be reason to expect a adequate return on the capital which they require at post-war constructional price high profit -lrb- take always good year together with bad -rrb- on capital sink before the war in building and machinery be thus a likely consequence of a increase in the price-level this fact be indeed the counterpart or complement of another phenomenon with which we be more familiar while price be actually rise profit as we have come to recognize necessarily rule high because every trader or manufacturer be constantly in the position of sell at a higher price-level stock which he purchase or goods make from material which he purchase at a lower level he thus acquire a abnormal profit on he circulate capital which be essentially similar to the profit on fixed capital which we have just examine the difference be that the former profit be crowd into the year when price be actually on the increase and thus be very noticeable indeed while the latter profit continue to accrue in smaller instalment after price have settle down as it be at the higher level and be not exhaust until the building and machinery have become obsolete but the two profit be essentially similar and in the long run should be commensurate in the one case stock can be sell for a large profit because it can not be replace except at a higher price in the other case plant and building yield a higher income because _ they _ can not be replace except at a higher price indeed if the owner choose the plant and building can like the stock be sell at they appreciate value as have be widely do by the owner of cotton mill in great britain since the armistice there be nothing in these consideration that should surprise we or even shock we moral sense for what they have indicate be a increase of money profit in rough proportion to the price-level so that the aggregate profit will represent about as much real income as before -lrb- 1 -rrb- the conclusion therefore amount to no more than this that you can not alter fundamentally the distribution of wealth between labor and capital by merely inflate the currency or otherwise juggle with the price-level and this be only what we should expect if there be any law of distribution of sufficient importance and permanence to justify the many volume which have be devote to they -lrb- footnote 1 : assume that the rate of interest have remain unaltered in fact it have greatly increase since pre-war day and this point to a still further increase of money profit and a increase in the real income which they represent see chapter viii § 10 -rrb- but this somewhat tame conclusion do not make it any less important to grasp clearly the significance of the appreciation in the value of capital goods a failure to realize it lie at the root of we bewildered muddling of many crucial problem of the day in the matter of housing for instance we know we can not build house at less than two or three time they prewar cost and yet we can not endure to see the owner of pre-war house obtain a commensurate increase of rent and so in great britain we pass rent restriction act and housing act and then in a fit of economy we suspend the latter and let the former stand while the housing shortage become steadily more acute when we hand the railway back from state control to private hand we horror at the idea of the company receive larger money profit than they do before the war lead we to lay down principle for the fix of fare and freight charge which take no account of post-war construction cost and then in alarm lest we may have thereby make it unprofitable for the company to spend a single penny of fresh capital upon further development we seek to provide for capital expenditure by cumbrous and dubious expedient doubtless we shall muddle through somehow with such policy : and public opinion be what it be they may perhaps have be about the best policy that be practicable but the problem would have be easier to handle if the public generally be a little less disposed to think in term of average and a little more in term of margin if we all of we instinctively realize that the cost that really matter be the cost at which additional production be profitable under the condition rule at the time or in the immediate future § 6 _ general relation between price utility and cost _ let we conclude this chapter by sum up the conclusion which have emerge as to the relation of utility and cost to price the price of a commodity be determine by the condition of both supply and demand and neither can logically be say to be the superior influence though it may sometimes be convenient to concentrate we attention on one or other of they the chief factor on which the condition of demand depend be the utility -lrb- as measure in term of money -rrb- the chief factor on which the condition of supply depend be the cost of production -lrb- again as measure in term of money -rrb- the prevail trend towards a equilibrium of demand and supply can thus be express as follow : -- law vi a commodity tend to be produce on a scale at which its marginal cost of production be equal to its marginal utility as measure in term of money and both be equal to its price chapter v joint demand and supply § 1 _ marginal cost under joint supply _ several reference have be make above to joint product a relation which it will be convenient now to describe as that of joint supply we sense of symmetry should make we look for a parallel relation on the side of demand and it be not far to seek there be a joint demand for carriage and horse for golf club and golf ball for pen and ink for the many group of thing which we use together in ordinary life but the most important instance of joint demand be to be find when we pass from consumer ' to producer ' goods there indeed joint demand be the universal rule iron ore coal and the service of many grade of operative be all jointly demand for the production of steel wool textile machinery and again the service of many operative be jointly demand for the production of woollen goods -lrb- to mention in each case only a few thing out of a very extensive list -rrb- now we have already note that when commodity be jointly supply there be a obvious difficulty in allocate to each of they its proper share of the joint cost of production there be a similar difficulty in estimate the utility of a commodity which be demand jointly with other thus the utility of wool be derive from that of the woollen goods which it help to make but the utility of the factory the machinery and the operative employ in the woollen and worst industry be derive from precisely the same source how much then of the utility of woollen goods should be attribute to the wool and how much to the textile machinery can we make any sense of the notion of utility as apply to one of these thing take by itself and if not how can we explain the price of a thing like wool in term of utility and cost since we can not disentangle its cost from that of mutton nor its utility from that of a great variety of other thing here the conception of the margin enable we to grapple with a problem which would otherwise be insoluble for while it be impossible to separate out the total utility and cost of wool it be not impossible to disentangle its marginal utility and its marginal cost the proportion in which wool and mutton be supply can not be radically transform but it can be vary within certain limit by rear for instance a different breed of sheep variation of this kind have be a important feature of the economic history of australasium where sheep farming be the lead industry before the day of cold storage australium and new zealand could not export they mutton to european market though they could export they wool wool be accordingly much the most valuable product the mutton be sell in the home market where the supply be very plentiful the price be very low in the circumstance the australasian farmer naturally concentrate on breed a variety of sheep whose wool-yielding be superior to they mutton-yielding quality the development of the art of refrigeration lead in the eighty to a important change it become possible to obtain relatively high price for frozen mutton in overseas market there be therefore a marked tendency especially in new zealand to substitute for the merino the crossbreed sheep which yield a larger quantity of mutton and a smaller quantity of wool of poorer quality now if we calculate the cost of maintain the number of merino sheep which will yield a give quantity of wool and calculate the cost of maintain the larger number of crossbreed sheep which will be require to yield the _ same _ quantity of wool -lrb- allow for difference of quality -rrb- the extra cost which would be incur in the latter case must be attribute entirely to the extra mutton that would be obtain this extra cost we can regard as constitute the marginal cost of mutton so long as this marginal cost fall short of the price of mutton it will be profitable to extend further the substitution of crossbreed for merino sheep the process of substitution will in fact be continue until we reach the point at which the marginal cost be about equal to the price similarly by start with the number of merino and crossbreed sheep which would yield the same quantity of mutton we can calculate the marginal cost of wool and again the tendency will be for this marginal cost to be equal to the price -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : it may be find difficult to grasp this point when state in general term the following arithmetical example may make it plainer : -- suppose a merino sheep yield 9 unit of mutton and 10 unit of wool suppose a crossbreed sheep yield 10 unit of mutton and 8 unit of wool suppose further that a merino sheep and a crossbreed sheep each cost the same sum say for convenience # 10 to rear and maintain and that there be no special cost assignable to the wool and the mutton respectively as of course in fact there be then 10 merino sheep yield 90 unit of mutton + 100 unit of wool cost # 100 while 9 crossbreed sheep yield 90 unit of mutton + 72 unit of wool cost # 90 hence you could obtain a extra 28 unit of wool for a extra cost of # 10 by maintain 10 merino sheep rather than 9 crossbreed sheep the marginal cost of wool be thus # 10\/28 per unit similarly 8 merino sheep yield 72 unit of mutton + 80 unit of wool cost # 80 while 10 crossbreed sheep yield 100 unit of mutton + 80 unit of wool cost # 100 hence you could obtain a extra 28 unit of mutton for a extra cost of # 20 by maintain 10 crossbreed sheep in place of 8 merino the marginal cost of mutton be thus # 20\/28 per unit so long as the price obtainable for wool exceed # 10\/28 and that obtainable for mutton do not exceed # 20\/28 per unit it will pay to substitute merino for crossbreed and conversely if the price of wool exceed # 10\/28 and the price of mutton also exceed # 20\/28 it will be profitable to expand the supply of both breed until as the result of the increase supply one of the above condition cease to obtain conversely if the price of both product be less than the figure indicate sheep farming of both kind will be restrict the resultant of the process of expansion or restriction and substitution will be that unless one of the breed be eliminate the price of mutton and wool will equal they respective marginal cost these marginal cost may of course alter as the process of substitution extend for the relative cost of maintain merino and crossbred will not be the same for every farmer here again it be the cost at the margin of substitution that matter -rrb- § 2 _ marginal utility under joint demand _ on the side of demand there exist as a rule similar possibility of variation _ some _ machinery _ some _ labor _ some _ material of various kind be all indispensable in the production of any manufacture commodity but the proportion in which these factor be combine together can be vary and be frequently vary in practice as the result of the ceaseless pursuit of economy by business man to produce pig-iron you need both coal and iron ore but if coal become more costly it be possible to economize its use machinery and labor must be use together in some case in proportion which be absolutely fix but there be in nearly every industry a debate question as to whether the introduction of some further labor-saving machine would be worth while or some improve machine which would represent the substitution of more capital plus less labor for less capital plus more labor a farmer can cultivate he land to use a common expression more intensively or less intensively in other word he can apply larger or smaller quantity of capital and labor -lrb- the proportion between which he can also vary -rrb- to the same amount of land the problem be essentially the same as that of the substitution of the crossbreed for the merino we can take the various possible combination of the factor of production and contrast two case in which different quantity of one factor be employ together with equal quantity of the other the extra product which will be yield in the case in which the larger quantity of the vary factor be employ can then be regard as the marginal product -lrb- or marginal utility -rrb- of the extra quantity of that factor and we can say that the employment of this factor will be push forward to the point where this marginal product will be roughly equal to the price that must be pay for it we can thus lay down the most important proposition that the relation between marginal utility and price hold good generally of the ultimate agent of production that the rent of land the wages of labor and we can even add the profit of capital tend to equal they -lrb- derive -rrb- marginal utility or as it be sometimes express they marginal net product whenever therefore the proportion in which two or more thing be produce or use together can be vary the relation of joint supply and joint demand be perfectly consistent with a specific marginal cost and marginal utility for each commodity § 3 _ a contrast between cotton and cotton-seed and wool and mutton _ but it sometimes happen that such variation can not be make thus it have not be find possible -lrb- so far as i be aware -rrb- to alter the proportion in which cotton lint and cotton-seed be yield by the cotton plant roughly speak you get about 2 pound of cotton-seed for every 1 pound of cotton lint -lrb- or raw cotton -rrb- and though this proportion may vary somewhat from plantation to plantation it be upon the knee of the god and not upon the will of the planter that the variation depend we can not therefore speak with accuracy of the separate marginal cost of raw cotton and cotton-seed it be true that some plantation be so far distant from any seed-crushing mill that it be not worth while to sell the seed as a commercial product and it might seem therefore as though we might regard the entire cost of cotton grow on _ such _ plantation as constitute the marginal cost of raw cotton but planter so situated derive a considerable value from they cotton-seed by use it as fodder for they live stock or as a manure you can of course argue that proper allowance be automatically make for this factor as a deduction from the cost of raw cotton when you add up the expense of the plantation in the same way you can deduct the price which a planter who sell he cotton-seed obtain for it from the total cost of the plantation and call the remainder the cost of the raw cotton but this be really to reason in a circle for in either case the magnitude of the deduction depend on the marginal utility of the cotton-seed and the notion of the cost of anything become blur and blunt if we so use it that it must be deduce from the utility of something else which be not a agent in the production of the thing in question this point be not merely a academic one it mean that we can not explain the _ relative _ price of cotton lint and cotton-seed in term of cost at all whether marginal or otherwise the influence of cost will be confine to the _ sum _ of the price of the two thing upon this sum it will exert precisely the same influence as it exert upon price in general by affect the total quantity of the two thing that will be supply but upon the distribution of this sum between lint and seed cost will exert no influence whatever because it can not affect the proportion in which they be supply it may assist some reader if i state the matter in more concrete term cost of production will be one of the factor which will result in the production of a annual cotton crop in the united state of let we say 10 million ton of seed cotton this crop will yield roughly 6-2\/3 million ton of cotton-seed and 3-1\/3 million ton -lrb- or rather more than 13 million bale -rrb- of lint the combined price receive by the planter of -lrb- let we say -rrb- 144 cent for 1 pound of lint plus 2 pound of seed should correspond roughly to the marginal joint cost of production but the factor of cost have no influence at all in determine that this combined price be make up of a price of 12 cent per pound for lint and only 12 cent per pound -lrb- or $ 24 per ton -rrb- for cotton-seed to account for this we must rely entirely upon demand we can say shortly that the respective price must be such as will enable the demand to carry off 6-2\/3 million ton of seed and 3-1\/3 million ton of raw cotton or we can go further and say that the marginal utility of a pound of raw cotton when 3-1\/3 million ton be supply be ten time as great as that of a pound of seed when 6-2\/3 million ton be supply if accordingly the demand for cotton-seed be to expand considerably owe say to the discovery of some new use for the oil which be its most valuable constituent the effect would be first a rise in the price of cotton-seed and subsequently by stimulate cotton grow a more plentiful supply and a lower price for raw cotton and so far at least as the increase supply be concern this must necessarily be the effect other thing be equal though to be sure it might be outweigh and obscure by other influence such as the boll-weevil but it be _ not _ the case that a increase demand for mutton must necessarily increase the supply or lower the price of wool and it be most unlikely to do so in any similar degree for here the separate marginal cost of the two thing exert they influence a increase demand for mutton will stimulate sheep farming but it will also stimulate the substitution of crossbreed for merino breed and the resultant of these two opposite tendency upon the supply of wool be logically indeterminate as a matter of history we know that the development of cold storage in the eighty -lrb- which we may regard for the present purpose as equivalent to a increase demand for australian mutton -rrb- cause considerable perturbation in the woollen and worst industry of yorkshire they be face with a dwindle supply and a soar price of merino wool and the adaptability with which they meet the situation and win prestige for the crossbreed top and yarn and fabric to which they largely turn be a matter of just pride in the trade to-day the fact however that this alteration in the supply of wool be a matter not only of quantity but of quality while it take nothing from the substance of the precede argument make it difficult to draw a clear moral bearing on the present issue from this incursion into history § 4 _ the importance of be unimportant _ the above contrast between case in which variation be possible and those in which it be not possible be reproduce with a heighten significance when we turn back to joint demand the case be perhaps less common in which it be _ impossible _ to alter the proportion in which different commodity be jointly demand but there be many case in which it be not nearly worth while to do so -lrb- and this amount to very much the same thing -rrb- case of this sort be especially likely to occur when we be deal with a commodity which account for only a tiny fraction of the cost of the industry which be its chief consumer sew cotton for example be jointly demand with many other thing by the tailor and other clothing trade but the money which these trade spend on sew cotton be so small a part of they total expenditure that no ordinary variation in its price be likely to make it worth while to study the way and means of use it in smaller quantity when sew cotton be buy by the domestic consumer consideration which be fundamentally the same though somewhat different in form point to a similar conclusion it be thus very difficult to assign to sew cotton a specific marginal utility this difficulty be of great importance in connection with the possibility of monopolistic exploitation for it mean that the demand blade of the scissors upon which we rely to cut off excrescence of price be blunt and if accordingly the producer constitute a strong enough combination to control the supply blade they will possess a unusual power of advance they selling price as they choose i be far from suggest that messr j & p coat be to be condemn as a extortionate monopoly on the contrary during 1919 when the profit in highly competitive industry like the main branch of the cotton and woollen trade soar exuberantly the record of this concern seem to I one of distinct moderation but the present point be that they possess a exceptional _ power _ to fix the price of sew cotton as they choose and that this be attributable in no small degree to the fact that sew cotton constitute a essential but relatively trifling item in the expense of the process in which it be employ perhaps the point will be make clearer if we turn from the selling price of commercial product in regard to which there be a strong and not ineffective public sentiment against profiteer to the remuneration of different class of labor with a instinctive disposition towards megalomania it be often claim in great britain that the miner be a very numerous and well-organized body of workpeople be in a stronger strategic position than most workpeople for exact the remuneration they desire it be quite true that a stoppage of work in the coal industry cause we a high degree of inconvenience and temporary concession may thereby be obtain which might otherwise have be refuse but this be a dubious advantage and we grossly exaggerate its real importance the truth be that the strategic position of the miner in regard to wages question be by no means strong for they wages constitute a very large percentage of the cost of coal and the price of coal in its turn be a most important element in the cost of many of the industry which be its principal consumer great britain moreover be far from possess a monopoly of coal if accordingly the wages of the miner be temporarily push up to a high point the result will certainly be a diminish demand for british coal which will lead before long to they fight a lose battle to maintain the concession they have win contrast they position with that of the steel smelter whose wages -lrb- high though the wage rate be -rrb- constitute a very small percentage of the cost of steel production and we must agree i think that we have in this distinction the main reason why the steel smelter though they hardly ever go on strike have as a rule be able to do so much better for themselves than the miner when a commodity or service be such that a appreciable alteration in its price have only a slight effect upon the quantity demand the demand be say to be _ inelastic _ conversely when a small change in price greatly alter the quantity demand we call the demand _ elastic _ in the former case it be worth nothing a larger aggregate sum of money will be spend upon the thing when its price be high than when it be low while the opposite be true in the latter case this distinction be of considerable importance in connection with many problem -lrb- eg of taxation -rrb- and the term elastic demand and inelastic demand be worth remember we may thus express the above conclusion by say that the demand for sewing-cotton be highly inelastic and that the demand for coal miner be more elastic than that for steel smelter § 5 _ capital and labor _ case in which it be impracticable to make any variation in the proportion in which different thing be use together be however the exception rather than the rule where variation be possible we be confront with a uncertainty as to the way in which a increase supply of one thing will react on the demand for another similar to we uncertainty as to whether a increase demand for mutton would augment or diminish the supply of wool it be for instance of the highest importance to give a clear answer if we can to the question whether a increase supply of capital will increase the demand for labor the chief effect of a increase supply of capital be to facilitate the extend use of expensive machine : to some extent these machine will increase the demand for labor to some extent they will be substitute for it which of these two tendency will outweigh the other we can not be absolutely sure but fortunately we can be far more nearly sure than be possible in the analogous case of wool and mutton a increase in the supply of capital increase the demand for the commodity from which the demand for labor be derive in both the sens discuss in chapter ii first it make they cheaper to buy and thus increase the quantity that will be buy it be this that be parallel to the effect of a increase demand for mutton in make it more profitable to breed sheep but it also serve to increase the purchase power with which to buy commodity because it increase the aggregate real wealth of the community and it thus serve to raise the whole demand curve this last consideration be so important as to make it overwhelmingly probable apart from the evidence of history that a increase in the supply of capital -lrb- and the same may be say of a increase in the supply of the other agent of production -rrb- will on balance increase the demand for labor the evidence of history point to the same conclusion the history of the last hundred year display a unprecedented accumulation of capital and a unprecedented extension of machinery associate with a unprecedented improvement in the standard of live throughout the whole community this be powerful testimony in favor of the view that a increase in the supply of capital and the use of machinery will usually enhance on balance the demand for labor moreover though this be not conclusive there be little room for doubt that a obstructive attitude towards the extension of machinery in a particular country or a particular district be misguided for its effect must be to make production more costly there than it be elsewhere and to lead slowly perhaps but very surely to the transference of the industry to other region § 6 _ conclusion as to joint supply and joint demand _ here however we be begin to digress let we sum up in a general form we conclusion as to the way in which change in the supply or demand of a commodity react upon the demand or supply of the other thing with which it be jointly demand or supply everything turn as we have see on the possibility of variation in the proportion in which the thing be use or produce together and this it be also clear be a matter of degree we conclusion therefore have best take the following form : -- law vii when two or more thing be jointly demand in proportion which can not easily be vary the tendency will be for a increase -lrb- or decrease -rrb- in the supply of one of they to increase -lrb- or decrease -rrb- the demand for the other these result will be more certain and more marked the more difficult it be to vary the proportion in which the thing be use similarly when two or more thing be jointly supply in proportion which can not easily be vary the tendency will be for a increase -lrb- or decrease -rrb- in the demand for one of they to increase -lrb- or decrease -rrb- the supply of the other these result again will be more certain and more marked the more difficult it be to vary the proportion in which the thing be supply § 7 _ composite supply and composite demand _ joint demand and joint supply do not complete the list of relation between the demand and supply of different thing between tea and coffee or beef and mutton there be a relation of a different kind these thing be in large measure what we call substitute for one another a increase supply and a lower price of mutton will probably induce we to consume less beef this relation it be convenient to describe as composite supply beef and mutton make up a composite supply of meat tea and coffee a composite supply of a certain type of beverage for any group of thing between which the relation of composite supply exist we can say with complete generality that a increase supply of one of they will tend to diminish the demand for the other parallel to the relation of composite supply be that of composite demand there be frequently several alternative use in which a commodity or service can be employ and these alternative use make up a composite demand for the thing in question thus railway gasworks private household and a great variety of industry contribute to a composite demand for coal it be worth note that there be frequently a association in practice between joint demand and composite supply on the one hand and between joint supply and composite demand on the other wool and mutton for instance we have describe as a instance of joint supply but in so far as the proportion of wool and mutton can be vary we can regard these thing as constitute a composite demand for sheep and this conception may help we to retain a clearer and more orderly picture of the problem we have discuss above we can regard the fact that wool and mutton be produce together as they joint supply aspect and the fact that these proportion can be vary as they composite demand aspect and the question as to whether a increase demand for mutton will increase the supply of wool turn upon whether the former aspect be more important than the latter similarly labor and machinery employ together for the same purpose form a instance of joint demand but in so far as they can be substitute for one another they constitute a composite supply of alternative agent of production these four relation of joint demand joint supply composite demand and composite supply be well worth remember and distinguish from one another they be of immense importance in every branch of economic affair there be hardly any economic problem upon which we be fit to express a opinion unless we have a lively sense of the far-reaching ramification of cause and consequence of the subtle and often unexpected interconnection between different industry and different market to gape at these complexity in a confused stupor be as foolish as it be to ignore they but confusion and stupor be only too likely to represent we final state of mind if we attempt to deal with these complication one by one as they occur to we in a piecemeal and haphazard fashion we need a clear method a systematic plan by which we may search they out and fit they into place the four relation which we have enumerate supply we with such a plan and method for they represent something more than a series of pompous name for familiar notion they constitute a classification of the various way in which the demand and supply of one thing can affect the demand and supply of other a classification which be exhaustive when we add the relation of derive demand and a analogous relation on the supply side which we must now notice § 8 _ ultimate real cost _ just as the utility of producer ' goods be derive from that of the consumer ' goods which they help to make so the cost of any commodity be derive from the cost of the thing which help to make it moreover just as we recognize that the utility of consumer ' goods lie at the back of all demand and constitute the ultimate end of all production so we can not but feel however obscurely that behind the phenomenon of money cost there must lie certain ultimate cost of which all money cost be but the measure but when we try to explain what the nature of these real cost may be we be plunge in difficulty wages it may indeed seem at first sight present no trouble there be the effort and the fatigue the unpleasantness of human labor to represent real cost but can we suppose that these thing be measure with any approach to accuracy by the wages which be pay in actual fact be it true even as a broad general rule that the service which be most arduous and most disagreeable command the highest price and wages be not the only ingredient of money cost there be profit : to what real cost do profit correspond more difficult still to what do rent correspond these plainly be not question upon which he who run may read it will be necessary to devote the next four chapter to they elucidation chapter vi land § 1 _ the special characteristic of land _ in the great process of co-operation by which the want of mankind be supply nature be a indispensable participant she render she assistance in a infinite variety of way of which the property of the soil which man cultivate form only one but the sunshine and rain which enable the farmer to grow he crop the coal and iron ore beneath the surface of the earth can be regard for we present purpose as form part of the land with which they be associate we can thus concentrate upon land as the representative of the free gift of nature which be of economic significance land in modern community be for the most part privately own it can be buy and sell for a price and acquire by inheritance moreover it be a common practice particularly in the unite kingdom for a owner who do not wish himself to cultivate or otherwise use the land not to sell it to the man who do but to lease it to he for a term of year for a annual payment which we term rent it be therefore natural and convenient to envisage the problem which we shall consider in this chapter as problem concern the price and rent of land but once again the law and principle which we shall state and illustrate in term of the current system of ownership and tenure possess a much deeper significance than this terminology might suggest the fact that land be a free gift of nature distinguish it in various way from commodity which be produce by man the peculiarity which be most important from the economic standpoint be -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the supply of land be broadly speak fix and unalterable and -lrb- 2 -rrb- that its quality and value vary from piece to piece with a variation which be immense in its range but fairly continuous in its gradation these be thus two aspect from which the phenomenon of price and rent can be regard aspect which it be usual to call -lrb- 1 -rrb- the scarcity aspect -lrb- 2 -rrb- the differential aspect § 2 _ the scarcity aspect _ the fact that the supply of land be fix have the follow significance if the demand for land increase the price will tend to rise this be also true for a short period at least of a ordinary commodity but in the latter case there would ensue a increase in supply which would serve to check the rise in price and possibly if production on a larger scale lead to improve method of production bring the price down eventually below its original level in the case of land no such reaction be possible there be nothing therefore to restrain the price -lrb- and the rent -rrb- of land from rise indefinitely and without limit if the demand for it should continue to increase conversely if the demand for land fall off there be nothing to check the consequent fall in price and rent in the case of ordinary commodity the supply would be diminish because most thing be either consume by be use or wear out in the course of time and a regular annual production be therefore necessary to sustain they supply at the exist level but land remain whether it be use or not and its supply be broadly speak just as incapable of be diminish as it be of be increase change in the demand for land in either direction be thus likely to affect its price in a much greater degree than that in which the price of a ordinary commodity will be affect by a corresponding change in its demand for most purpose however it be of more interest to compare land with other agent of production especially with capital and labor rather than with ordinary commodity now as we have already note there be some doubt as to the manner in which the supply of capital or labor be likely to be affect by alteration in demand price but the supply of capital and the supply of labor even if we suppose they to be as entirely unresponsive to price change as be the supply of land be at any rate not fix not only _ may _ they vary for many reason but they be in fact likely to vary in direct proportion to the population a increase in population imply a increase in the supply of labor and it be likely to be accompany by a increase in the supply of capital in other word the supply of these agent will expand as the demand for they expand but the supply of land will remain what it be this fact be enormously important in connection with the broad problem of population which will form the theme of volume vi but it be important also in other connection it have be the dominate factor in many absorb controversy upon high policy regard the ownership of land or the taxation of land value upon which we can touch but lightly here it have seem to many writer a reasonable proposition to lay down that the ordinary course of the progress of society the increase of population and industry must mean as a broad general rule a constant increase in the demand for land and if that be grant it seem to follow that the price and rent of land will tend constantly to increase john stuart mill accordingly in the middle of the last century assert that the ordinary progress of a society which increase in wealth be at all time tend to augment the income of landlord to give they both a greater amount and a greater proportion of the wealth of the community independently of any trouble or outlay incur by themselves -lrb- 1 -rrb- and upon the strength of this assertion he justify the policy of impose a special tax upon what we have come to call the unearned increment of land but how far do actual experience bear he assertion out in great britain we have see in the last half-century a undoubted increase in urban rent but over long period at least there be a marked fall in both the price and rent of agricultural land despite the fact that the country be increase in wealth as rapidly as ever before this be due of course in the main to the increase supplies of wheat and other foodstuff come from the new world : and if accordingly we choose to lump together not only we own urban and agricultural land but the land of other country as well and to speak vaguely of the demand for land as a whole it might seem as though we could argue that mill 's generalization still hold good but even this be by no means certain and in any case such a generalization be of very little service : what the illustration should rather suggest to we be the danger of speaking of land vaguely as a whole and the importance of turn we attention to the variation in value between different kind and different piece -lrb- footnote 1 : _ principle of political economy _ by john stuart mill -rrb- § 3 _ the differential aspect _ most ordinary commodity be not produce on a single uniform pattern as a rule there be many variation of grade and quality and consequently of price but these variation be usually design to meet the difference of taste among the purchaser and we do not expect to find that any variety of a ordinary commodity will be produce which be so poor in quality as to be entirely valueless but since it be nature which have produce the land without any assistance or guidance from man there be many piece of land which be so unfertile or be otherwise so unsuitable for productive purpose as to be quite valueless from the economic standpoint even in a densely populated country like great britain there be considerable tract of land which it be unprofitable to employ for any economic purpose whatsoever and which possess no further value than what the mere pride of ownership may give they this fact make it possible to apply the conception of the margin to the case of land with particularly illuminating result in the first place however it should be observe that the value of any piece of land do not depend solely on the intrinsic fertility of the soil the fact that land be a immobile thing make its _ situation _ a factor of great importance in the case of urban land situation be of course the only thing that count the value of a site in bond street or the city be entirely unaffected by its capacity or incapacity for potato-growing purpose but even for agricultural land situation be a most important matter a farm which be so remote that considerable transport charge must be incur to bring its produce to market will be less seek after and less valuable than one which be much better situate though somewhat less fertile in what follow therefore we must speak of the quality of a piece of land in a broad sense to include advantage of situation as well as of fertility let we now imagine the different piece of land in great britain to be arrange in order of quality so that we have a long series with land of the best quality at one end and of the poorest quality at the other at the latter end we will have such land as be find near the top of snowden or ben nevi which it clearly do not pay to cultivate at all somewhere then between these two extreme we shall come to a point where the land be just but only just worth cultivate or where to revert to a form of word we previously employ it be a matter of _ doubt _ whether the land be really worth use for a productive purpose such land we can regard as the marginal land and since the variety of nature be at once infinite and fairly minutely graduate we shall probably find that on one side of this margin there be much land which be only slightly superior and on the other much which be only slightly inferior to the marginal land itself what then be likely to be the value and the rent of this marginal land this land which be just on the margin of cultivation some reader may find the answer startling the rent of the marginal land will be nil because it will not pay to cultivate it if any appreciable rent be charge a piece of land for which it be worth a tenant 's while to pay a appreciable rent will not be the marginal land because there will be land just slightly inferior to it which it will also pay to cultivate if a somewhat lower rent be charge and so we can pass to poorer and poorer quality of land with a ever diminish rent until at the margin of cultivation the derive utility of the land be negligible and the rent vanish this certainly be a somewhat abstract conception but it be by no means so remote from reality as may at first sight appear the reader may protest that in the course of a extensive and vary acquaintance with landowner he have not yet run across this peculiar marginal type who let he land for no rent at all but there if he experience be really extensive i think he be mistaken it so happen that the ordinary agricultural landowner lease out he land not by itself but together with a variety of other thing such as farm building which it cost he a considerable sum of money to provide he will not as a rule be willing to go to this expense unless he see he way to obtain for the farm a annual payment which represent at least a fair return on this capital outlay as big a return as he could have get for instance by invest the same amount of money in some gilt-edged security this annual payment will it be true be call rent but the significance of this be that what we term rent in ordinary life be usually a complex thing make up of two essentially distinct element viz the normal return on the capital goods supply together with the land and what we may call the net rent or the pure rent attributable to the land itself now will any reader make so bold as to say that there be no land under cultivation in respect of which this net rent be either nil or negligible the landowner will not agree with he it be not a question it should be observe as to whether the rent obtain represent more than a fair return on the purchase price pay for the land that be quite another matter the question be whether the rent obtain exceed a fair return on the capital sum spend on the building etc with which every farm must be equip to let at all in fact there be not a few farm where there be no such excess and where accordingly there be no net rent or pure rent which can be attribute to the land the question whether it would be profitable to cultivate any piece of land turn upon whether the receipt which would be obtain by sell the produce would exceed the cost of cultivation : and under these cost of cultivation we must include of course the remuneration of the farmer 's service farmer like other people have to live and they would not take on the troublesome job of farm unless there seem a prospect of make a live out of it the remuneration of the farmer take of course the form not of a salary but of profit : and these profit vary very much from year to year and from place to place and from man to man but they be essentially payment for work do and a ordinary profit must be regard therefore as part of the necessary cost of farming thus it will not be worth while to cultivate a piece of land and the land will in fact lie unused upon which a careful farmer might obtain a profit in the ordinary sense of no more than $ 50 or $ 100 a year the marginal land will be land which yield a decent profit to a decent farmer as well as a gross rent to the landowner sufficient to compensate he for he capital outlay but nothing further what then will be the rent of a fertile and well-situated farm about which there be no doubt that it be well worth cultivate part of the gross rent which the landowner receive must again be regard as merely a return for the capital expend in equip the farm for use but in this case there will be a residue leave over which constitute the net rent of the land the net rent will measure the derive utility of the land to its occupier and will in general represent -lrb- very roughly of course in practice -rrb- the differential advantage of cultivate the land in question rather than land on the margin of cultivation this differential advantage may take either or both of the form of a larger produce per acre or a lower cost of production and marketing but in any case the extra profit which if no rent be charge a decent farmer could obtain by cultivate the farm in question rather than a marginal farm will be roughly equal to the net rent which he landlord can exact from he if he landlord so choose the landlord may of course not choose to exact a rent as high as this and as a matter of fact in a country like great britain landlord often content themselves with less the tradition associate with the ownership of agricultural land and with the relation between landlord and tenant serve to soften the edge of economic law and to subject the rent which be actually fix to the control in no small measure of the general sense of what be fair or customary in such case the landlord make the farmer a present for the time be of part of the economic rent on the other hand as irish agrarian history well illustrate the landlord may sometimes expropriate under the name of rent permanent improvement which be due to the labor or the expenditure of the tenant this be of course particularly likely to happen whenever it be the custom to leave to the tenant the obligation of provide the capital equipment of the farm which in great britain be for the most part the recognize duty of the owner again in the case of urban land in the south of england expropriation of this kind be a essential and well-understood feature of the leasehold system the owner grant a lease for a long period of time usually ninety-nine year for a ground rent which be notoriously below the true economic rent of the land subject to the condition that the leaseholder must erect upon the land and keep in good repair certain building which on expiry of the lease will become the property of the ground owner here the nominal ground rent be only part of the total rent which be really pay the ultimate transference of the building represent often the more important part there be in fact a great variety of system of land tenure some of which be highly complex the respective merit of which vary greatly and which constitute a most important problem for statesman and legislator consideration of this kind in no way diminish the importance of the general analysis of rent which we be pursue in the present chapter rather they make it the more important because we can not properly weigh the merit of any system of land tenure until we have grasp clearly the principle govern the rent of land in the purest form but certainly we must never forget that the rent we be discuss may differ very greatly from though it will vitally influence the money payment which be call rent in actual life it be the pure economic rent the rent which represent the _ full _ annual payment which it would be worth pay to obtain the use of the land alone which will measure as we have say the differential advantage of the land in question over land on the margin of cultivation a clear grasp of this relation help we to perceive that a increase in the prosperity of the community may sometimes influence rent in a unexpected way it all depend on the cause which have give rise to the increase prosperity a advance for instance in agricultural science will facilitate a more abundant supply of foodstuff but it will not necessarily increase the aggregate rent of agricultural land for if it take the form say of the discovery of some new artificial manure it will very likely facilitate production on the less fertile soil far more than it will on the more fertile soil where artificial manure be not so necessary it will thus tend to diminish the differential advantage of work on the more fertile farm and they rent will accordingly fall possibly by much more in the aggregate than any increase in the rent of the farm near the margin of cultivation the point may perhaps be better understand if we pass from agricultural to urban land and ask what would be the effect on site value of a great improvement in the facility of internal transport push the case to a extreme and suppose passenger transport to become so cheap and so quick that there cease to be any advantage in living in a town so as to be near you place of work urban landlord would no longer be able to obtain the high rent they now receive for the site of house in or near a town for most people would prefer to move out into the country where site can be obtain at little more than a agricultural rent the country cover so large a area relatively to the town that the supply of rural site would be still very plentiful as compare with the demand they rent would not therefore rise by very much although the rent of the housing site in town would fall heavily of course there be other factor to be take into account before we could pronounce upon the effect on aggregate rent central site for shop might for instance fetch a higher rental than before the purpose of this discussion be not to generalize but to show the danger of generalize about rent in the aggregate or land as a whole § 4 _ the margin of transference _ the last illustration may serve however to remind we of a obvious fact which we must now take into account the same piece of land may be use for a variety of purpose it may have be use for grow corn and later it may be devote to the building of house or as at slough to a repair depot for motor vehicle it need hardly be say that the land will as a general rule be put to the use in which its value be greatest or to speak more strictly in which the biggest rent or the biggest selling price can be obtain but the notion of the differential advantage which a piece of land possess over the marginal land become decidedly more complicate when we take account of this variety of use let we turn we attention for instance to the site use for shop and office purpose and consider what we can regard as the marginal site in this connection clearly it will not be the marginal land of which we speak above which it only just pay to cultivate and which yield no rent at all for this will probably be agricultural land in a out-of-the-way district where no one would dream of set up a office or a shop any site upon which a sane man would contemplate set up a shop will certainly possess value for other purpose such as house-building hence the marginal site for shopkeeping purpose will not be like we marginal farm a site which yield no rent as regard many piece of land there be no doubt as to the purpose for which they can most profitably be use this piece will command a much higher rent as a shop site than in any other capacity for that piece house-building be the obvious employment for another agriculture but in quite a number of instance there be considerable uncertainty it be not clear whether upon this site it will be better to erect a house or a shop or if the latter what kind of a shop it be not clear whether it will pay to use that farm land for a building scheme and within the domain of agriculture which of course comprise a immense variety of really different industry it be often a very moot point indeed whether a certain field should be leave under grass or bring under the plow case of this sort be not phantom of the imagination they emerge on every side as concrete problem with which some one or other be deal every day and it be these case which constitute the marginal land for the purpose of a particular occupation the marginal site for shop be the site for which it be only just worth while to pay rent sufficient to entice they away from house and the rent for a site in bond street or elsewhere which be so much more suitable for shop purpose that no alternative use would be worth consider will exceed the rent pay for one of these marginal site by roughly speak the extra advantage it possess for shop purpose or will fall short of it it may be well to add to the extent of its comparative disadvantage for there may be many such marginal site some of which will fetch low rent and other very high rent indeed the same site be often of great potential utility for a large variety of occupation between any two occupation there will thus usually be a _ margin of transference _ which we must conceive not as a point but as a irregular line upon or near to which there will be many piece of land differ greatly in the rent which they fetch these variation of rent will correspond to the difference between the advantage or derive utility which the site possess for _ both _ the occupation in question the position of such margin of transference will of course alter as industrial condition change and when they alter the rent of site which be not near any margin of transference will be affect also thus a increase demand for the product of any particular industry will make it profitable for that industry to offer higher rent and thus draw land away from other occupation this will have the effect of raise though possibly to a very slight extent the rent of site which still remain in other use for there will be fewer of they available and they derive utility will consequently be increase but here as everywhere it be upon the margin that we attention should be focus because it be round about the margin -lrb- wherever it be find -rrb- that the change be take place which really matter for society when mr mallaby-deeley buy a estate in covent garden from the duke of bedford the transaction hardly deserve the degree of public interest it excite nothing have happen which be of material consequence to anyone except the two gentleman concern the various site be still use for the various purpose for which they be use before nothing have occur that really matter but when house be pull down for the erection of a cinema or when a field be divert from tillage to pasture something have happen which affect for good or ill the interest of the whole community conversion from tillage to pasture represent indeed a tendency which have be very mark in great britain during the last generation and have arouse misgiving in many public-spirited observer possibly for a variety of reason these misgiving may be justified certainly the problem be well worthy of attention but when in this way the issue be raise of tillage versus pasture it be essential if we be to discuss it rationally that we should envisage it clearly as apply only to a limited portion of agricultural land to the portion which lie somewhere near the margin of transference as thing be now between the two form of agriculture it might be socially desirable to bring under the plow a field which the farmer find it only _ slightly _ more profitable to lease under grass but this would be highly improbable in the case of a field where the balance of argument to the farmer in favor of pasture be overwhelming the position of the margin of transference between different use may in other word be somewhat out of place from the social point of view and it may be desirable by appeal and propaganda even conceivably by the device of state subsidy and compulsion to push it forwards or backwards in greater or less degree but it will be necessarily a matter of degree and nothing could be more foolish than to speak as though there be or could be some ideal method of cultivation equally applicable to all land without regard to they climatic and other condition needless to say none of the agricultural expert who sometimes deplore the decline of arable farming be guilty of such foolishness but the sense of the diversity of nature which be very vivid to they may sometimes be lack in people who live in town and a firm grasp of the marginal notion may serve best to keep the latter from forget it § 5 _ the necessity of rent _ behind all such detailed application there lie a more general consideration which deserve attention the way in which the land of a country be use the way in which it be apportion between the countless alternative employment that be possible be a most important matter more important perhaps than any question as to the size of the income which particular landowner receive by virtue of they rights of ownership how be this apportionment effect as thing be now the answer be clear : mainly by the agency of either rent or price the business which find it worth while to offer the highest rent or the highest price for any piece of land will as a rule be able to command its use and with this as the govern principle a apportionment be secure between shop office factory agriculture between the immense variety of different employment cover by each of these broad heading not a rigid unvarying apportionment but one which constantly change as economic circumstance change and as the margin of transference between different occupation move hither and thither this apportionment take place at present as the result of the independent decision and bargain of many private individual who be think mainly of they own interest and not of those of the community but this state of affair might be alter the land might be nationalize and allocate to its various use by the co-ordinated labor of a great state department or some other agency of the collective will however improbable such a change it be perfectly conceivable but what be not conceivable be that any state department should handle the job with a success even approach that of the present system unless it continue to use as its main instrument the criterion of either rent or price that a piece of land would yield a higher rent in one occupation than in any other be not conclusive evidence that it be best to devote it to the former purpose but it be very good evidence and it should be allow to prevail unless it be demonstrably outweigh as it possibly might often be by consideration of a different kind that it would not be well for the community to employ land in the city of london for corn-growing purpose however desirable might be a revival of home agriculture be so obvious that it may seem to have no bearing on the present issue but it be only a extreme indication of the absurd and wasteful use of we natural resource which would grow up slowly but surely if we dispense with idea of rent and price as sordid irrelevancy and allocate we land on the basis of a balancing of the loftiest argument of a vague and sentimental character if you be prepare for the distribution of land to become stereotyped for each piece to continue indefinitely in its present use then indeed you might dispense with rent as primitive society very largely do that would mean stagnation and for a industrial country decay but if change be ever to be contemplate a simple quantitative measure be the only safeguard against utter chaos thus rent like interest will be find indispensable as a measure under any efficient system of society even if it might not always represent the payment of sum of money to private individual and that be why the principle govern rent possess as i indicate at the outset of this chapter a importance more fundamental than we present system of ownership and tenure § 6 _ the question of real cost _ but we must not forget the preliminary question that start we upon we analysis of the agent of production the rent which a manufacturer or farmer have to pay for he land he naturally include in he cost of production but do this money cost to the individual correspond to and measure any real cost to the community as a whole here let we note in the first place that if only we could disregard the variety of use to which land be put if we could suppose that all industry be agriculture and that agriculture be a single industry with a single product we could argue that rent do not enter into marginal cost at all for we could regard the marginal producer as the one work on a marginal farm whereas we have see there be no pure rent the rent which other producer have to pay would thus represent merely the destination of the surplus profit which arise wherever actual cost fall short of marginal cost this way of look at the matter have prove attractive to some thinker not in the least because of a desire to palliate the effect of landlordism but because it fit in so well with we general sense of rent as a surplus and a surplus as something distinct from a necessary price but it be clearly illegitimate in a economic theory which profess to describe the fact the marginal land for many purpose fetch as we have see a considerable rent and this rent be certainly part of the marginal cost and of the necessary price of the product of the particular industry the answer to we question be however not now very difficult to see land greatly as it differ in many respects from the other agent of production resemble they in the very important respect that be use for one purpose it be not available for other purpose and that the productive power of the community in other direction be thereby diminish this be the real cost to the community which attach to the product of any industry in virtue of the land which it occupy not any human labor or sacrifice require to produce the land itself but the curtailment of the natural resource available for productive use elsewhere this be the real cost of which rent be the money measure and generally speak a accurate measure at the margin of transference between one occupation and another a somewhat fanciful use of the term cost this may seem perhaps one not quite in accordance with we instinctive sense of what real cost should be but possibly the real cost represent by wages and profit may turn out to be not so very different and we have best leave the matter there until we have examine the nature of these other cost § 7 _ rent and sell price _ in this chapter we have speak mainly of the rent rather than the price of land : the relation between the two thing be fairly obvious and well understand but it will be well not to close the chapter without a brief account of it the price of any piece of land be affect by all the consideration on which its rent depend but it be also affect by another factor which have no influence whatever upon rent this factor be the rate of interest the higher the rate of interest the higher the return which a man could obtain by buy gilt-edged security the lower will be the price that he will pay for a piece of land which yield a give rent we can express the relation more precisely by the formulum price = -lrb- rent \* 100 -rrb- \/ -lrb- rate of interest -rrb- though we must be careful in apply this formulum in practice to allow for the possible deviation between the nominal and the true rent and similar complication the price it must be observe be derive in this way from the rent not the rent from the price -lrb- 1 -rrb- rent be thus logically the simpler price the more complex thing it be well therefore to analyze in the first instance the principle of rent if we live in a country where the practice of lease land for annual rent be less common than it be in great britain even if for whatever reason it be the price of land with which we be concern in practice the problem of price contain two distinct element which it be not easy to handle when mix up together for the rate of interest represent in itself a important branch of economics which will require a separate chapter to itself -lrb- footnote 1 : in this the rent of land differ fundamentally from that of other thing such as house for the price of a house be largely influence by the cost of construction of new house and should correspond closely to they in the long run the same relation between rent price and rate of interest will hold good but the rent will be affect by change in the rate of interest owe to the reaction of such change on the supply of house -rrb- chapter vii risk-bearing and enterprise § 1 _ profit and earnings of management _ the profit of a business as they be ordinarily reckon whether for the purpose of income tax or of a balance sheet comprise several element which be fundamentally distinct the relative importance of these various element vary greatly from one type of business to another the profit of a private business include for instance the remuneration of the work of management which in the case of a joint stock company be mostly pay for by salary or director ' fee it be to they profit that farmer small shopkeeper and the partner of a private firm look not merely for a return upon they capital but for the reward of they own labor earnings of management as they be usually term -lrb- though in truth they often cover other and humbler form of labor -rrb- be thus frequently one of the ingredient of profit § 2 _ the payment for risk-bearing _ there be another element of great importance about which we ordinary idea be apt to be so vague that it will be well to devote a chapter to its examination this be the element of payment for risk or rather the reward of risk-bearing risk be inherent in all business as it be inherent in all life the vagary of nature and the vagary of man be alike responsible the farmer may find he harvest ruin by a drought or by a deluge the coal or the gold for the extraction of which you have perhaps set up a extensive mining plant may come to a end which be unexpectedly abrupt you may put you money into roller-skating rink and find that cinema have become the rage with the fickle public sometimes the market may decline for cause which remain obscure but with consequence which be disagreeably plain but while risk be always present in some degree the degree vary enormously from one industry to another now it be obvious enough that in a exceptionally risky industry where there be a considerable possibility that the capital invest will yield no return at all the profit of those concern which succeed be likely to exceed the rate of interest on gilt-edged security but what be likely to be the magnitude of this excess be risk-taking reward if there be any such excess however small or will it suffice that the gain and loss should average out to a fair rate of interest over the whole industry to enable we to think closely let we suppose for a moment that we can measure accurately what the chance be suppose then that there be a precisely equal chance of success on the one hand and failure on the other in any enterprise failure involve a complete loss of all the capital invest suppose further 6 per cent to be at the time a fair return on a perfectly secure investment what would be the return which must be expect from the risky enterprise in the event of its succeed before it will be undertake the reader may be tempt to answer 12 per cent but 12 per cent would not suffice a equal chance of 12 per cent or nothing as compare with a certainty of 6 per cent do not mean that the risk in the former case be pay for to the tune of 6 per cent it mean that it be not pay for at all in each case what a mathematician would call the _ expectation _ be a return of 6 per cent the odds be evenly balance in the long run over a large number of case if the law of average work as we assume it do you would get just as much from the one type of investment as the other now risky enterprise will not as a rule be undertake on term like these investor and business man will not take risk with the odds precisely equal they must have they or believe that they have they in they favor § 3 _ monte carlo and insurance _ to assert this be not to ignore the strength of the appeal which the gambling instinct make to many if not to most of we the taste for gambling be indeed so deep and widespread that it would be foolish to leave it out of account in this connection it be clear enough that at place like monte carlo people be prepare to have the odds unmistakably against they apparently for the sheer pleasure and exhilaration of take risk moreover though for most people play at monte carlo represent a mere holiday indulgence it would be unsafe to assume that what appeal to they there will not also appeal to they in they business affair but what exactly be the secret of the charm of monte carlo it be the great attractive force of a small chance of a large gain as compare with the deterrent force of a large chance of a small loss people will readily pay $ 5 for one chance in a hundred of make no more perhaps than $ 400 or $ 450 and it be very likely that this hold good in the world of business if for example we be to suppose that the promoter of a new enterprise be confront with one chance in fifty of a profit of 50 per cent per annum on they capital as against forty-nine chance of a profit of 5 per cent this might well prove a more attractive prospect than a certain return of 6 per cent although the strict _ expectation _ of profit would be smaller in the former case but the risk of business enterprise be not often of this type they conform more usually to the opposite type of a large chance of a relatively small gain balance by a small chance of serious loss or entire failure now for almost everyone the possibility of a great loss will count as a deterrent -lrb- just as the possibility of a great gain may count as a attraction -rrb- for much more than its strict actuarial value the truth of this proposition be demonstrate by the existence of institution more impressive than monte carlo -- the insurance company which play so large a part in the economic life of modern time every year and upon a ever-growing scale both private individual and business concern pay sum of money which reach in the aggregate a colossal sum as premium to insure themselves against loss by fire shipwreck burglary death death duty against every risk which insurance company will cover now insurance company be not as we say in business for they health they find they business profitable and pay good dividend to they shareholder moreover they incur a considerable expenditure on office on clerical staff on agent and the like all these payment must be defray out of the premium they receive so that it be plain that the premium greatly exceed the _ expectation _ of the risk insure the odds be heavily in favor of the insurance company -- of that the stupidest person can have no shadow of doubt yet we continue to insure as private individual and as business man and so far from be ashamed of we proceedings as a weak and nerveless folly which somehow we be unable to resist we blazon they forth in the strong accent of conscious pride we preach insurance to we neighbor as the core of self-regarding duty and if ever we feel a twinge of uneasiness it be lest we too may have omit in some particular to practice what we preach the significance of this be unmistakable be we psychology what it may however deep and irrepressible we taste for derring-do however inadequate the scope which the dull routine of modern life afford for we adventurous impulse we be most of we anxious to avoid the risk of great financial loss we be very glad to find someone to take it off we shoulder if we can so glad that we be prepare to pay he for the service to pay he a sum which cover not only the actuarial equivalent of the risk but something substantial over and above in this we be entirely rational we conduct be justify by the law of the diminish utility of money which be note at the end of chapter iii it would be plainly foolish for instance to substitute for the certainty of a income of $ 2500 per annum a even chance of $ 5000 or nothing since the utility to we of $ 5000 be not twice as great as that of $ 2500 the majority of business risk be not of a kind against which it be possible to insure insurance company confine themselves to risk which be mainly a matter of what we call objective rather than subjective chance ie risk in respect of which knowledge of detailed fact peculiar to the individual case be of minor importance but such knowledge be of paramount importance in the case of ordinary business risk if for example a new enterprise be to be undertake the special knowledge and experience which its promoter possess be a vital factor in determine they estimate of the risk involve a outsider with no special knowledge would necessarily require to estimate the risk far more highly if we be to form a rational opinion on the basis of _ he _ knowledge so great indeed would be the risk to he that we can lay it down as a sound maxim that people be extremely rash who invest they money in risky undertaking about which they know very little this subjective aspect of business risk have a significance to which it will be necessary to revert but though most business risk be not and can not be a matter for premium and policy the principle which the practice of insurance illustrate apply none the less in the light of they knowledge and experience the promoter of a new undertaking must weigh up the chance of failure and success though they will not do so by the precise method of a actuary they will require that any chance of serious loss should be balance by such chance of exceptional gain as would raise the _ expectation _ of profit well above the normal return on secure investment the more risky the project seem the greater generally speak must be the _ expectation _ of profit require to induce people to undertake it if we suppose business man to calculate reasonably it follow that the average profit in any industry over a long period of year reckon in the loss of the concern which disappear altogether be likely to be higher the more risky be the industry such a result will not of course occur in every case even when the calculation be reasonable they may be entirely falsify by the event moreover business man may not calculate reasonably on the information which they have but unless we suppose they judgment to be subject to a prevail bias in one direction ie to be unduly optimistic as a general rule _ we _ should expect and in any case _ they _ must expect profit above the ordinary in a risky industry this conclusion be sufficiently important far too many people though they admit it when it be expressly state and dismiss it even as a tiresome commonplace be apt to neglect it when the occasion for apply it arise for example the great importance to any industry of good management be generally recognize and the consequent desirability of pay adequate salary to the managerial staff the importance of secure a supply of capital be very widely recognize and the practical necessity of pay a fair rate of interest be thus however grudgingly concede but the residuary profit as they be call which accrue at present to the owner of a business be denounce in some quarter in a sweeping fashion which seem to ignore altogether the all-pervading element of risk people speak as though you might appropriately limit profit in every industry to some uniform percentage on the capital employ without make it clear whether you would even be allow to make up in good year for the loss incur in bad the effect of introduce any such crude device into we present industrial system could only be to paralyze enterprise of a unusually risky kind which so far from be push to a excess at present be more probably curtail unduly from the standpoint of what be socially desirable like the fix of a low maximum price for a commodity it would cause the supply to wither up and disappear § 4 _ risk under large-scale organization _ while this be true of the present economic system the question be worth consider whether it represent a fundamental necessity whether for instance under we world socialist commonwealth the factor of risk-bearing need play so important a part as it do in the actual business world this question can not be answer with a conclusive simplicity oppose consideration present themselves between which it be not easy to strike a balance on the one hand in accordance with the law of average gain and loss tend to cancel out over a large series of transaction _ when reasonable calculation have be make _ thus insurance company while they take heavy risk off the shoulder of policy-holder incur relatively trifling risk themselves they can predict the aggregate sum which they will be call upon to pay within a small margin of error in the same way it might seem that every enlargement of the scale of business would make for a automatic insurance and a consequent economy of risk and thus that if all business be comprise in a single financial unit gain and loss would cancel out over so wide a range that the degree of risk remain would be almost negligible this might indeed happen if business risk be mainly of that objective kind in which the insurance company specialize for then we could assume that the chance of success or failure would be estimate reasonably but in fact most business risk not be of this kind must be estimate by process of human judgment which be very fallible and here we must take account of the law of average in another aspect with a different bearing on the argument when a industry comprise a large number of separate concern and the decision accordingly be take by many man act independently of one another the error of calculation will tend to some extent to cancel one another out the undue optimism of one man will be balance by the undue pessimism of another and if there be no prevail bias in either direction the error of judgment will not affect the result for the industry as a whole but where the effective decision be take by very few man the chance be far greater of a preponderating balance of error in one direction the risk dependent on the factor of human judgment tend therefore to increase this truth can be illustrate by a phenomenon which be fairly familiar it be recognize by intelligent person that the risk of speculation in a particular commodity market or stock market increase more than proportionately to the scale of operation a man who set out as a bull upon a small scale can buy without send up the price against he in the process and if he decide later that he judgment be mistaken he can at any time cut he loss and sell out without much difficulty but a bull on a very large scale can not complete he purchase except at a price which have be raise in consequence of he own action and he can not count on be able to unload at or near the market price should he decide to do so if accordingly he miscalculate he can not save himself from serious loss as a smaller man might do by a prompt discovery of he error he difficulty spring from the fundamental fact that the effect of he calculation be too great to be offset by those of the different and often opposite calculation of other man upon the issue whether a growth in the size of the business unit be likely to diminish risk the law of average thus cut both way the risk arise from the element of pure chance be more likely those arise from miscalculation be less likely to cancel out upon these grounds alone it would be unsafe to conclude that there would be on balance a economy of risk under any system of national or world socialism § 5 _ the entrepreneur _ there remain however a aspect of the problem which be perhaps more important than those discuss above it be probable that risk would be estimate and undertake more wisely or less wisely under a different system of society or of industrial organization upon this issue method of precise analysis be out of place but we may have something to learn from the emphatic testimony of tradition it have become a axiom of business man that while government can manage with more or less competence a safe and routine business like a postal service they success would be unlikely to prove conspicuous in undertaking where the element of risk be great there it be say we owe everything in the past to the enterprise of individual man -lrb- for even joint-stock company have not be notable as pioneer -rrb- adventure they own fortune in accordance with they own unfettered judgment this contention however much we may desire to qualify it have unquestionably a large measure of truth and the explanation be not difficult to discover for the wise taking of risk in industrial development of a experimental character peculiar condition and special quality be require first it be necessary to envisage distinctly the promising though risky opportunity and this call not infrequently for imagination of a none too common order then it must be study with insight and expert knowledge and weigh by process which be as much intuitive as intellectual the reason for or against take a particular business risk be seldom such as can adequately be express in term of arithmetic or even by clear argument the soundness of which be proportion to they logical cogency the mysterious faculty of judgment enter in and from mental process which defy analysis there emerge ultimately conviction and the will to act but it be precisely here that government department be apt to fail it be here that the individual who need consult no one but himself have a pull over any form of organization where decision be reach by the method of debate and agreement among a heterogeneous committee hence it be that we have come to regard exceptional risk-taking as the peculiar province of individual enterprise it be probable that these deficiency of corporate organization be tend to diminish and it be a interesting question how far it may be find possible to eliminate they in the future meanwhile the above consideration have a important bearing on the reward which can often be obtain from risky enterprise the number of individual who be in a position to envisage a business opportunity and to assess with some confidence the chance of success and failure be very limited not only must they possess special knowledge ability imagination confidence in they own judgment and the capacity to act on it they must also have at they disposal considerable financial resource to combine all these advantage represent a union of circumstance which be distinctly rare the fortunate few who do combine they be thus generally able to extract in the form of profit a high price for they service a price which cover not only the strict reward of risk-bearing and the necessary remuneration of they own service but a handsome payment for the special quality and advantage which have be indicate profit moreover may vary between one industry and another not only in accordance with the real risk which be entail but with the degree to which the supply of special knowledge etc be scarce or abundant this consideration go a long way to explain the large fortune which enterprising business man be often able to amass it also throw some much-needed light upon the function which such man discharge they perform to a large extent the work of management they supply capital on what may be a considerable scale but it be the taking of business risk which be perhaps they most characteristic function it be the union of these function which distinguish they as a essentially different type from the salaried manager who have invest he savings in rubber or in oil in other language there be a specific name for the man who combine all these three function in french he be call a entrepreneur in german a unternehmer it be much to be regret that in english we have no clear corresponding word the word capitalist be not uncommonly employ to do duty in this connection but this be a source of much confusion for the word be also use and more appropriately to include all investor whether or not they be active business man § 6 _ risk-taking and control _ but there be a ally confusion of more importance we commonly suppose it to be a lead feature of we present capitalist system that the control of industry rest in the hand of those who supply the capital nor as a general statement be this untrue but it conceal the essential point strictly speak it be risk-taking with which control be associate the mere lending of money carry with it no title to control government and municipality concede no such title to the subscriber to they loan nor do a company to its debenture holder the shareholder ' ultimate control be base upon the fact that they bear the financial risk of the concern nor be this a matter of mere legal form it be not uncommon for ordinary share to carry with they a greater voting power than the preference share of a corresponding value the principle which such arrangement endeavor to express be clear : control should rest with he who bear the risk it be with this principle rather than with a mulish insistence on the rights of property that advocate of worker ' control and the like have get to reckon it be upon this ground that -lrb- as they may quite conceivably do -rrb- they must make good they case § 7 _ general analysis of profit _ let we conclude this chapter by clear the ground for the next earnings of management payment for risk-taking and for the special knowledge and advantage associate with it be ingredient of the gross profit of a business the chief element that remain be that of interest on capital frequently indeed it be not the only one as we see in the last chapter a farmer may not be require by he landlord to pay the full economic rent for he farm and he may therefore make profit above the normal level above the ordinary return for he own service he own capital expenditure and the risk to which he be necessarily expose in such a case the farmer be really the recipient as we have already suggest of part of the economic rent of the land and a element of rent accordingly enter into he gross profit but profit may include a surplus element which may arise in a great variety of other way a business may possess some decide advantage which be not open to competitor and it may reap high profit accordingly you can for instance if you choose regard the high money profit which as be suggest in chapter iv be likely to accrue in future to the owner of pre-war factory as a surplus profit of this kind but while as this illustration indicate the phenomenon of surplus profit become of very great importance when we seek to study the distribution of wealth it need not detain we here for the surplus element arise only in so far as the cost of a business be lower than the marginal cost and it be the marginal cost which with good reason we be now endeavor to analyze the marginal cost must include a normal profit ie a profit which will cover earnings of management the reward of risk and enterprise interest on capital but nothing further it remain then only to consider this last element of interest chapter viii capital § 1 _ a reference to marx _ interest be the price pay simply for the use of capital but what be capital and in what do its use consist what claim have it to be regard as a independent factor of production we very familiarity with the term we habit of employ it with the rich looseness of every-day life be a obstacle to the clearness of thought which be again essential we recognize most of we clearly enough that capital although we reckon it in term of money consist like income of real thing factory machinery material and the like it be quite obvious that these thing be of use be indeed indispensable for production what more natural than that capital should command a price it almost seem as though we might pass without further ado to a detailed discussion of the force which determine the amount of this price but this account do not bring out the essential point as brief reference to a very famous controversy will show some ingenious writer in the last century the most notable of whom be karl marx set out to prove that in we modern society workpeople be exploit rob of the whole produce of they labor to the full extent of the return which accrue to capital the argument be exceedingly complex in detail but it boil down to this : the factory and machinery which be admittedly essential to production be themselves produce in exactly the same way as consumable goods they be produce by labor work with the assistance of nature and again if you choose of capital in the form of further factory machinery etc but these further capital goods can in they turn be regard as the product of labor nature and capital and so we can proceed until it seem as though the element of capital must disappear in the last analysis as though labor and nature be the sole ultimate agent of production and the reward of capital represent no more than the exercise of the exploiter 's power in one form or another this argument still dominate the mind of a large proportion of the so-called rebel against the exist social order if we be to meet this argument if which be perhaps more important we be to understand the true nature of capital we can not rest content with say that it consist of factory and machinery and that these be essential to the worker just as it be well to get behind the money term in which we often think of capital to the real goods so we have now to get behind the real goods to something else what this something else be the first chapter may have already do something to reveal § 2 _ wait for production _ between production and consumption there be a interval of time all productive process take time to accomplish the farmer must plow the soil and sow the seed month before he can reap the harvest which will reward he for he effort meanwhile he must live and in order that he may live he must consume if he employ laborer he must pay they wages that they too may consume and live for both purpose he require purchase power which represent of course command over real thing and if he have not sufficient purchase power of he own he must borrow from someone else who have in either case it be not enough that the farmer and he laborer should work no less essential be it that someone should _ wait _ the farmer must wait till he have sell he crop both for the reward of he own labor and for the repayment of the wages he advance in the meantime to he laborer or if he can not afford to wait and borrow in anticipation of the harvest then the lender must wait until the farmer have sell he crop be able to repay he thus the period of time involve in all production give rise to a demand for _ wait _ which someone or other must supply if the production be to take place it be this wait which be the essential reality underlie the phenomenon of capital and interest it be really this which constitute a independent factor of production distinct from labor and nature and equally necessary § 3 _ wait for consumption _ but let we carry the argument a step further after the farmer have sell he crop there be many stage through which they must pass at each of which more wait be require before they reach the ultimate consumer but then the wait be at a end this however be by no mean the case with a great number of commodity let we take the case of a speculative builder while he be build a house he like the farmer must wait -lrb- or find someone to wait on he behalf -rrb- for he own reward and for the repayment of he expenditure on wages and material but after the house be build if he let it to a tenant for a annual rent he waiting be far from over not until many year have pass will the rent payment add up to a sum which equal or exceed he outlay he may of course sell the house and thus bring he wait to a end but then the purchaser must wait no matter whether or not he be the occupier for no one would consider the use of a house for a day a month or a year as a adequate return for the price it cost to buy the occupier-owner pay for the prospect of its use for a long and perhaps indefinite number of year ahead and he must wait to enjoy the benefit for which he pay now in full waiting be as inherent in the consumption of durable thing as it be in all production now most industry be consumer of durable thing of a very expensive kind here we come back to the factory and machinery which ordinarily spring to we mind at the mention of the word capital not merely do the construction of these thing involve wait they consumption involve wait on a vastly larger scale just as with a house many year must elapse before they derive utility can even approximate to they purchase price it be mainly to supply the wait involve in the consumption of such durable goods that a typical joint-stock company issue share for public subscription the wait require to cover the period of time which its own productive process require be largely supply by means of bank overdraft or other form of short-period borrowing more strictly fix capital represent the wait involve in the consumption of durable thing circulate capital the wait involve in current production this distinction lose its sharpness when we consider not the affair of a particular business but the industrial system as a whole then the period of time involve in the consumption of durable instrument fall into place as part of the time require for the production of the ultimate consumer ' goods we can even perhaps conceive of a average period of production for industry and commerce as a whole and this conception be not without its use for it serve to bring out the fact that the period of consumption and the period of production in the narrower sense be only two aspect of the same fundamental thing the interval of time which elapse between work and the utility which be its ultimate purpose it serve moreover to make clear that anything which lengthen this interval of time increase the demand for wait or in other word the demand for capital and conversely that anything which shorten this interval diminish the demand for capital § 4 _ capital not a stock of consumable goods _ but the distinction between the two form of wait though not fundamental be none the less worth note it enable we to keep we theory in conformity with fact to look at the phenomenon of capital the right way up and it be easy if we be not careful to slip into the habit of look at it upside down people sometimes speak as though the commodity which constitute we capital instead of be mainly as we plain sense tell we that they be factory machinery and other durable instrument be rather a _ store _ or _ stock _ of immediately consumable goods the argument take the following form it be consumer ' goods thing like food and clothes which the farmer the builder and they workpeople consume while they be work to enable they to work therefore it be vital that such thing should not in the past have be consume as soon as they be make part of they must have be save and carry forward for future use furthermore the longer the time that the work on which people be now engage take to yield its product the larger must be this store of consumer ' goods for these product when they be complete will serve -lrb- take society as a whole -rrb- to replace the store which in the meantime be be use up so that the longer this replacement take the larger must be the initial store conversely the larger the store of consumer ' goods available the more distant be the future for which we can afford to work it be thus the store or stock of consumer ' goods which represent we real capital for it be the magnitude of this store which determine how far we can devote we energy to purpose which be remote in time now this be pure mysticism regard literally it be in direct conflict with the fact the process of industry be fairly regular and continuous at any moment large quantity of consumer ' goods of almost every kind be on the point of completion at the same moment equally large quantity be consume the thing which we buy be finish very likely only recently or if in fact they have lie idle for some time in stock there be nothing essential or at all helpful in that fact it represent rather a defect -- a maladjustment which should be rectify even many kind of agricultural produce do not need to be carry forward from one year to another for they be produce in many part of the world where the season come at different period of the year it be conceivable therefore that we might consume all non-durable thing the moment they be ready and the degree to which we approximate to this ideal be a mark of the efficiency of we economic system a large store of consumable goods be thus _ not _ a fundamental necessity of a prosperous society what _ be _ necessary be plainly the power to produce these thing in large quantity as they be require and this power be furnish by the durable instrument of production which we thus rightly regard as the true representative of modern capital if it be argue that this power to produce consumable goods may be regard as be _ in effect _ a store of consumable goods it must be sternly reply that this be the language of symbolism not of science and that symbolism be highly dangerous in this connection the false conception of capital as essentially a store of consumer ' goods have lead and still lead to many serious fallacy it be this that give rise to the notorious doctrine of the wages fund the notion that the sum which can at any time be pay in wages be equal to the quantity of capital _ alia _ consumable goods which happen to exist to this day it block with a undergrowth of obscurantist controversy the way to a straightforward account of the problem of trade cycle § 5 _ the essence of wait _ but it be with positive conclusion that we must here concern ourselves what be the essence of this wait as we have call it what be its result from the point of view of the community the individual who save and lend wait in the obvious sense that he postpone consumption he forego he right to purchase now a quantity of consumer ' goods in consideration of the prospect of purchase a larger quantity of such thing in the future from the standpoint of the whole community there be a similar postponement of consumption though it need not commence so soon the store of consumable goods be what it be : the quantity of goods in _ process _ of manufacture which will shortly be come forward be also what it be for some time therefore a sudden access of saving can not affect the quantity of goods available for consumption and if in fact they should be consume less rapidly that will represent a unfortunate defect not a essential condition of a smoothly work system the _ necessary _ consequence come later the increase saving will cause labor material land agent of production generally to be devote to distant purpose man will be set to work produce durable goods largely durable instrument of production like ship or railway or factory or plant if the increase saving be considerable the labor material etc require for these purpose will be withdraw even under we present system as under a smoothly work system they clearly must be from the production of other and more immediately consumable thing hence some time later the supplies of consumable thing will be diminish while at a later period still they will be more than correspondingly increase as the result of the assistance of the new durable instrument that be the essence of save from the social standpoint a early future be sacrifice to a more remote future the aggregate consumable income of the present be unaffected the aggregate consumable income of the near future be actually diminish it be not until at least some year later that the aggregate consumable income be increase § 6 _ individual and social saving _ this conclusion be important : but there be a obvious misinterpretation against which it will be well to guard it be customary for social moralist to preach thrift and saving as a public duty and to impart to they appeal a special note of urgency in time like the present when as the result of the havoc of the war destitution be widespread over europe now obviously these adviser do not mean to recommend something which will impoverish the world next year and the year after and the benefit of which will accrue only in a distant future : it be the immediate urgency of the world 's need which be rather the substance of they case nor would it be right to conclude that these wise man be the victim of a delusion and advocate a course the consequence of which they do not understand the explanation of the paradox be simple the more the community as a whole save now the less in the near future will be the aggregate consumable income of the whole community : but not of the _ remainder _ of the community exclusive of the saver it be the saver who must wait whose consumption must be postpone to perhaps a distant future but _ at no time _ do he saving result in a smaller income of consumable goods for other people the aggregate consumable income of the near future will be diminish but it may be better distribute and it may consist of thing of a different _ kind _ for consumer ' goods we must remember comprise champagne and motor car as well as food and clothes and if a rich man save it may be purely article of luxury the production of which will shortly be diminish moreover if he saving have the effect of transfer purchase power to impoverished people like those in central europe it will not be devote to a distant future it will very likely be devote to quite immediate end in other word it may not result in any creation of capital it may not represent any saving on the part of the community as a whole a relatively rich man wait and a relatively poor man _ anticipate _ he income to a corresponding extent and it be precisely this that be so urgently desirable in a time of widespread poverty and chaos this be no matter of hair-splitting and make plain thing obscure while it be always better for the _ rest _ of we that a individual who can afford to save should save rather than spend -lrb- though it might be better for we still if we could have he money to spend ourselves -rrb- and while this be the more important the greater be the poverty which generally prevail yet as a community we can not save so much we _ ought _ not to save so much when we be impoverish as when we be prosperous it be vital to appreciate this truth because as we shall see by no means all the saving of the world be do by individual there be many form of collective saving which take place in actual fact still more which we be often urge to undertake and it be of practical importance to realize that the very consideration which call most urgently for individual thrift forbid a great indulgence in such project a time of national poverty be not a time when it be suitable for the state to embark on large scheme of capital development : we require we resource for more immediate end face with such problem we practical sense may no doubt suffice to keep we straight but it be apt to do so at the expense of a complete inversion of the real issue if for instance we call for governmental retrenchment on what we deem extravagant policy of housing and education we usually speak as though they represent the profligacy of a spendthrift as contrast with the saving that be indispensable the truth be rather that these policy represent a save a investment for future purpose which may conceivably be greater -lrb- this must not be take as represent my personal opinion -rrb- than the community can properly afford this be another instance of what i mean by look at the problem of capital the right way up § 7 _ the necessity of interest _ it be only now that we be in a position to appreciate the true function of a rate of interest and the nature of its claim to be regard as a real cost interest it be sometimes say be necessary to provide for the future it be far more certain that interest be necessary to provide for the present it be a matter of legitimate doubt how far it be necessary to _ pay _ interest to secure a supply of capital there be no doubt at all that it be necessary to _ charge _ interest to limit the demand for it as we see in chapter i a world socialist commonwealth would require to retain a rate of interest if only as a matter of bookkeeping in order to choose between the various capital undertaking that be technically possible and this be the primary function which the fate of interest fulfil in we present-day society it separate the sheep from the goat it serve as a screen by means of which capital project be sift and through which only those be allow to pass which will benefit the future in a high degree for this essential purpose it be hard to imagine how a better instrument could be devise § 8 _ the supply of capital _ let we dwell for a moment on this image of a screen or sieve one condition of a good sieve be that its mesh should all be of the same size this condition the rate of interest almost perfectly fulfil but it be also important that the mesh should be of the _ right _ size whether this be true of the actual rate of interest be a far more doubtful matter it be indeed plain that it be not altogether devoid of merit in this respect in time of general world poverty like those which follow upon a great war it be desirable as have be argue that more of we productive resource should be devote to immediately useful purpose and a smaller portion dedicate to a distant future this readjustment the rate of interest help to bring about for it rise to a higher level and there be accordingly a strong inducement to all manufacturer and trader to economize they use of capital and thus to set free productive resource for more urgent need but while the mesh of the sieve as it be contract in time when it be desirable that they should contract we have no reason for suppose that they will contract in just the degree that be desire neither more nor less or indeed that at any time they approximate to the right size we in the twentieth century owe much of the material wealth that we enjoy to the fact that over the last century man save as largely as they do but we natural gratitude should not restrain we from doubt whether they be really well advise to do so if we ask the question _ how _ they manage to do so we doubt be deepen for first place among the explanation must be assign to the inequality in the then distribution of wealth it be because many man in england be rich enough to save that we railway be build and the resource of new continent be open up but england a century or even half a century ago be not really a rich community and if the national income in those day have be distribute more evenly among the people can we doubt that they would have spend a far larger proportion of it on immediate need can we doubt that they would have be right to do so we may rather doubt in view of the reaction of poverty on physical and mental efficiency on social harmony even possibly on population whether we to-day would have be really injure as much as might appear how then can we suppose that the sum of the amount which it suit individual to save will bear any close relation to the resource which the community can properly devote to future end be we to regard a unjust distribution of wealth as a mysterious dispensation of providence for secure perfect harmony between the future and the present the point need not be labor further there be no grounds for assume that we save as a community even roughly what we ought to save if we wish to believe we do we must turn for support from economics to theology it be important to be clear upon this issue in order to distinguish it from another with which it sometimes seem to be confuse this be the question briefly outline in chapter ii of the effect of change in the rate of interest on the supply of capital as be there indicate there be good reason for suppose that a fall in the rate of interest would induce some people to save more and conversely but the balance of probability be in favor of the conclusion that the _ net _ effect of change in the rate of interest though perhaps slight be usually of the more ordinary kind the decisive argument in this connection be the fact upon which we have just touch that savings be supply largely by people who be relatively rich and who become richer when the rate of interest rise for at this point it be necessary to be careful it be easy to slide from the above conclusion into a argument of the follow kind a higher rate of interest lead to more save it be thus necessary to _ evoke _ more save it be thus require as a _ incentive _ to induce people to incur the _ sacrifice _ of wait this sacrifice represent the real cost for which interest be pay this terminology of incentive inducement and sacrifice be of very dubious validity a rich man who be make richer by a rise in the rate of interest will probably save more but it will be rather because he have become richer than because he be tempt by the higher rate : and the less we talk about he sacrifice the better nor be it clear that the attraction of a high rate of interest be a operative factor on the mind of a man to whom save mean a real sacrifice of immediate comfort or enjoyment certainly it be only one among many factor and seldom a important one a really poor man will think not so much of the annual income which will accrue from he savings as of the capital sum upon which he or he family can fall back if a rainy day should come and for this purpose he might save as much as he save now even if there be no interest to be obtain thereby he might even be prepare to lend what he have save at least to bank -lrb- a deposit with a bank be in effect a loan -rrb- for the mere advantage of safe custody the people who save rather for the sake of the capital sum that can be realize than for that of the annual interest be very numerous and probably include many man in receipt of quite considerable earn income moreover those who consider mainly the future annual income which they savings will yield they be usually more concerned with its absolute amount than with the ratio it bear to the amount they must save in order to acquire it for this reason as have be often recognize they may save less when the rate of interest rise since a smaller quantity of savings will insure to they the future annual income they desire to obtain there be no need to be dogmatic upon any of these point the psychology of saving be both complex and obscure we conclusion must be the negative one that we have insufficient evidence to warrant the assertion that the particular rate of interest which happen to prevail be a measure of the sacrifice involve in save even in the case of what we might regard as the marginal saving and if we can not assert this we must be careful not to assume it as the basis of other argument or as part of a general analysis of price or exchange value it be of some interest to observe that the difficulty which we world socialist commonwealth would encounter if it attempt to dispense with the rate of interest would not necessarily include that of obtain a supply of capital it might indeed not find it easy to determine the proportion in which it should allocate its productive resource between immediate and distant end we present system can not be say to have evolve satisfactory principle for the solution of this question and the socialist commonwealth would have to work out its own solution but when it direct that labor and material should be devote to purpose of long-period utility there would be a automatic collective saving of which no one would be conscious as a individual sacrifice even at the present time we capital be not supply entirely by the savings of individual but to a extent which though quite incalculable be yet certainly considerable by involuntary saving of a essentially similar type to the above § 9 _ involuntary saving _ when a municipality embark on a municipal tramway scheme or any other industrial enterprise and pay off by means of a sinking-fund the capital which it borrow in the first instance the proceeding amount as the defender of municipal trading have rightly claim to a compulsory and unconscious saving on the part of the citizen they consumption have be postpone willy-nilly as the result of the increase rate or the high charge which they have have to pay and when the subscriber to the original loan have be pay off the capital of the community be enhance to the extent of that loan central government might similarly increase the supply of capital by devote annual revenue to capital purpose though they actual record as it happen be mainly of a different kind but what be chiefly a possibility in the case of government have actually be carry out on a enormous scale by other institution the development of the joint-stock company system have introduce a new factor into the problem of the supply of capital which be of immense though but dimly perceive importance the director of a company be technically no more than the servant of the shareholder it be the profit of the shareholder that it be the director ' duty to promote with a single mind and the whole capital of the concern include its reserve both open and conceal be the shareholder ' exclusive property but reality have a way of differ from form and just as in political affair it be common to regard the state as a very different thing to the people who compose it as a sublime entity with a separate existence of its own so director be apt to distinguish between the company and the shareholder it be the company to which they owe allegiance to pay away in dividend to shareholder money which they could employ in extend the business or strengthen the position of the company appear to some director a necessity hardly less unpleasant than a increase wages bill or a excess profit duty concession must indeed be make to the shareholder ' rapacity : but when something have be do in this direction dust can easily be throw in they not very observant eye reserve which within limit be a necessity of sound finance can be accumulate beyond those limit and when the further limit of a extreme but just arguable conservatism have be pass there remain the innumerable device know to every resourceful board of hidden reserve the secret of which be unmenaced by the meager information of a balance-sheet in all this the shareholder as the director occasionally assure themselves have no real grievance for he will gain in the long run from the appreciation in the capital value of he share all and perhaps more than all that he forego in the meantime in the way of dividend in the long run the shareholder be not injure but in the meantime he be in effect compel without any consciousness of the proceed to save and to reinvest in the company a portion of the dividend which he might otherwise have spend the reserve which be accumulate be not allow to lie idle : they be employ either in what be really capital extension of the business or in the purchase of outside security and in either case they represent a increase in the total supply of capital the principal which these proceedings represent be capable of indefinite extension but however possible it might be to secure a supply of capital without the inducement of a rate of interest that rate be indispensable for deal with the demand it be no good say three per cent seem a fair rate of interest let we try and limit it to that give the amount of savings which be supply the rate of interest must be allow to reach whatever figure be necessary to confine the demand to that amount give the quantity of resource which you have available for future need the mesh of the sieve must be make as narrow as be necessary to confine the project that pass through within those limit and so indeed it become necessary for any particular business to pay for its capital interest at the market rate not so much to secure the saving of it as to secure its allocation from the common pool § 10 _ interest and distribution _ it be unavoidable that this interest should accrue to whoever it be that supply the capital if the capital be supply as it might conceivably be collectively by the community the interest would accrue to the community and all would be well but as thing be the capital be supply mainly by the savings of individual and largely by individual confine to a relatively narrow class the profit of capital have thus a vital influence on the very serious matter of the distribution of wealth between social class now as experience show there be no element in profit which be capable of such radical change in so short a space of time as be the rate of interest even before the war it have become hard for people in great britain to realize that 3 per cent consol have stand at 114 as late as 1896 how blest write two cynical satirist of society in the same period : how bless the prudent man the maiden pure whose income be both ample and secure arise from consolidated three per cent annuity pay quarterly -lrb- 1 -rrb- it be impossible to read those line now without a sense of irony different from that which they be intend to convey not only be the rate of interest now double what it be a generation ago we have no good reason to suppose that the present high level will quickly be reduce the havoc of the war of which the widespread poverty of europe and the huge debt of government be but two different aspect make it almost inevitable that the rate should rule high in the present decade this can not but exercise a profound influence of a most disquieting character on the general level of profit and to a lesser extent -lrb- for here we must allow for the effect of high taxation -rrb- on the distribution of real wealth between social class here we be on the threshold of tremendous issue we almost feel the earth quake beneath we foot we hear the muffle roar of far-reaching social controversy : and ` mid this tumult kublum hear from far ancestral voice prophesy war -lrb- footnote 1 : _ narcissus _ by samuel butler and henry festing jone -rrb- chapter ix labor § 1 _ a retrospect on laissez-faire _ when a century and a half ago the foundation be be lay in the western world of systematic economic theory the public attention be much occupy with a subject which indeed have not cease to hold it : that of the failing of government the general interest in that topic be share by the pioneer of economic thought of whom in great britain adam smith be the most notable it be indeed they practical concern with the concrete economic issue of the day which very naturally give the impetus to they scientific quest it be hardly less natural that they should have express they opinion on these concrete issue with considerable emphasis now the keynote of they practical conclusion be that government be do immense mischief by meddle with a great many matter which they would have do better to leave alone in this they be in general agreement with one another incidentally -- let there be no mistake about it -- they be right but as invariably happen in public controversy they opinion become crystallize in a compact formulum or cry with unduly sweeping implication this be the cry of _ laissez-faire _ let government preserve law and order and leave the economic sphere alone the economist pick no quarrel with this formulum it serve well enough for workaday purpose to indicate the line of policy which they rightly think essential in they day the history of this cry be the history of every cry which have win a wide acceptance from mankind it do good work for perhaps half a century but then many crime be commit in its name the instrument which have be forge to clear away a noxious tariff jungle and the monstrous law of settlement be turn against lord shaftesbury and the factory act not only be inaction recommend to government as the highest wisdom other institution like trade union be warn off the economic grass a ideal of perfect competition become a idol to which much human flesh and blood be sacrifice but what be more to we present purpose the idea take root of a intimate association between the law of economics and the policy of _ laissez-faire _ people who oppose some long-overdue measure of state regulation believe themselves to be justify by the eternal verity of economic law and this claim even the advocate of the measure seldom venture to dispute they take refuge rather in a conception of economic law as a dangerous monster whose claw must be clip in the interest of the higher good this notion that all interference with so-called free competition be a violation -lrb- though very likely fully justified -rrb- of economic law have sink deep into we common think so that to this day whenever we see at work the hand of a state department a trust or a trade union we be apt to say demand and supply be here in abeyance and possibly we add a good thing too since in the matter of wages the hand of the trade union be very generally evident it be impossible to discuss the subject-matter of this chapter until we have rid we mind of this quite baseless prepossession to sweep away this cobweb i urge the reader to recall here the general tenor of the analysis of the precede chapter whether we be deal with the price of a ordinary commodity with joint product land or capital we come across relationship which seem altogether more fundamental than we present industrial system nor we may incidentally observe be we ever require to suppose that the present system be one of perfect competition these relationship be almost invariably such that even a world socialist commonwealth would find it necessary to maintain they it be not suggest and most certainly it must not be think that a world socialist commonwealth or even a more modest remodeling of the social order would not effect great change possibly for good and possibly for ill the same economic law might be make to bear very different fruit but they themselves would remain unchanged what be true in all these other field -- this should be we predisposition -- be not likely to be quite untrue in the field of labor § 2 _ idea and institution _ another point be worth note here we be sometimes advise to distinguish sharply between what should be and what be often two very different thing the advice be pertinent and useful particularly in the sphere of sociology but we incorrigible habit of confuse the two thing together be not without justification or at least excuse for in fact they gravitate towards one another with a force which be just as strong as the capacity of man for understanding and control he environment when we have a system which be clearly bad _ and _ when we see we way to make it better we generally make the change however tardily we sense of what should be thus react upon what be meanwhile until we can make the system better we appreciation of what be affect we sense of what should be and the more so as we be sensible for what should be be pre-eminently a affair of relativity a man may hold very strongly that equal pay to every individual be desirable as he put it as a ideal but this will not prevent he in a world in which manager be pay far more than manual worker from maintain hotly -lrb- at any rate if he be sensible -rrb- that to pay the manager of a particular concern a manual worker 's wage would be monstrously unfair he would also argue that it would be highly inexpedient equity and expediency be in fact intricately intertwine in we sense of what should be and we sense of what should be in the particular be govern by we knowledge of what be in the general these may seem unnecessary commonplace but they have a vital bearing on the _ modus operandus _ of economic law these law do not work _ in vacuo _ they work through the medium of the act of man the act of man be greatly influence by they institution and by they idea of right and wrong both institution and idea may serve to smooth rather than obstruct the path of economic law because the law may represent either what should be in the general or what be in the general and therefore what should be in the particular this may hold true even of a trade union or a sense of fair wages the business of economic theory be not to justify a regime of _ laissez-faire _ still less to show the folly of bring moral into business its value be rather that it may help we by improve we understanding to shape we institution and to adopt we moral sentiment so as to promote the public welfare with these general notion in we mind let we turn to see how stand the case with labor § 3 _ the general wage level _ the term labor may be use in a broad or in a narrow sense it may be confine to weekly wage-earner : it may be extend to include all those who work as the phrase go with either hand or brain it be with all class of labor in the broadest sense of the term that we must here concern ourselves it will be convenient however in the first instance to ignore the difference between they and to consider the force which determine what we may regard as the general wage-level the general law of supply and demand hold good the wages of labor tend to a level at which the demand be equal to the supply for if the demand exceed the supply if in other word labor be scarce wages tend to rise sooner or later in any case and the more promptly in proportion as the workpeople be organize conversely if the supply exceed the demand if in other word there be general unemployment wages tend to fall and the strongest trade union can not resist the tendency though they may delay it moreover the higher the wages that must be pay the smaller other thing be equal be the demand for labor for even if we leave foreign competition out of account and consider as it be labor throughout the world as a whole the demand for labor be by no means inelastic it be derive along with the demand for the other agent of production in the manner describe in chapter v as be there show the greater the supply of the other agent of production the greater be likely to be the demand for labor but these other agent can be substitute for labor in a great variety of way and a increase in wages -lrb- unless accompany by increase efficiency -rrb- will make it profitable for employer to effect such a substitution where it be not profitable before thus higher wages for the same labor efficiency must stimulate the tendency for capital to act as a substitute for labor at the expense necessarily -lrb- since the aggregate supply of capital will not be increase thereby -rrb- of its tendency to serve as a complement and this must mean a decrease in the volume of employment hence the power of labor to secure a general advance of wages by concerted or simultaneous trade union action apply if you will not merely to every industry but to every country be necessarily very limited beyond a certain point such a policy must result in general unemployment and if push sufficiently far in unemployment so extensive that it would continue even in period of active trade such a policy could neither be maintain in practice nor would it be a wise policy from the worker ' point of view in other word give on the one hand the condition of the demand for labor -lrb- ie the supply of capital natural resource business ability risk-bearing and knowledge of technical process etc which happen to exist -rrb- and give on the other hand the supply of labor -lrb- ie both the number of workpeople and they efficiency -rrb- the wage-level in the long run be fairly rigidly determine the introduction of the phrase in the long run in this connection be apt to provoke comment which may be pertinent but may be misconceive the worker it be point out be deeply concern with the short run in which he have to live it be very true and it be this that supplies one of the many justification of trade unionism to secure for the worker advance of wages which economic condition justify sooner than would otherwise have be obtain be certainly no trivial or contemptible function but it be none the less a illusion to suppose that the general wage-level can be appreciably and permanently raise by trade union action except in so far as it increase the efficiency of the worker or incidentally stimulate the efficiency of the employer § 4 _ the supply of labor in general _ the efficiency of labor may be regard as affect either the demand for labor on the one hand or the supply of it on the other accord as we look at the matter from the worker 's or the employer 's standpoint the employer be concern with the labor cost per unit of he output the worker be concern with the wages he receive a increase in the efficiency of labor may and usually will mean both a decrease in labor cost to the employer and a increase in the earnings of the worker it be thus wholly to the good but the effect of a increase in the supply of labor in the sense of a growth in the number of the population be far more dubious unaccompanied by a increase in the _ demand _ for labor it _ must _ result in a diminish remuneration for the individual worker to some extent indeed the demand for labor would almost certainly be increase the supply of capital may expand perhaps proportionately perhaps more than proportionately to the increase in population but one factor of production as we have see be not capable of such expansion this be the factor of land or natural resource it be the limitation of this factor which give rise to what we have most of we hear of as the law of diminish return it be this that be the essence of the problem of population portray in somber hue more than a hundred year ago by malthus this problem will form the subject of the sixth volume of the present series in the meantime it may be suggest that we be easily credulous if we suppose that the problem have be finally dispose of by the peculiar progress of a abnormal century but that experience have at least destroy the view that there _ need be _ or even be in fact in western country a relation between real wages and the number of the people so close and direct that a improved standard of live must be temporary only doom to destroy itself by the increase population it engender one may perhaps go further and say that it be doubtful even in what direction change in remuneration will influence the aggregate supply of labor when we pass to what should be it be plain that there be nothing whatever to be say for the sort of relation indicate above the view once widely hold that the principle of population must inevitably keep the mass of people close to the verge of the bare means of subsistence be no statement of a desirable ideal it be a nightmare a nightmare none the less though it may haunt we yet it be far from fanciful to suggest that it be because this relation be so obviously _ not _ what should be that it may be cease to hold true in fact but it would be very fanciful indeed to maintain that as yet what should be be represent by the actual population thus just as with capital so with labor there be no reason to suppose that the aggregate supply be determine by any fundamental economic law or correspond in practice to what be socially desirable § 5 _ the apportionment of labor among place _ again as with capital it be when we turn to the _ apportionment _ of labor between different employment that both economic law and social ideal make they appearance it will be well however to consider briefly in the first instance the different question of its apportionment between place this be hardly necessary in the case of capital because the possibility of foreign investment be very numerous and easy : the mobility of capital be thus sufficiently strong -lrb- once again it be only _ marginal _ adjustment that be necessary -rrb- to establish over at least a large part of the world something near to a uniform rate of interest but this be not the case with labor people do indeed move from place to place within a country and from one country to another in response to economic opportunity that even the latter movement may be a considerable thing the present population of the united state be a striking testimony but obviously the mobility be very incomplete here then we have what we might _ loosely _ call a economic law that labor tend to flow -lrb- as it be sometimes unhappily phrase -rrb- to those place where it can command the highest reward we have this tendency in evidence but it be far too weak to enable we to lay down what would deserve more strictly the title of a economic law that in the long run the reward of the same kind of labor be roughly equal in all place perhaps we can say this for many district in a single country but for few country be this true as between all they district as between country it be not remotely true here however the imperfection of economic law be balance by a extreme uncertainty as to the ideal perfect mobility of labor may be _ economically _ desirable in a very narrow sense of the term but it open out a vista of racial national and cultural problem into which it will be better for we not to enter here we must take for grant the population of a country like that of the world as a give fact when we do this the question of its remuneration be on all fours with the more general question discuss above that the remuneration of the labor of a country be mainly govern by the relation between demand and supply be a inexorable fact in view of the international mobility of capital the main distinctive factor in the demand for the labor of a particular country be the supply of natural resource which it know how to use where the natural resource be great relatively to the population there wages will rule high where the converse be true wages will rule low this result of economic analysis be abundantly confirm by experience the relatively high wages in the new world the low standard of living in the densely populated east the economic history of ireland be so many object-lesson of its truth § 6 _ the apportionment of labor among social grade _ the question of the apportionment of the labor of a country among different employment fall under two head some difference of occupation be associate particularly in great britain with difference of what we know as class the movement of labor between different social grade be clearly a very different thing from its movement between different occupation in the same grade the grade themselves be not easy to define : not a little ingenuity have be expend on the attempt and perhaps the best brief classification that have be put forward be one which divide labor into the follow four grade : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- automatic manual labor -lrb- 2 -rrb- responsible manual labor -lrb- 3 -rrb- automatic brain worker -lrb- 4 -rrb- responsible brain worker but the matter be one perhaps for the satirist of manners rather than the economist it suffice for we purpose that the distinction however vague be very real it be obvious the mobility of labor between the occupation of a platelayer and a barrister be not very great it may seem perhaps to be even smaller than it be for here it be important to bear in mind a general consideration which be equally applicable to horizontal movement within any social grade there may be a considerable movement of labor between different employment without any individual worker have to change he occupation the personnel of any industry be constantly change at one end man die retire or be pension off at the other end young recruit be take on by a diversion of the new recruit from one employment to another a radical change can be make in the occupational census in a comparatively short space of time it be in this manner that such movement as take place be largely effect at the present time within the rank of the professional class a man do not commonly leave the profession to which he have be train but he _ choice _ of profession be determine by he or he parent not solely on pecuniary grounds but usually with a anxious scanning of the general prospects which include pecuniary advantage together with many other thing the same thing be true in no small measure of manual wage-earner this general consideration must be bear in mind throughout the remainder of this chapter but even the son of platelayer do not commonly practice at the bar the obstacle in the way be various and subtle many of they be idea inherit from a bygone epoch about keep other people in they proper station which the whole drift of circumstance and the spirit of the age be rapidly wear down in the new world such obstacle be rare but a obstacle of a more tangible and formidable kind arise from the fact that the liberal profession and many business career require a long and expensive education and training which the platelayer be quite unable to afford to give he son now this expense of training be highly relevant not only to what be but to what should be it include it should be observe a negative as well as a positive element a long period of wait before income begin as well as the actual outlay on educational and other charge when the burden both of the wait and the positive cost must be bear either by the individual or the family there be few people who would seriously dispute that this go to justify on grounds of fairness as well as of expediency a higher level of annual remuneration later on though many people would doubtless argue that the amenity and dignity of the profession should be take into account on the other side but the same consideration make it a matter of legitimate doubt whether it would be desirable even as a ideal that the community should provide so completely the cost of training and of maintenance in the wait period as to make it no longer fair that the individual should be remunerate more highly than worker in less expensive occupation for this would mean that more labor would be absorb in the former employment than in principle would be socially desirable for reason which the argument of the next chapter will make plain but the most desirable number of doctor barrister teacher etc be not a thing which can be settle on purely economic grounds and it be unprofitable to carry further this particular line of thought few people would advocate as a ultimate ideal that the remuneration of the professional grade of labor should exceed that of lower grade by _ more _ than the extra expense of training and wait they involve that the excess be usually greater than this at the present time seem very probable : though it be a matter on which it be very hard to generalize but it would certainly be far greater than it be if the principle of _ laissez-faire _ rule supreme in these affair fortunately it do not and have never do so even before the day of free elementary education the endowment of education be not unknown the ancient public school and university which have come down to we from the middle age be a standing witness to what in this field a far poorer community think fit to do they system of scholarship and exhibition no less than they court and tower deserve we notice for these be design to form what we now call a ladder by which talent could climb from the humblest origin to the calling which then seem the summit either of spiritual or of worldly ambition this reference to talent make it well to consider here a factor which necessarily complicate though it do not substantially affect the whole argument of the present chapter there be difference of natural ability which no education or training can obliterate which it should rather be they business to excite these difference be associate to a great extent with difference of occupation they _ should be _ so associated far more closely than in fact they be they be also associate with difference of remuneration even within the same occupation what should be here be a question which we may excuse ourselves from discuss the principle which however vague be sufficient for we present purpose be that the same _ natural ability _ should command the same reward in all occupation subject to difference which should not exceed the difference of educational cost and initial wait they involve we can not assert as a economic law that this be generally true in fact if ever it become true it will be due not to _ laissez-faire _ or free competition but to social arrangement which express a sense of what be right § 7 _ the apportionment of labor among occupation _ when we pass to the apportionment of labor among different occupation in the same social grade the same principle as to what should be apply in a simpler form equal natural ability should command a equal reward in all occupation assume that difference in cost of training can be ignore the reward must of course be interpret not in term of money only but of real wages with allowance for the vary amenity of different task now it be here that the extreme advocate of _ laissez-faire _ make one of they cardinal mistake they assume that this ideal would be best secure by perfect competition the employer would choose the worker who would come for the lowest wage the worker would choose the employer who would pay he the highest wage and so by a process similar to the higgling of a commodity market the desirable uniform wage-level would become established but in fact the condition of the labor market differ greatly from those of a commodity market people be ignorant do not look ahead can not afford to risk the loss of a job however wretched which they happen to have get for reason such as these a considerable departure from _ laissez-faire _ be necessary in order to realize the theoretical result of _ laissez-faire _ to prevent the put of boy in large number into blind alley occupation you must supplement the foresight of parent with juvenile employment exchange and after-care committee to secure a proper uniformity of wages within the same occupation you must have trade union to secure a proper uniformity between different occupation you must have again trade union or fail they trade board that the action of trade union be very largely of this type be a fact insufficiently appreciate by the middle-class public the elaborate system of piece-rate list which have be evolve in the lancashire cotton industry be primarily design to secure the same wage for worker of equal efficiency in all mill irrespective of the degree to which the machinery be antiquated or up to date this result be wholly to the good : not only do it secure fairness for the worker it stimulate the employer wonderfully to efficiency the same result could never be secure so effectively by the free play of competition but this tendency which be easily the predominant element in the trade union regulation of the cotton trade be at least a important element in the policy of the common rule of all trade union though it may often be mix up with the more questionable tendency to eliminate difference of pay for difference of natural ability and the unquestionably bad tendency to discourage output as between different occupation the insistence of a trade union that wages must be level up towards the wages obtain in similar trade act again as a far more powerful force than competition but the action of trade union be by no means wholly of this type they often serve rather to secure still higher wages for worker who comparatively speak be already highly pay it make little difference whether this effect be secure directly by wage demand or indirectly by restrict the right of the entry to the trade in either case the consequence be the same and there should be no ambiguity as to they nature they be certainly bad for the community certainly bad for the _ other _ worker of the grade almost certainly bad for the worker of the grade regard as a whole the higher wages must raise the money cost of production and result sooner or later in fewer workpeople be employ in that occupation larger number must accordingly seek employment elsewhere and this can not but depress the wage rate of less strongly organize trade thus the effect be twofold : a larger proportion of workpeople will be employ in badly pay occupation and the wages there will be lessen the power of a strong trade union to secure wage advance of this type be considerable but it must not be exaggerated trade union employ as a matter of course device which in the case of trust we regard as the extremest weapon of monopoly to say if you buy from anyone except we you must not buy at a lower price than ours which messr j & p coat be represent as have do be analogous to insist that if non-unionist be employ it shall be at the trade union rate as every trade union very properly insist to say you must buy _ only _ from we the method of the boycott as it be call be analogous to the very common refusal to work with non-unionist at all but in one important respect the tactical position of a trade union be weaker than that of a ordinary combination it have usually get a buyer ' combination up against it in the shape of a association of employer the latter will be govern in they attitude towards the workpeople 's demand not only by immediate expediency but also by they own sense of what should be and they will usually resist demand for wages greatly in excess of those obtain in comparable trade in this way the tendency for worker of the same efficiency to receive the same real wages in all employment be far stronger than might at first sight appear if we have to rely for this result upon trade union alone it would be highly problematical for here a psychological curiosity emerge which familiar and intelligible as it be be none the less a curiosity so far from still higher wages for well-paid workpeople be regard in the world of manual labor as detrimental to the interest of other workpeople it have become almost a point of honor to believe the contrary a wage dispute in a particular trade be conceive as a engagement in a far-flung battle between capital and labor in which success at any part of the line will facilitate the victory of the whole army this conception contain a measure of truth as regard immediate and purely temporary effect though even here it be make to seem unduly plausible by the recurrence of trade cycle which cause wages at any time to move in the same direction all along the line but if the foregoing analysis have be appreciate the essential falsity of this notion should be evident it be a illusion which should receive no endorsement either tacit or express in any work on economics the general wage level of a country can not be regard -lrb- except temporarily and within narrow limit -rrb- as a function of the efficiency of labor organization it depend on the far deeper economic fact set out in § 3 above let we now try to summarize the conclusion of this section there _ be _ a tendency towards a uniformity of real wages for worker of the same grade and of the same efficiency this tendency be not due to competition alone it be help by many act of a collective kind arise from a sense of what should be it be obstruct by other act of a like kind where the sense of what should be be base on imperfect understand the more people act in accordance with what should be and the better they understand the more will this tendency approximate to a accurate economic law § 8 _ woman 's wages _ the wages of woman represent a problem of great public interest upon which the principle lay down in this chapter have a most important bearing and which in its turn serve to illustrate these principle further it have be suggest that male and female labor can be regard as a strong case of joint supply and the suggestion be not merely facetious the essential point that the proportion of available male and female labor be fairly constant -lrb- not that they may not alter with time and circumstance but that they be essentially independent of the condition of demand -rrb- hold true not only of a country as a whole but hardly less of a particular district if man and woman be to be regard as separate grade they be grade between which immobility be complete now man and woman differ in many way which affect both the demand for and the supply of they service on the one hand far fewer woman wish to enter business employment of any kind as woman have plenty of work that must be do at home on the other hand though woman can do many kind of work as well as or better than man it so happen that for much the greater number of service which be in large demand in the business world man be the more efficient incidentally it happen that many occupation which woman _ might _ do as well as man be close to they by exclusive regulation the resultant of these force be that man and woman be for the most part employ in different occupation and the scale of payment in woman 's occupation be far lower than that in man 's of this last fact singularly small complaint be make it be otherwise however when we come to occupation where man be either wholly or partially employ where woman be at least approximately as efficient as man and where the barrier to they entry be at least formally remove there a ferocious controversy rage over what be know as the principle of equal pay for equal work it be easy to understand why the male trade unionist in let we say the engineering trade should support this claim it be also indeed _ intelligible _ why the enthusiast for woman 's rights should urge it but it be much more doubtful whether they be wise possibly they be wise enough in they generation since it might not serve they on this matter to get across the man but it be clearly not prudential consideration of this kind by which they be mainly actuate they make the demand with extreme intensity of feeling as a demand for fundamental justice they be also very obviously inspire with the belief -lrb- similar to the illusion which be a point of honor with the male trade unionist -rrb- that high wages for woman in well-paid occupation will help to raise the wages of sweat woman worker in other trade now here again any lack of candor would be inexcusable the effect of this policy on the wages in woman 's trade be certainly to reduce they the policy serve as powerfully as any trade union custom to restrict the entry of woman into the man 's employment and often spell virtual exclusion for the equal efficiency may be approximate only and there may be advantage in male labor from the employer 's standpoint which be none the less important because they be not easy to define moreover from the employer 's standpoint the efficacy of female labor will be largely a matter for _ experiment _ and equal pay will give he no inducement to experiment at all the diminish number of woman in these occupation -lrb- as compare with what might have be -rrb- increase the number who must fall back on the purely woman 's trade and it _ must _ serve to reduce the wages there where organization be by no means strong i be far from assert that this consideration be conclusive against the principle of equal pay for equal work -lrb- though i think it conclusive against a rigid interpretation of it -rrb- for other matter such as the standpoint of the male trade unionist must be take into account but the reaction on the wages in woman 's trade permit of no ambiguity in occupation of another type the issue take a somewhat different form in the teaching profession equal pay would not exclude the woman it would be far more likely to exclude the man for though the advocate of the principle would declare that they intention be that the salary of woman should be level up to those of man it be more probable that the ultimate outcome would be a level down educational authority have the ratepayer and the taxpayer to consider and apart from this they have they own interpretation of what should be to pay a woman less than a man for the same work may seem glaringly unfair but it be not very clear why a woman who be a elementary school teacher should be pay much more than say a hospital nurse merely because in the former case a number of man happen also to be employ in fact there be a clashing of equity in this connection and there be little doubt which of they the educational authority would prefer a level down of the man 's salary would make it all but impossible to attract man of the desire type into the profession and would thus lead to the virtual extinction of the male elementary school teacher this might seem in a narrow sense to be economically desirable why should not man take they service to the task for which they can command a higher reward and which woman can not do as well but whether this would be desirable in the true interest of education be a far more doubtful matter and this be the real problem of equal pay for equal work for male and female school teacher the reader will notice that i have refrain from allude to the controversy as to whether man should receive more on the grounds that they have wife and family to maintain that although a most absorbing issue be not the real issue in practice at the present time the real issue be a clash between a sense of what should be on obvious general grounds and a sense of what should be in the particular derive from the very patent and general what be that man receive as a rule far higher pay than woman chapter x the real cost of production § 1 _ comparative cost _ beneath the great diversity of the consideration which be applicable to the different agent of production certain general conclusion emerge from the analysis of the last four chapter in no case do we find that the aggregate supply of the agent be determine by clear and certain economic law possess any fundamental significance the supply of natural resource be a fixed thing quite independent of the effort or the desire of man however the supply of capital and the supply of labor may react under present condition towards economic stimulus these reaction possess no quality of inevitability and bear no clear relation to what should be the supply of risk-bearing respond perhaps more decidedly to the prospects of increase reward but it be so intimately associate with special knowledge and the quality of business enterprise as to leave some uncertainty attach even to this conclusion when on the other hand we turn to the apportionment of these factor among different use we find relation which be both clear and fundamental law emerge which state at once not only what be or at least what tend to be but also what should be and it be the fact that they taste what should be that give they they fundamental character these conclusion enable we to give a general answer to the question which be raise at the end of chapter v : what be the ultimate real cost to which the money cost of production correspond the attempt have often be make to relate money cost to such thing as the effort of work and the sacrifice of wait the existence of such cost be beyond dispute much saving do mean a sacrifice of immediate enjoyment to the man who save most labor be irksome and disagreeable in itself and involve strain and wear and tear while all labor mean a deprivation of the utility of leisure workpeople moreover do not grow on gooseberry bush but must be feed and clothe from the cradle and they rearing and maintenance represent a real cost which someone must incur but the existence -lrb- or the importance -rrb- of such cost be one thing they relation to money cost be another in chapter viii we see how difficult it be to establish any clear relation between the rate of interest and the sacrifice of save the cost of labor present similar difficulty the relative irksomeness of two occupation may affect the relative wages which will rule in the two case so certainly will the difference in the cost of education and training which they require but these be matter which concern the _ apportionment _ of labor between different employment there be no good reason to suppose that the general wage-level would be reduce merely because work as a whole become less irksome or involve a smaller physical or mental strain the supply of people be not determine by the same kind of influence as be the supply of a commodity parent do not produce child for the sake of the wages which the child will receive when they go out to work or if this happen we rightly regard it as a horrible anomaly in so far as parent be affect by economic condition it be by they own economic condition the question be rather one of how many child they can afford to have than of a balancing of the cost to they against the income which they child may subsequently acquire but other consideration enter in and in fact it be doubtful how the aggregate supply of labor will react to change in prosperity finally the supply of land involve neither effort nor sacrifice and among we money cost we have to account for the item of the rent of land to dispose of this difficulty by argue that rent do not enter into marginal cost -lrb- in any sense which be not equally true of wages and profit -rrb- be to lose contact with reality thus the attempt to explain money cost in term of the cost of produce the ultimate agent of production lead we into a quagmire of unreality and dubious hypothesis for a systematic theory which will rest on firm foundation we must interpret money cost in very different term the real cost which the price of a commodity measure be not absolute but comparative marginal money cost reduce themselves in the last analysis to the payment which must be make to secure the use of the requisite agent of production these payment _ tend _ to equal the payment which the same agent could have command in alternative employment the payment which they could have command in alternative employment tend in they turn to equal the derive marginal utility of they service in those employment it be thus the loss of _ utility _ which arise from the fact that these agent of production be not available for alternative employment that be measure by the money cost of a commodity at the margin of production this conception of ultimate cost encounter a instinctive repugnance arise from a mistaken sense of logical symmetry which it will be well to examine cost it be object so interpret lose its character as a independent entity it be merely something derive from utility now in the earlier chapter of this volume we find reason to be impress with the general symmetry which pervade the relation of demand and supply moreover when we consider the case of ordinary commodity we find that at the back of demand and give rise to it be utility at the back of supply and limit it be cost the general symmetry between demand and supply thus seem almost to imply a fundamental symmetry between utility and cost if then cost in the last analysis be derive from utility do not this make nonsense of the symmetry between demand and supply or if we cling to this last symmetry as a demonstrable truth must we not refuse to admit that cost can be derive from utility this be one of those false dilemma which supply the wiseacre of the world with a plausible case for distrust the logical faculty if we have good reason for believe that both of two apparently inconsistent thing be true the explanation be seldom that one of they be really false it be more usually that they be not really inconsistent so it be here the symmetry between demand and supply be very great and we should always look to see if it hold good but it be by no means perfect and it be in the last analysis that it most notably fail it be most important to distinguish clearly between the utility and the cost of a commodity as two separate and independent thing in chapter v it will be remember we do not permit ourselves to derive the cost of produce cotton lint from the utility of cotton-seed the refusal to do so be essential to clear think it lead to some very useful practical corollary but to derive the cost of a commodity from the utility of something which be produce _ with _ it as part of the same productive process and to derive the cost from the utility which the agent which help to produce it possess for other purpose be two entirely different thing in work on international trade the reader will discover that the comparative nature of real cost be so unmistakable that a doctrine of comparative cost be expound with much formality at the outset this doctrine be apt to prove somewhat puzzling when we have to deal with it as a apparent exception to the general tenor of economic theory its difficulty disappear when we realize clearly that the real cost of _ anything _ be the curtailment of the supply of other useful thing which the production of that particular thing entail § 2 _ the allocation of resource _ however strange the above conception may seem there should be no doubt that this cost be very real here the irregularity and maladjustment of the economic world the recurrence of trade depression and the like do much to obscure a clear vision of the essential reality at a time when there be much unemployment and much machinery standing idle it be so clear to common sense that we _ could _ produce more of some particular thing without diminish the supply of other thing that any apparent statement to the contrary may perhaps seem the height of academic pedantry but let I ask the reader to consider with a open mind a familiar parallel during the recent war there be inevitably much waste and muddle in the utilization of the military resource of the ally some regiment would be keep inactive for long period not for purpose of rest or training but owe to some defect of organization in the manufacture of munitions a insufficient appreciation of the principle of joint demand lead to the pile up of excessive store of certain material which be useless until commensurate supplies of the complementary factor could be obtain it be unnecessary to multiply example the waste of both man-power and material be immense but the allocation of these resource between for instance the various theater of war be none the less a very real problem which give rise to much engrossing controversy it be a axiom that the more resource you employ in mesopotamium or in palestine the less resource remain available for france no one thought of maintain that as long as there be any waste of these resource so long as there remain any man to be comb out of unessential industry you could pour troops and munitions into salonika without stop to consider the need of other theater of war such a notion would have be clearly imbecile for the sufficient reason that the send of army to salonika would do nothing in itself to secure -lrb- however much it might incidentally stimulate -rrb- the more efficient use of the resource which remain now this be precisely analogous to the problem of the allocation of we resource for the purpose of peace notwithstanding all the waste and maladjustment of the economic system the use of resource to produce one commodity _ do _ in general curtail the production of other the mere launching of a new business enterprise do no more than the send of a army to salonika to eliminate waste in the remainder of the economic organism unemployment broadly speak be a function not of the magnitude of the normal demand for labor -lrb- which affect rather the wage-level -rrb- but of fluctuation in the demand for labor fluctuation from one day to another as at the dock from one season to another as in the building trade above all from one period of year to another as in the cycle of general trade boom and depression nothing will diminish unemployment which do not serve to diminish these fluctuation a new business will not as a rule have any such effect if it be launch during a trade depression -lrb- a most unusual proceeding -rrb- it may temporarily absorb unemployed labor and idle material but when the next boom come it will be use though presumably to greater advantage labor and material which but for it would have be employ for other purpose meanwhile the cause make for unemployment will be unaffected miscalculation will still be make the building trade will still become slack in the winter the casual method of engage dock laborer will still continue trade cycle will still recur while beneath they and conceal by they some industry will expand and other will decay thus like the army at salonika the new business would in effect divert resource from elsewhere this truth need to be firmly grasp in mind it be this that make it in general unsound policy to subsidize industry either directly or indirectly by means of a protective tariff it be this indeed that supply the answer to half the economic fallacy that be always current the allocation of resource so as to yield the maximum effect be rightly recognize as one of the most vital and difficult of we war-time problem to cope with it the ally people devise one instrument after another and finally evolve the supreme ally council the analogous problem in the economic world of peace time be no less important and far more difficult but there be nothing to correspond to the supreme ally council there we rely upon a co-operation which as be stress in chapter i be unco-ordinated that co-operation have be evolve by the mutual competition of innumerable business concern control by man largely animated by the motive of pecuniary profit but it have not be evolve wholly by such means : and how far that competition or that motive of profit be essential to its efficiency be question with which this volume have not be in any way concern the economic law the relation between utility and price and cost with which it have be occupy be a entirely different matter and these _ be _ essential to the efficiency of any system of society for if the marginal utility of a commodity be equal to its marginal cost and if this marginal cost be compose of payment to the various agent of production at least as great as they could have obtain if they have be use otherwise this amount to say that the agent of production be so utilize as to yield the maximum utility and this be the same thing as say that they be so utilize as to produce the maximum wealth § 3 _ utility and wealth _ upon this last point it be important to be quite clear a increase in wealth seem a solid tangible reality something which however much we may scorn it in we more precious mood we recognize for a rather poor community to be a important object of endeavor but a increase in utility seem a vague impalpable notion hardly deserving the same practical concern none the less the two thing be identical we greatly deceive ourselves if we suppose wealth to be a objective reality it be true that when we get behind the money in which it be measure we come upon commodity like food and clothes and house and factory which seem comfortably solid and objective thing but we also come upon many service like those of gardener and doctor and hospital nurse which we be bind to reckon as part of we wealth although they be not embody in any tangible commodity moreover although material commodity be objective reality in themselves and in many of they property they be _ not _ objective reality in they property as wealth a pair of boot be a objective fact so be the number of pair in existence at any time so be they size they weight the quantity of leather or of paper which they happen to contain but the wealth which those boot represent be not a objective fact it depend upon the opinion which man and woman entertain as to they utility and these opinion take we into the subjective region of human psychology let we suppose for instance that we calculate on the basis of present price that the boot in existence at the present time represent 1\/1000 part of we total wealth suppose then that a miracle be to happen that the sky open and rain boot upon we of every size and shape and pattern until we have 1000 time as many boot as we have before could we say that we total real wealth have be double clearly we could not to obtain boot for nothing and to wear a new pair every week would make we somewhat better off but not twice as well off as we be previously in other word the real wealth of a thousand time as many boot as we have now be not a thousand time as great as the wealth of the present number of boot we be indeed practically restate the law of diminish utility and this perhaps be enough to show that wealth be fundamentally the same thing as utility another point however be worth note we real wealth would be somewhat increase in the case suppose but if we be to turn to the money measure of wealth the opposite result would be far more likely for the price of boot would most likely fall to nothing and the total value of boot in the commercial sense would accordingly be nothing also this show that money value may be a most imperfect measure of aggregate wealth for what money value represent be the product of the quantity of the commodity and its _ marginal _ utility while aggregate wealth be _ total _ utility which be a very different thing this it may be observe make all attempt to compare the wealth of different country or different time and no less to construct index number of price imperfect of necessity and arbitrary in they foundation § 4 _ criterion of policy _ the point have now be reach at which we must take into account the very important fact which be mention at the close of chapter iii the maximum utility which the law of supply and demand tend to bring about be a maximum _ total _ utility indeed but one still measure in term of money a unequal distribution of wealth destroy any necessary correspondence between that and the maximum _ real _ utility this consideration however do not affect the general validity of the conclusion that the law of supply and demand represent what be socially desirable now or under any system for what be at fault here be the distribution of wealth and it be that which should be change in so far as it be possible to do so now it be important to realize that whenever it be possible to supply a commodity to poor people below cost price it be possible to alter the distribution of wealth for that in effect be what be do purchase power which may be take from richer people by taxation or which may be obtain from collective profit on other trading be in effect transfer to the poor people in question though the transference be couple with the condition that the purchase power must be expend in a particular way it be _ in general _ desirable that the transference should be make without this condition be attach to this general statement exception indeed exist so numerous and important as possibly to justify a great extension of social expenditure of this type education should certainly be provide free of charge there be strong argument for subsidize housing the provision of milk to expectant mother the feeding of school child such instance can be multiply into a very extensive list but it be important to observe that in each case the justification of the policy rest in the presumption that the service supply be one which it be particularly important that the beneficiary should have _ as compare with _ the other thing upon which they might have prefer to expend the equivalent purchasing power have it be transfer to they without condition where there be no such presumption as surely there be none in the case of the great bulk of commodity the relation between price and marginal cost should be rigidly maintain it be the distribution of purchase power which we should rather seek to alter how far be it possible to alter that i suppose that it be inevitable that many reader will have conclude that the precede chapter must be take to mean that the distribution of wealth be not susceptible of any appreciable change i would remind those reader of a important distinction upon which impatient people have sometimes base a complaint against economist the economist it be say analysis with great pomp and ceremony the law govern the distribution of wealth among the agent of production but say practically nothing about the distribution between individual and class which be the only thing of any real interest to practical people now the economist concentrate on the agent of production for the very good reason that it be only with respect to they that any clear and certain law as to distribution can be lay down into the distribution between individual and class there enter other and variable factor govern by no fundamental economic law and _ here _ the conclusion should at once suggest itself be the field for action design to alter the distribution of wealth what be possible or desirable in this field it be again not the purpose of this volume to discuss it be a obvious even if not a very helpful conclusion that a increase in the habit of saving among weekly wage-earner might without appreciably affect the distribution between capital and labor greatly modify the result distribution between social class but question as to how far it might be possible or justifiable to achieve a similar result by the use of the weapon of taxation by change in inheritance law or by the public ownership of industry take we into a far more uncertain and controversial sphere the difficulty and objection which present themselves be familiar and formidable but they be of quite a different order from the economic law which we have be examine the law themselves do not entitle we to make any dogmatic pronouncement upon these large issue of social policy but this be not to deprive these law of practical importance they represent essential criterion of sound policy in the sphere of social reorganization no less than in ordinary business in we day a curious obsession have lead many people to disparage these criterion as though they be the sordid prejudice of a stupid tradesman because it have be find a matter of obvious practical convenience to maintain the road out of taxation or of rate and to dispense with charge for they use it be suggest that the same principle should be apply to the railway or more commonly because it have be find convenient to make the same charge for the carrying of letter between land 's end and john o ' groat as between hampstead and highgate it be suggest that _ this _ principle should be apply to railway rate and fare it may be well therefore to point out that the justification of uniform postal charge rest upon the fact : -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the cost of collection sort etc be so large a part of the cost of carry a letter that the real cost between john o ' groat and land 's end do not differ from that between hampstead and highgate by as much as might at first sight appear -lrb- 2 -rrb- that the charge in any case be very small so that -lrb- 3 -rrb- the avoidance of the small degree of tax and bounty which the present system imply be not worth the book-keeping expense which differential charge would involve it should be obvious that these consideration apply to the railway with a greatly diminish force they might possibly justify what be know as the zone system of charge ie uniform rate within certain narrow area but the notion of uniform rate throughout great britain conjure up a vision of train take coal from south wale to scotland and other take coal from scotland to south wale in accordance with the slightest preference of the consumer and without regard to the extra real cost involve on a scale to which the waste of competition afford no parallel it would in fact achieve the essential folly of send coal to newcastle these consideration however be not what interest the advocate of the postal principle they seem to recommend the obliteration or the confusion of the relation between price and cost as a superior ideal it be important to be clear what exactly this ideal involve it involve in the first place as the whole argument of this volume have go to show a less economical employment of we productive resource they would be divert to end of less utility and so produce less real wealth but this be not the worst there be plenty of waste and maladjustment in we economic system at the present time the desirable relation of price to marginal cost be but imperfectly attain the further departure from this relation which would follow from any likely application of the postal principle might not matter in themselves so very much what be far more serious be that the criterion of efficiency would become blunt and the clear aim of management would be confuse in fog it be essential that every manager should be on the alert to eliminate waste and to improve efficiency that he should be always try to secure the best result but how can he do this if he have no simple means of _ measure _ what result be good and what be bad the measure which he have at present be that of price cost and the resultant profit and it would be fatal to take that away unless a equally simple and more accurate measure could be substitute for it this be not a question it should be observe of motive or incentive very likely we much exaggerate the importance of the profit motive it may be true that man would work perhaps that they already work in fact as zealously for a fix salary as for personal gain but aim and motive be two somewhat different thing and the _ aim _ of profit be and will remain essential to the efficient conduct of business in a game the player be not animated by the motive of score run or point but they aim at they and the zest disappear very speedily from the game if that aim cease to be of interest moreover while a score system be always a somewhat arbitrary thing measure imperfectly the true merit of the play if it measure they with the roughest accuracy we prefer the issue of we game to be decide so rather than by the decision of a impartial judge who can take into account the finest point of skill so it be in the world of business the scoring-board of profit may be a imperfect one let we by all means where we can alter the rule of the game so as to make it better but let we not imagine that it display a finer insight or a superior intellect to speak as though the scoring-board could be dispense with and the test of profit and loss treat as irrelevant quantitative measurement be essential to efficiency let we be careful to remember all that this imply index ability accountancy allocation of resource ambiguity australasium bastiat frederic beef and hide borrowing and lending system of
