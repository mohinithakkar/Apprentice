falkland suckling haust drummond stirl earl hall crashaw rowley nash ford middleton the life of the poet \* \* \* \* geoffry chaucer it have be observe that man of eminence in all age and distinguish for the same excellence have generally have something in they life similar to each other the place of homer 's nativity have not be more variously conjecture or he parent more differently assign than we author 's leland who live nearest to chaucer 's time of all those who have write he life be commission by king henry viii to search all the library and religious house in england when those archive be preserve before they destruction be produce by the reformation or polydore virgil have consume such curious piece as would have contradict he frame and fabulous history he for some reason believe oxford or berkshire to have give birth to this great man but have not inform we what those reason be that induce he to believe so and at present there appear no other but that the seat of he family be in those country pitt positively assert without produce any authority to support it that woodstock be the place which opinion mr camden seem to hint at where he mention that town but it may be suspect that pitt have no other ground for the assertion than chaucer 's mention woodstock park in he work and have a house there but after all these different pretension he himself in the testament of love seem to point out the place of he nativity to be the city of london and tho ' mr camden mention the claim of woodstock he do not give much credit to it for speaking of spencer -lrb- who be uncontrovertedly bear in london -rrb- he call he fellow citizen to chaucer the descent of chaucer be as uncertain and unfixed by the critic as the place of he birth mr speight be of opinion that one richard chaucer be he father and that one elizabeth chaucer a nun of st helen 's in the second year of richard ii might have be he sister or of he kindred but this conjecture say urry -lrb- 1 -rrb- seem very improbable for this richard be a vintner living at the corner of kirton-lane and at he death leave he house tavern and stock to the church of st mary aldermary which in all probability he would not have do if he have have any son to possess he fortune nor be it very likely he could enjoy the family estate mention by leland in oxfordshire and at the same time follow such a occupation pitt assert that he father be a knight but tho ' there be no authority to support this assertion yet it be reasonable to suppose that he be something superior to a common employ we find one john chaucer attend upon edward iii and queen philippa in they expedition to flander and cologn who have the king 's protection to go over sea in the twelfth year of he reign it be highly probable that this gentleman be father to we geoffry and the supposition be strengthen by chaucer 's first application after leave the university and inn of law be to the court nor be it unlikely that the service of the father should recommend the son it be universally agree that he be bear in the second year of the reign of king edward iii ad 1328 he first study be in the university of cambridge and when about eighteen year of age he write he court of love but of what college he be be uncertain there be no account of he in the record of the university from cambridge he be remove to oxford in order to compleat he study and after a considerable stay there and a strict application to the public lecture of the university he become -lrb- say leland -rrb- a ready logician a smooth rhetorician a pleasant poet a great philosopher a ingenious mathematician and a holy divine that he be a great master in astronomy be plain by he discourse of the astrolabe that he be verse in hermetic philosophy -lrb- which prevail much at that time -rrb- appear by he tale of the chanon yeoman : he knowledge in divinity be evident from he parson 's tale and he philosophy from the testament of love thus qualify to make a figure in the world he leave he learn retirement and travel into france holland and other country where he spend some of he younger day upon he return he enter himself in the inner temple where he study the municipal law of the land but he have not long prosecute that dry study till he superior ability be take notice of by some person of distinction by whole patronage he then approach the splendor of the court the reign of edward iii be glorious and successful he be a discerning as well as a fortunate monarch he have a taste as well for erudition as for arm he be a encourager of man of wit and part and permit they to approach he without reserve at edward 's court nothing but gallantry and a round of pleasure prevail and how well qualify we poet be to shine in the soft circle whoever have read he work will be at no loss to determine but besides the advantage of he wit and learn he possess those of person in a very considerable degree he be then about the age of thirty of a fair beautiful complexion he lip red and full he size of a just medium and he air polish and graceful so that he unite whatever could claim the approbation of the great and charm the eye of the fair he have ability to record the valor of the one and celebrate the beauty of the other and be qualify by he genteel behavior to entertain both he become a finish courtier the first dignity to which we find he prefer be that of page to the king a place of so much honor and esteem at that time that richard ii leave particular legacy to he page when few other of he servant be take notice of in the forty-first year of edward iii he receive as a reward of he service a annuity of twenty mark per ann payable out of the exchequer which in those day be no inconsiderable pension in a year after he be advance to be of he majesty 's privy chamber and a very few month to be he shield bearer a title at that time -lrb- tho ' now extinct -rrb- of very great honor be always next the king 's person and generally upon signal victory reward with military honor we poet be thus eminent by he place contract friendship and procure the esteem of person of the first quality queen philippa the duke of lancaster and he duchess blanch shew particular honor to he and lady margaret the king 's daughter and the countess of pembroke give he they warmest patronage as a poet in he poem call the romaunt and the rose and troilus and creseide he give offence to some court lady by the looseness of he description which the lady margaret resent and oblige he to atone for it by he legend of good woman a piece as chaste as the other be luxuriously amorous and under the name of the daisy he veil lady margaret whom of all he patron he most esteemed thus love and honor he younger year be dedicate to pleasure and the court by the recommendation of the dutchess blanch he marry one philippa rouet sister to the guardianess of she grace 's child who be a native of hainault : he be then about thirty year of age and be fix by marriage the king begin to employ he in more public and advantageous post in the forty-sixth year of he majesty 's reign chaucer be send to venice in commission with other to treat with the doge and senate of genoa about affair of great importance to we state the duke of lancaster whose favorite passion be ambition which demand the assistance of learn man engage warmly in we poet 's interest besides the duke be remarkably fond of lady catherine swynford he wife 's sister who be then guardianess to he child and whom he afterwards make he wife thus be he doubly attach to chaucer and with the vary fortune of the duke of lancaster we find he rise or fall much about this time for he successful negociation at genoa the king grant to he by letter patent by the title of armiger noster one pitcher of wine daily in the port of london and soon after make he comptroller of the custom with this particular proviso that he should personally execute the office and write the account relate to it with he own hand but as he be advance to higher place of trust so he become more entangled in the affair of state the consequence of which prove very prejudicial to he the duke of lancaster have be the chief instrument of raise he to dignity expect the fruit of those favor in a ready compliance with he in all he design that prince be certainly one of the proudest and most ambitious man of he time nor could he patiently bear the name of a subject even to he father nothing but absolute power and the title of king could satisfy he upon the death of he elder brother edward the black prince he fix a eye upon the english crown and seem to stretch out a impatient hand to reach it in this view he seek by all means possible to secure he interest against the decease of the old king and be afraid of the opposition of the clergy who be always strenuous against a irregular succession he embrace the opinion and espouse the interest of wickliff who now appear at oxford and be a man of very great ability and much esteem at court draw over to he party great number as well fashionable as low people in this confusion the duke of lancaster endeavor all he could to shake the power of the clergy and to procure votary amongst the lead popular man chaucer have no small hand in promote these proceedings both by he public interest and writings towards the close of edward 's reign he be very active in the intrigue of the court party and so recommend himself to the prince successor that upon he ascend the throne he confirm to he by the title of dilectus armiger noster the grant make by the late king of twenty mark per annum and at the same time confirm the other grant of the late king for a pitcher of wine to be deliver he daily in the port of london in less than two year after this we find we poet so reduce in he cirumstance -lrb- but by what mean be unknown -rrb- that the king in order to screen he from he creditor take he under he protection and allow he still to enjoy he former grant the duke of lancaster whose restless ambition ever excite he to disturb the state engage now with all the interest of which he be master to promote himself to the crown the opinion of wickliff gain ground and so great a commotion now prevail amongst the clergy that the king perceive the state in danger and be willing to support the clerical interest suffer the archbishop of canterbury to summon wickliff to appear before he whose interest after this arraignment very much decayed -lrb- 2 -rrb- the king who be devote to he pleasure resign himself to some young courtier who hate the duke of lancaster and cause a fryar to accuse he of a attempt to kill the king but before he have a opportunity of make out the charge against he the fryar be murder in a cruel and barbarous manner by lord john holland to whose care he have be commit this lord john holland call lord huntingdon and duke of exeter be half brother to the king and have marry elizabeth daughter of the duke of lancaster he be a great patron of chaucer and much respect by he with the duke of lancaster 's interest chaucer 's also sink he patron be unable to support he he could no longer struggle against opposite party or maintain he post of honor the duke pass over sea he friend feel all the malice of a enraged court which induce they to call in a number of the populace to assist they of which we poet be a zealous promoter one john of northampton a late lord mayor of london be at the head of these disturbance which do not long continue for upon beheading one of the rioter and northampton 's be take into custody the commotion subside strict search be make after chaucer who escape into hainault afterwards he go to france and find the king resolute to get he into he hand he flee from thence to zealand several accomplice in this affair be with he whom he support in they exile while the chief ringleader -lrb- except northampton who be condemn at read upon the evidence of he clerk -rrb- have restore themselves to court favor by acknowledge they crime and now forget the integrity and resolution of chaucer who suffer exile to secure they secret and so monstrously ungrateful be they that they wish he death and by keep supplies of money from he endeavor to effect it -- while he expend he fortune in remove from place to place and in support he fellow exile so far from receive any assistance from england he apartment be let and the money receive for rent be never acccount for to he nor could he recover any from those who owe it he they be of opinion it be impossible for he ever to return to he own country the government still pursue they resentment against he and he friend they be oblige to leave zealand and chaucer be unable to bear longer the calamity of poverty and exile and finding no security wherever he flee choose rather to throw himself upon the law of he country than perish abroad by hunger and oppression he have not long return till he be arrest by order of the king and confine in the tower of london the court sometimes flatter he with the return of the royal favor if he would impeach he accomplice and sometimes threaten he with immediate destruction they threat and promise he along while disregard but recollect the ingratitude of he old friend and the misery he have already suffer he at last make a confession and accord to the custom of trial at that time offer to prove the truth of it by combat what the consequence of this discovery be to he accomplice be uncertain it no doubt expose he to they resentment and procure he the name of a traytor but the king who regard he as one beloved by he grandfather be please to pardon he thus fall from a heighth of greatness we poet retire to bemoan the fickleness of fortune and then write he testament of love in which be many pathetic exclamation concern the vicissitude of human thing which he then bitterly experienced but as he have formerly be the favorite of fortune when dignity be multiply thick upon he so he misery now succeed with a equal swiftness he be not only discard by he majesty unpensioned and abandon but he lose the favor of the duke of lancaster as the influence of he wife 's sister with that prince be now much lessen the duke be deject with the trouble in which he be involve begin to reflect on he vicious course of life and particularly he keep that lady as he concubine which produce a resolution of put she out of he house and he make a vow to that purpose chaucer thus reduce and weary of the perpetual turmoil at court retire to woodstock to enjoy a studious quiet where he write he excellent treatise of the astrolabe but notwithstanding the severe treatment of the government he still retain he loyalty and strictly enjoin he son to pray for the king as the pious resolution of some people be often the consequence of a present evil so at the return of prosperity they be soon dissipate this prove the case with the duke of lancaster : he party again gather strength he interest begin to rise upon which he take again he mistress to he bosom and not content with heaping favor honor and title upon she he make she he wife procure a act of parliament to legitimate she child which give great offence to the duchess of gloucester the countess of derby and arundel as she then be entitle to take place of they with she interest chaucer 's also return and after a long and bitter storm the sun begin to shine upon he with a evening ray for at the sixty-fifth year of he age the king grant to he by the title of delectus armiger noster a annuity of twenty mark per annum during he life as a compensation for the former pension he needy circumstance oblige he to part with but however sufficient that might be for present support yet as he be encumber with debt he dare not appear publickly till he majesty again grant he he royal protection to screen he from the persecution of he creditor he also restore to he he grant of a pitcher of wine daily and a pipe annually to be deliver to he by he son thoma who that year possess the office of chief butler to the king now that i have mention he son it will not be improper to take a view of we author 's domestical affair at least as far as we be enable by material that have descend to we time thoma he eldest son be marry to one of the greatest fortune in england maud daughter and heir of sir john burgheershe knight of the garter and dr henry burghurshe bishop of lincoln chancellor and treasurer of england mr speight say this lady be give he in marriage by edward iii in return of he service perform in he embassy in france he second son lewi be bear in 1381 for when he father write the treatise of the astrolabe he be ten year old he be then a student in merton college in oxford and pupil to nicholas strade but there be no further account of he thoma who now enjoy the office of chief butler to he majesty have the same place confirm to he for life by letter patent to king henry iv and continue by henry vi in the 2d year of henry iv we find he speaker of the house of common sheriff of oxfordshire and berkshire and constable of wallingford castle and knaresborough castle during life in the 6th year of the same prince he be send ambassador to france in the 9th of the same reign the common present he they speaker as they do likewise in the 11th year soon after this queen jane grant to he for he good service the manor of woodstock hannerborough and wotten during life and in the 13th year he be again present speaker as he be in the 2d of henry v and much about that time he be send by the king to treat of a marriage with catherine daughter to the duke of burgundy he be send again ambassador to france and pass thro ' a great many public station mr stebbing say that he be knight but we find no such title give he in any record he die at ewelm the chief place of he residence in the year 1434 by he wife maud he have one daughter name alice who be thrice marry first to sir john philip and afterwards to thoma montacute earl of salisbury : she third husband be the famous william de la pole duke of suffolk who lose he head by the fury of the yorkist who dread he influence in the opposite party tho ' he stand proscribe by the parliament of henry vi for misguide that easy prince they son john have three son the second of whom edmund forfeit he life to the crown for treason against henry vii by which mean the estate which chaucer 's family possess come to the crown but to return to we poet : by means of the duke of lancaster 's marriage with he sister in law he again grow to a considerable share of wealth but be now about seventy year of age and fatigue with a tedious view of hurry greatness he quit the stage of grandeur where he have act so considerable a part with varied success and retire to dunnigton castle -lrb- 3 -rrb- near newbury to reflect at leisure upon past transaction in the still retreat of contemplation in this retirement do he spend he few remain year universally love and honor he be familiar with all man of learn in he time and contract friendship with person of the greatest eminence as well in literature as politics gower occleve lidgate wickliffe be great admirer and particular friend of chaucer besides he be well acquaint with foreign poet particularly franci petrarch the famous italian poet and refiner of the language a revolution in england soon after this happen in which we find chaucer but little concerned he make no mean compliment to henry iv but gower he cotemporary though then very old flatter the reign prince and insult the memory of he murder sovereign all act of parliament and grant in the last reign be annul chaucer again repair to court to get fresh grant but bend with age and weakness tho ' he be successful in he request the fatigue of attendance so overcome he that death prevent he enjoy he new possession he die the 25th of October in the year 1400 in the second of henry iv in the 72d of he age and bear the shock of death with the same fortitude and resignation with which he have undergo a variety of pressure and vicissitude of fortune dryden say he be poet laureat to three king but urry be of opinion that dryden must be mistake as among all he work not one court poem be to be find and selden observe that he could find no poet honor with that title in england before the reign of edward iv to whom one john kaye dedicate the siege of rhode in prose by the title of he humble poet laureat i can not better display the character of this great man than in the follow word of urry as to he temper say he he have a mixture of the gay the modest and the grave he reading be deep and extensive he judgment sound and discerning he be communicative of he knowledge and ready to correct or pass over the fault of he cotemporary writer he know how to judge of and excuse the slip of weaker capacity and pity rather than expose the ignorance of that age in one word he be a great scholar a pleasant wit a candid critic a sociable companion a stedfast friend a great philosopher a temperate oeconomist and a pious christian as to he genius as a poet dryden -lrb- than whom a higher authority can not be produce -rrb- speaking of homer and virgil positively assert that we author exceed the latter and stand in competition with the former he language how unintelligible soever it may seem be almost as modern as any of he cotemporary or of those who follow he at the distance of 50 or 60 year as harding skelton and other and in some place it be so smooth and beautiful that dryden would not attempt to alter it i shall now give some account of he work in the order in which they be write so far as can be collect from they and subjoin a specimen of he poetry of which profession as he may justly be call the morning star so as we descend into later time we may see the progress of poetry in england from its great original chaucer to its full blaze and perfect consummation in dryden mr philip suppose a greater part of he work to be lose than what we have extant of he of that number may be many a song and many a lecherous lay which perhaps might have be write by he while he be a student at cambridge the court of love as have be before observe be write while he reside at cambridge in the 18th year of he age the craft lover be write in the year of we lord 1348 and probably the remedy of love be write about that time or not long after the lamentation of mary magdalen take from origen be write by he in he early year and perhaps boethius de consolatione philosophiæ be translate by he about the same time the romaunt of the rose be a translation from the french : this poem be begin by william de lerris and continue by john de meun both famous french poet it seem to have be translate about the time of the rise of wickliffe 's opinion it consist of violent invective against religious order the complaint of the black knight during john of gaunt 's courtship with blanch be suppose to be write on account of the duke of lancaster 's marriage the poem of troilus and creseide be write in the early part of he life translate -lrb- as he say -rrb- from lollius a historiographer in urbane in italy he have add several thing of he own and borrow from other what he think proper for the embellishment of this work and in this respect be much indebted to he friend petrarch the italian poet the house of fame from this poem mr pope acknowledge he take the hint of he temple of fame the book of blaunch the duchess commonly call the dreme of chaucer be write upon the death of that lady the assembly of fowl -lrb- or parlement of briddi as he call it in he retraction -rrb- be write before the death of queen philippa the life of st cecilium seem to have be first a single poem afterwards make one of he canterbury tale which be tell by the second nonne : and so perhaps be that of the wife of bath which he advise john of gaunt to read and be afterwards insert in he canterbury tale the canterbury tale be write about the year 1383 it be certain the tale of the nonnes priest be write after the insurrection of jack straw and wat tyler the flower and the leaf be write by he in the prologue to the legend of gode woman chaucer 's abc call la priere de nostre damê be write for the use of the duchess blaunch the book of the lion

pembroke the treatise of the conclusion of the astrolabie be write in the year 1391 of the cuckow and nightingale this seem by the description to have be write at woodstock the ballade beginning in feverre & c be a compliment to the countess of pembroke several other ballad be ascribe to he some of which be justly suspect not to have be he the comedy imputed to he be no other than he canterbury tale and the tragedy be those the monk tell in he tale the testament of love be write in he trouble the latter part of he life the song beginning fly fro the prese & c be write in he death-bed leland say that by the content of the learn in he time the plowman 's tale be attribute to chaucer but be suppress in the edition then extant because the vice of the clergy be expose in it mr speight in he life of chaucer print in 1602 mention a tale in william thynne 's first print book of chaucer 's work more odious to the clergy than the plowman 's tale one thing must not be omit concern the work of chaucer in the year 1526 the bishop of london prohibit a great number of book which he think have a tendency to destroy religion and virtue as do also the king in 1529 but in so great esteem be he work then and so highly value by the people of taste that they be except out of the prohibition of that act the pardoner prologue lording quoth he in chirch when i preche i paine mee to have a have a

edition of that author modernize -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : some biographer of chaucer say that pope gregory ix give order to the archbishop of canterbury to summon he and that when a synod be convene

this castle -rrb- \* \* \* \* \* langland it have be dispute amongst the critic whether this poet precede or follow chaucer mr cooper author of the muse library be of opinion that he precede chaucer and observe that in more place than one that great poet seem to copy langland but i be rather incline to believe that he be cotemporary with he which account for she observation and my conjecture be strengthen by the consideration of he stile which be equally unmusical and obsolete with chaucer 's and tho ' dryden have tell we that chaucer exceed those who follow he at 50 or 60 year distance in point of smoothness yet with great submission to he judgment i think there be some alteration even in skelton and harding which will appear to the reader to the best advantage by a quotation of langland 's family we have no account selden in he note on draiton 's poly olbion quote he with honor but he be entirely neglect by philip and winstanly tho ' he seem to have be a man of great genius : besides chaucer few poet in that or the subsequent age have more real inspiration or poetical enthusiasm in they composition one can not read the work of this author or chaucer without lament the unhappiness of a fluctuating language that bury in its ruin even genius itself for like edifice of sand every breath of time deface it and if the form remain the beauty be lose the piece from which i shall quote a few line be a work of great length and labor of the allegoric kind it be animated with a lively and luxurious imagination point with a variety of pungent satire and dignified with many excellent lesson of morality but as to the conduct of the whole it do not appear to be of a piece every vision seem a distinct rhapsody and do not carry on either one single action or a series of many but we ought rather to wonder at its beauty than cavil at its defect and if the poetical design be break the moral be entire which be uniformly the advancement of piety and reformation of the roman clergy the piece before we be entitle the vision of pier the plowman and i shall quote that particular part which seem to have furnish a hint to milton in he paradise lose b 2 1 475 kinde conscience

because all they transaction be so soon make public and want a fresh subsidy come to the house in person to complain of this usage when the burgess hear of he come it be long debate whether they should admit he or no and sir thoma strongly urge that he should be admit for this reason that if he shall find fault with the spreading of we secret -lrb- say he -rrb- we may lay the blame upon those he grace bring with he the proud churchman have enter the house make a long speech for grant the subsidy and ask several of the member opinion concern it they be all so confound as not to be able to answer and the house at last resolve that they speaker should reply for they upon this sir thoma shew that the cardinal 's come into the house be unprecedented illegal and a daring insult on the liberty of the burgess and that the subsidy demand be unnecessary upon which wolsey suddenly depart in a rage and ever after entertain suspicion of more and become jealous of he great ability we author 's fame be not confine to england only all the scholar and statesman in every country in europe have hear of and correspond with he but of all stranger he have a peculiar esteem for erasmus who take a journey into england in order to converse with he and enter more minutely into the merit of one whose learning he have so high a opinion of they agree to meet first at my lord mayor 's table and as they be personally unknown to make the experiment whether they could discover one another by conversation they meet accordingly and remain some hour undiscover at last a argument be start in which both engage with great keenness erasmus designedly defend the unpopular side but find himself so strongly press that he could hold it no longer he break out in a extasy aut tu es morus aut nullus upon which more reply aut tu es erasmus aut diabolus as at that time erasmus be strive to defend very impious proposition in order to put he antagonist 's strength to the proof when he live in the city of london as a justice of peace he use to attend the session at newgate there be then upon the bench a venerable old judge who be very severe against those who have they purse cut -lrb- as the phrase then be -rrb- and tell they that it be by they negligence that so many purse-cutter come before he sir thomas who be a great lover of a joke contrived to have this judge 's purse cut from he in the session house by a felon when the felon be arraign he tell the court that if he be permit to speak to one of the judge in private he could clear he innocence to they they indulge he in he request and he make choice of this old judge and while he whisper something in he ear he slily cut away he purse the judge return to the bench and the felon make a sign to sir thoma of he have accomplish the scheme sir thoma move the court that each of they should bestow some alms on a needy person who then stand falsly accuse and be a real object of compassion the motion be agree to and when the old man come to put he hand in he purse he be astonish to find it go and tell the court that he be sure he have it when he come there what say more in a pleasant manner do you charge any of we with felony the judge begin to be angry we facetious author desire the felon to return he purse and advise the old man never to be so bitter against innocent man 's negligence when he himself could not keep he purse safe in that open assembly although he live a courtier and be much concern in business yet he never neglect he family at home but instruct he daughter in all useful learning and converse familiarly with they he be remarkably fond of he eldest daughter margaret as she have a greater capacity and sprightlier genius than the rest he child often use to translate out of latin into english and out of english into latin and dr stapleton observe that he have see a apology of sir thoma more 's to the university of oxford in defense of learning turn into latin by one of he daughter and translate again into english by another margaret whose wit be superior to the rest writ a treatise on the four last thing which sir thoma declare be finer than he she compose several oration especially one in answer to quintilian defend a rich man which he accuse for have poison a poor man 's bee with certain venomous flower in he garden so eloquent and forcible that it may justly rival quintilian himself she also translate eusebius out of greek tho ' sir thoma be thus involve in public affair and domestic concern yet he find leisure to write many book either against heretic or of a devotional cast for at that time what he reckon heresy begin to diffuse itself over all germany and flander he build a chapel in he parish church at chelsea which he constantly attend in the morning

before nor ever since happen of a father be a judge and he son a chancellor at the same time every day as the chancellor go to the bench he kneel before he father and ask he blessing the people soon find the difference between the intolerable pride of wolsey and the gentleness and humility of more he permit every one to approach he without reserve he dispatch business with great assiduity and so clear the court of tedious suit that he more than once come to the bench and call for a cause there be none to try as no dignity could inspire he with pride so no application to the most important affair could divert he from sally of humor and a pleasantry of behavior it once happen that a beggar 's little dog which she have lose be present to lady more of which I be very fond but at last the beggar get notice where the dog be she come to complain to sir thoma as he be sit in he hall that he lady withhold she dog from she presently my lady be send for and the dog bring with she which he

from he parliament and council a divorce from he lawful wife and be passionately fond of anna bullen he marry she and declare she queen of england : this marriage sir thoma have always oppose and hold it unlawful for he sovereign to have another wife during he first wife 's life the queen who be of a petulant disposition and elate with she new dignity could not withhold she resentment against he but animated all she relation and the party incline to the protestant interest to persecute he with rigor not long after the divorce the council give authority for the publication of a book in which the reason why this divorce be grant be lay down a answer be soon publish with which sir thoma more be charge as the author of which report however he sufficiently clear himself in a letter to mr

with great honor and gallantry and share that monarch 's favor in a very considerable degree who make he a grant in he own country as a evidence of he affection for he this grant of the king 's happen in the year 1535 and yet in seven year afterwards either thro ' want of economy or by a boundless confidence in he friend he reduce he affair to a very indifferent situation which perhaps might be the

arrest for debt he majesty likewise resent the affront offer to he servant and with the concurrence of the parliament proceed very severely against the sheriff hollinsh in he chronicle vol 2 p 955 give a very full account of it sir thoma moil knight then speaker of the house give a special order to the serjeant of the parliament to repair to the compter and there demand the delivery of the prisoner but notwithstanding this high authority the officer in the city refuse to obey the command and after many altercation they absolutely resist the serjeant upon which a fray ensue within the compter-gate between ferrar and the officer not without mutual hurt so that the serjeant be drive to defend himself with he mace of arm and have the crown of it break with ward off a stroke the sheriff of london so far from appease foment the quarrel and with insolent language refuse to deliver they prisoner : upon which the serjeant thus abuse return to the house and related what have happen this circumstance so exasperate the burgess that they all rise and go into the upper house and declare they would transact no more business till they member be restore to they they then command they serjeant again to go to the compter with he mace and make a second demand by they authority -- the sheriff hear that the upper house hide concerned themselves in it and be afraid of they resentment restore the prisoner before the serjeant have time to return to the compter but this do not satisfy the burgess they summon the sheriff before they together with one white who in contempt of they dignity have take out a writ against ferrar and as a punishment for they insolence they be send to the tower and ever since that period the power and privilege of the common have be on the increase ferrar continue in high favor with henry during the remainder of he reign and seem to have stand upon good term with somerset lord protector in the beginning of edward vi since it appear that he attend the protector in quality of one of the commissioner of the army in he expedition into scotland in 1548 -lrb- 4 -rrb- which perhaps might be owe to he be about the person of prince edward in he father 's life-time another instance of this happen about four year afterwards at a very critical juncture for when the unfortunate duke of somerset lay under sentence of death and it be observe that the people murmur and often give testimony of discontent and that the king himself be very uneasy those about he study every method to quiet and amuse the one to entertain and divert the other -lrb- 5 -rrb- in order to this at the entrance of christmas holiday mr ferrar be proclaimed lord misrule that be a kind of prince of sport and pastime which office he discharge for twelve day together at greenwich with great magnificence and address and entirely to the king 's satisfaction in this character attend by the politest part of the court he make a excursion to london where he be splendidly entertain by the lord mayor and when he take he leave he have present give he in token of respect but notwithstanding he make so great figure in the diversion at court yet he be no idle spectator of political affair and maintain he reputation with the learn world he write the reign of queen mary which tho ' publish in the name of richard grafton in he chronicle yet be certainly the performance of ferrar accord to the annals of stow p 632 whose authority in this case be very high we author be a historian a lawyer and a politician even in he poetry as appear from these piece of he which be insert in the mirror of magistrate and which be not inferior to any other that have find a place there -lrb- 6 -rrb- in the early part of he life he write some tract on he own profession which gain he great reputation and which discover that he be a lover of liberty and not dispose to sacrifice to the crown the rights and property of the subject it seldom happen that when a man often change he situation or be force to do so that he continue to preserve the good opinion of different party but this be a happiness which ferrar enjoy he be consult by the learn as a candid critic admire and love by all who converse with he with respect to the time of we author 's death we can not be absolutely certain all we know be that he die in the year 1579 at he house in flamstead in

george ferrar lately decease -lrb- 7 -rrb- none of we author deliver any thing as to mr ferrar 's religion but it be highly probable that he be a zealous protestant : not from he accept grant of abbey-land for that be but a precarious proof but from he come into the world under the protection of thoma lord cromwell who be certainly persuade of the truth of the protestant religion have this occasion to mention thoma lord cromwell the famous earl of essex who be we author 's warmest patron i be persuade my reader will forgive I a digression which will open to they the noblest instance of gratitude and honor in that worthy nobleman that ever adorn the page of a historian and which have be tell with rapture by all who have writ of the time particularly by dr burnet in he history of the reformation and fox in he martyrology -- thoma lord cromwell be the son of a blacksmith at putney and be a soldier under the duke of bourbon at the sack of rome in the year 1527 while he be abroad in a military character in a very low station he fall sick and be unable to follow the army he be observe one day by a italian merchant to walk very pensive and have all the appearance of penury and wretchedness : the merchant enquire of he the place of he birth and fortune and upon converse with cromwell be so well pleased with the account he give of himself that he supply he with money and credit to carry he to england cromwell afterwards make the most rapid progress in state-preferment ever know honor be multiply thick upon he and he come to have the dispensing of he sovereign 's bounty it happen that this italian merchant 's circumstance decay and he come to england to sollicit the payment of some debt due to he by he correspondent who find he necessitous be dispose to put he off and take the advantage of he want to avoid payment this not a little embarrassed the foreigner who be now in a situation forlorn enough as providence would have it lord cromwell then earl of essex ride to court see this merchant walk with a dejected countenance which put he in mind of he former situation he immediately order one of he attendant to desire the merchant to come to he house he lordship ask the merchant whether he know he he answer no : cromwell then relate the circumstance of the merchant 's relieve a certain englishman and ask if he remember it the merchant answer that he have always make it he business to do good but do not remember that circumstance -- he lordship then enquire the reason of he come to england and upon the merchant 's tell he he story he so interested himself as soon to procure the payment of all he debt -- cromwell then inform the merchant that he be himself the person he have thus relieved and for every ducat which the merchant have give he he return to the value of a hundred tell he that this be the payment of he debt he then make he a munificent present and ask he whether he choose to settle in england or return to he own country the foreigner choose the latter and return to spend the remainder of he day in competence and quiet after have experience in lord essex as high a instance of generosity and gratitude as perhaps ever be know this noble act of he lordship employ say burnet the pen of the belt writer at that time in panegyric on so great a behavior the finest poet praise he he most violent enemy could not help admire he and latest posterity shall hold the name of he in veneration who be capable of so generous a act of honor but to return to ferrar in we author 's history of the reign of queen mary tho ' he shew himself a great admirer of the personal virtue of that princess and a very discerning and able historian yet it be every where evident that he be attach to the protestant interest but more especially

judgment till i meet with some other testimony of he have thus heinously offend against he god and against the best and most amiable system of religion that ever be or ever can be : marloe might

elizabeth yet he have recourse to the mean expedient of write obscenity and favor the cause of vice by which he no doubt recommend himself to the rake about town who as they be generally no true judge of wit to estimate the merit of a piece as it happen to suit they appetite or encourage they in every irregular indulgence no man of honor who see a poet endowed with a large share of natural understanding prostitute he pen to the vilest purpose of debauchery and lewdness can think of he but with contempt and he wit however brilliant ought not to screen he from the just indignation of the sober part of mankind when wit be prostitute to vice ` tis wit no more that be it cease to be true wit and i have often think there should be some public mark of infamy fix on those who hurt society

whom he basely forsake with a child she have by he for the company of some harlot to whom he apply the wages of iniquity while he wife starve after some year indulgence of this sort when he wit begin to grow stale we find he fall into abject poverty and lament the life he have lead which bring he to it for it always happen that a mistress be a more expensive piece of furniniture than a wife and if the modern adulterer would speak the truth i be certain they would acknowledge that half the money which in the true sense of the word be misspend upon those daughter of destruction would keep a family with decency and maintain a wife with honor when we author be in this forlorn miserable state he writ a letter to he wife which mr winstanly have prefer and which as it have somewhat tender in

who as they bustle less in life be generally unacquainted with those artifice and trick which be acquire by a knowledge of the world and that then they yoke-fellow need only be tender and indulgent to win they but i believe it may be generally allow that woman be the best or worst part of the human creation : none excel they in virtue but when they depart from it none exceed they in vice in the case of green we shall see by the letter he send he wife how much she be injure the remembrance of many wrong offer thee and thy unreproved virtue add greater sorrow to my miserable state than i can utter or thou conceive neither be it lessen by consideration of thy absence -lrb- tho ' shame would let I hardly behold thy face -rrb- but exceedingly aggravate for that i can not as i ought to thy

consider he be the fruit of thy womb in whose face regard not the father so much as thy own perfection : he be yet green and may grow strait if he be carefully tend otherwise apt enough to follow he

green whose end may be look upon as a kind of punishment for a life spend in riot and infamy \* \* \* \* \* edmund spenser be bear in london and educate at pembroke hall in cambridge the account of the birth and family of this great man be but obscure and imperfect and at he first set out into life he fortune and interest seem to have be very inconsiderable after he have for some time continue at the college and lay that foundation of learning which join to he natural genius qualify he to rise to so great a excellency he stand for a fellowship in competition with mr andrew a gentleman in holy order and afterwards lord bishop of winchester in which he be unsuccessful this disappointment join with the narrowness of he circumstance force he to quit the university -lrb- 1 -rrb- and we find he next reside at the house of a friend in the north where he fall in love with he rosalind whom he finely celebrate in he pastoral poem and of whose cruelty he have write such pathetical complaint it be probable that about this time spenser 's genius begin first to distinguish itself for the shepherd 's calendar which be so full of he unprosperous passion for rosalind be amongst the first of he work of note and the supposition be strengthen by the consideration of poetry 's be frequently the offspring of love and retirement this work he address by a short dedication to the mæcenas of he age the immortal sir philip sidney this gentleman be now in the highest reputation both for wit and gallantry and the most popular of all the courtier of he age and as he be himself a writer and especially excel in the fabulous or inventive part of poetry it be no wonder he be strike with we author 's genius and become sensible of he merit a story be tell of he by mr hughe which i shall present the reader as it serve to illustrate the great worth and penetration of sidney as well as the excellent genius of spenser it be say that we poet be a stranger to this gentleman when he begin to write he fairy queen and that he take occasion to go to leicester-house and introduce himself by send in to mr sidney a copy of the ninth canto of the first book of that poem sidney be much surprize with the description of despair in that canto and be say to have shew a unusual kind of transport on the discovery of so new and uncommon a genius after he have read some stanza 's he turn to he steward and bid he give the person that bring those verse fifty pound but upon read the next stanza he order the sum to be double the steward be no less surprized than he master and think it he duty to make some delay in execute so sudden and lavish a bounty but upon read one stanza stanza more mr sidney raise the gratuity to two hundred pound and command the steward to give it immediately lest as he read further he might be tempt to give away he whole estate from this time he admit the author to he acquaintance and conversation and prepare the way for he be know and receive at court tho ' this seem a promising omen to be thus introduce to court yet he do not instantly reap any advantage from it he be indeed create poet laureat to queen elizabeth but he for some time wear a barren laurel and possess only the place without the pension -lrb- 2 -rrb- lord treasurer burleigh under whose displeasure spenser labor take care to intercept the queen 's favor to this unhappy great man as misfortune have the most influence on elegant and polished mind so it be no wonder that spenser be much depress by the cold reception he meet with from the great a circumstance which not a little detract from the merit of the minister then in power : for i know not if all the political transaction of burleigh be sufficient to counterballance the infamy affix on he name by prosecute resentment against distressed merit and keep he who be the ornament of the time as much distant as possible from the approach of competence these discouragement greatly sink we author 's spirit and accordingly we find he pour out he heart in complaint of so injurious and undeserved a treatment which probably would have be less unfortunate to he if he noble patron sir philip sidney have not be so much absent from court as by he employment abroad and the share he have in the low-country war he be oblige to be in a poem call the ruin of time which be write some time after sidney 's death the author seem to allude to the discouragement i have mention in the follow stanza o grief of grief o gall of all good heart to see that virtue should despise be of such as first be raise for virtue 's part and now broad-spread like a aged tree let none shoot up that nigh they plant be o let not these of whom the muse be scorn alive or dead be by the muse adorn these line be certainly mean to reflect on burleigh for neglect he and the lord treasurer afterwards conceive a hatred towards he for the satire he apprehend be level at he in mother hubbard 's tale in this poem the author have in the most lively manner paint out the misfortune of depend on court favor the line which follow be among other very remarkable full little knowest thou that hast not try would what hell it be in sue long to bide to dole good day that night be better spend to waste long night in pensive discontent to speed to day to be put back to-morrow to feed on hope to pine with fear and sorrow to have thy prince 's grace yet want she peer to have thy ask yet wait many year to fret thy soul with cross and with care to eat thy heart thro ' comfortless despair to fawn to crouch to wait to ride to run to spend to give to want to be undo as this be very much the author 's case it probably be the particular passage in that poem which give offence for as hughe very elegantly observe even the sigh of a miserable man be sometimes resent as a affront by he who be the occasion of they there be a little story which seem found on the grievance just now mention and be relate by some as a matter of fact -lrb- 3 -rrb- commonly report at that time it be say that upon he present some poem to the queen she order he a gratuity of one hundred pound but the lord treasurer burleigh object to it say with some scorn of the poet of whose merit he be totally ignorant what all this for a song the queen reply then give he what be reason spenser for some time wait but have the mortification to find himself disappoint of she majesty 's bounty upon this he take a proper opportunity to present a paper to queen elizabeth in the manner of a petition in which he remind she of the order she have give in the follow line i be promise on a time to have reason for my rhime from that time unto this season i receive nor rhime nor reason this paper produce the intended effect and the queen after sharply reprove the treasurer immediately direct the payment of the hundred pound the have first order in the year 1579 he be send abroad by the earl of leicester as appear by a copy of latin verse date from leicester-house and address to he friend mr harvey but mr hughe have not be able to determine in what service we be employ when the lord gray of wilton be choose deputy of ireland spenser be recommend to he as secretary this draw he over to another kingdom and settle he in a scene of life very different from what he have formerly know but that he understand and discharge he employment with skill and capacity appear sufficiently by he discourse on the state of ireland in which there be many solid and judicious remark that shew he no less qualify for the business of the state than for the entertainment of the muse he life be now free from the difficulty under which it have hitherto struggle and he service to the crown receive a reward of a grant from queen elizabeth of 3000 acre of land in the county of cork he house be in kilcolman and the river mullum which he have more than once so finely introduce in he poem run through he grounds much about this time he contract a intimate friendship with the great and learn sir walter raleigh who be then a captain under the lord gray the poem of spenser 's call colin clout come home again in which sir walter raleigh be describe under the name of the shepherd of the ocean be a beautiful memorial of this friendship which take its rise from a similarity of taste in the polite art and which he agreeably describe with a softness and delicacy peculiar to he sir walter afterwards promote he in queen elizabeth 's esteem thro ' whose recommendation she read he writings he now fall in love a second time with a merchant 's daughter in which say mr cooper author of the muse library he be more successful than in he first amour he write upon this occasion a beautiful epithalamium with which he present the lady on the bridal-day and have consign that day and she to immortality in this pleasant easy situation we excellent poet finish the celebrated poem of the fairy queen which be begin and continue at different interval of time and of which he at first publish only the three first book to these be add three more in a follow edition but the six last book -lrb- except the two canto 's of mutability -rrb- be unfortunately lose by he servant whom he have in haste send before he into england for tho ' he pass he life for some time very serenely here yet a train of misfortune still pursue he and in the rebellion of the earl of desmond he be plunder and deprive of he estate this distress force he to return to england where for want of he noble patron sir philip sidney he be plunge into new calamity as that gallant hero die of the wound he receive at zutphen it be say by mr hughe that spenser survive he patron about twelve year and die the same year with he powerful enemy the lord burleigh 1598 he be bury say he in westminster-abbey near the famous geoffery chaucer as he have desire he obsequy be attend by the poet of that time and other who pay the last honor to he memory several copy of verse be throw after he into he grave and he monument be erect at the charge of the famous robert devereux the unfortunate earl of essex this be the account give by he editor of the death of spenser but there be some reason to believe that he speak only upon imagination as he have produce no authority to support he opinion especially as i find in a book of great reputation another opinion deliver upon probable grounds the ingenious mr drummond of hawthronden a noble wit of scotland have a intimate correspondence with all the genius 's of he time who reside at london particularly the famous ben johnson who have so high a opinion of mr drummond 's ability that he take a journey into scotland in order to converse with he and stay some time at he house at hawthronden after ben johnson depart mr drummond careful to retain what past betwixt they write down the head of they conversation which be publish amongst he poem and history of the five jame 's king of scotland amongst other particulars there be this ben johnson tell I that spenser 's goods be rob by the irish in desmond 's rebellion he house and a little child of he burnt and he and he wife nearly escape that he afterwards die in king-street -lrb- 4 -rrb- by absolute want of bread and that he refuse twenty piece send he by the earl of essex -lrb- 5 -rrb- and give this answer to the person who bring they that he be sure he have no time to spend they mr drummond 's work from whence i have extract the above be print in a thin quarto and may be see at mr wilson 's at plato 's head in the strand i have be thus particular in the quotation that no one may suspect such extraordinary circumstance to be advance upon imagination in the inscription on he tomb in westminster abbey it be say he be bear in the year 1510 and die 1596 cambden say 1598 but in regard to he birth they must both be mistake for it be by no means probable he be bear so early as 1510 if we judge by the remarkable circumstance of he standing for a fellowship in competition with mr andrew who be not bear accord to hughe till 1555 besides if this account of he birth be true he must have be sixty year old when he first publish he shepherd 's calendar a age not very proper for love and in this case it be no wonder that the beautiful rosalind slight he address and he must have be seventy year old when he enter into business under lord gray who be create deputy in ireland 1580 : for which reason we may fairly conclude that the inscription be false either by the error of the carver or perhaps it be put on when the monument be repair there be very few particulars of this great poet and it must be a mortification to all lover of the muse that no more can be find concern the life of one who be the greatest ornament of he profession no writer ever find a nearer way to the heart than he and he verse have a peculiar happiness of recommend the author to we friendship as well as raise we admiration one can not read he without fancy oneself transport into fairy land and there converse with the grace in that enchanted region : in elegance of thinking and fertility of imagination few of we english author have approach he and no writer have such power as he to awake the spirit of poetry in other cowley own that he derive inspiration from he and i have hear the celebrated mr jame thomson the author of the season and justly esteem one of we best descriptive poet say that he form himself upon spenser and how closely he pursue the model and how nobly he have imitate he whoever read he castle of indolence with taste will readily confess mr addison in he character of the english poet address to mr sacheverel thus speak of spenser : old spenser next warm would with poetic rage in ancient tale amus have a barb ` rous age a age that yet uncultivate and rude where-e ` er the poet 's fancy lead pursued thro ' pathless field and unfrequented flood to den of dragon and enchanted wood but now the mystic tale that plea would of yore can charm a understanding age no more the long spin allegory fulsome grow while the dull moral lye too plain below we view well please at distance all the sight of arm and palfry battle field and fight and damsel in distress and courteous knight but when we look too near the shades decay and all the please landscape fade away it be agree on all hand that the distress of we author help to shorten he day and indeed when he extraordinary merit be consider he have the hardest measure of any of we poet it appear from different account that he be of a amiable sweet disposition humane and generous in he nature besides the fairy queen we find he have write several other piece of which we can only trace out the title among these the most considerable be nine comedy in imitation of the comedy of he admire ariosto inscribe with the name of the nine muse the rest which be mention in he letter and those of he friend be he die pelicane he pageant stemmata dudleyana the canticle paraphraze ecclesiaste seven psalm hour of we lord sacrifice of a sinner purgatory a s ` ennight slumber the court of cupid and hell of lover it be likewise say he have write a treatise in prose call the english poet : as for the epithalamion thamesis and he dream both mention by himself in one of he letter mr hughe think they be still preserved tho ' under different name it appear from what be say of the dream by he friend mr harvey that they be in imitation of petrarch 's vision to produce authority in favor of spenser as a poet i should reckon a affront to he memory that be a tribute which i shall only pay to inferior wit whose highest honor it be to be mention with respect by genius 's of a superior class the work of spenser will never perish tho ' he have introduce unnecessarily many obsolete term into they there be a flow of poetry a elegance of sentiment a fund of imagination and a enchanting enthusiasm which will ever secure he the applause of posterity while any lover of poetry remain we find little account of the family which spenser leave behind he only that in a few particulars of he life prefix to the last folio edition of he work it be say that he great grandson hugolin spenser after the restoration of king charle ii be restore by the court of claim to so much of the land as could be find to have be he ancestor there be another remarkable passage of which -lrb- say hughe -rrb- i can give the reader much better assurance : that a person come over from ireland in king william 's time to sollicit the same affair and bring with he letter of recommendation as a defendant of spenser he name procure he a favourable reception and he apply himself particularly to mr congreve by whom he be generously recommend to the favor of the earl of hallifax who be then at the head of the treasury and by that mean he obtain he suit this man be somewhat advance in year and might be the same mention before who have possibly recover only some part of he estate at first or have be disturb in the possession of it he could give no account of the work of he ancestor which be want and which be therefore in all probability irrecoverably lose the follow stanza be say to be those with which sir philip sidney be first strike from he return sad and comfortless as on the way together we do fare we meet that villain -lrb- god from he I bless -rrb- that curse wight from whom i ` scaped whylear a man of hell that call himself despair who first we greet and after fair areed of tiding strange and of adventure rare : so creep close as snake in hidden weed inquireth of we state and of we knight ' y deed which when he know and feel we feeble heart emboss would with bale and bitter-biting grief which love have launce with he deadly dart with wound word and term of foul reprief he pluck from we all hope of due relief that erst we hold in love of ling ` ring life then hopeless heartless ` gin the cunning thief persuade we die to stint all further strife : to I he lend this rope to he a rusty knife the follow be the picture the darksome cave they enter where they find that cursed man low sit on the ground muse full sadly in he sullen mind he greasy lock long grow and unbound disorder hung about he shoulder round and hide he face through which he hollow eyne look would deadly dull and stare as astound he raw bone cheek thro ' penury and pine be shrink into he jaw as he do never dine he garment nought but many ragged clout with thorn together pinn would and patch be the which he naked side he wrapt about and he beside there lay upon the grass a dreary corse whose life away do pass all wallow in he own yet luke-warm blood that from he wound yet well fresh alas in which a rusty knife fast fix stand and make a open passage for the gush flood it would perhaps be a injury to spenser to dismiss he life without a few remark on that great work of he which have place he among the foremost of we poet and discover so elevated and sublime a genius the work i mean be he allegorical poem of the fairy queen sir william temple in he essay on poetry say that the religion of the gentile have be weave into the contexture of all the ancient poetry with a agreeable mixture which make the modern affect to give that of christianity a place also in they poem but the true religion be not find to become fictitious so well as the false one have do and all they attempt of this kind seem rather to debase religion than heighten poetry spenser endeavor to supply this with morality and to make instruction instead of story the subject of a epic poem he execution be excellent and he flight of fancy very noble and high but he design be poor and he moral lay so bare that it lose the effect it be true the pill be gilded but so thin that the color and the taste be easily discover -- mr rymer assert that spenser may be reckon the first of we heroic poet he have a large spirit a sharp judgment and a genius for heroic poetry perhaps above any that ever write since virgil but we misfortune be he want a true idea and lose himself by follow a unfaithful guide tho ' besides homer and virgil he have read tasso yet he rather suffer himself to be mislead by ariosto with whom blindly ramble on marvel and adventure he make no conscience of probability all be fanciful and chimerical without any uniformity or without any foundation in truth in a word he poem be perfect fairy-land thus far sir william temple and mr rymer let we now attend to the opinion of a greater name mr dryden in he dedication of juvenal thus proceeds : the english have only to boast of spenser and milton in heroic poetry who neither of they want either genius or learn to have be perfect poet and yet both of they be liable to many censure for there be no uniformity in the design of spenser he aim at the accomplishment of no one action he raise up a hero for every one of he adventure and endow each of they with some particular moral virtue which render they all equal without subordination or preference : every one be valiant in he own legend only we must do he the justice to observe that magnanimity which be the character of prince arthur shine throughout the whole poem and succor the rest when they be in distress the original of every knight be then live in the court of queen elizabeth and he attribute to each of they that virtue which he think be most conspicuous in they a ingenious piece of flattery tho ' it turn not much to he account have he live to finish he poem in the remain legend it have certainly be more of a piece but could not have be perfect because the model be not true but prince arthur or he chief patron sir philip sidney die before he deprive the poet both of means and spirit to accomplish he design for the rest he obsolete language and ill choice of he stanza be fault both of the second magnitude for notwithstanding the first he be still intelligible at least after a little practice and for the last he be more to be admire that labor under such disadvantage he verse be so numerous so various and so harmonious that only virgil whom he have professedly imitate have surpass he among the roman and only waller among the english mr hughe in he essay on allegorical poetry prefix to spenser 's work tell we that this poem be conceive work up and color with stronger fancy and discover more the particular genius of spenser than any of he other writings and have observe that spenser in a letter to sir walter raleigh call it a continue allegory or dark conceit he give we some remark on allegorical poetry in general define allegory to be a fable or story in which under imaginary person or thing be shadow some real action or instructive moral or as i think say he it be somewhere very shortly define by plutarch it be that in which one thing be related and another thing understand it be a kind of poetical picture or hieroglyphick which by its apt resemblance convey instruction to the mind by a analogy to the sens and so amuse the fancy while it inform the understanding every allegory have therefore two sens the literal and mystical the literal sense be like a dream or vision of which the mystical sense be the true meaning or interpretation this will be more clearly apprehend by consider that as a simile be a more extended metaphor so a allegory be a kind of continued simile or a assemblage of similitude draw out at full length the chief merit of this poem no doubt consist in that surprising vein of fabulous invention which run through it and enrich it every where with imagery and description more than we meet with in any other modern poem the author seem to be possess of a kind of poetical magic and the figure he call up to we view rise so thick upon we that we be at once pleased and distract with the exhaustless variety of they so that he fault may in a manner be imputed to he excellency he abundance betray he into excess and he judgment be over-born by the torrent of he imagination that which seem the most liable to exception in this work be the model of it and the choice the author have make of so romantic a story the several book rather appear like so many several poem than one entire fable each of they have its peculiar knight and be independent of the rest and tho ' some of the person make they appearance in different book yet this have very little effect in conceal they prince arthur be indeed the principal person and have therefore a share give he in every legend but he part be not considerable enough in any one of they he appear and vanish again like a spirit and we lose sight of he too soon to consider he as the hero of the poem these be the most obvious defect in the fable of the fairy queen the want of unity in the story make it difficult for the reader to carry it in he mind and distract too much he attention to the several part of it and indeed the whole frame of it would appear monstrous be it to be examine by the rule of epic poetry as they have be draw from the practice of homer and virgil but as it be plain the author never design it by these rule i think it ought rather to be call a poem of a particular kind describe in a series of allegorical adventure or episode the most note virtue and vice to compare it therefore with the model of antiquity would be like draw a parallel between the roman and gothic architecture in the first there be doubtless a more natural grandeur and simplicity in the latter we find great mixture of beauty and barbarism yet assist by the invention of a variety of inferior ornament and tho ' the former be more majestic in the whole the latter may be very surprizing and agreeable in its part -lrb- footnote 1 : hughe 's life of spencer prefix to the edition of we author 's work -rrb- -lrb- footnote 2 : hughe ubus supra -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : winst p 88 -rrb- -lrb-

he remove from thence to the middle-temple in order to study the municipal law but do not long remain there -lrb- 2 -rrb- he genius which be of a sprightly kind could not bear the confinement of a student or the drudgery of reading law he abandon it therefore and travel into france where he so improve himself in polite accomplishment that when he return he be look upon as one of the most finished gentleman about court soon after he arrival in england he contract a intimacy which afterwards grow into friendship with sir robert carre a scotch gentleman a favorite with king jame and afterwards earl of somerset such be the warmth of friendship in which these two gentleman live that they be inseparable carre could enter into no scheme nor pursue any measure without the advice and concurrence of overbury nor could overbury enjoy any felicity but in the company of he he love they friendship be the subject of court-conversation and they genius seem so much alike that it be reasonable to suppose no breach could ever be produce between they but such it seem be the power of woman such the influence of beauty that even the sacred tie of friendship be break asunder by the magic energy of these superior charm carre fell in love with lady france howard daughter to the earl of suffolk and lately divorce from the earl of essex -lrb- 3 -rrb- he communicate he passion to he friend who be too penetrate not to know that no man could live with much comfort with a woman of the countess 's stamp of whose moral he have a bad opinion he insinuate to carre some suspicion and those well found against she honor he dissuade he with all the warmth of the sincerest friendship to desist from a match that would involve he in misery and not to suffer he passion for she beauty to have so much sway over he as to make he sacrifice he peace to its indulgence carre who be desperately in love forget the tie of honor as well as friendship communicate to the lady what overbury have say of she and they who have read the heart of woman will be at no loss to conceive what reception she give that unwelcome report she know that carre be immoderately attach to overbury that he be direct by he council in all thing and devote to he interest earth have no curse like love to hatred turn would nor hell a fury like a woman scorn would this be literally verify in the case of the countess she let loose all the rage of which she be capable against he and as she pant for the consummation of the match between carre and she she so influence the viscount that he begin to conceive a hatred likewise to overbury and while he be thus subdue by the charm of a wicked woman he seem to change he nature and from the gentle easy accessible good-natured man he formerly appear he degenerate into the sullen vindictive and implacable one thing with respect to the countess ought not to be omit she be wife of the famous earl of essex who afterwards head the army of the parliament against the king and to whom the imputation of impotence be lay the countess in order to procure a divorce from she husband give it out that tho ' she have be for some time in a married state she be yet a virgin and which it seem sit very uneasy upon she to prove this a jury of matron be to examine she and give they opinion whether she be or be not a virgin : this scrutiny the countess do not care to undergo and therefore entreat the favor that she might enter mask to save she blush this be grant she and she take care to have a young lady provide of much the same size and exterior appearance who personate she and the jury assert she to be a unviolated virgin this precaution in the countess no doubt diminish she character and be a circumstance not favourable to she honor for if she husband have be really impotent as she pretend she need not have be afraid of the search and it prove that she either injure she husband by falsely asperse he or that she have violate she honor with other man but which ever of these cause prevail have the countess be wise enough she have no occasion to fear the consequence of a scrutiny for if i be rightly inform a jury of old woman can no more judge accurately whether a woman have yield she virginity than they can by examine a dead body know of what distemper the deceased die but be that as it may the whole affair be unfavourable to she modesty it shew she a woman of irregular passion which poor sir thoma overbury dearly experience for even after the countess be happy in the embrace of the earl of somerset she could not forbear the persecution of he she procure that sir thoma should be nominate by the king to go ambassador to russia a destination she know would displease he it be then no better than a kind of honorable grave she likewise excite earl somerset to seem again he friend and to advise he strongly to refuse the embassy and at the fame time insinuate that if he should it would only be lie a few week in the tower which to a man well provide in all the necessaries as well as comfort of life have no great terror in it this expedient sir thoma embrace and absolutely refuse to go abroad upon which on the twenty-first of April 1613 he be send prisoner to the tower and put under the care of sir gervi yelvi then lord lieutenant the countess be so far successful begin now to conceive great hope of compleat she scheme of assassination and draw over the earl of somerset she husband to she party and he who a few year before have obtain the honor of knighthood for overbury be now so enraged against he that he coincide in take measure to murder he friend sir gervi yelvi who obtain the lieutenancy by somerset 's interest be a creature devote to he pleasure he be a needy man totally destitute of any principle of honor and be easily prevail upon to forward a scheme for destroy poor overbury by poison accordingly they consult with one mr turner the first inventer -lrb- say winstanley of that horrid garb of yellow ruff and cuff and in which garb he be afterwards hang -rrb- who have acquaintance with one jame franklin a man who it seem be admirably fit to be a cut-throat agreed with he to

open all the terror of another life to he mind he be move to confess the whole he relate how mr turner and the countess become acquaint and discover all those who be any way concern in it upon which they be all apprehend and some send to newgate and other to the tower have thus confess and be convict accord to due course of law he be hang at tyburn after he mr turner after she franklin then sir gervis yelvis be find guilty on they several arraignment be execute some of they die penitent the earl and the countess be both condemn but notwithstanding they guilt be greater than any of the other criminal the king to the astonishment of all he subject forgive they but they be both forbid to appear at court there be something strangely unaccountable in the behavior of somerset after condemnation when he be ask what he think of he condition and if he be prepare to die he answer that he think not of it at all for he be sure the king durst not command he to be execute this ridiculous boasting and bidding defiance to he majesty 's power be construe by some in a very odd manner and there be not want those who assert that somerset be privy to a secret of the king 's which if it have be reveal would have produce the strangest consternation in the kingdom that ever be know and draw down infamy upon he majesty for ever but as nothing can be ascertain concern it it might seem unfair to impute to this silly prince more fault than he perhaps commit : it be certain he be the slave of he favorite and not the most shocking crime in they it seem could entirely alienate he affection and it be doubtful whether the saving of somerset or the execution of raleigh reflect most disgrace upon he reign some have say that the body of sir thoma overbury be throw into a obscure

after a long night of gothic ignorance after many age of priestcraft and superstition learning and genius visit we island in the day of the renowned queen elizabeth it be then that liberty begin to dawn and the people have shake off the restraint of priestly austerity presume to think for themselves at a æra so remarkable as this so famous in history it seem no wonder that the nation would be bless with those immortal ornament of wit and learning who all conspire at once to make it famous -- this astonishing genius seem to be commission from above to deliver we not only from the ignorance under which we labor as to poetry but to carry poetry almost to its perfection but to write a panegyric on shakespear appear as unnecessary as the attempt would be vain for whoever have any taste for what be great terrible or tender may meet with the amplest gratification in shakespear as may those also have a taste for drollery and true humor he genius be almost boundless and he succeed alike in every part of write i can not forbear give the character of shakespear in the word of a great genius in a prologue speak by mr garrick when he first open drury-lane house as manager when learn 's triumph o'er she barb ` rous foe first rear have the stage -- immortal shakespear rise each change of many-coloured life he draw exhaust world and then imagine new existence see he spurn she bounded reign and panting time toil after he in vain all man have discover a curiosity to know the little story and particularity of a great genius for it often happen that when we attend a man to he closet and watch he moment of solitude we shall find such expression drop from he or we may observe such instance of peculiar conduct as will let we more into he real character than ever we can discover while we converse with he in public and when perhaps he appear under a kind of mask there be but few thing know of this great man few incident of he life have descend to posterity and tho ' no doubt the fame of he ability make a great noise in the age in which he flourish yet he station be not such as to produce many incident as it be subject to but few vicissitude mr rowe who well understand and greatly admire shakespear have be at pain to collect what incident be know or be to be find concern he and it be chiefly upon mr rowe 's authority we build the account now give we author be the son of john shakespear and be bear at stratford upon avon in warwickshire April 1564 at it appear by public record relate to that town the family from which he be descend be of good figure and fashion there and be mention as gentleman he father who be a considerable dealer in wool be incumbr with a large family of ten child could afford to give he eldest son but a slender education he have breed he at a free school where he acquire what latin he be master of but how well he understand that language or whether after he leave the school he make greater proficiency in it have be dispute and be a point very difficult to settle however it be certain that mr john shakespear we author 's father be oblige to withdraw he early from school in order to have he assistance in he own employment towards support the rest of the family it be without controversy say rowe that in he work we scarce find any trace that look like a imitation of the ancient the delicacy of he taste and the natural bent of he own great genius equal if not superior to some of the best of theirs would certainly have lead he to read and study they with so much pleasure that some of they fine image would naturally have insinuate themselves into and be mix with he own writings so that he not copy at least something from they may be a argument of he never have read they whether he ignorance of the ancient be disadvantageous to he or no may admit of dispute for tho ' the knowledge of they might have make he more correct yet it be not improbable but that the regularity and deference for they which would have attend that correctness might have restrain some of that fire impetuosity and even beautiful extravagance which we can not help admire in shakespear as to he want of learn mr pope make the follow just observation : that there be certainly a vast difference between learning and language how far he be ignorant of the latter i can not -lrb- say he -rrb- determine but it be plain he have much reading at least if they will not call it learn nor be it any great matter if a man have knowledge whether he have it from one language or from another nothing be more evident than that he have a taste for natural philosophy mechanic ancient and modern history poetical learning and mythology we find he very know in the custom rite and manners of the roman in coriolanus and julius cæsar not only the spirit but manners of the roman be exactly draw and still a nicer distinction be shewn between the manners of the roman in the time of the former and the latter he reading in the ancient historian be no less conspicuous in many reference to particular passage and the speech copy from plutarch in coriolanus may as well be make instance of he learning as those copy from cicero in the cataline of ben johnson the manners of other nation in general the ægyptians venetian french & c be draw with equal propriety whatever object of nature or branch of science he either speak or describe it be always with competent if not extensive knowledge he description be still exact and he metaphor appropriate and remarkably draw from the nature and inherent quality of each subject -- we have translation from ovid publish in he name among those poem which pass for he and for some of which we have undoubted authority be publish by himself and dedicate to the earl of southampton he appear also to have be conversant with plautus from whence he have take the plot of one of he play he follow the greek author and particularly dare phrygius in another although i will not pretend continue mr pope to say in what language he read they mr warburton have strongly contend for shakespear 's learning and have produce many imitation and parallel passage with ancient author in which i be incline to think he right and beg leave to produce few instance of it he always say mr warbur-ton make a ancient speak the language of a ancient so julius cæsar act i scene ii -- ye god it doth amaz I a man of such a feeble temper should so get the start of the majestic world and bear the palm alone this noble image be take from the olympic game this majestic world be a fine periphrasis of the roman empire majestic because the roman rank themselves on a footing with king and a world because they call they empire orbi romanus but the whole story seem to allude to cæsar 's great exemplar alexander who when he be ask whether he would run the course of the olympic game reply ` yes if the racer be king ' -- so again in anthony and cleopatra act i scene i anthony say with a astonishing sublimity let rome in tyber melt and the wide arch of the raze empire fall take from the roman custom of raise triumphal arch to perpetuate they victory and again act iii scene iv octavium say to anthony of the difference between he and she brother war ` twixt you twain would be as if the world should cleave and that slay man should solder up the reft -- this thought seem take from the story of curtius leap into the chasm in the forum in order to close it so that as that be close by one roman if the whole world be to cleave roman only could solder it up the metaphor of soldering be extreamly exact accord to mr warburton for say he as metal be solder up by metal that be more refined than that which it solder so the earth be to be solder by man who be only a more refined earth the manners of other nation in general the egyptian venetian french etc be draw with equal propriety a instance of this shall be produce with regard to the venetian in the merchant of venice act iv scene i -- he loss that have of late so huddle on he back enough to press a royal merchant down we be not to imagine the word royal to be a random sound epithet it be use with great propriety by the poet and design to shew he well acquaint with the history of the people whom he here bring upon the stage for when the french and venetian in the beginning of the thirteenth century have win constantinople the french under the emperor henry endeavor to extend they conquest in the province of the grecian empire on the terra firma while the venetian be master of the sea give liberty to any subject of the republic who would fit out vessel to make themselves master of the isle of the archipelago and other maritime place to enjoy they conquest in sovereignty only do homage to the republic for they several

to settle in the world after a family manner think fit to marry while he be yet very young he wife be the daughter of one hatchway say to have be a substantial yeoman in the neighborhood of stratford in this kind of domestic obscurity he continue for some time till by a unhappy instance of misconduct he be oblige to quit the place of he nativity and take shelter in london which luckily prove the occasion of display one of the greatest genius 's that ever be know in dramatic poetry he have the misfortune to fall into ill company : among these be some who make a frequent practice of deer-stealing and who engage he more than once in rob a park that belong to sir thoma lucy of charlecot near stratford for which he be prosecute by that gentleman as he think somewhat too severely and in order to revenge himself of this suppose ill usage he make a ballad upon he and tho ' this probably the first essay of he poetry be lose yet it be say to have be so very bitter that it redouble the prosecution against he to that degree that he be oblige to leave he business and family for some time and shelter himself in london this sir thoma lucy be it be say afterwards ridicule by shakespear under the well known character of justice shallow it be at this time and upon this accident that he be say to have make he first acquaintance in the playhouse here i can not forbear relate a story which sir william davenant tell mr betterton who communicate it to mr rowe rowe tell it mr pope and mr pope tell it to dr newton the late editor of milton and from a gentleman who hear it from he ` tis here related concern shakespear 's first appearance in the playhouse when he come to london he be without money and friend and be a stranger he know not to whom to apply nor by what mean to support himself -- at that time coach not be in use and as gentleman be accustom to ride to the playhouse shakespear drive to the last necessity go to the playhouse door and pick would up a little money by take care of the gentlemen horse who come to the play he become eminent even in that profession and be take notice of for he diligence and skill in it he have soon more business than he himself could manage and at last hire boy under he who be know by the name of shakespear 's boy : some of the player accidentally converse with he find he so acute and master of so fine a conversation that strike therewith they and recommend he to the house in which he be first admit in a very low station but he do not long remain so for he soon distinguish himself if not as a extraordinary actor at least as a fine writer he name be paint as the custom be in those time amongst those of the other player before some old play but without any particular account of what sort of part he use to play : and mr rowe say that tho ' he very carefully enquire he find the top of he performance be the ghost in he own hamlet i should have be much more pleased continue rowe to have learn from some certain authority which be the first play he writ it would be without doubt a pleasure to any man curious in thing of this kind to see and know what be the first essay of a fancy like shakespear 's the highest date which rowe have be able to trace be romeo and juliet in 1597 when the author be thirty-three year old and richard ii and iii the next year viz the thirty-fourth of he age tho ' the order of time in which he several piece be write be generally uncertain yet there be passage in some few of they that seem to fix they date so the chorus at the end of the fourth act of henry v by a compliment very handsomely turn to the earl of essex shews the play to have be write when that lord be general to the queen in ireland and he eulogium upon queen elizabeth and she successor king jame in the latter end of he henry viii be a proof of that play 's be write after the accession of the latter of these two prince to the throne of england whatever the particular time of he writing be the people of the age he live in who begin to grow wonderfully fond of diversion of this kind could not but be highly please to see a genius arise amongst they of so pleasurable so rich a vein and and so plentifully capable of furnish they favorite entertainment besides the advantage which shakespear have over all man in the article of wit he be of a sweet gentle amiable disposition and be a most agreeable companion so that he become dear to all that know he both as a friend and as a poet and by that mean be introduce to the best company and hold conversation with the finest character of he time queen elizabeth have several of he play act before she and that princess be too quick a discerner and rewarder of merit to suffer that of shakespear to be neglect it be that maiden princess plainly whom he intend by -- a fair vestal thron by the west midsummer night dream and in the same play he give we a poetical and lively representation of the queen of scot and the fate she meet with -- thou rememb ` rest since once i sit upon a promontory and hear a sea-maid on a dolphin 's back utter such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grow civil at she song and certain star shoot madly from they sphere to hear the sea-maid 's music queen elizabeth be so well pleased with the admirable character of falstaff in the two part of henry iv that she command he to continue it in one play more and to make he in love this be say to have be the occasion of he write the merry wife of windsor how well she be obey the play itself be a proof and here i can not help observe that a poet seldom succeed in any subject assign he so well as that which be he own choice and where he have the liberty of selecting : nothing be more certain than that shakespear have fail in the merry wife of windsor and tho ' that comedy be not without merit yet it fall short of he other play in which falstaff be introduce and that knight be not half so witty in the merry wife of windsor as in henry iv the humor be scarcely natural and do not excite to laughter so much as the other it appear by the epilogue to henry iv that the part of falstaff be write originally under the name of oldcastle some of that family be then remain the queen be please to command he to alter it upon which he make use of the name of falstaff the first offence be indeed avoid but i be not sure whether the author might not be somewhat to blame in he second choice since it be certain that sir john falstaff who be a knight of the garter and a lieutenant-general be a name of distinguished merit in the war with france in henry v and henry vith 's time shakespear besides the queen 's bounty be patronize by the earl of southampton famous in the history of that time for he friendship to the unfortunate earl of essex it be to that nobleman he dedicate he poem of venus and adoni and it be report that he lordship give we author a thousand pound to enable he to go through with a purchase he hear he have a mind to make a bounty at that time very considerable as money then be value : there be few instance of such liberality in we time there be no certain account when shakespear quit the stage for a private life some have think that spenser 's thalium in the tear of the muse where she lament the loss of she willy in the comic scene relate to we poet 's abandon the stage but it be well know that spenser himself die in the year 1598 and five year after this we find shakespear 's name amongst the actor in ben johnson 's sejanus which first make its appearance in the year 1603 nor could he then have any thought of retire since that very year a license by king jame the first be grant to he with burbage philipp hemming condel & c to exercise the art of play comedy tragedy & c as well at they usual house call the globe on the other side the water as in any other part of the kingdom during he majesty 's pleasure this license be print in rymer 's fædera besides it be certain shakespear do not write macbeth till after the accession of jame i which he do as a compliment to he as he there embrace the doctrine of witch of which he majesty be so fond that he write a book call dæmonalogy in defense of they existence and likewise at that time begin to touch for the evil which shakespear have take notice of and pay he a fine turn compliment so that what spenser there say if it relate at all to shakespear must hint at some occasional recess which he make for a time what particular friendship he contract with private man we can not at this time know more than that every one who have a true taste for merit and could distinguish man have generally a just value and esteem for he he exceed candor and good nature must certainly have incline all the gentler part of the world to love he as the power of he wit oblige the man of the most refined knowledge and polite learning to admire he he acquaintance with ben johnson begin with a remarkable piece of humanity and good nature : mr johnson who be at that time altogether unknown to the world have offer one of he play to the stage in order to have it act and the person into whose hand it be put after have turn it carelessly over be just upon return it to he with a ill-natured answer that it would be of no service to they company when shakespeare luckily cast he eye upon it and find something so well in it as to engage he first to read it through and afterwards to recommend mr johnson and he writings to the public the latter part of we author 's life be spend in ease and retirement he have the good fortune to gather a estate equal to he want and in that to he wish and be say to have spend some year before he death in he native stratford he pleasant wit and good nature engage he in the acquaintance and entitle he to the friendship of the gentleman of the neighborhood it be still remember in that county that he have a particular intimacy with one mr combe a old gentleman note thereabout for he wealth and usury it happen that in a pleasant conversation amongst they common friend mr combe merrily tell shakespear that he fancy he intend to write he epitaph if he happen to out-live he and since he could not know what might be say of he when dead he desire it might be do immediately upon which shakespear give he these line ten in the hundred lye here engrave ` tis a hundred to ten he soul be not save : if any man asketh who lie in this tomb oh oh quoth the devil ` tis my john-a-combe but the sharpness of the satire be say to have sting the man so severely that he never forgive it shakespear die in the fifty-third year of he age and be bury on the north side of the chancel in the great church at stratford where a monument be place on the wall the follow be the inscription on he grave-stone good friend for jesus sake forbear to dig the dust inclose here blest be the man that spare these stone and cur would be he that move my bone he have three daughter of whom two live to be marry judith the elder to mr thoma quincy by whom she have three son who all die without child and susannah who be he favorite to dr john hall a physician of good reputation in that county she leave one child a daughter who be marry to thoma nash esq and afterwards to sir john bernard of abington but deceased likewise without issue he dramatic writings be first publish together in folio 1623 by some of the actor of the different company they have be act in and perhaps by other servant of the theater into whose hand copy might have fall and since republish by mr rowe mr pope mr theobald sir thoma hanmer and mr warburton ben johnson in he discovery have make a sort of essay towards the character of shakespear i shall present it the reader in he own word ' i remember the player have often mention it as a honor to shakespear that in write he never blot out a line my answer have be would he have blot out a thousand which they think a malevolent speech i have not tell posterity this but for they ignorance who chuse that circumstance to commend they friend by wherein he most fault and to justify my own character -lrb- for i lov would the man and do honor to he memory on this side idolatry as much as any -rrb- he be indeed honest and of a open free nature have a excellent fancy brave notion and gentle expression wherein he flow with that facility that sometimes it be necessary he should be stopp would he wit be in he own power : would the rule of it have be so many time he fall into those thing which could not escape laughter as when he say in the person of cæsar one speak to he cæsar thou dost I wrong he reply cæsar do never wrong but with just cause ` and such like which be ridiculous but he redeem he vice with he virtue there be ever more in they to be praise than to be pardon ' ben in he conversation with mr drumond of hawthornden say that shakespear want art and sometimes sense the truth be ben be himself a better critic than poet and though he be ready at discover the fault of shakespear yet he be not master of such a genius as to rise to he excellency and great as johnson be he appear not a little tinctured with envy notwithstanding the defect of shakespear he be justly elevated above all other dramatic writer if ever any author deserve the name of original -lrb- say pope -rrb- it be he : -lrb- 1 -rrb- ` he poetry be inspiration indeed he be not so much a imitator as instrument of nature and it be not so just to say of he that he speak from she as that she speak through he he character be so much nature herself that it be a sort of injury to call they by so distant a name as copy of she the power over we passion be likewise never possess in so eminent a degree or display in so many different instance nor be he more a matter of the great than of the ridiculous in human nature nor only excel in the passion since he be full as admirable in the coolness of reflection and reasoning : he sentiment be not only in general the most pertinent and judicious upon every subject but by a talent very peculiar something between penetration and felicity he hit upon that particular point on which the bent of each argument or the force of each motive depend ' we author 's play be to be distinguish only into comedy and tragedy those which be call history and even some of he comedy be really tragedy with a mixture of comedy amongst they that way of tragi-comedy be the common mistake of that age and be indeed become so agreeable to the english taste that though the severer critic among we can not bear it yet the generality of we audience seem better pleased with it than a exact tragedy there be certainly a great deal of entertainment in he comic humor and a pleasing and well distinguish variety in those character he think fit to exhibit with he image be indeed every where so lively that the thing he would represent stand full before you and you possess every part of it of which this instance be astonishing : it be a image of patience speaking of a maid in love he say ------ she never tell she love but let concealment like a worm i ` th ` bud feed on she damask cheek : she pin would in thought and sit like patience on a monument smile at grief but what be characteristically the talent of shakespear and which perhaps be the most excellent part of the drama be the manners of he person in act and in speak what be proper for they and fit to be shewn by the poet in make a apparent difference between he character and mark every one in the strongest manner poet who have not a little succeed in write for the stage have yet fall short of they great original in the general power of the drama none ever find so ready a road to the heart he tender scene be inexpressibly move and such as be mean to raise terror be no less alarming but then shakespeare do not much shine when he be consider by particular passage he sometimes debase the noblest image in nature by expression which be too vulgar for poetry the ingenious author of the rambler have observe that in the invocation of macbeth before he proceed to the murder of duncan when he thus express himself --------- come thick night and veil thee in the dunnest smoke of hell nor heaven peep thro ' the blanket of the dark to cry hold hold that the word dunnest and blanket which be so common in vulgar mouth destroy in some manner the grandeur of the image and be two word of a higher signification and remove above common use put in they place i may challenge poetry itself to furnish a image so noble poet of a inferior class when consider by particular passage be excellent but then they idea be not so great they drama be not so striking and it be plain enough that they possess not soul so elevated as shakespeare 's what can be more beautiful than the flow enchantment of rowe the delicate and tender touch of otway and southern or the melting enthusiasm of lee and dryden but yet none of they piece have affect the human heart like shakespeare 's but i can not conclude the character of shakespeare without take notice that besides the suffrage of almost all wit since he time in he favor he be particularly happy in that of dryden who have read and study he clearly sometimes borrow from he and well know where he strength lay in he prologue to the tempest alter he have the follow line shakespear who teach by none do first impart to fletcher wit to lab ` ring johnson art he monarch-like give there he subject law and be that nature which they paint and draw fletcher reach that which on he height do grow while johnson creep and gather all below : this do he love and this he mirth digest one imitate he most the other best if they have since outwrit all other man ` tis from the drop which fall from shakespear 's pen the storm -lrb- 2 -rrb- which vanish on the neighb ` ring shore be teach by shakespear 's tempest first to roar that innocence and beauty which do smile in fletcher grow in this inchanted isle but shakespear 's magic could not copy be

great pleasantry and humor he fortune be easy the court he element and which be ever a advantage to a author wit be not he business but diversion : ` tis not to be doubt but he translation of ariosto be publish after spenser 's fairy queen and yet both in language and number it be much inferior as much as it be reasonable to suppose the genius of harrington be below that of spenser mr cooper remark that the whole poem of orlando be a tedious medley of unnatural character and improbable event and that the author 's patron cardinal hippolito de este have some reason for that severe question where the devil signior ludovico do you pick up all these damned lie the genius of ariosto seem infinitely more fit for satire than heroic poetry and some be of opinion that have harrington write nothing but epigram he have be more in he own way we can not certainly fix the time that sir john die but it be reasonable to suppose that it be about the middle or rather towards the latter end of

i which play be write long after fletcher die and transplant into love 's pilgrimage after print the new inn which be in the year 1630 and two of the play print under fletcher 's name the coronation and the little thief have be claim by shirley as he it be probable they be leave imperfect by the one and finish by the other mr fletcher die of the plague in the forty ninth year of he age the first of king charle i a 1625 and be bury in st mary overy 's church in southwark beaumont and fletcher as have be observe write play in concert but what share each bear in form the plot write the scene & c be unknown the general opinion be that beaumont 's judgment be usually employ in correct and retrench the superfluity of fletcher 's wit whose fault be as mr cartwright express it to do too much but if winstanley may be credit the former have he share likewise in the drama for that author relate that we poet meet once at a tavern in order to form the rude draught of a tragedy fletcher undertake to kill the king which word be overhear by a waiter he be officious enough in order to recommend himself to lodge a information against they : but they loyalty be unquestioned and the relation of the circumstance probable that the vengeance be only aim at a theatrical monarch the affair end in a jest the first play which bring they into esteem as dryden say be philaster or love lie a bleeding for before that they have write two or three very unsuccessfully as the like be report of ben johnson before he writ every man in he humor these author have with the advantage of the wit of shakespear which be they precedent great natural gift improve by study they plot be allow generally more regular than shakespear 's they touch the tender passion and excite love in a very move manner they fault notwithstanding beaumont 's castigation consist in a certain luxuriance and stretch they speech to a immoderate length -lrb- 2 -rrb- however it must be own they wit be great they language suit to the passion they raise and the age in which they live be a sufficient apology for they defect mr dryden tell we in he essay on dramatic poetry that beaumont and fletcher 's play in he time be the most please and frequent entertainment of the stage two of theirs be act through the year for one of shakespear 's or johnson 's and the reason he assign be because there be a certain gaiety in they comedy and a pathos in they most serious play which suit generally with all man 's humor but however it might be when dryden writ the case be now reverse for beaumont and fletcher 's play be not act above once a season while one of shakespear 's be represent almost every third night it may seem strange that wit of the first magnitude should not be so much honor in the age in which they live as by posterity -lrb- 3 -rrb- it be now fashionable to be in rapture with shakespear edition be multiply upon edition and man of the greatest genius have employ all they power in illustrate he beauty which ever grow upon the reader and gain ground upon perusal these noble author have receive incense of praise from the highest pen they be love and esteem by they cotemporary who have not fail to demonstrate they respect by various copy of verse at different time and upon different occasion address to they the insertion of which would exceed the bound propose for this work i shall only observe that amongst the illustrious name of they admirer be denham waller cartwright ben johnson sir john berkenhead and dryden himself a name more than equal to all the rest but the work of we author have not escape the censure of critic especially mr rhymer the historiographer who be really a man of wit and judgment but somewhat ill natured for he have labor to expose the fault without take any notice of the beauty of rollo duke of normandy the king and no king and the maid tragedy in a piece of he call the tragedy of the last age consider and examine by the practice of the ancient and by the common sense of all age in a letter to fleetwood shepherd esquire mr rymer send one of he book as a present to mr dryden who in the blank leaf before the beginning and after the end of the book make several remark as if he intend to publish a answer to that critic and he opinion of the work be this -lrb- 4 -rrb- my judgment -lrb- say he -rrb- of this piece be that it be extremely learn but the author seem better acquaint with the greek than the english poet that all writer ought to study this critic as the best account i have see of the ancient that the model of tragedy he have here give be extremely correct but that it be not the only model of tragedy because it be too much circumscribe in the plot character & c and lastly that we may be teach here justly to admire and imitate the ancient without give they the preference with this author in prejudice to we own country some of beaumont and fletcher 's play be print in quarto during the life of they author and in the year 1645 twenty year after fletcher 's death there be publish in folio a collection of they play which have not be print before amount to between thirty and forty at the beginning of this volume be insert a

vivacity of genius in he application to he study some have say that after leave the university he settle himself in the middle-temple and study the law but this opinion must be erroneous since he declare afterwards on he trial that he never read a word of law 'till he be prisoner in the tower in 1569 when he be not above 17 year of age he be one of the select troop of a hundred gentleman voluntier whom queen elizabeth permit henry champernon to transport into france for the assistance of protestant prince there -lrb- 2 -rrb- but of what service they be or what be the consequence of the expedition we have no account so great a scene of action as the whole kingdom of france be at that period give raleigh a opportunity of acquire experience and reading character as well as improve himself in the knowledge of language and manners and he own history of the world contain some remark which he then make of the conduct of some great general there of which he have himself be witness after we author 's return from france he embark in a expedition to the northern part of america with sir humphry gilbert he brother by the mother 's side that gentleman have obtain the queen 's patent to plant and inhabit such part of it as be unpossessed by any prince with whom she be in alliance but this attempt prove unsuccessful by means of the division which arise amongst the voluntier the next year 1580 upon the descent of the spanish and italian force in ireland under the pope 's banner for the support of the desmond in they rebellion in munster he have a captain 's commission under the lord gray of wilton to whom at that time the famous spenser be secretary but the chief service which captain raleigh perform be under thoma earl of ormond governor of munster he surprize the irish kern at ramile and have inclose they take every rebel upon the spot who do not fall in the conflict among the prisoner there be one laden with withy who be ask what he intend to have do with they boldly answer to have hang up the english charle upon which raleigh order he to be immediately dispatch in that manner and the rest of the robber and murderer to be punish accord to they desert -lrb- 3 -rrb- the earl of ormond depart for england in the spring of the year 1581 he government of munster be give to captain raleigh in which he behave with great vigilance and honor he fight the arch rebel barry at clove whom he charge with the utmost bravery and after a hard struggle put to flight in the month of August 1581 captain john gouch be appoint governor of munster by the lord deputy raleigh attend he in several journy to settle and compose that country but the chief place of they residence be cork and after gouch have cut off sir john desmond brother to the earl of desmond who be at the head of the rebellion he leave the government of that city to raleigh -lrb- 4 -rrb- whose company be not long after disband upon the reduction of that earl the slaughter of he brother and the submission of barry he return to england the lord deputy gray have resign the sword in ireland towards the end of August 1582 the dispute between he and raleigh upon reason which be variously assign by different writer be bring to a hearing before the council table in england where the latter support he cause with such ability as procured he the good opinion both of she majesty and the lord of the council and this add to the patronage of the earl of leicester be suppose to be one considerable occasion of he preferment though it do not immediately take place nor could the hope of it restrain he from a second expedition with he brother sir humphry gilbert to newfoundland for which he build a ship of 200 ton call the bark raleigh and furnish it compleatly for the voyage in which he resolve to attend he brother as he vice-admiral that fleet depart from plymouth the 11th of June 1583 but after it have be two or three day at sea a contagious distemper have seize the whole crew of raleigh 's ship oblige he to return to that port however by this accident he escape the misfortune of that expedition for after sir humphry have take possession of newfoundland in the right of the crown of england and assign land to every man of he company and fail three hundred league in the voyage home with full hope of the queen 's assistance to fit out a fleet next year he unfortunately perish for venture rashly in a frigate of but ten ton he be on the ninth of September that year at midnight swallow up in a high sea another vessel suffer the same fate and even the rest return not without great hazard and loss -lrb- 5 -rrb- : but this ill success could not divert raleigh from pursue a scheme of such importance to he country as those discovery in north america he draw up a account of the advantage of such a design and the means of prosecute it which he lay before the queen and council who be so well satisfy with the probability of success that on the 25th of march 1584 she majesty grant he letter patent in favor of he project contain free liberty to discover such remote heathen and barbarous land as be not actually possess by any christian prince nor inhabit by christian people immediately upon this grant raleigh choose two able and experienced captain and furnish they with two vessel fit out at he own expence with such expedition that on the 27th of April follow they set sail for the west of england take they course by the canary island where they arrive on the 10th of may towards the west indy and that be in those day the best and most frequented rout to america they pass by the carribbe island in the beginning of June and reach the gulph of florida on the 2d of July sailing along the shore about one hundred and twenty mile before they could find a convenient harbor at last they debark in a very low land which prove to be a island call wohoken and after take formal possession of the country they carry on a friendly correspondence with the native indian who supply they with a great variety of fish and venison and give they fur and deerskin in exchange for trifle thus encourage by the native eight of the company in a boat go up the river occam twenty mile and next day in the evening they come to a island call roanah which be but seven league from the place where they ship lay here they find the residence of the indian chief whose name be grangamineo whose house consist of nine apartment build of cedar fortify round with sharp piece of timber : he wife come out to they and order the people to carry they from the boat on they back and shew they many other civility they continue they intercourse with the native for some time still view the situation of the adjacent country and after have obtain the best information they could of the number and strength of the indian nation in that neighborhood and of they connexion alliance or contest with each other they return about the middle of September to england and make such a advantageous report of the fertility of the soil and healthiness of the climate that the queen favor the design of settle a colony in that country to which she be please to give the name of virginium -lrb- 6 -rrb- about two month after raleigh be choose knight of the shire for he county of devon and make a considerable figure in parliament where a bill pass in confirmation of he patent for the discovery of foreign country during the course of this session he receive the honor of knighthood from she majesty a distinction the more honorable to he as the queen be extreamly cautious in confer title and besides the patent for discovery she grant he about the same time a power to license the vend of wine throughout the kingdom which be in all probability very lucrative to he but it engage he in a dispute with the university of cambridge which have oppose one keymer whom he have license to sell wine there contrary to the privilege of that university the parliament be prorogue raleigh intent upon plant he new colony in virginia set out he own fleet of seven sail for that country under the command of he cousin sir richard greenville who after have visit the country leave behind he a hundred and seven person to settle a colony at roanah in he return to england he take a spanish prize worth 50000 l but this be not the only circumstance of good fortune which happen to raleigh this year for the rebellion in ireland be now suppress and the forfeit land divide into signiory among those principally who have be instrumental in the important service of reduce that country she majesty grant he one of the largest portion consist of twelve thousand acre in the county of cork and waterford with certain privilege and immunity upon condition of plant and improve the same to which the other grantee be oblige in the year 1586 we find we author so highly advance in the queen 's favor so extremely popular on account of he patronage of learn man ard the active spirit he exert in business that she majesty make he seneschal in the dutchy of cornwall but these distinction incur the usual effect of court preferment and expose sir walter to the envy of those who be much inferior to he in merit and even the earl of leicester himself who have formerly be he great patron become jealous of he and set up in opposition to he he nephew the young earl of essex the comedian likewise take the liberty to reflect upon raleigh 's power and influence upon the queen which she majesty resent so highly as to forbid tarleton the most celebrated actor of that age from approach she presence raleigh sollicitous for the prosperity of the plantation in virginium send out new supplies from time to time some of whom be oblige to return home and the general alarm spread over the nation on account of the spanish invasion throw all thing into disorder about the beginning of the year 1587 he be raise to the dignity of captain of she majesty 's guard which he hold together with the place of lord-warden of the stannary and lieutenant-general of the county of cornwall from this time till the year 1594 we find sir walter continually engage in project new expedition send succor to colony abroad or manage affair in parliament with consummate address in the year 1593 we find father parson the jesuit charge he with no less a crime than atheism and that he have found a school in which he teach atheistical principle and have make a great many young gentleman convert to they the most considerable authority to countenance the suspicion of sir walter 's religion be that of archbishop abbot who in a letter date at lambeth address to sir thoma roe then a ambassador at the mogul 's court expressly charge sir walter with doubt god 's be and omnipotence -lrb- 7 -rrb- but it be highly probable sir walter 's opinion might be misrepresent by he enemy or wrong conclusion draw from those which he maintain and it would be a shocking injustice to the memory of so great a man to suspect he of irreligion whose writings contain not the least trace of it and whose history of the world in particular breathe a strong spirit of real and genuine piety in the heighth of he favor with the queen he fall under she majesty 's displeasure for be enamour of mr elizabeth throgmorton one of the queen 's maid of honor whom he debauch and such it seem be the chastity of these time that a frailty of that sort be look upon as the highest offence she majesty be so exasperated that she command he to be confine several month and after he enlargement forbid he the court whence the poor lady be likewise dismiss from she attendance about the maiden queen who appear in this case the champion of virginity sir walter soon make she a honorable reparation by marriage and they be both example of conjugal affection and fidelity during the time we author continue under she majesty 's displeasure for this offence he project the discovery of the rich and extensive empire of guiana in the south of america which the spaniard have then visit and to that day have never conquer for this purpose have collect information relate to it he send a old officer to take a view of the coast who return the year follow with a very favourable account of the riches of the country which he have receive from some of the principal cassique upon the border of it this determine raleigh 's resolution who provide a squadron of ship at a very great expence and the lord high admiral howard and sir robert cecil conceive so good a opinion of the design that both concur in it he personally engage in the attempt and with no great number of ship so far explore the unknown country that he make greater progress in a few month than the spaniard have do for many year and have satisfy himself of the certainty of the gold mine of the country he return home with honor and riches the latter end of the summer 1595 and in the year follow publish in quarto a account of the voyage and discovery dedicate to lord admiral howard and sir robert cecil the next year sir walter be so far restore to the queen 's favor that he be engage in the important and successful expedition to cadiz in which the earl of essex and lord admiral howard be joint commander and raleigh of the council of war and one of the admiral in this as in all he other expedition he behave with equal conduct and courage after he return from the successful expedition under the earl of essex he promote a reconciliation between that nobleman and secretary cecil in consequence of which he be himself fully reinstate in the queen 's favor and have the command of captain of the guard restore to he with other mark of she forgiveness in 1597 he be employ in the island voyage as rear admiral the earl of essex have the chief command and the lord thoma howard the post of vice-admiral the design of it be to defeat and destroy at ferol as well as in the other port of the enemy the spanish fleet intend for a new expedition against england and ireland and to seize upon such indian fleet of treasure as they should meet with belong to the king of spain to conquer restrain and garrison most of the isle of the azore and especially the terceras but the success of this expedition do not answer the greatness of the preparation for it the jealousy of the earl of essex the commander obstruct the service which sir walter 's ability might otherwise have perform in the council of war which be hold before the isle of flore it be resolve that the general and sir walter should jointly attack the island of fyal where the latter wait seven day for he lordship and hearing nothing of he call a council of war in which it be determine that raleigh should attempt the town himself which he do with astonishing bravery and success essex find himself deprive of the honor of take fyal be exasperate to such a degree that he break some of the officer who have behave with great gallantry under raleigh and some of he sycophant alledge that raleigh himself deserve to lose he head for breach of article in landing without he lordship order upon they return to england the earl endeavor to transfer the miscarriage of the expedition upon raleigh and gain to he side the populace whom sir walter never court and whose patronage he scorn but the queen herself be not well pleased with the earl 's conduct since it be judge he might have do more than he do and he proceedings against sir walter in call he action to public question be highly disapprove -lrb- 8 -rrb- the next important transaction we find raleigh engage in be in 1601 when the unfortunate earl of essex who have calumniate he to the king of scotland and endeavor all he could to shake he interest be so ill advise by he creature as to attempt a public insurrection raleigh be active in suppress it : the earl pretend that the cause of he take arm be to defend himself against the violence of he personal enemy the lord cobham and raleigh have form a design of murder he tho ' on the other hand it be pretty certain that sir ferdinand gorge one of the earl 's accomplice afterwards accuse sir christopher blount another of they for persuade he to kill or at least apprehend sir walter which gorge refuse blount discharge four shot after he in a boat blount acknowledge this and at the time of he execution ask sir walter forgiveness for it which he readily grant -- while the earl garison he house sir walter be one of those who invest it and when he lordship be bring to he trial he with forty of the queen 's guard be present upon duty and be likewise examine with relation to a conference which he have upon the thame the morning of the insurrection with sir ferdinando gorge at the execution of essex six day after in the tower raleigh attend probably in he character of captain of the guard and stand near the scaffold that he might the better answer if essex should be desirous of speak to he but retire before the earl 's execution because the people seem to take he appearance there in a wrong light tho ' he afterwards repent of it as the earl express a inclination to see and speak with he before he death which be in all probability to have ask raleigh 's forgiveness for have traduce and calumniate he in order to color he own rash design in 1602 we author sell he estate in ireland to mr boyle afterwards earl of cork and about midsummer he settle he estate of sherbone on he son walter on account of a challenge which he have receive from sir amias preston who have be knight at cadiz by the earl of essex which challenge sir walter intend to accept and therefore dispose he affair in proper order the cause of they quarrel do not appear but they be afterwards reconcile without proceed to a duel -lrb- 9 -rrb- the death of queen elizabeth on the 24th of march 1602-3 prove a great misfortune to raleigh jame she successor have be prejudice against he by the earl of essex who insinuate that raleigh be no friend to he succession nor have any regard for he family and these prejudice be heighten by secretary cecil in he private correspondence with that pusilanimous jealous prince before he ascend the throne of england or at least immediately upon that event for tho ' raleigh and cecil have unite against essex yet after the ruin of that earl and he party they seeming friendship terminate in a mutual struggle for a superiority of power but there be another important cause of jame 's disgust to sir walter which be that he lord cobham and sir john fortescue would have oblige the king to article before he be admit to the throne and that the number of he countryman should be limitt which add to the circumstance of sir walter 's zeal to take off he mother inspire he majesty with a confirm aversion to he and indeed the tragical end of the queen of scot be perhaps the greatest error with which the annals of that glorious reign be stain raleigh in vain endeavor to gain the affection of the new king which he attempt by transfer on secretary cecil the blood of the earl of essex as well as that of he royal mother but this attempt to secure the affection of a weak prince end in he ruin for it exasperate cecil the more against he and as sir walter be of a active martial genius the king who be a lover of peace and a natural coward be afraid that so military a man would involve he in a war which he hate above all thing in the world we author be soon remove from he command as captain of the guard which be bestow upon sir thoma erskin he majesty 's favorite as well as countryman -lrb- 10 -rrb- the predecessor to the earl of mar whose action perform in the year 1715 be recent in every one 's memory not long after he majesty 's ascend the throne of england sir walter be charge with a plot against the king and royal family but no clear evidence be ever produce that raleigh have any concern in it the plot be to have surprize the king and court to have create commotion in scotland animated the discontented in england and advance arabellum stuart cousin to the king to the throne arabellum be the daughter of lord charle stuart younger brother to henry lord darnly and son to the duke of lenox she be afterwards marry to william seymor son to lord beauchamp and grandson to the earl of hertford and both be confine for the presumption of marry without he majesty 's consent from which they make they escape but be again retaken lady arabellum die of grief and mr seymor live to be a great favorite with charle i raleigh persist in avow he ignorance of the plot and when he come to he trial he behave himself so prudently and defend himself with so much force that the mind of the people present who be at first exasperate against he be turn from the severest hatred to the tenderest pity notwithstanding sir walter 's proof that he be innocent of any such plot and that lord cobham who have once accuse he have recant and sign he recantation nor be produce against he face to face a pack would jury bring he in guilty of high treason sentence of death be pronounce against he he humbly request that the king might be make acquaint with the proof upon which he be cast he accompany the sheriff to prison with wonderful magnanimity tho ' in a manner suit to he unhappy situation raleigh be keep near a month at winchester in daily expectation of death and in a very pathetic letter write he last word to he wife the night before he expect to suffer -lrb- 11 -rrb- in which he hope he blood would quench they malice who have murder he and pray god to forgive he persecutor and accuser the king sign the warrant for the execution of the lord cobham and gray and sir griffin markham at winchester pretend say lord cecil to forbear sir walter for the present till lord cobham 's death have give some light how far he would make good he accusation markham be first bring upon the scaffold and when he be on he knee ready to receive the blow of the ax the groom of the bedchamber produce to the sheriff he majesty 's warrant to stop the execution and markham be tell that he must withdraw a while into the hall to be confront by the lord then lord gray be bring forth and have pour out he prayer and confession be likewise call aside and lastly lord cobham be expose in the same manner and perform he devotions though we do not find that he say one word of he guilt or innocence or charge raleigh with have instigate he all which circumstance seem more than sufficient to wipe off from the memory of raleigh the least suspicion of any plot against jame 's person or government he be remand to the tower of london with the rest of the prisoner of whom markham afterwards obtain he liberty and travel abroad lord gray of wilton die in the tower lord cobham be confine there many year during which it be say he be examine by the king in relation to raleigh and entirely clear he he afterwards die in the lowest circumstance of distress in February follow a grant be make by the king of all the goods and chattel forfeit by sir walter 's conviction to the trustee of he appoint for the benefit of he creditor lady and child after 12 year confinement in the tower in march 1615 he be release out of it by the interposition of the favorite buckingham but before he quit that place he see the earl of somerset commit there for the murder of sir thoma overbury and afterwards condemn which occasion sir walter to compare he own case with that of the earl 's and to remark ` that the whole history of the world have not the like precedent of a king 's prisoner to purchase freedom and he bosom favorite ` to have the halter but in scripture in the case of mordecaus and haman ' on hearing which the king be say to have reply that raleigh might die in that deceit which afterwards prove true for the king pardon the infamous somerset a murderer and execute raleigh a brave and a honest man equally to the astonishment of the world sir walter be now at large have the means of prosecute he old scheme of settle guiana which he have so much at heart that even during he imprisonment he hold a constant correspondence with that country send thither every year or every second year a ship to keep the indian in hope of be relieve from the tyranny of the spaniard who have again encroach upon they and massacre many both of the inhabitant and of raleigh 's man in these ship be bring several native of the country with whom he converse in the tower and obtain all possible information concern it upon such information he offer he scheme for prosecute he discovery to the court before he undertake it in person : nor be there any doubt either as to the improbability of the design or its unlawfulness notwithstanding the peace make with spain otherwise the king would not have make such grant as he do even at that time which shew that he be then convince that sir walter have in he first voyage discover and take possession of that country for the crown of england and consequently that he subject be justly intitle to any benefit that might arise from its discovery without the least respect to the pretension of the spaniard : besides when sir walter first move the court upon this subject the spanish match be not think of and the king 's necessity be then very press he may be presume to have conceive great hope from that discovery though he might afterwards change he opinion when he grow so unreasonably fond of that match in 1616 he obtain a royal commission to settle guiana at the expence of himself and he friend he be appoint general and commander in chief of this enterprize and governor of the new country which he be to settle with ample authority a power be grant he too of exercise martial law in such a manner as the king 's lieutenant general by sea or land or any lieutenant of the county of england have these power seem to imply a virtual pardon to raleigh and perhaps make he less solicitous for a actual one meantime gondemar the spanish ambassador by he address vivacity and flattering the humor of jame have gain a great ascendency over he and begin to make a great clamor about raleigh 's preparation and from that moment form scheme of destroy he the whole expence of this expedition be defray by raleigh and he friend the fleet consist of about seven sail on the 17th of November 1617 they come in sight of guiana and soon after to anchor in five degree off the river caliana where they remain till the 4th of December raleigh be receive with great joy by the indian who not only assist he with provision and every thing else in they power but offer he the sovereignty of they country if he would settle amongst they which he decline to accept -lrb- 12 -rrb- he extreme sickness for six week prevent he from undertake the discovery of the mine in person and be oblige to depute captain keymi to that service and accordingly on the 4th of December order five small ship to sail into the river oronoque when they land they find a spanish garrison between they and the mine which sally out unexpectedly put they in confusion and give they battle in this conflict young raleigh be kill and by a fatal mistake captain keymi do not prove the mine but burnt and plunder the spanish garrison and find amongst the governor 's papers one which inform he that raleigh 's expedition have be betray and that he be to be sacrifice to the spaniard upon keymi 's unsuccessful attempt raleigh sharply rebuke he for he mistake and a deviation from he order which so much affect that captain that he shoot himself in he own cabin and find the wound not mortal he finish he design by a long knife with which he stab himself to the heart in this distressful situation raleigh return home and find on he arrival at plymouth a declaration publish against he at which he take the alarm and contrived to convey himself out of the kingdom in a vessel hire for that purpose by a old officer of he but change he opinion in that respect he proceed in he journey to london yet think it proper to gain time for the appease he majesty by the assistance of one maneuric a french quack he counterfeit sickness for several day during which he write he apology however on the 7th of August he arrive at london where he be confine in he own house but have still good reason not to trust himself to the mercy of the court he form a design to escape into france which sir lewi stackley who be privy to and encourage it discover and sir walter be seize in a boat upon the river below woolwich be a second time on the 10th of August commit to the tower but tho ' he death seem absolutely determine yet it seem difficult to find a method of accomplish it since he conduct in the late expedition could not be stretch in law to such a sentence it be resolve therefore to sacrifice he to the resentment of spain in a manner so shameful that it have justly expose the conduct of the court to the indignation of all succeed age and transmit the pusillanimous monarch with infamy to posterity they call he down to judgment upon he former sentence pass fifteen year before which they be not then ashamed to execute a privy seal be send to the judge to order immediate execution on which a conference be hold Friday the 24th of oct 1688 between all the judge of england concern the manner how prisoner who have be attaint of treason and set at liberty should be bring to execution in consequence of they revolution a privy seal come to the king 's - bench command that court to proceed against sir walter accord to law who next day receive notice of the council to prepare himself for death and on Wednesday the 28th of that month at 8 o'clock in the morning be take out of bed in the hot fit of a ague and carry to the king 's - bench westminster where execution be award against he the next morning the 29th of October the day of the lord-mayor 's inauguration a solemnity never perhaps attend before with a public execution sir walter be conduct by the sheriff of middlesex to the old palace yard in westminster where mount the scaffold he behave with the most undaunted spirit and seeming cheerfulness the bishop of salisbury -lrb- tohon -rrb- be surprize at the hero 's contempt of death and expostulate with he upon it he tell he plainly that he never fear death and much less then for which he bless god and as to the manner of it tho ' to other it might seem grievous yet for himself he have rather die so than in a burning fever this verify the noble observation of shakespear that all hero have a contempt of death which he put in the mouth of julius cæsar when he friend dissuade he from go to the senate-house coward die many a time before they death the valiant never taste of death but once of all the wonder i have hear of yet it seem to I most strange that man should fear see that death the necessary end will come when it will come -- sir walter eat he breakfast that morning smoak he pipe and make no more of death than if he have be to take a journey on the scaffold he converse freely with the earl of arundel and other of the nobility and vindicate himself from two suspicion the first of enter into a confederacy with france the second of speak disloyally of he majesty he clear himself likewise of the suspicion of have persecute the earl of essex or of insulting he at he death he conclude with desire the good people to join with he in prayer to that great god of heaven whom -lrb- say he -rrb- i have grievously offend be a man full of vanity who have live a sinful life in such calling as have be most induce to it : for i have be a soldier a sailor and a courtier which be course of wickedness and vice the proclamation be make that all man should depart the scaffold he prepare himself for death give away he hat and cap and money to some attendant that stand near he when he take leave of the lord and other gentleman that stand near he he entreat the lord arundel to prevail with the king that no scandalous writings to defame he should be publish after he death conclude i have a long journey to go and therefore will take my leave then have put off he gown and doublet he call to the executioner to shew he the axe which not be presently do he say i pray thee let I see it do not thou think i be afraid of it and have it in he hand he feel along the edge of it and smile say to the sheriff this be a sharp medicine but it be a physician for all disease the executioner kneel down and ask he forgiveness sir walter lay he hand upon he shoulder grant it and be ask which way he would lay himself on the block he answer so the heart be right it be no matter which way the head lie he head be strike off at two blow he body never shrink nor move he head be shewn on each side of the scaffold and then put into a red leather bag and with he velvet night-gown throw over be afterwards convey away in a mourning coach of he lady 's he body be inter in the chancel of st margaret 's church westminster but he head be long preserve in a case by he widow who survive he twenty-years thus fall sir walter raleigh in the 66th year of he age a sacrifice to a contemptible administration and the resentment of a mean prince : a man of so great ability that neither that nor the precede reign produce he equal he character be a combination of almost every eminent quality he be the soldier statesman and scholar unite and have he live with the hero of antiquity he would have make a just parallel to cæsar and xenophon like they be equal master of the sword and the pen one circumstance must not be omit which in a life so full of action as he be somewhat extraordinary viz that whether he be on board he ship upon important and arduous expedition busy in court transaction or pursue scheme of pleasure he never fail to dedicate at least four hour every day to study by which he become so much master of all knowledge and be enable as a poet beautifully express it to enrich the world with he prison-hours -lrb- 13 -rrb- as the sentence of raleigh blacken but he king so he memory will be ever dear to the lover of learning and of they country : and tho ' he make not a very great figure as a poet have business of greater importance continually upon he hand yet it would have be a unpardonable negligence to omit he as he do honor to the list and deserve all the encomium a honest mind can give or the most masterly pen bestow and it be to be wish some man of eminent talent whose genius be turn to biography -lrb- of such at present we be not destitute -rrb- would undertake the life of this hero and by mix pleasing and natural

of person of distinction in the year 1573 be then but about ten year of age he be page to some honorable person as may be collect from he own word : in some of he epistle to henry reynold esquire it appear that even then he could construe he cato and some other little collection of sentence which make he very anxious to know what sort of being the poet be and very press upon he tutor to make he if possible a poet in consequence of this he be put to the reading of virgil 's eclogue and 'till even then say one of he biographer he scorn any thing that look like a ballad though write by elderton

commemorate the most part of the writer who be educate there in 1588 it appear from he poem entitle mose he birth and miracle that he be a spectator at dover of the spanish invasion which be

nine or ten year before the death of queen elizabeth but at what time he begin to publish can not be ascertain in the year 1593 when he be but 30 year of age he publish a collection of he pastoral

only by the poet and florid writer of those day but also by divine historian and other scholar of the most serious turn and extensive learning in he younger year he be much beloved and patronize by sir walter aston of tixhall in staffordshire to whom for he kind protection he gratefully dedicate many of he poem whereof he baron war be the first in the spring of he acquaintance as drayton himself express it but however it may be gather from he work that he most early dependance be upon another patron namely sir henry goodere of polesworth in he own county to whom he have be grateful for a great part of he education and by whom he be recommend to the patronage of the countess of bedford : it be no less plain from many of he dedication to sir walter ashton that he be for many year support by he and accommodate with such supplies as afford he leisure to finish some of he most elaborate composition and the author of the biographium britannica have tell we ` that it have be alledge that he be by the interest of the same gentleman with sir roger ashton one of the bedchamber to king jame in he minority make in some measure ministerial to a intercourse of correspondence between the young king of of scot and queen elizabeth : ' but as no authority be produce to prove this it be probably without foundation as poet have seldom inclination activity or steadiness to manage any state affair particularly a point of so delicate a nature we author certainly have fair prospects from he service or other testimony of early attachment to the king 's interest of some preferment besides he have write sonnet in praise of the king as a poet thus we see drayton descend to servile flattery to promote he interest and praise a man as a poet contrary to he own judgment because he be a king who be as devoid of poetry as courage he welcome he majesty to he british dominion with a congratulatory poem print in 4to 1603 the same year he be choose by sir walter aston one of the esquire who attend he when he be with other create knight of the bath at the coronation of he majesty it no where appear that ever we author print those poem in praise of he majesty and the ungrateful reception they meet as well as the disagreeable experience of the universal degeneracy at court so different from that of the maiden reign might extinguish all hope of raise himself there

chief province ben have certainly no great talent for versification nor do he seem to have have a extraordinary ear he verse be often want in syllable and sometimes have too many i shall quote some line of he poem to the memory of shakespear before i give a detail of he piece to the memory of my beloved the author mr william shakespear and what he have leave we to draw no envy -lrb- shakespear -rrb- on thy name be i thus ample to thy book and fame : while i confess thy writings to be such as neither man nor muse can praise too much ` tis true and all man 's suffrage but these way be not the path i mean unto thy praise : for silliest ignorance on these may light which when it sound at best but eccho right as blind affection which doth ne'er advance the truth but grope and urgeth all by chance a crafty malice might pretend he praise and think to ruin where it seem would to raise these be as some infamous baud or whore should praise a matron : what could hurt she more but thou art proof against they and indeed above th ' ill fortune of they or the need i therefore will begin soul of the age th ' applause delight the wonder of the stage my shakespear rise i will not lodge thee by chaucer or spenser or bid beaumont lye a little further to make thee a room : thou art a monument without a tomb and art alive still while the book doth live and we have wit to read and praise to give that i not mix thee so my brain excuse i mean with great but disproportion would muse : for if i think my judgment be of year i should commit thee surely with thy peer and tell how far thou do `

king jame have resolve accord to he motto of beatus pacificus to have a friendship with he neighbouring kingdom of france and spain and also to enter into a alliance with the state of venice and for that purpose to send ambassador to those several state offer to sir henry he choice of which ever of these employment best suit he inclination who from the consideration of he own personal estate be small and the court of france and spain extreamly sumptuous so as to expose he to expence above he fortune make choice of venice a place of more retirement and where he could execute he embassy and at the same time indulge himself in the study of natural philosophy in that seat of the science where he be sure to meet with man accomplish in all the polite improvement as well as the more solid attainment of philosophy have inform the king that he choose to be send to venice he majesty settle a very considerable allowance upon he during he stay there he then take he leave and be accompany through france to venice say walton by gentleman of the best family and breed that this nation afford when sir henry wotton arrive at venice there subsist between the venetian and the pope a very warm contention which be prosecute by both party with equal fury the laity make many complaint against the two frequent practice of land be leave to the church without a licence from the state which increase the power of the clergy already too great and render they insolence insupportable in consequence of this the state make several injunction against lay-person dispose they land in that manner another cause of they quarrel be that the venetian have send to rome several article of complaint against two priest the abbot of nervesa and a canon of vicenza for commit such abominable crime as mr walton say it would be a shame to mention : they complaint meet with no redress and the detestable practice of these monster in holy order still continue they seize they person and commit they to prison the justice or injustice of such power exercise by the venetian produce debate between the republic and pope clement viii clement soon die pope paul the first a man of unbounded insolence and elate with he spiritual superiority let loose all he rage against the state he judge all resistance to be a diminution of he power and threaten excommunication to the whole state if a revocation be not instantly make which the venetian reject he proceed in menace and at last do excommunicate the duke the whole senate and all they dominion then he shut up the church charge the clergy to forbear sacred office to any of the venetian till they obedience should make they capable of absolution the contention be thus fomented till a report prevail that the venetian be turn protestant which be believe by many as the english embassador be so often in conference with the senate and that they have make all they proceedings know to the king of england who would support they should the pope presume to exercise any more oppression this circumstance make it appear plain enough to he holiness that he weaken he power by exceed it and be alarm lest a revolution should happen offer the venetian absolution upon very easy term which the republic still slight do at last obtain it by that which be scarce so much as a shew of desire it for eight year after sir henry wotton 's go into italy he stand very high in the king 's esteem but at last lose he favor for some time by a accident too singular to be here omit when he first go embassador to italy as he pass through germany he staid some day at augsburgh where have be in he former travels well know by many of the first reputation in learning and pass a evening in merriment he be desire by christopher hecamore to write a sentence in he album and consent to it take occasion from some accidental conversation which happen in the company to write a pleasant definition of a embassador in these word legatus est vir bonus peregre-missus ad mentiendum republicæ causa which he choose should have be thus render into english : a ambassador be a honest man send to lie abroad for the good of he country but the word lie upon which the conceit turn be not so express in latin as to admit a double meaning or so fair a construction as sir henry think in english about eight year after this album fall into the hand of gaspar scioppius a restless zealot who publish book against king jame and upbraid he for entertain such scandalous principle as he embassador have express by that sentence : this aspersion gain ground and it become fashionable in venice to write this definition in several glass window these incident reach the ear of king jame he be much displeased with the behavior of he embassador on that occasion and from a innocent piece of witticism sir henry be like to pay very dear by lose he master 's favor upon this we author write two apology one to velserus which be disperse in germany and italy and another to the king both which be so well write that he majesty upon read they declare that sir henry wotton have sufficiently commutt for a greater offence upon this reconciliation sir henry become more in favor with he majesty than ever like friend who have be for some time separated they meet again with double fervor and they friendship increase to a greater warmth during the twenty year which sir henry be ambassador at venice he have the good fortune to be so well respect by all the duke and the lead man of the republic that he interest every year increase and they seldom deny he any favor he ask for he countryman who come to venice which be as walton express it a city of refuge for all englishman who be any way distressed in that republic walton proceed to relate two particular instance of the generosity and tenderness of he disposition and the nobleness of he mind which as they serve to illustrate he character deserve a place here there have be many englishman bring by commander of they own country to serve the venetian for pay against the turk and those english by irregularity and imprudence commit such offence as bring they into prison and expose they to work in gally wotton could not be a unconcerned spectator of the misery of he countryman : they offence he know proceed rather from wantonness and intemperance than any real principle of dishonor and therefore he think it not beneath he to become a petitioner for they releasement he be happy in a successful representation of they calamity they be set at liberty and have a opportunity of return to they own country in comfort in place of languish in jail and be slave at the gally and by this compassionate interposition with the republick he have the blessing of many miserable wretch : the highest pleasure which any human being can enjoy on this side immortality of the generosity and nobleness of he mind walton give this instance upon sir henry wotton 's come a second time to venice he be employ as embassador to several of the german prince and to the emperor ferdinando ii and this embassy to these prince be to incline they to equitable measure for the restoration of the queen of bohemia and she descendant to they patrimonial inheritance of the palatinate this be by eight month constant endeavor and attendance upon the emperor and he court bring to a probability of a successful conclusion by a treaty but about that time the emperor 's army fight a battle so fortunately as put a end to the expect treaty and sir henry wotton 's hope who when he quit the emperor 's court humbly advise he to use he victory with moderation which advice the emperor be please to hear graciously be well satisfy with wotton 's behavior during he residence at he court he then tell he that tho ' the king he master be look upon as a abetter of he enemy yet he could not help demonstrate he regard to he by make he a present of a rich jewel of diamond worth more than ten thousand pound this be receive with all possible respect by sir henry but the next morning upon he depart from vienna at he take leave of the countess of sabrina a italian lady in whose house he reside he express he gratitude for she civility by present she with the jewel give he by the emperor which be afterwards discover be by the emperor take as a affront but sir henry acknowledge he gratitude for the mark of distinction shewn to he at the same time declare he do not chuse to receive profit from any present give he by a enemy of he royal mistress for so the queen of bohemia the eldest daughter of the king of england permit he to call she upon sir henry wotton 's return from he embassy he signify a inclinacion to the king to be excuse from any further employment in foreign affair to retire from the bustle of life and spend the evening of he day in studious ease and tranquility he majesty in consequence of this request promise he the reversion of a office which be the place of master of the rolle if he out-live sir julius cæsar who then possess it and be grow so old that he be say to be keep alive beyond nature 's course by the prayer of the many people who daily live upon he bounty here it will not be improper to observe that sir henry wotton have thro ' a generosity of temper reduce he affair to such a state that he could not live without some profitable employment as he be indebted to many person for money he borrow to support he dignity in he embassy the king 's appointment for that purpose be either not regularly pay or too inconsiderable for the expence this render it impossible for he to wait the death of sir julius cæsar besides that place have be long sollicit by that worthy gentleman for he son and it would have be think a ill-natured office to have by any means prevent it it luckily happen at this time that the provostship of he majesty 's college at eaton become vacant by the death of mr murray for which there be many earnest and powerful sollicitation this place be admirably suit to the course of life wotton resolve to pursue for the remain part of he day he have see enough of the world to be sick of it and be now three-score year of age he think a college be the fittest place to indulge contemplation and to rest he body and mind after a long struggle on the theater of life in he suit for this place he be happily successful and immediately enter into holy order which be necessary before he could take possession of he new office walton have relate the particular manner of he spend he time which be divide between attendance upon public devotion the more

he observe that this tragi-comedy be one preserved amongst two hundred and twenty in which i have have either a entire hand or at least a main finger of this prodigious number winstanley langbaine and

with he which naturalist look upon as portend a hardy and vigorous constitution a strange circumstance be related of he in he early year in a life prefix to he work he speak latin say the author at five year old and write it at nine if either of these circumstance be true it would seem as if he have learn latin from he nurse nor ever hear any other language so that it be native to he but to speak latin at five in consequence of study be almost impossible the polite art which we author chiefly admire be music and poetry how far he excel in the former can not be know nor can we agree with he life-writer already mention that he excel in both sir john suckling seem to have be no poet nor to have have even the most distant appearance of it he line be generally so unmusical that none can read they without grate they ear be author of several play he may indeed be call a dramatist and consequently come within we design but as he be destitute of poetical conception as well as the power of number he have no pretension to rank among the good poet dryden somewhere call he a sprightly wit a courtly writer in this sense he be what mr dryden stile he but then he be no poet notwithstanding he letter which be publish along with he play be exceed courtly he stile easy and genteel and he thought natural and in read he letter one would wonder that the same man who could write so elegantly in prose should not better succeed in verse after suckle have make himself acquaint with the constitution of he own country and take a survey of the most remarkable thing at home he travel to digest and enlarge he notion from a view of other country where say the above-mentioned author he make a collection of they virtue without any tincture of they vice and folly only that some be of opinion he copy the french air too much which be disagreeable to he father who be remarkable for he gravity and indeed inconsistent with the gloominess of the time he be reproach for it and it be imputed to he as the effect of he travels but some be of opinion that it be more natural than acquire the easiness of he manner and address be suitable to the openness of he heart the gaiety wit and gallantry which be so conspicuous in he and he seem to have value himself upon nothing more than the character of the courtier and the fine gentleman which he so far attain that he be allow to have have the peculiar happiness of make every thing he do become he while suckle be thus assiduous about acquire the reputation of a finish courtier and a man of fashion it be no wonder that he neglect the higher excellency of genius for a poet and a beau never yet be unite in one person sir john be not however so much devoted to the luxury of the court as to be wholly a stranger to the field in he travels he make a campaign under the great gustavus adolphus where he be present at three battle and five siege besides other skirmish between party and from such a considerable scene of action gain as much experience in six month as otherwise he would have do in as many year after he return to england the civil war be then rage he raise a troop of horse for the king 's service entirely at he own charge so richly and compleatly mount that it stand he in 1200 l but he zeal for he majesty do not meet with the success it deserve which very much affect he and soon after this he be seize with a fever and

birth person education and fortune people expectation of he be raise to too great a heighth which seldom fail to issue in a disappointment he make no figure in the history of these time perhaps from the immaturity of he death which prevent he from action this might be one reason for he be neglect in the annals of the civil war : another might be he unnecessary or rather ridiculous shew of finery which he affect in decorate he troop of horse this could not fail to draw down contempt upon he for in time of public distress nothing can be more foolish than to wear the livery of prosperity and surely a army would have no great reason to put much confidence in the conduct or courage of that general who in the morning of a battle should be find in he tent perfume he hair or array himself in embroidery mr lloyd in he memoirs of we author observe that he thought be not so loose as he expression nor he life so vain as he thought and at the same time make a allowance for he youth and sanguine complexion which say he a little more time and experience would have correct of this we have instance in he occasional discourse about religion to my lord dorset to whom he be related and in he thought of the posture of affair in both which he have discover that he could think as coolly and reason as justly as man of more year and less fire to a lady that forbid to love before company

native of scotland and a poet of no inconsiderable rank we have at first some doubt whether he fall within we design as be no englishman but upon observe that mr langbaine have give a place to the earl of stirl a man of much inferior note and that we author though a scotchman write extremely pure and elegant english and he life that be fruitful of a great many incident without further apology it be here present to the reader he be bear the 13th of November 1585 he father be sir john drummond of hawthornden who be gentleman usher to king jame vi but do not enjoy that place long be in three month after he be raise to he new dignity take away by death -lrb- 1 -rrb- the family of drummond in the article of antiquity be inferior to none in scotland where that kind of distinction be very much regard the first year of we author 's youth be spend at the high school at edinburgh where the early promise of that extraordinary genius which afterwards appear in he become very conspicuous he be in due time send to the university of edinburgh where after the ordinary stay he be make master of art when he course at the university be finish he do not like the greatest part of giddy student give over reading and vainly imagine they have a sufficient stock of learning : he have too much sense thus to deceive himself he know that a education at the university be but the ground-work of knowledge and that unless a man digest what he have there learn and endeavor to produce it into life with advantage so many year attendance be but entirely throw away be convince of this truth he continue to read the best author of antiquity whom he not only retain in he memory but so digest that he become quite master of they and able to make such observation on they genius and writings as fully shew that he judgment have be sufficiently exercise in read they in the year 1606 he father send he into france he be then only twenty-one year old he study at bourge the civil law with great diligence and applause and be master not only of the dictate of the professor but make also he own observation on they which occasion the learn president lockhart to observe that if mr drummond have follow the practice he might have make the best figure of any lawyer in he time but like all other man of wit he see more charm in euripide sophocle seneca and other the illustrious ancient than in the dry wrangling of the law as there have be often instance of poet and man of genius be educate to the law so here it may not be amiss to observe that we remember not to have meet with one amongst they who continue in that profession a circumstance not much in its favor and be a kind of proof that the professor of it be generally compose of man who be capable of application but without genius mr drummond have as we have already observe a sovereign contempt for the law apply himself to the sublimer study of poetry and history in both which he become very eminent have relinquish all thought of the bar or appear in public he retire to he pleasant seat at hawthornden and there by read the greek and latin author enrich the world with the product of he solitary hour after he have recover a very dangerous fit of sickness he write he cypress grove a piece of excellent prose both for the fineness of the stile and the sublimity and piety of the sentiment : in which he represent the vanity and instability of human affair teach a due contempt of the world propose consolation against the fear of death and give we a view of eternal happiness much about this time he write the flower of sion in verse though the number in which these poem be write be not now very fashionable yet the harmony be excellent and during the reign of king jame and charle i we have meet with no poet who seem to have have a better ear or feel more intimately the passion he describe the writer of he life already mention observe that notwithstanding he close retirement love steal upon he and entirely subdue he heart he need not to have assign retirement as a reason why it should seem strange that love grow upon he for retirement in its own nature be the very parent of love when a man converse with but few lady he be apt to fall in love with she who charm he most whereas be he attention dissipate and he affection bewilder by variety he would be preserve from love by not be able to fix they which be one reason why we always find people in the country have more enthusiastic notion of love than those who move in the hurry of life this beautiful young lady with whom mr drummond be enamoured be daughter of mr cunningham of barne of a ancient and honorable family he make he address to she in the true spirit of gallantry and as he be a gentleman who have see the world and consequently be accomplish in the elegancy of life he be not long in exciting proper return of passion he gain she affection and when the day of the marriage be appoint and all thing ready for its solemnization she be seize with a fever and snatch from he when he imagination have figure those scene of rapture which naturally fill the mind of a bridegroom as we author be a poet he no doubt be capable of form still a greater ideal fealt than a man of ordinary genius and as he mistress be as rowe express it ` more than painting can express ' or ` youthful poet fancy when they love ' those who have feel that delicate passion may be able in some measure to judge of the severity of distress into which we poetical bridegroom be now plunge : after the fervor of sorrow have in some measure subside he express he grief for she in several letter and poem and with more passion and sincerity celebrate he dead mistress than other praise they living one this extraordinary shock occasion by the young lady 's death on whom he doat with such excessive fondness so affect he spirit that in order as much as possible to endeavor to forget she he quit he retirement and reside eight year at pari and rome he travel through germany france and italy where he visit all the famous university converse with the learn man and make a excellent collection of the best ancient greek and of the modern spanish french and italian book mr drummond though a scholar and a man of genius do not think it beneath he to improve himself in those gay accomplishment which be so peculiar to the french and which never fail to set off wit and part to the best advantage he study music and be report to have possess the genteel accomplishment of dance to no inconsiderable degree after a long stay of eight year abroad he return again to he native country where a civil war be ready to break out he then find that as he could be of no service by he action he might at least by he retirement and during the confusion he go to the feat of he brother-in-law sir john scott of scott tarvat a man of learning and good sense in this interval it be suppose he write he history of the five jame 's successively king of scotland which be so excellent a work whether we consider the exact conduct of the story the judicious reflection and the fine language that no historian either of the english or scotch nation -lrb- the lord clarendon except -rrb- have shew a happier talent for that species of write which tho ' it do not demand the highest genius yet be as difficult to attain as any other kind of literary excellence this work be receive in england with as much applause as if it have be write by a countryman of they own and about english affair it be first publish six or seven year after the author 's death with a preface or introduction by mr hall of grays-inn who tho ' not much disposed to think favourably of the scotch nation have yet thus do justice to mr drummond for he manner of write say he though he treat of thing that be rather many than great and rather troublesome than glorious yet he have bring so much of the main together as it may be modestly say none of that nation have do before he and for he way of handle it he have sufficiently make it appear how conversant he be with the writings of venerable antiquity and how generously he have emulate they by a happy imitation for the purity of that language be much above the dialect he write in he description lively and full he narration clear and pertinent he oration eloquent and fit for the person who speak and he reflection solid and mature so that it can not be expect that these leaf can be turn over without as much pleasure as profit especially meet with so many glory and trophy of we ancestor in this history mr drummond have chiefly follow bishop elphiston and have give a different turn to thing from buchanan whom a party of the scotch accuse of be a pensioner of queen elizabeth 's and as he join interest with the earl of murray who want to disturb the reign of he much injured sister mary queen of scot he be strongly suspect of be a party writer and of have misrepresent the scotch transaction of old in order to serve some scheme of policy in the short note which mr drummond have leave behind he in he own life he say that he be the first in the island that ever celebrate a dead mistress he poem consist chiefly of love-verse madrigal epigram epitaph & c they be highly esteem by he contemporary both for the wit and learn that shone in they edward philip milton 's nephew write a preface to they and observe ` that he poem be the effect of genius the most polite and verdant that ever the scot nation produce and say that if he should affirm that neither tasso guarinus or any of the most neat and refined spirit of italy nor even the choicest of we english poet can challenge any advantage above he it could not be judge any attribute superior to what he deserve and for he history he say have there be nothing else extant of he writings consider but the language how florid and ornate it be consider the order and prudent conduct of the story and you will rank he in the number of the best writer and compare he even with thuanus himself : neither be he less happy in he verse than prose for here be all those grace meet together that conduce any thing towards the make up a compleat and perfect poet a decent and become majesty a brave and admirable heighth and a wit flow ' thus far the testimony of mr philip in order to divert himself and he friend he write a small poem which he call polemio-middinia ` tis a sort of macronic poetry in which the scot word be put in latin termination in queen anne 's time it be reprint at oxford with a preface concern macronic poetry it have be often reprint in scotland where it be think a very humorous performance we author who we have already see suffer so much by the immature fate of he first mistress think no more of love for many year after she decease but see by accident one elizabeth logan grandchild to sir robert logan who by the great resemblance she bear to he first favorite rekindle again the flame of love she be beautiful in he eye because she recall to he mind the dear image of she he mourn and by this lucky similarity she captivate he though he be near 45 year of age he marry this lady she bear to he several child william who be knight in charle ii 's time robert and elizabeth who be marry to one dr henderson a physician at edinburgh in the time of the public trouble mr drummond besides compose he history write several tract against the measure of the covenanter and those engage in the opposition of charle i in a piece of he call irene he harangue the king nobility gentry clergy and common about they mutual mistake jealousy and fear he lay before they the dismal consequence of a civil war from indisputable argument and the history of past time the great marquis of montrose writ a letter to he desire he to print this irene as the best means to quiet the mind of the distract people he likewise send he a protection date August 1645 immediately after the battle of kylsyth with another letter in which he highly commend mr drummond 's learning and loyalty besides this work of irene he write the load star and a address to the noblemen baron gentleman & c who league themselves for the defense of the liberty and religion of scotland the whole purport of which be to calm the disturbed mind of the populace to reason the better sort into loyalty and to check the grow evil which he see would be the consequence of they behavior those of he own countryman for whom he have the greatest esteem be sir william alexander afterwards earl of stirl sir robert carr afterwards earl of ancram from whom the present marquis of lothian be descend dr arthur johnston physician to king charle i and author of a latin paraphrase of the psalm and mr john adamson principal of the college of edinburgh he have great intimacy and correspondence with the two famous english poet michael drayton and ben johnson the latter of whom travel from london on foot to see he at he seat at hawthornden during the time ben remain with mr drummond they often hold conversation about poetry and poet and mr drummond have preserve the head of what pass between they and as part of it be very curious and serve to illustrate the character of johnson we have insert it in he life : though it perhaps be not altogether fair in mr drummond to commit to write thing that pass over a bottle and which perhaps be heedlesly advance it be certain some of the particulars which mr drummond have prefer be not much in ben 's favor and as few people be so wise as not to speak imprudently sometimes so it be not the part of a man who invite another to he table to expose-what may there drop inadvertently but as mr drummond have only make memorandum perhaps with no resolution to publish they he may stand acquit of part of this charge it be report of we author that he be very smart and witty in he repartee and have a most excellent talent at extempore versify above any poet of he time in the year 1645 when the plague be rage in scotland we author come accidentally to

reformer to send man to the army which fight against the king and he estate lie in three different county he have not occasion to send one entire man but half and quarter and such like fraction that be the money levy upon he as he share do not amount to the maintain one man but perhaps half as much and so on through the several county where he estate lay upon this he write the follow verse to the king of all these force rai would against the king ` tis my strange hap not one whole man to bring from diverse parish yet diverse man but all in half and quarter : great king then in half and quarter if they come ` gainst thee in half and quarter send they back to I be repute a malignant he be extremely harrass by the prevail party and for he verse and discourse frequently summon before they

he give early discovery of a rise genius and much improve the fine part he have from nature by a very polite and extensive education he first travel abroad as tutor to the earl of argyle and be a considerable time with that nobleman while they visit foreign country after he return be happy in so great a patron as the earl of argyle and finish in all the courtly accomplishment he be caress by person of the first fashion while he yet move in the sphere of a private gentleman mr alexander have a strong propensity to poetry he decline enter upon any public employment for some year and dedicate all he time to the reading of the ancient poet upon which he form he taste and whose various grace he seem to have understand king jame of scotland who with but few regal quality yet certainly have a propension to literature and be a encourager of learn man take mr alexander early into he favor he accept the poem we author present he with the most condescending mark of esteem and be so warm in he interest that in the year 1614 he create he a knight and by a kind of compulsion oblige he to accept the place of master of the request -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the king 's bounty do not stop here : we author have settle a colony in nova scotium in america at he own expence jame make he a grant of it by he royal deed on the 21st of September 1621 and intend to have erect the order of baronet for encouraging and advance so good a work but the three last year of that prince 's reign be render troublesome to he by reason of the jealousy and commotion which then subsist in england he think fit to suspend the further prosecution of that affair 'till a more favourable crisis which he live not to see as soon as king charle i ascend the throne who inherit from he father the warmest affection for he native country he endeavor to promote that design which be likely to produce so great a benefit to the nation and therefore create sir william alexander lord lieutenant of new scotland and institute the order of knight baronet for the encouraging and advance that colony and give he the power of coin small copper money a privilege which some discontented british subject complain of with great bitterness but he majesty who have the highest opinion of the integrity and ability of sir william do not on that account withdraw he favor from he but rather encrease it for in the year 1626 he make he secretary of state for scotch affair in place of the earl of haddington and a peer by the title of viscount stirling and soon after raise he to the dignity of a earl by letter patent date June 14 1633 upon the solemnity of he majesty 's coronation at the palace of holy-rood-house in edinburgh he lordship enjoy the place of secretary with the most unblemished reputation for the space of fifteen year even to he death which happen on the 12th of February 1640 we author marry the daughter of sir william erskine baronet cousin german to the earl of marr then regent of scotland by she he have one son who die he majesty 's resident in nova scotium in the life time of he father and leave behind he a son who succeed he grandfather in the title of earl of stirl he lordship be author of four play which he stile monarchic tragedy viz the alexandræan tragedy cræsus darius and julius cæsar all which in the opinion of the ingenious mr coxeter -lrb- whose indefatigable industry in collect material for this work which he live not to publish have furnish the present biographer with many circumstance they could not otherwise have know -rrb- be write in he lordship 's youth and before he undertake any state employment these play be write upon the model of the ancient as appear by he introduce the chorus between the act they be grave and sententious throughout like the tragedy of seneca and yet the softer and tender passion be sometimes very delicately touch the author have be very unhappy in the choice of he verse which be alternate like the quatrain of the french poet pibrach or sir william davenant 's heroic poem call gondibert which kind of verse be certainly unnatural for tragedy as it be so much remove from prose and can not have that beautiful simplicity that tender pathos which be indispensable to the language of tragedy mr rymer have criticise with great judgment on this error of we author and shewn the extreme absurdity of write play in rhime notwithstanding the great authority of dryden can be urge in its defense write play upon the model of the ancient by introduce chorus can be defend with as little force it be the nature of a tragedy to warm the heart rouze the passion and fire the imagination which can never be do while the story go languidly on the soul can not be agitate unless the business of the play rise gradually the scene be keep busy and leading character active : we can not better illustrate this observation than by a example one of the best poet of the present age the ingenious mr mason of cambridge have not long ago publish a tragedy upon the model of the ancient call elfrida the merit of this piece as a poem have be confess by the general reading it have obtain it be full of beauty the language be perfectly poetical the sentiment chaste and the moral excellent there be nothing in we tongue can much exceed it in the flowry enchantment of poetry or the delicate flow of number but while we admire the poet we pay no regard to the character no passion be excite the heart be never move nor be the reader 's curiosity ever raise to know the event want of passion and regard to character be the error of we present dramatic poet and it be a true observation make by a gentleman in a occasional prologue speaking of the wit from charle ii to we own time he say from bard to bard the frigid caution creep and declamation roar while passion sleep but to return to we author 's play the alexandræan tragedy be build upon the difference about the succession that rise between alexander 's captain after he decease he have borrow many thought and translate whole speech from seneca virgil & c in this play he lordship seem to mistake the very essence of the drama which consist in action for there be scarce one action perform in view of the audience but several person be introduce upon the stage who relate atchievement do by themselves and other : the two first act be entirely foreign to the business of the play upon the whole it must be allow that he lordship be a very good historian for the reader may learn from it a great deal of the affair of greece and rome for the plot see quintus curtius the thirteenth book of justin diodorus siculus jofephus raleigh 's history & c the scene be in babylon cræsus a tragedy the scene of this play be lay in sardi and be reckon the most moving of the four it be chiefly borrow from herodotus clio justin plutarch 's life of solon salian torniel in the fifth act there be a episode of abradate and panthæa which the author have take from xenophon 's cyropædeia or the life and education of cyrus lib vii the ingenious scudery have likewise build upon this foundation in he divert romance call the grand cyrus darius a tragedy this be he lordship 's first dramatic performance it be print at edinburgh in 4to in the year 1603 it be first compose of a mixture of english and scotch dialect and even then be commend by several copy of verse the scene of this play be lay in babylon the author afterwards not only polish he native language but alter the play itself as to the plot consult q curtius diodorus siculus justin plutarch 's life of alexander & c julius cæsar a tragedy in the fifth act of this play my lord bring brutus cassius cicero anthony & c together after the death of cæsar almost in the same circumstance shakespear have do in he play of this name but the difference between the anthony and brutus of shakespear and these character draw by the earl of stirling be as great as the genius of the former transcend the latter this be the most regular of he lordship 's play in the unity of action the story of this play be to be find in all the roman history write since the death of that emperor he lordship have acknowledge the stile of he dramatic work not to be pure for which in excuse he have plead he country the scotch dialect then be in a very imperfect state have mention the scotch dialect it will not be improper to observe that it be at this time much in the same degree of perfection that the english language be in the reign of henry viii and queen elizabeth there be idiom peculiar to the scotch which some of they best writer have not be able entirely to forget and unless they reside in england for some time they seldom overcome they and they language be greatly obscure by these means but the reputation which some scotch writer at present enjoy make it sufficiently clear that they be not much want in perspicuity or elegance of which mr hume the ingenious author of essay moral and political be a instance in the particular quality of fire which be indispensible in a good writer the scotch author have rather too much of it and be more apt to be extravagantly animated than correctly dull besides these play we author write several other poem of a different kind viz doomsday or the great day of the lord 's judgment first print 1614 and a poem divide into 12 book which the author call hour in this poem be the follow emphatic line when speaking of the divine vengeance fall upon the wicked he call it a weight of wrath more than ten world could bear a very ingenious gentleman of oxford in a conversation with the author of this life take occasion to mention the above line as the best he have ever read consist of monysyllable and be indeed one of the most affect line to be meet with in any poet this poem say mr coxeter ` in he m note be reprint in 1720 by a johnston who in he preface say that he have the honor of transmit the author 's work to the great mr addison for the perusal of they and he be please to signify he approbation in these candid term that he have read they with the greatest satisfaction and be please to give it as he judgment that the beauty of we ancient english poet be too slightly pass over by the modern writer who out of a peculiar singularity have rather take pain to find fault than endeavor to excel ' a parænæsis to prince henry who die before it be publish it be afterwards dedicate to king charle i -lrb- 3 -rrb- jonathan intend to be a heroic poem but the first book of it be only extant he

of huntingdon president of the north who from he infancy have devote he to the service of the church and he mother whom he have celebrate for she exemplary and distinguished piety be extremely sollicitous that she favorite son would be of a profession she herself hold so much in veneration we author who seem to have be very credulous in he disposition rather religious than wise or possess any attainment equal to the dignity to which he rise have preserve in he speciality some vision of he mother 's which he relate with a air of seriousness sufficient to evidence he own conviction of they reality but as they appear to have be the offspring of a disorder imagination they have no right to a place here in order to train he up to the ministry he father at first resolve to place he under the care of one mr pelset lately come from cambridge to be the public preacher at leicester who undertake to give he a education equally finish with that of the university and by these means save much expence to he father : this resolution however be not execute some other friend advise he father to send he to cambridge and persuade he that no private tuition could possibly be equal to that of the academical when we author have remain six year at cambridge he have a right to preferment and to stand for a fellowship have not he tutor mr gilby be bear in the same county with he and the statute not permit two of the same shire to enjoy fellowship and as mr gilby be senior to we author and already in possession mr hall could not be promote in consequence of this he propose to remove when the earl of huntingdon be make acquaint with this circumstance and hearing very favourable account of we author interested himself to prevent he removal he make application to mr gilby promise to make he he chaplain and promote he in the church provide he would relinquish he place in the college in favor of mr hall these promise be make with seeming sincerity and as the earl of huntingdon be a man of reputation for probity he comply with he lordship 's request and relinquish he place in the college when he be about to enter upon he office of chaplain to he great mortification the nobleman on whose promise he confide and on whom he immediately depend suddenly die by which accident he be throw unprovided upon the world this not a little affected mr hall who be shock to think that mr gilby should be thus distressed by the generosity of he temper which excite he to quit a certainty in order to make way for he promotion he address dr chadderton then the master of the college that the succeed election might be stop and that mr gilby should again possess he place but in this request he be unsuccessful : for the doctor tell he that mr gilby be divest of all possibilty of remedy and that they must proceed in the election the day follow when mr hall be unanimously choose into that society two year after this he be choose rhetorician to the public school where as he himself express it he be encourage with a sufficient frequence of auditor but this place he soon resign to dr dod and enter upon study necessary to qualify he for take order some time after this the mastership of a famous school erect at tiverton in devon become vacant this school be endow by the founder mr blundel with a very large pension and the care of it be principally cast upon the then lord chief justice popham he lordship be intimately acquaint with dr chadderton request he to recommend some learn and prudent man for the government of that school the dr recommend mr hall assure he that great advantage would arise from it without much trouble to himself : we author think proper to accept this the doctor carry he to london and introduce he to lord chief justice popham who seem well pleased and thank dr chadderton for recommend a man so well qualify for the charge when dr chadderton and mr hall have take leave of he lordship and be return to they lodgings a messenger present a letter to mr hall from lady drury of suffolk earnestly request he to accept the rectory of halst a place in she gift this flow of good fortune not a little surprized he and as he be govern by the maxim of prudence he make no long hesitation in accept the latter which be both a better benefice and a higher preferment be settle at halst he find there a dangerous antagonist to he ministry whom he call in he speciality a witty and a bold atheist : this be one mr lilly who by reason of he travels -lrb- say he -rrb- and ability of discourse and behavior have so deeply insinuated himself into my patron that there be small hope for I to work any good upon that noble patron of mine who by the suggestion of this wicked detractor be set off from I before he know I hereupon i confess find the obduredness and hopeless condition of that man i bent my prayer against he beseech god daily that he would be please to remove by some means or other that apparent hindrance of my faithful labor who give I a answer accordingly for this malicious man go hastily up to london to exasperate my patron against I be then and there sweep away by the pestilence and never return to do any further mischief this account give by mr hall of he antagonist reflect no great honor upon himself : it be conceive in a spirit of bitterness and there be more of spite against lilly 's person in it than any tenderness or pity for he error he call he a witty atheist when in all probability what he term atheism be no more than a freedom of thinking and facetious conversation which to the pious churchman have the appearance of deny the existence of god besides have hall deal candidly he should have give he reader some more particulars of a man whom he be bold enough to denominate a atheist a character so very singular that it should never be imputed to any man without the strongest grounds hall in he usual spirit of enthusiasm in order to remove this antagonist of he have recourse to a miracle : he tell we he go up to london and die of the plague which he would have we to understand be by the immediate interpolition of god as if it be not ridiculous to suppose we author of so great importance as that the supreme be should work a miracle in he favor but as it be with natural so be it with spiritual pride those who be possess by either never fail to over-rate they own significance and justly expose themselves to the contempt of the sober part of mankind we author have also give we some account of he marriage with the daughter of mr george winniff of bretenham he say of she that much modesty piety and good disposition be lodge in she seemly presence she be recommend to he by the rev mr grandig he friend and he say he listen to the recommendation as from the lord whom he frequently consult by prayer before he enter into the matrimonial state she live with he 49 year not long after mr hall 's settlement at halst he be sollicit by sir edmund bacon to accompany he in a journey to the spa in ardenna at the time when the earl of hertford go ambassador to the archduke albert of brussels this request mr hall comply with as it furnish he with a opportunity of fee more of the world and gratify a desire he have of converse with the romish jesuit the particulars of he journey which he have preserve in he speciality be too trifling to be here insert : when he come to brussels he be introduce by a english gentleman who practice physic there to the acquaintance of father costrus who hold some conversation with he concern the miracle say to be lately do by one lipsieus apricolli a woman who live at zichem from particular miracle the father turn the discourse to the difference between divine and diabolical miracle and he tell mr hall that if he could ascertain that one miracle ever be work in the church of england he would embrace that persuasion : to which we author reply that he be fully convince that many devil have be eject out of person in that church by fasting and prayer they both believe the possibility and frequency of miracle they only differ as to the church in which miracle be perform hall have censure father costrus as a barren man and of superficial conversation and it be to be fear that whoever read hall 's religious work will conclude much in the same manner of he they depart from brussels soon after this interview between father costrus and we author and meet with nothing in they journey to and return from the spa worth relation only mr hall have by he zeal in defend he own church expose himself to the resentment of one signior ascanio negro who begin notwithstanding mr hall 's lay-habit to suspect he to be a clergyman and use some indecent freedom with he in consequence of this suspicion we author to avoid any impertinence which the captain be likely to be guilty of towards he tell he sir edmund bacon the person with whom he travel be the grandchild of the great lord verulam high chancelor of england whose fame be extend to every country where science and philosophy prevail and that they be protect by the earl of hertford the english embassador at brussels upon the italian 's be make acquaint with the quality of sir edmund and the high connection of the two traveller he think proper to desist from any act of impertinence to which bigotry and ignorance would have excite he hall return to england after be absent eighteen month and be receive but coldly by sir robert drury he patron there have never be much friendship between they in consequence of this mr hall come to london in search of a more comfortable provision he be soon recommend by one mr gurrey tutor to the earl of essex to preach before prince henry at richmond before this accident mr hall have be author of some meditation whom mr gurrey tell he have be well receive at henry 's court and much read by that promising young prince he preach with success for the prince desire to hear he a second time and be so well pleased with he that he signify a inclination of have he attend about he court mr hall 's reputation grow he be take notice of by person of fashion and soon obtain the living of waltham present he by the earl of norwich while he exercise he function at waltham the archdeacon of norwich engage he to interest himself in favor of the church of wolverhampton from which a patrimony be detain by a sacrilegious conveyance in the course of this prosecution we author observe that a marvellous light open itself unexpectedly by reveal a counterfeit seal in the manifestation of razure and interpolation and misdate of unjustifiable evidence that after many year suit lord chancellor ellesmere upon a full hearing give a decree in favor of the church during mr hall 's residence at waltham he be thrice employ by he majesty in public service he first public employment be to attend the earl of carlisle who go on a embassy to france and during he absence he majesty confer upon he the deanery of worcester upon he return he attend the king in a journey to scotland where he exert himself in support of episcopacy in opposition to the established ministry there who be presbyterian have acquire some name in polemical divinity and be long accustomed to disputation the king make choice of he to go to the netherland and assist at the synod of dort in settle the controvert point of faith for which that reverend body be there convene hall have be very lavish in he own praise while he act at the synod of dort he have give many hint of the supernatural assistance he be bless with : he have inform we that he be then in a languish state of health that he rest be break and he night sleepless but on the night precede the occasion of he preach a latin sermon to the synod he be favor with refreshing sleep which he ascribe to the immediate care of providence the state of holland he say send daniel heinsius the poet to visit he and be so much delighted with he comportment that they present he with a rich medal of gold as a monument of they respect for he poor endeavor upon we author 's return home he find the church tear to piece by the fierce contention which then subsist concern the doctrine of arminius : he see this with concern and be sensible true religion piety and virtue could never be promote by such altercation and therefore with the little power of which he be master he endeavor to effect a reconciliation between the contend party : he write what he call a project of pacification which be present to he majesty and would have have a very happy influence have not the enemy of mr hall misrepresent the book and so far influence the king that a royal edict for a general inhibition bury it in silence hall after this contend with the roman catholic who upon the prospect of the spanish match on the success of which they build they hope begin to betray a great degree of insolence and proudly boast the pedigree of they church from the apostle themselves they insist that as they church be the first so it be the best and that no ordination be valid which be not derive from it hall in answer to they assertion make a concession which some of he protestant brethren think he have no right to do he acknowledge the priority of the roman church but deny its infallibility and consequently that it be possible another church might be more pure and approach more to the apostolic practice than the romish this controversy he manage so successfully that he be promote to the see of exeter and as king jame i seldom know any bound to he generosity when he happen to take a person into he favor he soon after that remove he from exeter and give he the higher bishoprick of norwich which he enjoy not without some allay to he happiness for the civil war soon break out he undergo the same severity which be exercise against other prelate of which he have give a account in a piece prefix to he work call hall 's hard measure and from this we shall extract the most material circumstance the insolence of some churchman and the superiority they assume in the civil government during the distraction of charle i provoke the house of common to take some measure to prevent they grow power which that pious monarch be too much disposed to favor in consequence of this the lead member of the opposition petition the king to remove the bishop from they seat in parliament and degrade they to the station at common which be warmly oppose by the high church lord and the bishop themselves who protest against whatever step be take during they restraint from parliament as illegal upon this principle that as they be part of the legislature no law could pass during they absence at least if that absence be produce by violence which clarendon have fully represent the prejudice against the episcopal government gain ground petition to remove the bishop be pour in from all part of the kingdom and as the earl of strafford be then so obnoxious to the popular resentment he cause and that of the bishop be reckon by the vulgar synonimous and both feel the resentment of a enraged populace to such a fury be the common people work up that they come in body to the two house of parliament to crave justice both against the earl of strafford and the archbishop of canterbury and in short the whole bench of spiritual peer the mob besiege the two house and threaten vengeance upon the bishop whenever they come out this fury excite some motion to be make in the house of peer to prevent such tumult for the future which be send down to the house of common the bishop for they safety be oblige to continue in the parliament house the greatest part of the night and at last make they escape by bye-way and stratagem they be then convince that it be no longer safe for they to attend the parliament 'till some measure be take to repress the insolence of the mob and in consequence of this they meet at the house of the archbishop of york and draw up a protest against whatever step should be take during they absence occasion by violence this protest the bishop intend should first be give to the secretary of state and by he to the king and that he majesty should cause it to be read in the house of peer but in place of this the bishop be accuse of high treason bring before the bar of the house of peer and send to the tower during they confinement they enemy in the house of common take occasion to bring in a bill for take away the vote of bishop in the house of peer : in this bill lord falkland concur and it be support by mr hambden and mr pym the oracle of the house of common but meet with great opposition from edward hyde afterwards earl of clarendon who be a friend to the church and could not bear to see they liberty infringe the bishop petition to have council assign they in which they be indulge in order to answer to the charge of high treason a day be appoint the bishop be bring to the bar but nothing be effect the house of common at last finding that there could be no proof of high treason dropt that charge and be content to libel they for a misdemeanor in which they likewise but ill succeed for the bishop be admit to bail and no prosecution be carry on against they even for a misdemeanor be now at liberty the greatest part of they retire to they diocese 'till the storm which have threaten they should subside bishop hall repair to norwich where he meet from the disaffected party a very cold reception he continue preach however in he cathedral at norwich 'till the order of sequestration come down when he be desire to remove from he palace while the sequestrator seize upon all he estate both real and personal and appraize all the goods which be in the palace the bishop relate the follow instance of oppression which be inflict on he ` one morning -lrb- say he lordship -rrb- before my servant be up there come to my gate one wright a london trooper attend with other require entrance threaten if they be not admit to break open the gate whom i find at first sight struggle with one of my servant for a pistol which he have in he hand i demand he business at that unseasonable time he tell I he come to search for arm and ammunition of which i must be disarm i tell he i have only two musket in the house and no other military provision he not rest upon my word search round about the house look into the chest and trunk examine the vessel in the cellar finding no other warlike furniture he ask I what horse i have for he commission be to take they also i tell he how poorly i be store and that my age would not allow I to travel on foot in conclusion he take one horse away ' the committee of sequestration soon after proceed to strip he of all the revenue belong to he see and as he refuse to take the covenant the magistrate of the city of norwich who be no friend to episcopal jurisdiction cite he before they for give ordination unwarrantably as they term it : to this extraordinary summons the bishop answer that he would not betray the dignity of he station by he personal appearance to answer any complaint before the lord mayor for as he be a peer of the realm no magistrate whatever have a right to take cognizance of he conduct and that he be only accountable to the house of lord of which he be one the bishop proceed to enumerate the various insult he receive from the enraged populace sometimes they search he house for malignant at other time they threaten violence to he person nor do they resentment terminate here they exercise they fury in the cathedral tear down the altar break the organ in piece and commit a kind of sacrilegious devastation in the church they burn the service book in the market-place fill the cathedral with musketeer who behave in it with as much indecency as if it have be a alehouse they force the bishop out of he palace and employ that in the same manner these be the most material hardship which accord to the bishop 's own account happen to he which he seem to have bear with patience and fortitude and may serve to shew the violence of party rage and that religion be often make a pretence for commit the most outrageous insolence and horrid cruelty it have be already observe that hall seem to have be of a enthusiastic turn of mind which seldom consist with any brilliance of genius and in this case it hold true for in he sermon extant there be a imbecility which can flow from no other cause than want of part in poetry however he seem to have greater power which will appear when we consider he in that light it can not positively be determine on what year bishop hall die he publish that work of he call hard measure in the year 1647 at which time he be seventy-three year of age and in all probability do not long survive it he ecclesiastical work be a sermon preach before king jame at hampton-court 1624 christian liberty set forth in a sermon at whitehall 1628 divine light and reflection in a sermon at

print in three vol folio besides these work bishop hall be author of satire in six book lately reprint under the title of virgidemiarum of which we can not give a better account than in the word of the ingenious author of the monthly review by which bishop hall 's genius for that kind of poetical writing will fully appear he publish these satire in the twenty third year of he age and be as he himself assert in the prologue the first satirist in the english language i first adventure follow I who list and be the second english satyrist and if we consider the difficulty of introduce so nice a poem as satire into a nation we must allow it require the assistance of no common and ordinary genius the italian have they ariosto and the french they regnier who might have serve he as model for imitation but he copy after the ancient and chiefly juvenal and persius though he want not many stroke of elegance and delicacy which shew he perfectly acquaint with the manner of horace among the several discouragement which attend he attempt in that kind he mention one peculiar to the language and nature of the english versification which would appear in the translation of one of persius 's satire : the difficulty and dissonance whereof say he shall make good my assertion besides the plain experience thereof in the satire of ariosto save which and one base french satire i could never attain the view of any for my direction yet we may pay he almost the same compliment which be give of old to homer and archilochus : for the improvement which have be make by succeed poet bear no manner of proportion to the distance of time between he and they the verse of bishop hall be in general extremely musical and flowing and be greatly preferable to dr donne 's as be of a much smoother cadence neither shall we find he deficient if compare with he successor in point of thought and wit but he exceed he with respect to he character which be more numerous and work up with greater art and strength of color many of he line would do honor to the most ingenious of we modern poet and some of they have think it worth they labor to imitate he especially mr oldham bishop hall be not only we first satyrist but be the first who bring epistolary write to the view of the public which be common in that age to other part of europe but not practice in england till he publish he own epistle it may be proper to take notice that the virgidemiarum be not print with he other writings and that a account of they be omit by he through he extreme modesty in the speciality of he life prefix to the third volume of he work in folio the author 's postscript to he satire be prefix by the editor in the room of a preface and without any apparent impropriety it be not without some signature of the bishop 's good sense and taste and make a just allowance for the use of a few obsolete term and the puerile custom of that age in make affected repetition and reiteration of the same word within the compass of a period it would read like no bad prose at present he have undoubtedly a excellent ear and we must conclude he must have succeed considerably in erotic or pastoral poetry from the follow stanza 's in he defiance to envy which may be consider as a exordium to he poetical writings witnesse ye muse how i wilful sing these heady rhime withouten second care and wish have they worse my guilty thought among the ruder satire should go ragg would and bare and shew he rougher and he hairy hide tho ' mine be smooth and deck would in carelesse pride would we but breathe within a wax-bound

term by the author toothless satire and the three last bite satire he have a animated idea of good poetry and a just contempt of poetaster in the different species of it he say of himself in the first satire nor can i crouch and writhe my fawn tayle to some great patron for my best avayle such hunger-starven trencher-poetrie or let it never live or timely die he frequently avow he admiration of spenser whose cotemporary he be he first book consist of nine satire appear in a manner entirely level at low and abject poetaster several satire of the second book reprehend the contempt of the rich for man of science and genius we shall transcribe the sixth be short and void of all obscurity a gentle squire would gladly entertaine into he house some trencher-chaplaine some willing man that might instruct he son and that would stand to good condition first that he lie upon the truckle-bed while he young maister lieth o'er he head second that he do on no default ever presume to sit above the salt third that he never change he trencher twise fourth that he use all common courtesy sit bare at meale and one halfe raise and wait last that he never he young maister beat but he must ask he mother to define how manie jerke she would he breech should line all these observe he could contented bee to give five marke and winter liverie the seventh and last of this book be a very just and humorous satire against judicial astrology which be probably in as high credit then as witchcraft be in the succeed reign the first satire of the third book be a strong contrast of the temperance and simplicity of former age with the luxury and effeminacy of he own tine which a reflect reader would be apt to think no better than the present we find the good bishop suppose we ancestor as poorly feed as virgil 's and horace 's rustic he say with sufficient energy thy grandsire 's word favor would of thrifty leeke or manly garlicke but thy furnace reeke hot steam of wine and can a-loose descrie the drunken draught of sweet autumnitie the second be a short satire on erect stately monument to worthless man the following advice be nobly moral the subsequent sarcasm just and well express thy monument make thou thy live deed no other tomb than that true virtue need what have he nought whereby he might be knowne but costly pilement of some curious stone the matter nature 's and the workman 's frame he purse 's cost : where then be osmond 's name deserv ` dst thou ill well be thy name and thee wert thou inditch in great secrecie the third give a account of a citizen 's feast to which he be invite as he say with hollow word and -lrb- 2 -rrb- overly request and whom he disappoint by accept he invitation at once and not mayden it no insignificant term as he apply it : for as he say who look for double bidding to a feast may dine at home for a importune guest after a sumptuous bill of fare we author compare the great plenty of it to we present notion of a miser 's feast -- say come there no more for so mean all that cost never hence take I for thy second host the fourth be level at ostentation in devotion or in dress the fifth represent the sad plight of a courtier whose perewinke as he term it the wind have blow off by unbonnett in a salute and expose he waxen crown or scalp ` tis probable this might be about the time of they introduction into dress here the sixth which be a fragment contain a hyperbolical relation of a thirsty foul call gullion who drunk acheron dry in he passage over it and ground charon 's boat but float it again by as liberal a stream of urine it conclude with the follow sarcastical yet wholesome irony drinke on drie foule and pledge sir gullion : drinke to all health but drink not to thyne owne the seventh and last be a humorous description of a famished beau who have dine only with duke humfrey and who be strangely adorn with exotic dress to these three satire he add the follow conclusion thus have i writ in smoother cedar

much like the first satire of horace 's first book on the dissatisfaction and caprice of mankind -- quus fit mecænas and after a just and lively-description of we different pursuit in life he conclude with the follow preference of a college one which we find in the speciality of he life he be greatly devote to in he youth the line which be far from inelegant seem indeed to come from he heart and make he appear as a exception to that too general human discontent which be the subject of this satire ` mongst all these stir of discontented strife oh let I lead a academick life to know much and to

the great number of obsolete word retain would incline we to think the editor have not procure any very extraordinary alteration of the original edition which we have never see the present one be nearly print and if it should occasion another we can not think but a short glossary at the end of it or explanation at the bottom of the page where the most uncouth and antiquated term occur would justly increase the value of it by add considerably to the perspicuity of this writer who in other respects seem to have be a learn divine a conscientious christian a lover of peace and well endue
