17 1852 everybody have hear of quarantine but in we favored country there be many untravelled person who do not precisely know what it be and who no doubt wonder why it should be such a bugbear to traveller in the orient i confess i be still somewhat in the same predicament myself although i have already be twenty-four hour in quarantine but as a peculiarity of the place be that one can do nothing however good a will he have i propose to set down my experience each day hope that i and my reader may obtain some insight into the nature of quarantine before the term of my probation be over i leave alexandrium on the afternoon of the 14th inst in company with mr carter harrison a fellow-countryman who have join I in cairo for the tour through palestine we have a head wind and rough sea and i remain in a torpid state during most of the voyage there be rain the second night but when the cloud clear away yesterday morning we be gladden by the sight of lebanon whose summit glitter with streak of snow the lower slope of the mountain be green with field and forest and beyrout when we run up to it seem bury almost out of sight in the foliage of its mulberry grove the town be build along the northern side of a peninsula which project about two mile from the main line of the coast form a road for vessel in half a hour after we arrival several large boat come alongside and we be tell to get we baggage in order and embark for quarantine the time necessary to purify a traveller arrive from egypt from suspicion of the plague be five day but the day of arrival and departure be count so that the durance amount to but three full day the captain of the osiri muster the passenger together and inform they that each one would be oblige to pay six piastre for the transportation of himself and he baggage two heavy lighter be now draw up to the foot of the gangway but as soon as the first box tumble into they the man tumble out they attach the craft by cable to two smaller boat in which they sit to tow the infected load we be all send down together jew turk and christian -- a confused pile of man woman child and goods a little boat from the city in which there be representative from the two hotel hover around we and card be throw to we the zealous agent wish to supply we immediately with table bed and all other household appliance but we decline they help until we arrive at the mysterious spot at last we float off -- two lighter full of infected though respectable material tow by oarsman of most scurvy appearance but free from every suspicion of taint the sea be still rough the sun be hot and a fat jewess become sea-sick a italian jew rail at the boatman ahead in the neapolitan patois for the distance be long the quarantine be on the land-side of beyrout we see the row of little yellow house on the cliff and with great apparent risk of be sweep upon the breaker be tug into a small cove where there be a landing-place nobody be there to receive we the boatman jump into the water and push the lighter against the stone stair while we unload we own baggage a tin cup fill with sea-water be place before we and we each drop six piastre into it -- for money strange as it may seem be infectious by this time the _ guardiano _ have have notice of we arrival and we go up with they to choose we habitation there be several row of one-story house overlook the sea each contain two empty room to be have for a hundred piastre but a square two-story dwelling stand apart from they and the whole of it may be have for thrice that sum there be seven frank prisoner and we take it for ourselves but the room be bare the kitchen empty and we learn the important fact that quarantine be durance vile without even the bread and water the guardiano say the agent of the hotel be at the gate and we can order from they whatever we want certainly but at they own price for we be wholly at they mercy however we go down stair and the chief officer who accompany we get into a corner as we pass and hold a stick before he to keep we off he be now clean but if he garment brush against ours he be lose the people we meet in the grounds step aside with great respect to let we pass but if we offer they we hand no one would dare to touch a finger 's tip here be the gate : a double screen of wire with a interval between so that contact be impossible there be a crowd of individual outside all anxious to execute commission among they be the agent of the hotel who propose to fill we bare room with furniture send we a servant and cook and charge we the same as if we lodge with he the bargain be close at once and he hurry off to make the arrangement it be now four o'clock and the brace air of the headland give a terrible appetite to those of we who like I have be sea-sick and fasting for forty-eight hour but there be no food within the quarantine except a patch of green wheat and a well in the limestone rock we two american join company with we room-mate a alexandrian of italian parentage who have come to beyrout to be marry and make the tour of we territory there be a path along the cliff overhang the sea with glorious view of lebanon up to he snowy top the pine-forest at he base and the long cape whereon the city lie at full length repose beside the wave the mahommedan and jew in company of ten -lrb- to save expense -rrb- be lodge in the smaller dwelling where they have already arouse million of flea from they state of torpid expectancy we return and take a survey of we companion in the pavilion : a french woman with two ugly and peevish child -lrb- one at the breast -rrb- in the next room and three french gentleman in the other -- a merchant a young man with hair of extraordinary length and a _ filateur _ or silk-manufacturer middle-aged and cynical the first be a gentleman in every sense of the word the latter endurable but the young absalom be my aversion i be subject to involuntary liking and disliking for which i can give no reason and though the man may be in every way amiable he presence be very distasteful to I we take a pipe of consolation but it only whet we appetite we give up we promenade for exercise be still worse and at last the sun go down and yet no sign of dinner we pavilion become a tower of famine and the italian recite dante finally a strange face appear at the door by apicius it be a servant from the hotel with iron bedstead camp-table and some large chest which breathe a odor of the commissary department we go stealthily down to the kitchen and watch the unpack we dinner be there sure enough but alas it be not yet cook patience be no more my companion manage to filch a raw onion and a crust of bread which we share and roll under we tongue as a sweet morsel and it give we strength for another hour the greek dragoman and cook who be send into quarantine for we sake take compassion on we the fire be kindle in the cold furnace savory steam creep up the stair the preparation increase and finally climax in the rapturous announcement : monsieur dinner be ready the soup be liquified bliss the _ cotelette d'agneau _ be _ cotelette de bonheur _ and as for that broad dish of syrian lark -- heaven forgive we the regret that more song have not be silence for we sake the meal be all nectar and ambrosia and now fill and contented we subside into sleep on comfortable couch so close the first day of we incarceration this morning dawn clear and beautiful lebanon except he snowy crest be wrap in the early shadow but the mediterranean gleam like a shield of sapphire and beyrout sculpture against the background of its mulberry grove be glorified beyond all other city the turf around we pavilion fairly blaze with the splendor of the yellow daisy and crimson poppy that stud it i be satisfy with what i saw and feel no wish to leave quarantine to-day we italian friend however be more impatient he betrothed come early to see he and we be edify by the great alacrity with which he hasten to the grate to renew he vow at two yard ' distance from she in the meantime i go down to the turkish house to cultivate the acquaintance of a singular character i meet on board the steamer he be a negro of six foot four dress in a long scarlet robe he name be mahommed senoosee and he be a _ fakeer _ or holy man from timbuctoo he have be two year absent from home on a pilgrimage to mecca and medina and be now on he way to jerusalem and damascus he have travel extensively in all part of central africa from dar-fur to ashantee and profess to be on good term with the sultan of houssa and bornou he have even be in the great kingdom of waday which have never be explore by european and as far south as iolum the capital of adamowa of the correctness of he narration i have not the least doubt as they correspond geographically with all that we know of the interior of africa in answer to my question whether a european might safely make the same tour he reply that there would be no difficulty provide he be accompany by a native and he offer to take I even to timbuctoo if i would return with he he be very curious to obtain information about america and make note of all that i tell he in the quaint character use by the mughrebbin or arab of the west which have considerable resemblance to the ancient cufic he wish to join company with I for the journey to jerusalem and perhaps i shall accept he _ Sunday April _ 18 as quarantine be a sort of limbo without the pale of civilized society we have no church service to-day we have do the best we could however in send one of the outside dragoman to purchase a bible in which we succeed he bring we a very handsome copy print by the american bible society in new york i try vainly in cairo and alexandrium to find a missionary who would supply my heathenish destitution of the sacred writings for i have reach the east through austrium where they be prohibit and to travel through palestine without they would be like sailing without pilot or compass it give a most impressive reality to solomon 's house of the forest of lebanon when you can look up from the page to those very forest and those grand mountain excellent with the cedar see the holy man of timbuctoo pray with he face towards mecca i go down to he and we converse for a long time on religious matter he be tolerably well inform have read the book of mose and the psalm of david but like all mahommedan he idea of religion consist mainly of form and its reward be a sensual paradise the more intelligent of the moslem give a spiritual interpretation to the nature of the heaven promise by the prophet and i have hear several openly confess they disbelief in the seventy houry and the palace of pearl and emerald shekh mahommed senoosee scarcely ever utter a sentence in which be not the word allah and la illah il ' allah be repeat at least every five minute those of he class consider that there be a peculiar merit in the repetition of the name and attribute of god they utterly reject the doctrine of the trinity which they believe imply a sort of partnership or god-firm -lrb- to use they own word -rrb- and declare that all who accept it be hopelessly damned to deny mahomet 's prophetship would excite a violent antagonism and i content myself with make they acknowledge that god be greater than all prophet or apostle and that there be but one god for all the human race i have never yet encounter that bitter spirit of bigotry which be so frequently ascribe to they but on the contrary fully as great a tolerance as they would find exhibit towards they by most of the christian sect this morning a paper be send to we on which we be request to write we name age profession and place of nativity we conjecture that we be subject to the suspicion of political as well as physical taint but happily this be not the case i register myself as a _ voyageur _ the french as _ negocian _ and when it come to the woman 's turn absalom who be a partisan of female progress wish to give she the same profession as she husband -- a machinist but she declare that she only profession be that of a married woman and she be so inscribed she peevish boy rejoice in the title of _ pleuricheur _ or weeper and the infant as _ titeuse _ or sucker while this be go on the guardiano of we room come in very mysteriously and beckon to my companion say that mademoiselle be at the gate but it be the italian who be want and again from the little window of we pavilion we watch he hurry progress over the lawn no sooner have she depart than he take he pocket telescope slowly sweep the circuit of the bay as she draw nearer and nearer beyrout he have succeed in distinguish among the mass of building the top of the house in which she live but alas it be one story too low and he patient espial have only be reward by the sight of some cat promenade on the roof i have succeed in obtain some further particulars in relation to quarantine on the night of we arrival as we be about get into we bed a sudden and horrible gush of brimstone vapor come up stair and we all fall to cough like patient in a pulmonary hospital the odor increase till we be oblige to open the window and sit beside they in order to breathe comfortably this be the preparatory fumigation in order to remove the ranker seed of plague after which the milder symptom will of themselves vanish in the pure air of the place several time a day we be stunned and overwhelmed with the crack bray of three discordant trumpet as grate and doleful as the last gasp of a die donkey at first i suppose the object of this be to give a greater agitation to the air and separate and shake down the noxious exhalation we emit but since i be inform that the soldier outside would shoot we in case we attempt to escape i have conclude that the sound be mean to alarm we and prevent we approach too near the wall on inquire of we guardiano whether the wheat grow within the grounds be subject to quarantine he inform I that it do not ecovey infection and that three old goose who walk out past the guard with impunity be free to go and come as they have never be know to have the plague yesterday evening the medical attendant a polish physician come in to inspect we but he make a very hasty review look down on we from the top of a high horse _ Monday April _ 19 eureka the whole thing be explain talk to day with the guardiano he happen to mention that he have be three year in quarantine keep watch over infected traveller what say i you have be sick three year oh no he reply i have never be sick at all but be not people sick in quarantine _ stafferillah _ he exclaim they be always in better health than the people outside what be quarantine for then i persist what be it for he repeat with a pause of blank amazement at my ignorance why to get money from the traveller indiscreet guardiano it be better to suppose ourselves under suspicion of the plague than to have such a explanation of the mystery yet in spite of the unpalatable knowledge i almost regret that this be we last day in the establishment the air be so pure and brace the view from we window so magnificent the colonize branch of the beyrout hotel so comfortable that i be content to enjoy this pleasant idleness -- the more pleasant since be involuntary it be no weight on the conscience i look up to the maronite village perch on the slope of lebanon with scarce a wish to climb to they or turn to the sparkling mediterranean view the speronara 's sail of snowy hue whitening and brighten on that field of blue and have none of that unrest which the sight of a vessel in motion suggest to-day my friend from timbuctoo come up to have another talk he be curious to know the object of my travels and as he would not have comprehend the exact truth i be oblige to convey it to he through the medium of fiction i inform he that i have be dispatch by the sultan of my country to obtain information of the country of africa that i write in a book account of everything i saw and on my return would present this book to the sultan who would reward I with a high rank -- perhaps even that of grand vizier the oriental deal largely in hyperbole and scatter number and value with the most reckless profusion the arabic like the hebrew its sister tongue and other old original tongue of man be a language of root and abound with the boldest metaphor now exaggeration be but the imperfect form of metaphor the expression be always a splendid amplification of the simple fact like skilful archer in order to hit the mark they aim above it when you have once learn he standard of truth you can readily gauge a arab 's expression and regulate you own accordingly but whenever i have attempt to strike the key-note myself i generally find that it be below rather than above the oriental pitch the shekh have already inform I that the king of ashantee whom he have visit possess twenty-four house full of gold and that the sultan of houssa have seventy thousand horse always stand saddle before he palace in order that he might take he choice when he wish to ride out by this he do not mean that the fact be precisely so but only that the king be very rich and the sultan have a great many horse in order to give the shekh a idea of the great wealth and power of the american nation i be oblige to adopt the same plan i tell he therefore that we country be two year ' journey in extent that the treasury consist of four thousand house fill to the roof with gold and that two hundred thousand soldier on

some of he irresistible dry saying i persuade mr harrison to adopt the oriental costume which from five month ' wear in africa i greatly prefer to the frank we therefore ride out of beyrout as a pair of syrian bey while françois with he belt sabre and pistol have much the aspect of a greek brigand the road cross the hill behind the city between the forest of pine and a long tract of red sand-hill next the sea it be a lovely morning not too bright and hot for light fleecy vapor hang along the side of lebanon beyond the mulberry orchard we enter on wild half-cultivated tract cover with a bewildering maze of blossom the hill-side and stony shelf of soil overhang the sea fairly blaze with the brilliant dot of color which be rain upon they the pink the broom the poppy the speedwell the lupin that beautiful variety of the cyclamen call by the syrian _ deek e-djebel _ -lrb- cock o ' the mountain -rrb- and a number of unknown plant dazzle the eye with they profusion and load the air with fragrance as rare as it be unfailing here and there clear swift rivulet come down from lebanon course they way between thicket of bloom oleander just before cross the little river damoor françois point out on one of the distant height the residence of the late lady hester stanhope during the afternoon we cross several offshoot of the lebanon by path incredibly steep and stony and towards evening reach saïda the ancient sidon where we obtain permission to pitch we tent in a garden the town be build on a narrow point of land jut out from the center of a bay or curve in the coast and contain about five thousand inhabitant it be a quiet sleepy sort of a place and contain nothing of the old sidon except a few stone and the fragment of a mole extend into the sea the fortress in the water and the citadel be remnant of venitian sway the cloud gather after nightfall and occasionally there be a dash of rain on we tent but i hear it with the same quiet happiness as when in boyhood sleep beneath the rafter i have hear the rain beat all night upon the roof i breathe the sweet breath of the grass whereon my carpet be spread and old mother earth welcome I back to she bosom cradle I into calm and refreshing sleep there be no rest more grateful than that which we take on the turf or the sand except the rest below it we rise in a dark and cloudy morning and continue we way between field of barley completely stain with the bloody hue of the poppy and meadow turn into golden mosaic by a brilliant yellow daisy until noon we road be over a region of alternate meadow land and gentle though stony elevation make out from lebanon we meet continually with indication of ancient power and prosperity the ground be strew with hew block and the foundation of building remain in many place break sarcophagus lie half-buried in grass and the gray rock of the hill be pierce with tomb the soil though stony appear to be naturally fertile and the crop of wheat barley and lentil be very flourishing after round the promontory which form the southern boundary of the gulf of sidon we ride for a hour or two over a plain near the sea and then come down to a valley which run up among the hill terminate in a natural amphitheatre a ancient barrow or tumulus nobody know of whom stand near the sea during the day i notice two charming little picture one a fountain gush into a broad square basin of masonry shaded by three branch cypress two turk sit on its edge eat they bread and curdled milk while they horse drink out of the stone trough below the other a old mahommedan with a green turban and white robe seat at the foot of a majestic sycamore over the high bank of a stream that tumble down its bed of white marble rock to the sea the plain back of the narrow sandy promontory on which the modern soor be build be a rich black loam which a little proper culture would turn into a very garden it help I to account for the wealth of ancient tyre the approach to the town along a beach on which the surf break with a continuous roar with the wreck of a greek vessel in the foreground and a stormy sky behind be very striking it be a wild bleak picture the white minaret of the town stand out spectrally against the cloud we ride up the sand-hill back of the town and select a good camping-place among the ruin of tyre near we there be a ancient square building now use as a cistern and fill with excellent fresh water the surf roar tremendously on the rock on either hand and the boom of the more distant breaker come to my ear like the wind in a pine forest the remains of the ancient sea-wall be still to be trace for the entire circuit of the city and the heavy surf break upon pile of shatter granite column along a sort of mole protect a inner harbor on the north side be great number of these column i count fifteen in one group some of they fine red granite and some of the marble of lebanon the remains of the pharo and the fortress strengthen the sea-wall be point out by the syrian who accompany we as a guide but he faith be a little stronger than mine he even show we the ruin of the jetty build by alexander by means of which the ancient city then insulate by the sea be take the remains of the causeway gradually form the promontory by which the place be now connect with the main land these be the principal indication of tyre above ground but the guide inform we that the arab in digging among the sand-hill for the stone of the old building which they quarry out and ship to beyrout come upon chamber pillar arch and other object the tyrian purple be still furnish by a muscle find upon the coast but tyre be now only note for its tobacco and mill-stones i see many of the latter lie in the street of the town and a arab be sell a quantity at auction in the square as we pass they be cut out from a species of dark volcanic rock by the bedouin of the mountain there be half a dozen small coast vessel lie in the road but the old harbor be entirely destroy isaiah 's prophecy be literally fulfil : howl ye ship of tarshish for it be lay waste so that there be no house no enter in on return from we ramble we pass the house of the governor daood agha who be dispense justice in regard to a lawsuit then before he he ask we to stop and take coffee and receive we with much grace and dignity as we rise to leave a slave bring I a large bunch of choice flower from he garden we set out from tyre at a early hour and ride along the beach around the head of the bay to the ras-el-abiad the ancient promontorium album the morning be wild and cloudy with gleam of sunshine that flash out over the dark violet gloom of the sea the surf be magnificent roll up in grand billow which break and form again till the last of the long fall fringe of snow slide seethe up the sand something of ancient power be in they shock and roar and every great wave that plunge and draw back again call in its solemn bass : where be the ship of tyre where be the ship of tyre i look back on the city which stand advanced far into the sea she foot bath in thunderous spray by and by the cloud clear away the sun come out bold and bright and we road leave the beach for a meadowy plain cross by fresh stream and sow with a inexhaustible wealth of flower through thicket of myrtle and mastic around which the rue and lavender grow in dense cluster we reach the foot of the mountain and begin ascend the celebrated ladder of tyre the road be so steep as to resemble a staircase and climb along the side of the promontory hang over precipice of naked white rock in some place three hundred foot in height the mountain be a mass of magnesian limestone with occasional bed of marble the surf have wear its foot into hollow cavern into which the sea rush with a dull heavy boom like distant thunder the side be cover with thicket of broom myrtle arbutus ilex mastic and laurel overgrown with woodbine and intersperse with patch of sage lavender hyssop wild thyme and rue the whole mountain be a heap of balm a bundle of sweet spice we horse ' hoof clatter up and down the round of the ladder and we look we last on tyre fading away behind the white hem of the breaker as we turn the point of the promontory another cove of the mountain-coast follow terminate by the cape of nakhura the northern point of the bay of acre we ride along a stony way between field of wheat and barley blot almost out of sight by shower of scarlet poppy and yellow chrysanthemum there be frequent ruin : fragment of sarcophagus foundation of house and about half way between the two cape the mound of alexandro-schoenæ we stop at a khan and breakfast under a magnificent olive tree while two boy tend we horse to see that they eat only the edge of the wheat field below the house be two large cypress and on a little tongue of land the ruin of one of those square tower of the corsair which line all this coast the intense blue of the sea see close at hand over a broad field of golden wheat form a dazzling and superb contrast of color early in the afternoon we climb the ra nakhura not so bold and grand though quite as flowery a steep as the promontorium album we have be jogging half a hour over its uneven summit when the side suddenly fall away below we and we see the whole of the great gulf and plain of acre back by the long ridge of mount carmel behind the sea which make a deep indentation in the line of the coast extend the plain bound on the east at two league ' distance by a range of hill cover with luxuriant olive grove and still higher by the distant mountain of galilee the fortification of acre be visible on a slight promontory near the middle of the gulf from we foot the line of foamy surf extend for mile along the red sand-beach till it finally become like a chalk-mark on the edge of the field of blue we ride down the mountain and continue we journey over the plain of esdraelon -- a picture of summer luxuriance and bloom the wave of wheat and barley roll away from we path to the distant olive orchard here the water gush from a stone fountain and flow into a turf-girdled pool around which the syrian woman be wash they garment there a garden of orange lemon fig and pomegranate tree in blossom be a spring of sweet odor which overflow the whole land we ride into some of these forest for they be no less and finally pitch we tent in one of they belong to the palace of the former abdallah pasha within a mile of acre the old saracen aqueduct which still convey water to the town overhang we tent for a hour before reach we destination we have see it on the left cross the hollow on light stone arch in one place i count fifty-eight and in another one hundred and three of these arch some of which be fifty foot high we camp be a charming place : a nest of deep herbage under two enormous fig-tree and surround by a balmy grove of orange and citron it be doubly beautiful when the long line of the aqueduct be light up by the moon and the orange tree become mound of ambrosial darkness in the morning we ride to acre the fortification of which have be restore on the land-side a ponderous double gateway of stone admit we into the city through what be once apparently the court-yard of a fortress the street of the town be narrow terribly rough and very dirty but the bazaar be extensive and well stock the principal mosque whose heavy dome be visible at some distance from the city be surround with a garden enclose by a pillared corridor pave with marble all the house of the city be build in the most massive style of hard gray limestone or marble and this circumstance alone prevent they complete destruction during the english bombardment in 1841 the mark of the shell be everywhere see and the upper part of the lofty building be completely riddled with cannon-ball some of which remain embedded in the stone we make a rapid tour of the town on horseback follow by the curious glance of the people who be in doubt whether to consider we turk or frank there be a dozen vessel in the harbor which be consider the best in syrium the baggage-mule have go on so we gallop after they along the hard beach around the head of the bay it be a brilliant morning a delicious south-eastern breeze come to we over the flowery plain of esdraelon the sea on we right shone blue and purple and violet-green and black as the shadow or sunshine cross it and only the long line of roar foam for ever change in form do not vary in hue a fisherman stand on the beach in a statuesque attitude he handsome bare leg bath in the frothy swell a bag of fish hanging from he shoulder and the large square net with its sinker of lead in he right hand ready for a cast he have good luck for the wave bring up plenty of large fish and cast they at we foot leave they to struggle back into the treacherous brine between acre and haifa we pass six or eight wreck mostly of small trading vessel some be half bury in sand some so old and mossy that they be fast rot away while a few have be recently hurl there as we round the deep curve of the bay and approach the line of palm-trees gird the foot of mount carmel haifa with its wall and saracenic town in ruin on the hill above grow more clear and bright in the sun while acre dip into the blue of the mediterranean the town of haifa the ancient caiapha be small dirty and beggarly look but it have some commerce share the trade of acre in the production of syrium it be Sunday and all the consular flag be fly it be a unexpected delight to find the american color in this little syrian town fly from one of the tallest pole the people stare at we as we pass and i notice among they many bright frankish face with eye too clear and gray for syrium o ye kind brother of the monastery of carmel forgive I if i look to you for a explanation of this phenomenon we ascend to mount carmel the path lead through a grove of carob tree from which the bean know in germany as st john 's bread be produce after this we come into a olive grove at the foot of the mountain from which long field of wheat give forth a ripe summer smell flow down to the shore of the bay the olive tree be of immense size and i can well believe as fra carlo inform we that they be probably plant by the roman colonist establish there by titus the gnarled veteran bole still send forth vigorous and blossoming bough there be all manner of lovely light and shades chequer over the turf and the wind path we ride at last we reach the foot of a ascent steeper than the ladder of tyre as we horse slowly climb to the convent of st elijah whence we already see the french flag float over the shoulder of the mountain the view open grandly to the north and east reveal the bay and plain of acre and the coast as far as ra nakhura from which we first see mount carmel the day previous the two view be very similar in character one be the obverse of the other we reach the convent -- dayr mar elias as the arab call it -- at noon just in time to partake of a bountiful dinner to which the monk have treat themselves fra carlo the good franciscan who receive stranger show we the building and the grotto of elijah which be under the altar of the convent church a small but very handsome structure of italian marble the sanctity of the grotto depend on tradition entirely as there be no mention in the bible of elijah have reside on carmel though it be from this mountain that he see the cloud like a man 's hand rise from the sea the convent which be quite new -- not yet complete in fact -- be a large massive building and have the aspect of a fortress as we be to sleep at tantura five hour distant we be oblige to make a short visit in spite of the invitation of the hospitable fra carlo to spend the night there in the afternoon we pass the ruin of athlit a town of the middle age and the castel pellegrino of the crusader we road now follow the beach nearly the whole distance to jaffa and be in many place for league in extent a solid layer of white brown purple and rosy shell which crack and rattle under we horse ' foot tantura be a poor arab village and we have some difficulty in procure provision the people live in small hut of mud and stone near the sea the place have a thievish look and we deem it best to be careful in the disposal of we baggage for the night in the morning we take the coast again ride over million of shell a line of sandy hill cover with thicket of myrtle and mastic shut off the view of the plain and meadow between the sea and the hill of samarium after three hour ' ride we see the ruin of ancient cæsarea near a small promontory the road turn away from the sea and take the wild plain behind which be completely overgrow with camomile chrysanthemum and wild shrub the ruin of the town be visible at a considerable distance along the coast the principal remain consist of a massive wall flank with pyramidal bastion at regular interval and with the trace of gateway draw-bridge and tower it be formerly surround by a deep moat within this space which may be a quarter of a mile square be a few fragment of building and toward the sea some high arch and mass of masonry the plain around abound with trace of house street and court-yard cæsarea be one of the roman colony but owe its prosperity principally to herod st paul pass through it on he way from macedon to jerusalem by the very road we be travel during the day the path strike inland over a vast rolling plain cover with sage lavender and other sweet-smelling shrub and tenant by herd of gazelle and flock of large stork as we advance further the landscape become singularly beautiful it be a broad shallow valley swell away towards the east into low rolling hill far back of which rise the blue line of the mountain -- the hill-country of judea the soil where it be plough be the richest vegetable loam where it lay fallow it be entirely hide by a bed of grass and camomile here and there great herd of sheep and goat browse on the herbage there be a quiet pastoral air about the landscape a soft serenity in its form and color as if the hebrew patriarch still make it they abode the district be famous for robber and we keep we arm in readiness never suffer the baggage to be out of we sight towards evening as mr h and myself with françois be ride in advance of the baggage mule the former with he gun in he hand i with a pair of pistol thrust through the fold of my shawl and françois with he long turkish sabre we come suddenly upon a lonely englishman whose companion be somewhere in the rear he appear to be strike with terror on see we make towards he and turn he horse 's head make a attempt to fly the animal however be restive and after a few plunge refuse to move the traveller give himself up for lose he arm drop by he side he stare wildly at we with pale face and eye open wide with a look of helpless fright restrain with difficulty a shout of laughter i say to he : do you leave jaffa to-day but so completely be he ear the fool of he imagination that he think i be speak arabic and make a faint attempt to get out the only word or two of that language which he know i then repeat with as much distinctness as i could command : do -- you -- leave -- jaffa -- to-day he stammer mechanically through he chatter tooth y-y-yes and we immediately dash off at a gallop through the bush when we last see he he be stand as we leave he apparently not yet recover from the shock at the little village of el haram where we spend the night i visit the tomb of sultan alus ebn-aleym who be now revere as a saint it be enclose in a mosque crowning the top of a hill i be admit into the court-yard without hesitation though from the porter styling I effendi he probably take I for a turk at the entrance to the inner court i take off my slipper and walk to the tomb of the sultan -- a square heap of white marble in a small marble enclosure in one of the niche in the wall near the tomb there be a very old iron box with a slit in the top the porter inform I that it contain a charm belong to sultan alus which be of great use in producing rain in time of drouth in the morning we send we baggage by a short road across the country to this place and then ride down the beach towards jaffa the sun come out bright and hot as we pace along the line of spray we horse ' foot sink above the fetlock in pink and purple shell while the droll sea-crab scamper away from we path and the blue gelatinous sea-nettle be toss before we by the surge we view be confine to the sand-hill -- sometimes cover with a flood of scarlet poppy -- on one hand and to the blue surf-fringed sea on the other the terrible coast be still line with wreck and just before reach the town we pass a vessel of some two hundred ton recently cast ashore with she strong hull still unbroken we ford the rapid stream of el anjeh which come down from the plain of sharon the water rise to we saddle the low promontory in front now break into tower and white dome and great mass of heavy wall the aspect of jaffa be exceedingly picturesque it be build on a hill and the land for many mile around it be low and flat its topmost house overlook all the field of sharon the old harbor protect by a reef of rock be on the north side of the town but be now so sand up that large vessel can not enter a number of small craft be lie close to the shore the port present a different scene when the ship of hiram king of tyre come in with the material for the temple of solomon there be but one gate on the land side which be rather strongly fortify outside of this there be a open space which we find fill with vender of orange and vegetable camel-men and the like some vociferating in loud dispute some give up to silence and smoke under the shade of the sycamore we ride under the heavily arched and tower gateway and enter the bazaar the street be crowd and there be such a confusion of camel donkey and man that we make we way with difficulty along the only practicable street in the city to the sea-side where françois point out a hole in the wall as the veritable spot where jonah be cast ashore by the whale this part of the harbor be the receptacle of all the offal of the town and i do not wonder that the whale 's stomach should have turn on approach it the sea-street be fill with merchant and trader and we be oblige to pick we way between bar of iron skin of oil heap of orange and pile of building timber at last we reach the end and as there be no other thoroughfare return the same way we go pass out the gate and take the road to ramleh and jerusalem but i hear the voice of françois announce _ monsieur le diner est prêt _ we be encamp just beside the pool of ramleh and the mongrel child of the town be make a great noise in the meadow below it we horse be enjoy they barley and mustapha stand at the tent-door tie up he sack dog be bark and donkey bray all along the border of the town whose filth and dilapidation be happily conceal by the fig and olive garden which surround it i have not curiosity enough to visit the greek and latin convent embed in its foul purlieus but content myself with gaze from my door upon

between delightful garden of fig citron orange pomegranate and palm the country for several mile around the city be a complete level -- part of the great plain of sharon -- and the gray mass of building crowning the little promontory be the only landmark see above the green garden-land on look towards the sea the road be line with hedge of giant cactus now in blossom and shaded occasionally with broad-armed sycamore the orange tree be in bloom and at the same time laden down with ripe fruit the orange of jaffa be the finest in syrium and great number of they be send to beyrout and other port further north the dark foliage of the pomegranate fairly blaze with its heavy scarlet blossom and here and there a cluster of rose make good the scriptural renown of those of sharon the road be fill with people pass to and fro and several family of jaffa jew be have a sort of pic-nic in the choice shady spot ere long we come to a fountain at a point where two road meet it be a large square structure of limestone and marble with a stone trough in front and a delightful open chamber at the side the space in front be shaded with immense sycamore tree to which we tie we horse and then take we seat in the window above the fountain where the greek bring we we breakfast the water be cool and delicious as be we jaffa orange it be a charming spot for as we sit we could look under the bough of the great tree and down between the garden to jaffa and the mediterranean after leave the garden we come upon the great plain of sharon on which we could see the husbandman at work far and near ploughing and sowing they grain in some instance the two operation be make simultaneously by have a sort of funnel attach to the plough-handle run into a tube which enter the earth just behind the share the man hold the plough with one hand while with the other he drop the requisite quantity of seed through the tube into the furrow the people be plough now for they summer crop and the wheat and barley which they sow last winter be already in full head on other part of the plain there be large flock of sheep and goat with they attendant shepherd so run the rich landscape break only by belt of olive tree to the far hill of judea ride on over the long low swell fragrant with wild thyme and camomile we see at last the tower of ramleh and down the valley a hour 's ride to the north-east the minaret of ludd the ancient lydda still further i could see the house of the village of sharon embower in olive ramleh be build along the crest and on the eastern slope of a low hill and at a distance appear like a stately place but this impression be immediately dissipate on enter it west of the town be a large square tower between eighty and ninety foot in height we ride up to it through a orchard of ancient olive tree and over a field of bean the tower be evidently a minaret as it be build in the purest saracenic style and be surround by the ruin of a mosque i have rarely see anything more graceful than the ornamental arch of the upper portion over the door be a lintel of white marble with a arabic inscription the mosque to which the tower be attach be almost entirely destroy and only part of the arch of a corridor around three side of a court-yard with the fountain in the center still remain the subterranean cistern under the court-yard amaze I with they extent and magnitude they be no less than twenty-four foot deep and cover by twenty-four vaulted ceiling each twelve foot square and rest on massive pillar the mosque when entire must have be one of the finest in syrium we clamber over the broken stone cumber the entrance and mount the step to the very summit the view reach from jaffa and the sea to the mountain near jerusalem and southward to the plain of ascalon -- a great expanse of grain and grazing land all blossom as the rose and dot especially near the mountain with dark luxuriant olive-grove the landscape have something of the green pastoral beauty of england except the mountain which be wholly of palestine the shadow of fleecy cloud drift slowly from east to west move across the landscape which become every moment softer and fairer in the light of the decline sun i do not tarry in ramleh the street be narrow crooked and filthy as only a oriental town can be the house have either flat roof or dome out of the crevice in which spring a plentiful crop of weed some yellow dog bark at we as we pass child in tattered garment stare and old turbaned head be raise from the pipe to guess who the two brown individual might be and why they be attend by such a fierce _ cawass _ pass through the eastern gate we be gladden by the sight of we tent already pitch in the meadow beside the cistern dervish have arrive a hour before we and have everything ready for the sweet lounge of a hour to which we treat ourselves after a day 's ride i watch the evening fade away over the blue hill before we and try to convince myself that i should reach jerusalem on the morrow reason say : you certainly will -- but to faith the holy city be as far off as ever be it possible that i be in judea be this the holy land of the crusade the soil hallowed by the foot of christ and he apostle i must believe it yet it seem once that if i ever tread that earth then beneath my foot there would be thenceforth a consecration in my life a holy essence a purer inspiration on the lip a surer faith in the heart and because i be not other than i have be i half doubt whether it be the palestine of my dream a number of arab cameleer who have come with traveller across the desert from egypt be encamp near we françois be suspicious of some of they and therefore divide the night into three watch which be keep by himself and we two man mustapha be the last and keep not only himself but myself wide awake by he dolorous chant of love and religion i fall sound asleep at dawn but be rouse before sunrise by françois who wish to start betime on account of the rugged road we have to travel the morning be mild clear and balmy and we be soon packed and in motion leave the baggage to follow we ride ahead over the fertile field the wheat and poppy be glisten with dew bird sing among the fig-tree a cool breeze come down from the hollow of the hill and my blood leap as nimbly and joyously as a young hart on the mountain of bether between ramleh and the hill-country a distance of about eight mile be the rolling plain of arimathea and this as well as the greater part of the plain of sharon be one of the richest district in the world the soil be a dark-brown loam and without manure produce annually superb crop of wheat and barley we ride for mile through a sea of wheat wave far and wide over the swell of land the tobacco in the field about ramleh be the most luxuriant i ever see and the olive and fig attain a size and lusty strength wholly unknown in italy judea curse of god what a misconception not only of god 's mercy and beneficence but of the actual fact give palestine into christian hand and it will again flow with milk and honey except some part of asia minor no portion of the levant be capable of yield such a harvest of grain silk wool fruit oil and wine the great disadvantage under which the country labor be its frequent drouth but be the soil more generally cultivate and the old orchard replant these would neither be so frequent nor so severe we gradually ascend the hill pass one or two village imbed in grove of olive in the little valley slant down to the plain the arab be still plough and sowing singing the while a old love-song with its chorus of _ ya ghazalee ya ghazalee _ -lrb- oh gazelle oh gazelle -rrb- the valley narrow the lowland behind we spread out broader and in half a hour more we be thread a narrow pass between stony hill overgrow with ilex myrtle and dwarf oak the wild purple rose of palestine blossom on all side and a fragrant white honeysuckle in some place hang from the rock the path be terribly rough and barely wide enough for two person on horseback to pass each other we meet a few pilgrim return from jerusalem and a straggle company of armed turk who have such a piratical air that without the solemn asseveration of françois that the road be quite safe i should have feel uneasy about we baggage most of the person we pass be mussulmen few of whom give the customary peace be with you but once a syrian christian salute I with god go with you o pilgrim for two hour after enter the mountain there be scarcely a sign of cultivation the rock be limestone or marble lie in horizontal stratum the broken edge of which rise like terrace to the summit these shelf be so cover with wild shrub -- in some place even with row of olive tree -- that to I they have not the least appearance of that desolation so generally ascribe to they in a little dell among the hill there be a small ruin mosque or chapel -lrb- i could not decide which -rrb- shaded by a group of magnificent terebinth tree several arab be rest in its shade and we hope to find there the water we be look for in order to make breakfast but it be not to be find and we climb nearly to the summit of the first chain of hill where in a small olive orchard there be a cistern fill by the late rain it belong to two ragged boy who bring we a earthen vessel of the water and then ask shall we bring you milk o pilgrim i assent and receive a small jug of thick buttermilk not remarkably clean but very refreshing my companion who have not recover from he horror at find that the inhabitant of ramleh wash themselves in the pool which supply we and they refuse to touch it we make but a short rest for it be now nearly noon and there be yet many rough mile between we and jerusalem we cross the first chain of mountain ride a short distance over a stony upland and then descend into a long cultivate valley run to the eastward at the end nearest we appear the village of aboo ' l ghosh -lrb- the father of lie -rrb- which take its name from a note bedouin shekh who distinguish himself a few year ago by levy contribution on traveller he obtain a large sum of money in this way but as he add murder to robbery and fall upon turk as well as christian he be finally capture and be now expiate he offence in some mine on the coast of the black sea near the bottom of the village there be a large ruin building now use as a stable by the inhabitant the interior be divide into a nave and two side-aisle by row of square pillar from which spring point arch the door-way be at the side and be gothic with a dash of saracenic in the ornamental moulding above it the large window at the extremity of the nave be remarkable for have round arch which circumstance together with the trace of arabesque paint ornament on the column lead I to think it might have be a mosque but dr robinson who be now here consider it a christian church of the time of the crusader the village of aboo ' l ghosh be say to be the site of the birth-place of the prophet jeremiah and i can well imagine it to have be the case the aspect of the mountain-country to the east and north-east would explain the savage dreariness of he lamentation the whole valley in which the village stand as well as another which join it on the east be most assiduously cultivate the stony mountain side be work into terrace where in spite of soil which resemble a american turnpike patch of wheat be grow luxuriantly and olive tree century old hold on to the rock with a clutch as hard and bony as the hand of death in the bed of the valley the fig tree thrive and sometimes the vine and fig grow together form the patriarchal arbor of shade familiar to we all the shoot of the tree be still young and green but the blossom of the grape do not yet give forth they goodly savor i do not hear the voice of the turtle but a nightingale sing in the briery thicket by the brook side as we pass along climb out of this valley we descend by a stony staircase as rugged as the ladder of tyre into the wady beit-hanineh here be garden of orange in blossom with orchard of quince and apple overgrown with vine and the fragrant hawthorn tree snowy with its bloom a stone bridge the only one on the road cross the dry bed of a winter stream and look up the glen i see the arab village of kulonieh at the entrance of the valley of elah glorious with the memory of the shepherd-boy david we road turn off to the right and commence ascend a long dry glen between mountain which grow more sterile the further we go it be nearly two hour past noon the sun fiercely hot and we horse be nigh jade out with the rough road and we impatient spur i begin to fancy we could see jerusalem from the top of the pass and try to think of the ancient day of judea but it be in vain a newer picture shut they out and banish even the diviner image of we savior and he disciple heathen that i be i could only think of godfrey and the crusader toiling up the same path and the ringing line of tasso vibrate constantly in my ear : ecco apparir gierusalemm ' si vede ecco additar gierusalemm ' si scorge ecco da mille voci unitamente gierusalemme salutar si sente the palestine of the bible -- the land of promise to the israelite the land of miracle and sacrifice to the apostle and they follower -- still sleep in the unattainable distance under a sky of bluer and more tranquil loveliness than that to whose cloudless vault i look up it lay as far and beautiful as it once seem to the eye of childhood and the sword of seraph keep profane foot from its sacred hill but these rough rock around I these dry fiery hollow these thicket of ancient oak and ilex have hear the trumpet of the middle age and the clang and clatter of european armor -- i could feel and believe that i enter the rank i follow the trumpet and the holy hymn and wait breathlessly for the moment when every mail knee should drop in the dust and every bearded and sunburned cheek be wet with devotional tear but when i climb the last ridge and look ahead with a sort of painful suspense jerusalem do not appear we be two thousand foot above the mediterranean whose blue we could dimly see far to the west through notch in the chain of hill to the north the mountain be gray desolate and awful not a shrub or a tree relieve they frightful barrenness a upland tract cover with white volcanic rock lay before we we meet peasant with ass who look -lrb- to my eye -rrb- as if they have just leave jerusalem still forward we urge we horse and reach a ruin garden surround with hedge of cactus over which i see dome and wall in the distance i draw a long breath and look at françois he be jogging along without turn he head he could not have be so indifferent if that be really the city presently we reach another slight rise in the rocky plain he begin to urge he pant horse and at the same instant we both lash the spirit into ours dash on at a break-neck gallop round the corner of a old wall on the top of the hill and lo the holy city we greek jerk both pistol from he holster and fire they into the air as we rein up on the steep from the description of traveller i have expect to see in jerusalem a ordinary modern turkish town but that before I with its wall fortress and dome be it not still the city of david i see the jerusalem of the new testament as i have imagine it long line of wall crown with a notch parapet and strengthen by tower a few dome and spire above they cluster of cypress here and there this be all that be visible of the city on either side the hill slope down to the two deep valley over which it hang on the east the mount of olive crown with a chapel and mosque rise high and steep but in front the eye pass directly over the city to rest far away upon the lofty mountain of moab beyond the dead sea the scene be grand in its simplicity the prominent color be the purple of those distant mountain and the hoary gray of the nearer hill the wall be of the dull yellow of weather-stained marble and the only tree the dark cypress and moonlit olive now indeed for one brief moment i know that i be in palestine that i saw mount olivet and mount zion and -- i know not how it be -- my sight grow weak and all object tremble and waver in a watery film since we arrive i have look down upon the city from the mount of olive and up to it from the valley of jehosaphat but i can not restore the illusion of that first view we allow we horse to walk slowly down the remain half-mile to the jaffa gate a englishman with a red silk shawl over he head be sketch the city while a arab hold a umbrella over he inside the gate we stumble upon a italian shop with a italian sign and after thread a number of intricate passage under dark archway and be turn off from one hotel which be full of traveller reach another keep by a convert german jew where we find dr robinson and dr ely smith who both arrive yesterday it sound strange to talk of a hotel in jerusalem but the world be progress and there be already three i leave to-morrow for jericho the jordan and the dead sea and shall have more to say of jerusalem on my return chapter iv the dead sea and the jordan river bargaining for a guard -- departure from jerusalem -- the hill of offence -- bethany -- the grotto of lazarus -- the valley of fire -- scenery of the wilderness -- the hill of engaddus -- the shore of the dead sea -- a bituminous bath -- gallop to the jordan -- a watch for robber -- the jordan -- baptism -- the plain of jericho -- the fountain of elisha -- the mount of temptation -- return to jerusalem and the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroy as the lord have speak -- jeremiah xlviii 8 jerusalem _ may _ 1 1852 i return this after noon from a excursion to the dead sea the river jordan and the site of jericho owe to the approach heat a early visit be deem desirable and the shekh who have charge of the road be summon to meet we on the day after we arrive there be two of these gentleman the shekh el-aràb -lrb- of the bedouin -rrb- and the shekh el-fellah -lrb- of the peasant or husbandman -rrb- to whom each traveller be oblige to pay one hundred piastre for a escort it be in fact a sort of compromise by which the shekh agree not to rob the traveller and to protect he against other shekh if the road be not actually safe the turkish garrison here be a mere farce but the arrangement be wink at by the pasha who of course get he share of the 100000 piastre which the two scamp yearly levy upon traveller the shekh come to we room and after try to postpone we departure in order to attach other tourist to the same escort and thus save a little expense take half the pay and agree to be ready the next morning unfortunately for my original plan the convent of san saba have be close within two or three week and no stranger be now admit this unusual step be cause by the disorderly conduct of some frenchman who visit san saba we send to the bishop of the greek church ask a simple permission to view the interior of the convent but without effect we leave the city yesterday morning by st stephen 's gate descend to the valley of jehosaphat ride under the stone wall which enclose the suppose gethsemane and take a path lead along the mount of olive towards the hill of offence which stand over against the southern end of the city opposite the mouth of the vale of hinnon neither of the shekh make he appearance but send in they stead three arab two of whom be mount and arm with sabre and long gun we man mustapha have charge of the baggage-mule carry we tent and the provision for the trip it be a dull sultry morning a dark leaden haze hang over jerusalem and the _ khamseen _ or sirocco-wind come from the south-west out of the arabian desert we have again resume the oriental costume but in spite of a ample turban my face soon begin to scorch in the dry heat from the crest of the hill of offence there be a wide view over the height on both side of the valley of the brook kedron they side be work into terrace now green with spring grain and near the bottom plant with olive and fig tree the upland ridge or watershed of palestine be cultivate for a considerable distance around jerusalem the soil be light and stony yet appear to yield a good return for the little labor bestow upon it cross the southern flank of mount olivet in half a hour we reach the village of bethany hanging on the side of the hill it be a miserable cluster of arab hut with not a building which appear to be more than a century old the grotto of lazarus be here show and of course we stop to see it it belong to a old mussulman who come out of he house with a piece of wax rope to light we down a aperture open from the roadside into the hill and there be barely room enough for a person to enter descend about twenty step at a sharp angle we land in a small damp vault with a opening in the floor communicate with a short passage below the vault be undoubtedly excavate for sepulchral purpose and the body be probably deposit -lrb- as in many egyptian tomb -rrb- in the pit under it we guide however point to a square mass of masonry in one corner as the tomb of lazarus whose body he inform we be still wall up there there be a arch in the side of the vault once lead to other chamber but now close up and the guide state that seventy-four prophet be inter therein there seem to be no doubt that the present arab village occupy the site of bethany and if it could be prove that this pit exist at the beginning of the christian era and there never have be any other we might accept it as the tomb of lazarus on the crest of a high hill over against bethany be a arab village on the site of bethpage we descend into the valley of a winter stream now fill with patch of sparse wheat just begin to ripen the mountain grow more bleak and desolate as we advance and as there be a regular descent in the several range over which one must pass the distant hill of the land of moab and ammon be always in sight rise like a high blue wall against the sky the dead sea be 4000 foot below jerusalem but the general slope of the intervene district be so regular that from the spire of the city and the mount of olive one can look down directly upon its water this deceive I as to the actual distance and i could scarcely credit the assertion of we arab escort that it would require six hour to reach it after we have ride nearly two hour we leave the jericho road send mustapha and a staunch old arab direct to we resting-place for the night in the valley of the jordan the two mount bedouin accompany we across the rugged mountain lie between we and the dead sea at first we take the way to the convent of mar saba follow the course of the brook kedron down the wady en-nar -lrb- valley of fire -rrb- in half a hour more we reach two large tank hew out under the base of a limestone cliff and nearly fill with rain the surface be cover with a greenish vegetable scum and three wild and dirty arab of the hill be wash themselves in the principal one we bedouin immediately dismount and follow they example and after we have take some refreshment we have the satisfaction of fill we water-jug from the same sweet pool after this we leave the san saba road and mount the height east of the valley from that point all sign of cultivation and habitation disappear the mountain be grim bare and frightfully rugged the scanty grass coax into life by the winter rain be already scorch out of all greenness some bunch of wild sage gnaphalium and other hardy aromatic herb spot the yellow soil and in sheltered place the scarlet poppy burn like coal of fire among the rift of the gray limestone rock we track keep along the higher ridge and crest of the hill between the glen and gorge which sink on either hand to a dizzy depth below and be so steep as to be almost inaccessible the region be so scar gash and tear that no work of man 's hand can save it from perpetual desolation it be a wilderness more hopeless than the desert if i be leave alone in the midst of it i should lie down and await death without thought or hope of rescue the character of the day be peculiarly suit to enhance the impression of such scenery though there be no cloud the sun be invisible : as far as we could see beyond the jordan and away southward to the mountain of moab and the cliff of engaddus the whole country be cover as with the smoke of a furnace and the furious sirocco that threaten to topple we down the gulf yawn on either hand have no coolness on its wing the horse be sure-footed but now and then a gust would come that make they and we strain against it to avoid be dash against the rock on one side or hurl off the brink on the other the atmosphere be painfully oppressive and by and by a dogged silence take possession of we party after pass a lofty peak which françois call djebel nuttar the mountain of rain we come to a large moslem building situate on a bleak eminence overlook part of the valley of the jordan this be the tomb call nebbee moussa by the arab and believe by they to stand upon the spot where mose die we halt at the gate but no one come to admit we though my companion think he see a man 's head at one of the aperture in the wall arab tradition here be as much at fault as christian tradition in many other place the true nebo be somewhere in the chain of pisgah and though probably i see it and all see it who go down to the jordan yet no man knoweth its place unto this day beyond nebbee moussa we come out upon the last height overlook the dead sea though several mile of low hill remain to be pass the head of the sea be visible as far as the ras-el-feshka on the west and the hot fountain of callirhoë on the eastern shore farther than this all be vapor and darkness the water be a soft deep purple hue brighten into blue we road lead down what seem a vast sloping causeway from the mountain between two ravine wall by cliff several hundred foot in height it gradually flatten into a plain cover with a white saline incrustation and grow with clump of sour willow tamarisk and other shrub among which i look in vain for the osher or dead sea apple the plant appear as if smite with leprosy but there be some flower grow almost to the margin of the sea we reach the shore about 2 pm the heat by this time be most severe and the air so dense as to occasion pain in my ear the dead sea be 1300 foot below the mediterranean and without doubt the lowest part of the earth 's surface i attribute the oppression i feel to this fact and to the sultriness of the day rather than to any exhalation from the sea itself françois remark however that have the wind -- which by this time be veer round to the north-east -- blow from the south we could scarcely have endure it the sea resemble a great cauldron sink between mountain from three to four thousand foot in height and probably we do not experience more than a tithe of the summer heat i propose a bath for the sake of experiment but françois endeavor to dissuade we he have try it and nothing could be more disagreeable we risk get a fever and besides there be four hour of dangerous travel yet before we but by this time we be half undressed and soon be float on the clear bituminous wave the beach be fine gravel and shelve gradually down i keep my turban on my head and be careful to avoid touch the water with my face the sea be moderately warm and gratefully soft and soothing to the skin it be impossible to sink and even while swim the body rise half out of the water i should think it possible to dive for a short distance but prefer that some one else would try the experiment with a log of wood for a pillow one might sleep as on one of the patent mattress the taste of the water be salty and pungent and sting the tongue like saltpetre we be oblige to dress in all haste without even wipe off the detestable liquid yet i experienced very little of that discomfort which most traveller have remark where the skin have be previously bruise there be a slight smart sensation and my body feel clammy and glutinous but the bath be rather refreshing than otherwise we turn we horse ' head towards the jordan and ride on over a dry barren plain the two bedouin at first dash ahead at full gallop utter cry and whirling they long gun in the air the dust they raise be blow in we face and contain so much salt that my eye begin to smart painfully thereupon i follow they at a equal rate of speed and we leave a long cloud of the accursed soil whirling behind we presently however they fall to the rear and continue to keep at some distance from we the reason of this be soon explain the path turn eastward and we already see a line of dusky green wind through the wilderness this be the jordan and the mountain beyond the home of robber arab be close at hand those robber frequently cross the river and conceal themselves behind the sand-hill on this side we brave escort be therefore incline to put we forward as a forlorn-hope and secure they own retreat in case of a attack but as we be all well armed and have never consider they attendance as anything more than a genteel way of buy they off from rob we we allow they to lag as much as they choose finally as we approach the pilgrim ' ford one of they take he station at some distance from the river on the top of a mound while the other get behind some tree near at hand in order as they say to watch the opposite hill and alarm we whenever they should see any of the benus sukr or the benus adwam or the tyakh come down upon we the jordan at this point will not average more than ten yard in breadth it flow at the bottom of a gully about fifteen foot deep which traverse the broad valley in a most tortuous course the water have a white clayey hue and be very swift the change of the current have form island and bed of soil here and there which be cover with a dense growth of ash poplar willow and tamarisk tree the bank of the river be border with thicket now overgrow with wild vine and fragrant with flowering plant bird sing continually in the cool dark covert of the tree i find a singular charm in the wild lonely luxuriant bank the tangled undergrowth and the rapid brawling course of the sacred stream as it slip in sight and out of sight among the tree it be almost impossible to reach the water at any other point than the ford of the pilgrim the suppose locality of the passage of the israelite and the baptism of christ the plain near it be still blacken by the camp-fire of the ten thousand pilgrim who go down from jerusalem three week ago to bathe we tie we horse to the tree and prepare to follow they example which be necessary if only to wash off the iniquitous slime of the dead sea françois in the meantime fill two tin flask from the stream and stow they in the saddle-bag the current be so swift that one could not venture far without the risk of be carry away but i succeed in obtain a complete and most refreshing immersion the taint of gomorrah be not entirely wash away but i ride off with as great a sense of relief as if the baptism have be a moral one as well and have purify I from sin we ride for nearly two hour in a north-west direction to the bedouin village of rihah near the site of ancient jericho before reach it the gray salt waste vanish and the soil be cover with grass and herb the barren character of the first region be evidently owe to deposit from the vapor of the dead sea as they be blow over the plain by the south wind the channel of stream around jericho be fill with nebbuk tree the fruit of which be just ripen it be apparently indigenous and grow more luxuriantly than on the white nile it be a variety of the _ rhamnus _ and be set down by botanist as the spina christus of which the savior 's mock crown of thorn be make i see no reason to doubt this as the twig be long and pliant and armed with small though most cruel thorn i have to pay for gather some of the fruit with a tear dress and bleeding finger the little apple which it bear be slightly acid and excellent for alleviate thirst i also notice on the plain a variety of the nightshade with large berry of a golden color the spring flower so plentiful now in all other part of palestine have already disappear from the valley of the jordan rihah be a vile little village of tent and mud-hut and the only relic of antiquity near it be a square tower which may possibly be of the time of herod there be a few garden in the place and a grove of superb fig-tree we find we tent already pitch beside a rill which issue from the fountain of elisha the evening be very sultry and the musquito give we no rest we purchase some milk from a old man who come to the tent but such be he mistrust of we that he refuse to let we keep the earthen vessel contain it until morning as we have already pay the money to he son we would not let he take the milk away until he have bring the money back he then take a dagger from he waist and throw it before we as security while he carry off the vessel and return the price i have frequently see the same mistrustful spirit exhibit in egypt we two bedouin to whom i give some tobacco in the evening manifest they gratitude by steal the remainder of we stock during the night this morning we follow the stream to its source the fountain of elisha so call as be probably that heal by the prophet if so the healing be scarcely complete the water which gush up strong and free at the foot of a rocky mound be warm and slightly brackish it spread into a shallow pool shaded by a fine sycamore tree just below there be some remains of old wall on both side and the stream go roar away through a rank jungle of cane fifteen foot in height the precise site of jericho i believe have not be fix but the city of the palm tree as it be call be probably on the plain near some mound which rise behind the fountain here there be occasional trace of foundation wall but so ruin as to give no clue to the date of they erection further towards the mountain there be some arch which appear to be saracenic as we ascend again into the hill-country i observe several trace of cistern in the bottom of ravine which collect the rain herod as be well know build many such cistern near jericho where he have a palace on the first crest to which we climb there be part of a roman tower yet stand the view look back over the valley of jordan be magnificent extend from the dead sea to the mountain of gilead beyond the country of ammon i think i could trace the point where the river yabbok come down from mizpeh of gilead to join the jordan the wilderness we now enter be fully as barren but less rugged than that through which we pass yesterday the path ascend along the brink of a deep gorge at the bottom of which a little stream foam over the rock the high bleak summit towards which we be climb be consider by some biblical geographer to be mount quarantana the scene of christ 's fasting and temptation after two hour we reach the ruin of a large khan or hostlery under one of the peak which françois state to be the veritable high mountain whence the devil point out all the kingdom of the earth there be a cave in the rock beside the road which the superstitious look upon as the orifice out of which he satanic majesty issue we meet large number of arab family with they flock descend from the mountain to take up they summer residence near the jordan they be all on foot except the young child and goat which be stow together on the back of donkey the man be arm and appear to be of the same tribe as we escort with whom they have a good understand the morning be cold and cloudy and we hurry on over the hill to a fountain in the valley of the brook kedron where we breakfast before we have reach bethany a rain come down and the sky hang dark and lower over jerusalem as we pass the crest of mount olivet it still rain and the filthy condition of the city exceed anything i have see even in the orient chapter v the city of christ modern jerusalem -- the site of the city -- mount zion -- mount moriah -- the temple -- the valley of jehosaphat -- the olive of gethsemane -- the mount of olive -- moslem tradition -- panorama from the summit -- the interior of the city --

since travel be become a necessary part of education and a journey through the east be no longer attend with personal risk jerusalem will soon be as familiar a station on the grand tour as pari or naple the task of describe it be already next to superfluous so thoroughly have the topography of the city be lay down by the survey of robinson and the drawing of robert there be little more leave for biblical research the few place which can be authenticate be now generally accept and the many doubtful one must always be the subject of speculation and conjecture there be no new light which can remove the cloud of uncertainty wherein one continually wander yet even reject all these with the most skeptical spirit there still remain enough to make the place sacred in the eye of every follower of christ the city stand on the ancient site the mount of olive look down upon it the foundation of the temple of solomon be on mount moriah the pool of siloam have still a cup of water for those who at noontide go down to the valley of jehosaphat the ancient gate yet looketh towards damascus and of the palace of herod there be a tower which time and turk and crusader have spare jerusalem be build on the summit ridge of the hill-country of palestine just where it begin to slope eastward not half a mile from the jaffa gate the water run towards the mediterranean it be about 2700 foot above the latter and 4000 foot above the dead sea to which the descent be much more abrupt the hill or rather group of small mount on which jerusalem stand slant eastward to the brink of the valley of jehosaphat and the mount of olive rise opposite from the side and summit of which one see the entire city spread out like a map before he the valley of hinnon the bed of which be on a much higher level than that of jehosaphat skirt the south-western and southern part of the wall and drop into the latter valley at the foot of mount zion the most southern of the mount the steep slope at the junction of the two valley be the site of the city of the jebusite the most ancient part of jerusalem it be now cover with garden-terrace the present wall cross from mount zion on the south to mount moriah on the east a little glen anciently call the tyropeon divide the mount and wind through to the damascus gate on the north though from the height of the wall and the position of the city the depression which it cause in the mass of building be not very perceptible except from the latter point moriah be the lowest of the mount and hang directly over the valley of jehosaphat its summit be build up by solomon so as to form a quadrangular terrace five hundred by three hundred yard in dimension the lower course of the grand wall compose of huge block of gray conglomerate limestone still remain and there seem to be no doubt that they be of the time of solomon some of the stone be of enormous size i notice several which be fifteen and one twenty-two foot in length the upper part of the wall be restore by sultan selim the conqueror of egypt and the level of the terrace now support the great mosque of omar which stand on the very site of the temple except these foundation wall the damascus gate and the tower of hippicus there be nothing left of the ancient city the length of the present wall of circumference be about two mile but the circuit of jerusalem in the time of herod be probably double that distance the best view of the city be from the mount of olive and the hill north of it whence titus direct the siege which result in its total destruction the crusader under godfrey of bouillon encamp on the same hill my first walk after reach here be to the summit of the mount of olive not far from the hotel we come upon the via dolorosa up which accord to catholic tradition christ toil with the cross upon he shoulder i find it utterly impossible to imagine that i be walk in the same path and prefer doubt the tradition a arch be build across the street at the spot where they say he be show to the populace -lrb- _ ecce homo _ -rrb- the passage be steep and rough descend to st stephen 's gate by the governor 's palace which stand on the site of the house of pontius pilate here in the wall form the northern part of the foundation of the temple there be some very fine remains of ancient workmanship from the city wall the ground descend abruptly to the valley of jehosaphat the turkish resident have they tomb on the city side just under the terrace of the mosque while thousand of jew find a peculiar beatitude in have themselves inter on the opposite slope of the mount of olive which be in some place quite cover with they crumble tombstone the bed of the brook kedron be now dry and stony a sort of chapel build in the bottom of the valley be suppose by the greek to cover the tomb of the virgin -- a claim which the latin consider absurd near this at the very foot of the mount of olive the latter sect have lately build a high stone wall around the garden of gethsemane for the purpose apparently of protect the five aged olive i be ignorant of the grounds wherefore gethsemane be place here most traveller have give they faith to the spot but dr robinson who be more reliable than any amount of mere tradition do not coincide with they the tree do not appear as ancient as some of those at the foot of mount carmel which be suppose to date from the roman colony establish by titus moreover it be well know that at the time of the taking of jerusalem by that emperor all the tree for many mile around be destroy the olive-tree therefore can not be those under which christ rest even suppose this to be the true site of gethseniane the mount of olive be a steep and rugged hill dominate over the city and the surround height it be still cover with olive orchard and plant with patch of grain which do not thrive well on the stony soil on the summit be a mosque with a minaret attach which afford a grand panoramic view as we reach it the chief of the college of dervish in the court of the mosque of omar come out with a number of attendant he salute we courteously which would not have be the case have he be the superior of the latin convent and we greek monk there be some turkish lady in the interior of the mosque so that we could not gain admittance and therefore do not see the rock contain the foot-print of christ who accord to moslem tradition ascend to heaven from this spot the mohammedan it may not be generally know accept the history of christ except he crucifixion believe that he pass to heaven without death another person be crucify in he stead they call he the _ roh-allah _ or spirit of god and consider he after mahomet as the holiest of the prophet we ascend to the gallery of the minaret the city lay opposite so fairly spread out to we view that almost every house might be separately distinguish it be a mass of gray building with dome-roof and but for the mosque of omar and el aksa with the court and gallery around they would be exceedingly tame in appearance the only other prominent point be the tower of the holy sepulchre the citadel enclose herod 's tower and the mosque on mount zion the turkish wall with its sharp angle its square bastion and the long embrasured line of its parapet be the most striking feature of the view stony hill stretch away from the city on all side at present cheer with tract of spring wheat but later in the season brown and desolate in the south the convent of st elia be visible and part of the little town of bethlehem i pass to the eastern side of the gallery and look thence deep down among the sterile mountain behold a long sheet of blue water its southern extremity vanish in a hot sulphury haze the mountain of ammon and moab which form the background of my first view of jerusalem lean like a vast wall against the sky beyond the mysterious sea and the broad valley of the jordan the great depression of this valley below the level of the mediterranean give it a most remarkable character it appear even deeper than be actually the case and resemble a enormous chasm or moat separate two different region of the earth the _ khamseen _ be blow from the south from out the desert of edom and throw its veil of fiery vapor over the landscape the muezzin point out to I the location of jericho of kerak in moab and es-salt in the country of ammon ere long the shadow of the minaret denote noon and place he hand on both side of he mouth he cry out first on the south side towards mecca and then to the west and north and east : god be great : there be no god but god and mohammed be he prophet let we prostrate ourselves before he : and to he alone be the glory jerusalem internally give no impression but that of filth ruin poverty and degradation there be two or three street in the western or higher portion of the city which be tolerably clean but all the other to the very gate of the holy sepulchre be channel of pestilence the jewish quarter which be the largest so sickened and disgusted I that i should rather go the whole round of the city wall than pass through it a second time the bazaar be poor compare with those of other oriental city of the same size and the principal trade seem to be in rosary both turkish and christian cross seal amulet and piece of the holy sepulchre the population which may possibly reach 20000 be apparently jewish for the most part at least i have be principally strike with the hebrew face in my walk the number of jew have increase considerably within a few year and there be also quite a number who have be convert to protestantism be bring hither at the expense of english missionary society for the purpose of form a protestant community two of the hotel be keep by family of this class it be estimate that each member of the community have cost the mission about # 4500 : a sum which would have christianize tenfold the number of english heathen the mission however be keep up by its patron as a sort of religious luxury the english have lately build a very handsome church within the wall and the rev dr gobat well know by he missionary labor in abyssinium now have the title of bishop of jerusalem a friend of he in central africa give I a letter of introduction for he and i be quite disappointed in find he absent dr barclay of virginium a most worthy man in every respect be at the head of the american mission here there be besides what be call the american colony at the village of arto near bethlehem : a little community of religious enthusiast whose experiment in cultivation have meet with remarkable success and be much speak of at present whatever good the various mission here may in time accomplish -lrb- at present it do not amount to much -rrb- jerusalem be the last place in the world where a intelligent heathen would be convert to christianity be i cast here ignorant of any religion and be i to compare the life and practice of the different sect as the means of make my choice -- in short to judge of each faith by the conduct of its professor -- i should at once turn mussulman when you consider that in the holy sepulchre there be _ nineteen _ chapel each belong to a different sect call itself christian and that a turkish police be always station there to prevent the bloody quarrel which often ensue between they you may judge how those who call themselves follower of the prince of peace practice the pure faith he seek to establish between the greek and latin church especially there be a deadly feud and they contention be a scandal not only to the few christian here but to the moslem themselves i believe there be a sort of truce at present owe to the settlement of some of the dispute -- as for instance the restoration of the silver star which the greek steal from the shrine of the nativity at bethlehem the latin however not long since demolish _ vi et armis _ a chapel which the greek commence building on mount zion but if the employment of material weapon have be abandon for the time there be none the less a war of word and of sound still go on go into the holy sepulchre when mass be be celebrate and you can scarcely endure the din no sooner do the greek choir begin its shrill chant than the latin fly to the assault they have a organ and terribly do that organ strain its bellows and labor its pipe to drown the rival singing you think the latin will carry the day when suddenly the cymbal of the abyssinians strike in with harsh brazen clang and for the moment triumph then there be copt and maronite and armenian and i know not how many other sect who must have they share and the service that should be a many-toned harmony pervade by one grand spirit of devotion become a discordant orgie befitting the rite of belial a long time ago -- i do not know the precise number of year -- the sultan grant a firman in answer to the application of both jew and christian allow the member of each sect to put to death any person belong to the other sect who should be find inside of they church or synagogue the firman have never be recall though in every place but jerusalem it remain a dead letter here although the jew freely permit christian to enter they synagogue a jew who should enter the holy sepulchre would be lucky if he escape with he life not long since a english gentleman who be take by the monk for a jew be so severely beat that he be confine to he bed for two month what worse than scandal what abomination that the spot look upon by so many christian as the most awfully sacred on earth should be the scene of such brutish intolerance i never pass the group of turkish officer quietly smoke they long pipe and sip they coffee within the vestibule of the church without a feeling of humiliation worse than the money-changer whom christ scourge out of the temple the guardian of this edifice make use of he crucifixion and resurrection as a means of gain you may buy a piece of the stone cover the holy sepulchre duly certify by the greek patriarch of jerusalem for about $ 7 at bethlehem which i visit this morning the latin monk who show we the manger the pit where 12000 innocent be bury and other thing have much less to say of the sacredness or authenticity of the place than of the injustice of allow the greek a share in its possession the native jewish family in jerusalem as well as those in other part of palestine present a marked difference to the jew of europe and america they possess the same physical characteristic -- the dark oblong eye the prominent nose the strongly-marked cheek and jaw -- but in the latter these trait have become harsh and coarse century devote to the lowest and most debasing form of traffic with the endurance of persecution and contumely have greatly change and vulgarize the appearance of the race but the jew of the holy city still retain a noble beauty which prove to my mind they descent from the ancient princely house of israel the forehead be loftier the eye larger and more frank in its expression the nose more delicate in its prominence and the face a purer oval i have remark the same distinction in the countenance of those jewish family of europe whose member have devote themselves to art or literature mendelssohn 's be a face that might have belong to the house of david on the evening of my arrival in the city as i set out to walk through the bazaar i encounter a native jew whose face will haunt I for the rest of my life i be saunter slowly along ask myself be this jerusalem when lift my eye they meet those of christ it be the very face which raphael have paint -- the traditional feature of the savior as they be recognize and accept by all christendom the wave brown hair partly hide by a jewish cap fall clustering about the ear the face be the most perfect oval and almost feminine in the purity of its outline the serene child-like mouth be shaded with a light moustache and a silky brown beard clothe the chin but the eye -- shall i ever look into such orb again large dark unfathomable they beam with a expression of divine love and divine sorrow such as i never before saw in human face the man have just emerge from a dark archway and the golden glow of the sunset reflect from a white wall above fall upon he face perhaps it be this transfiguration which make he beauty so unearthly but during the moment that i see he he be to I a revelation of the savior there be still miracle in the land of judah as the dusk gather in the deep street i could see nothing but the ineffable sweetness and benignity of that countenance and my friend be not a little astonished if not shock when i say to he with the earnestness of belief on my return : i have just see christ i make the round of the holy sepulchre on Sunday while the monk be celebrate the festival of the invention of the cross in the chapel of the empress helena as the finding of the cross by the empress be almost the only authority for the place inclose within the holy sepulchre i go there incline to doubt they authenticity and come away with my doubt vastly strengthen the building be a confused labyrinth of chapel choir shrine staircase and vault -- without any definite plan or any architectural beauty though very rich in part and full of picturesque effect golden lamp continually burn before the sacred place and you rarely visit the church without see some procession of monk with cross censer and taper thread the shadowy passage from shrine to shrine it be astonishing how many locality be assemble under one roof at first you be show the stone on which christ rest from the burden of the cross then the place where the soldier cast lot for he garment both of they adjoining the sepulchre after see this you be take to the pillar of flagellation the stock the place of crowning with thorn the spot where he meet he mother the cave where the empress helena find the cross and lastly the summit of mount calvary the sepulchre be a small marble building in the center of the church we remove we shoe at the entrance and be take by a greek monk first into a sort of ante-chamber light with golden lamp and have in the center inclose in a case of marble the stone on which the angel sit stoop through a low door we enter the sepulchre itself forty lamp of gold burn unceasingly above the white marble slab which as the monk say protect the stone whereon the body of christ be lay as we again emerge we guide lead we up a flight of step to a second story in which stand a shrine literally blaze with gold kneel on the marble floor he remove a golden shield and show we the hole in the rock of calvary where the cross be plant close beside it be the fissure produce by the earthquake which follow the crucifixion but to my eye aid by the light of the dim wax taper it be no violent rupture such as a earthquake would produce and the rock do not appear to be the same as that of which jerusalem be build as we turn to leave a monk appear with a bowl of sacred rose-water which he sprinkle on we hand bestow a double portion on a rosary of sandal-wood which i carry but it be a mohammedan rosary bring from mecca and contain the sacred number of ninety-nine bead i have not space here to state all the argument for and against the locality in the holy sepulchre i come to the conclusion that none of they be authentic and be glad to have the concurrence of such distinguished authority as dr robinson so far from this be a matter of regret i for one rejoice that those sacred spot be lose to the world christianity do not need they and they be spare a daily profanation in the name of religion we know that christ have walk on the mount of olive and go down to the pool of siloam and tarry in bethany we know that here within the circuit of we vision he have suffer agony and death and that from this little point go out all the light that have make the world greater and happier and better in its later than in its earlier day yet i must frankly confess in wander through this city -- revere alike by christian jew and turk as one of the holiest in the world -- i have be remind of christ the man rather than of christ the god in the glory which overhang palestine afar off we imagine emotion which never come when we tread the soil and walk over the hallowed site as i toil up the mount of olive in the very footstep of christ panting with the heat and the difficult ascent i find it utterly impossible to conceive that the deity in human form have walk there before I and even at night as i walk on the terraced roof while the moon the balmy moon of bless israel restore the jerusalem of olden day to my imagination the savior who then haunt my thought be the man jesus in those moment of trial when he feel the weakness of we common humanity in that agony of struggle in the garden of gethsemane in that still more bitter cry of human doubt and human appeal from the cross : my god my god why hast thou forsake I yet there be no reproach for this conception of the character of christ better the divinely-inspired man the purest and most perfect of he race the pattern and type of all that be good and holy in humanity than the deity for whose intercession we pray while we trample he teaching under we foot it would be well for many christian sect do they keep more constantly before they eye the sublime humanity of christ how much bitter intolerance and persecution might be spare the world if instead of simply adore he as a divine mediator they would strive to walk the way he tread on earth but christianity be still undeveloped and there be yet no sect which represent its fall and perfect spirit it be my misfortune if i give offence by these remark i can not assume emotion i do not feel and must describe jerusalem as i find it since be here i have read the account of several traveller and in many case the devotional rhapsody -- the ecstacy of awe and reverence -- in which they indulge strike I as force and affect the pious writer have describe what be expect of they not what they find it be partly from read such account that my anticipation be raise too high for the view of the city from the jaffa road and the panorama from the mount of olive be the only thing wherein i have be pleasantly disappoint by far the most interesting relic left to the city be the foundation wall of solomon 's temple the mosque of omar accord to the account of the turk and mr gather wood 's examination rest on immense vault which be believe to be the substruction of the temple itself under the dome of the mosque there be a large mass of natural rock revere by the moslem as that from which mahomet mount the beast borak when he visit the seven heaven and believe by mr catherwood to have serve as part of the foundation of the holy of holy no christian be allow to enter the mosque or even its enclosure on penalty of death and even the firman of the sultan have fail to obtain admission for a frank i have be strongly tempt to make the attempt in my egyptian dress which happen to resemble that of a mollah or moslem priest but the dervish in the adjoining college have sharp eye and my pronunciation of arabic would betray I in case i be accost i even go so far as to buy a string of the large bead usually carry by a mollah but unluckily i do not know the moslem form of prayer or i might carry out the plan under the guise of religious abstraction this morning we succeed in get a nearer view of the mosque from the roof of the governor 's palace françois by assume the character of a turkish _ cawass _ gain we admission the roof overlook the entire enclosure of the haram and give a complete view of the exterior of the mosque and the paved court surround it there be no regularity in the style of the building in the enclosure but the general effect be highly picturesque the great dome of the mosque be the grandest in all the orient but the body of the edifice make to resemble a octagonal tent and cover with blue and white tile be not high enough to do it justice the first court be pave with marble and have four portico each of five light saracenic arch open into the green park which occupy the rest of the terrace this park be stud with cypress and fig tree and dot all over with the tomb of shekh as we be look down on the spacious area behold who should come along but shekh mohammed senoosee the holy man of timbuctoo who have lay off he scarlet robe and don a green one i call down to he whereupon he look up and recognize we for this reason i regret we departure from jerusalem as i be sure a little persuasion would induce the holy man to accompany I within the mosque we leave to-morrow for damascus by way of nazareth and tiberius my original plan be to have go to djerash the ancient geraza in the land of gilead and thence to bozrah in djebel hauaran but djebel adjeloun as the country about djerash be call be under a powerful bedouin shekh name abd-el azeez and without a escort from he which involve considerable delay and a fee of $ 150 it would be impossible to make the journey we be therefore restricted to the ordinary route and in case we should meet with any difficulty by the way mr smith the american consul who be now here have kindly procure we a firman from the pasha of jerusalem all the traveller here be make preparation to leave but there be still two party in the desert chapter vi the hill-country of palestine leave jerusalem -- the tomb of the king -- el bireh -- the hill-country -- first view of mount hermon -- the tomb of joseph -- ebal and gerizim -- the garden of nablous -- the samaritan -- the sacred book -- a scene in the synagogue -- mentous and telemachus -- ride to samaria -- the ruin of sebaste -- scriptural landscape -- halt at genin -- the plain of esdraelon -- palestine and californium -- the hill of nazareth -- accident -- fra joachim -- the church of the virgin -- the shrine of the annunciation -- the holy place blest land of judea thrice hallowed of song where the holiest of memory pilgrim-like throng : in the shade of thy palm by the shore of thy sea on the hill of thy beauty my heart be with thee j g whittier latin convent nazareth _ Friday may _ 7 1852 we leave jerusalem by the jaffa gate because within a few month neither traveller nor baggage be allow to pass the damascus gate on account of smuggling operation have be carry on there not far from the city wall there be a superb terebinth tree now in the full glory of its shine green leave it appear to be bath in a perpetual dew the round mass of foliage sparkle and glitter in the light and the great spreading bough flood the turf below with a deluge of delicious shade a number of person be recline on the grass under it and one of they a very handsome christian boy speak to we in italian and english i scarcely remember a brighter and purer day than that of we departure the sky be a sheet of spotless blue every rift and scar of the distant hill be retouch with a firmer pencil and all the outline blur away by the haze of the previous few day be restore with wonderful distinctness the temperature be hot but not sultry and the air we breathe be a elixir of immortality through a luxuriant olive grove we reach the tomb of the king situate in a small valley to the north of the city part of the valley if not the whole of it have be form by quarry away the crag of marble and conglomerate limestone for build the city near the edge of the low cliff overhang it there be some illustration of the ancient mode of cut stone which as well as the custom of excavate tomb in the rock be evidently borrow from egypt the upper surface of the rock be first make smooth after which the block be map out and cut apart by groove chisel between they i visit four or five tomb each of which have a sort of vestibule or open portico in front the door be low and the chamber which i enter small and black without sculpture of any kind the tomb bear some resemblance in they general plan to those of thebe except that they be without ornament either sculptured or paint there be fragment of sarcophagus in some of they on the southern side of the valley be a large quarry evidently work for marble as the block have be cut out from below leave a large overhang mass part of which have break off and fall down some piece which i pick up be of a very fine white marble somewhat resemble that of carrara the opening of the quarry make a striking picture the soft pink hue of the weather-stained rock contrast exquisitely with the vivid green of the vine festoon the entrance from the long hill beyond the tomb we take we last view of jerusalem far beyond whose wall i see the church of the nativity at bethlehem the jewish synagogue on the top of the mountain call nebbee samwil the highest peak in palestine be visible at some distance to the west notwithstanding its sanctity i feel little regret at leave jerusalem and cheerfully take the rough road northward over the stony hill there be few habitation in sight yet the hill-side be cultivate wherever it be possible for anything to grow the wheat be just come into head and the people be at work plant maize after four hour ' ride we reach el bireh a little village on a hill with the ruin of a convent and a large khan the place take its name from a fountain of excellent water beside which we find we tent already pitch in the evening two englishman a ancient mentor with a wild young telemachus in charge arrive and camp near we the night be calm and cool and the full moon pour a flood of light over the bare and silent hill we rise long before sunrise and ride off in the brilliant morning -- the sky unstained by a speck of vapor in the valley beyond el bireh the husbandman be already at they plough and the village boy be on they way to the uncultured part of the hill with they flock of sheep and goat the valley terminate in a deep gorge with perpendicular wall of rock on either side we road mount the hill on the eastern side and follow the brink of the precipice through the pass where a enchanting landscape open upon we the village of yebrood crown a hill which rise opposite and the mountain slope lean towards it on all side be cover with orchard of fig tree and either rustling with wheat or cleanly plough for maize the soil be a dark brown loam and very rich the stone have be laboriously build into terrace and even where heavy rocky boulder almost hide the soil young fig and olive tree be plant in the crevice between they i have never see more thorough and patient cultivation in the crystal of the morning air the very hill laugh with plenty and the whole landscape beam with the sign of gladness on its countenance the site of ancient bethel be not far to the right of we road over hill laden with the olive fig and vine we pass to ain el-haramiyeh or the fountain of the bobber here there be tomb cut in the rock on both side of the valley over another ridge we descend to a large bowl-shaped valley entirely cover with wheat and open eastward towards the jordan thence to nablous -lrb- the shechem of the old and sychar of the new testament -rrb- be four hour through a wind dell of the richest harvest land on the way we first catch sight of the snowy top of mount hermon distant at least eighty mile in a straight line before reach nablous i stop to drink at a fountain of clear and sweet water beside a square pile of masonry upon which sit two moslem dervish this we be tell be the tomb of joseph whose body after have accompany the israelite in all they wanderings be at last deposit near shechem there be less reason to doubt this spot than most of the sacred place of palestine for the reason that it rest not on christian but on jewish tradition the wonderful tenacity with which the jew cling to every record or memento of they early history and the fact that from the time of joseph a portion of they have always linger near the spot render it highly probable that the locality of a spot so sacred should have be preserve from generation to generation to the present time it have be recently propose to open this tomb by digging under it from the side if the body of joseph be actually deposit here there be no doubt some trace of it remain it must have be embalm accord to the egyptian custom and place in a coffin of the indian sycamore the wood of which be so nearly incorruptible that thirty-five century would not suffice for its decomposition the singular interest of such a discovery would certainly justify the experiment not far from the tomb be jacob 's well where christ meet the woman of samarium this place be also consider as authentic for the same reason if not wholly convince to all there be at least so much probability in they that one be free from that painful coldness and incredulity with which he behold the sacred show of jerusalem leave the tomb of joseph the road turn to the west and enter the narrow pass between mount ebal and gerizim the former be a steep barren peak clothe with terrace of cactus standing on the northern side of the pass mount gerizim be cultivate nearly to the top and be truly a mountain of blessing compare with its neighbor through a orchard of grand old olive-tree we reach nablous which present a charming picture with its long mass of white dome-topped stone house stretch along the foot of gerizim through a sea of bowery orchard the bottom of the valley resemble some old garden run to waste abundant stream pour from the generous heart of the mount of blessing leap and gurgle with pleasant noise through thicket of orange fig and pomegranate through bower of rose and tangled mass of briar and wild vine we halt in a grove of olive and after we tent be pitch walk upward through the orchard to the ras-el-ain -lrb- promontory of the fountain -rrb- on the side of mount gerizim a multitude of beggar sit at the city gate and as they continue to clamor after i have give sufficient alms i pay they with _ allah deelek _ -- -lrb- god give it to you -rrb- -- the moslem 's reply to such importunity -- and they cease in a instant this exclamation it seem take away from they the power of demand a second time from under the ras-el-ain gush forth the fountain of honey so call from the sweetness and purity of the water we drink of it and i find the taste very agreeable but my companion declare that it have a unpleasant woolly flavor when we climb a little higher we find that the true source from which the fountain be supply be above and that a arab be wash a flock of sheep in it we continue we walk along the side of the mountain to the other end of the city through garden of almond apricot prune and walnut-tree bind each to each by great vine whose heavy arm they seem barely able to support the interior of the town be dark and filthy but it have a long busy bazaar extend its whole length and a café where we procure the best coffee in syrium nablous be note for the existence of a small remnant of the ancient samaritan the stock have gradually dwindle away and amount to only forty family contain little more than a hundred and fifty individual they live in a particular quarter of the city and be easily distinguish from the other inhabitant by the cast of they feature after we guide a native of nablous have point out three or four i have no difficulty in recognize all the other we meet they have long but not prominent nose like the jew small oblong eye narrow lip and fair complexion most of they have brown hair they appear to be hold in considerable obloquy by the moslem we attendant who be of the low class of arab take the boy we meet very unceremoniously by the head call out : here be another samaritan he then conduct we to they synagogue to see the celebrated pentateuch which be there preserve we be take to a small open court shaded by a apricot-tree where the priest a old man in a green robe and white turban be seat in meditation he have a long gray beard and black eye that light up with a sudden expression of eager greed when we promise he backsheesh for a sight of the sacred book he arise and take we into a sort of chapel follow by a number of samaritan boy kneel down at a niche in the wall he produce from behind a wooden case a piece of ragged parchment write with hebrew character but the guide be familiar with this deception and rate he so soundly that after a little hesitation he lay the fragment away and produce a large tin cylinder cover with a piece of green satin embroidered in gold the boy stoop down and reverently kiss the blazon cover before it be remove the cylinder slide open by two row of hinge open at the same time the parchment scroll which be roll at both end it be indeed a very ancient manuscript and in remarkable preservation the rent have be carefully repair and the scroll neatly stitch upon another piece of parchment cover on the outside with violet satin the priest inform I that it be write by the son of aaron but this do not coincide with the fact that the samaritan pentateuch be different from that of the jew it be however no doubt one of the oldest parchment record in the world and the samaritan look upon it with unbounded faith and reverence the pentateuch accord to they version contain they only form of religion they reject everything else which the old testament contain three or four day ago be they grand feast of sacrifice when they make a burnt offering of a lamb on the top of mount gerizim within a short time it be say they have show some curiosity to become acquaint with the new testament and the high priest send to jerusalem to procure arabic copy i ask one of the wild-eyed boy whether he could read the sacred book oh yes say the priest all these boy can read it and the one i address immediately pull a volume from he breast and commence reading in fluent hebrew it appear to be a part of they church service for both the priest and _ boab _ or door-keeper keep up a run series of response and occasionally the whole crowd shout out some deep-mouthed word in chorus the old man lean forward with a expression as fix and intense as if the text have become incarnate in he follow with he lip the sound of the boy 's voice it be a strange picture of religious enthusiasm and be of itself sufficient to convince I of the legitimacy of the samaritan 's descent when i rise to leave i give he the promise fee and a smaller one to the boy who read the service this be the signal for a general attack from the door-keeper and all the boy who be present they surround I with eye sparkling with the desire of gain kiss the border of my jacket stroke my beard coaxingly with they hand which they then kiss and crowd up with a boisterous show of affection be about to fall on my neck in a heap after the old hebrew fashion the priest clamorous for more follow with glowing face and the whole group have a riotous and bacchanalian character which i should never have imagine could spring from such a passion as avarice on return to we camp we find mentor and telemachus arrive but not on such friendly term as they greek prototype we be keep awake for a long time that night by they high word and the first sound i hear the next morning come from they tent telemachus i suspect have find some island of calypso and do not relish the cold shock of the plunge into the sea by which mentor have force he away he insist on return to jerusalem but as mentor would not allow he a horse he have not the courage to try it on foot after a series of altercation in which he take a pistol to shoot the dragoman and apply very profane term to everybody in the company he wrath dissolve into tear and when we leave mentor have decide to rest a day at nablous and let he recover from the effect of the storm we ride down the beautiful valley take the road to sebaste -lrb- samarium -rrb- while we luggage-mule keep directly over the mountain to jenin we path at first follow the course of the stream between turfy bank and through luxuriant orchard the whole country we overlook be plant with olive-tree and except the very summit of the mountain cover with grain-field for two hour we course be north-east lead over the hill and now and then dip into beautiful dell in one of these a large stream gush from the earth in a full fountain at the foot of a great olive-tree the hill-side above it be a complete mass of foliage crown with the white wall of a syrian village descend the valley which be very deep we come in sight of samarium situate on the summit of a isolate hill the sanctuary of the ancient christian church of st john tower high above the mud wall of the modern village ride between olive-orchard and wheat-field of glorious richness and beauty we pass the remains of a acqueduct and ascend the hill the ruin of the church occupy the eastern summit part of they have be convert into a mosque which the christian foot be not allow to profane the church which be in the byzantine style be apparently of the time of the crusader it have originally a central and two side-aisle cover with groined gothic vault the sanctuary be semi-circular with a row of small arch support by double pillar the church rest on the foundation of some much more ancient building -- probably a temple belong to the roman city behind the modern village the hill terminate in a long elliptical mound about one-third of a mile in length we make the tour of it and be surprise at find a large number of column each of a single piece of marble they have once form a double colonnade extend from the church to a gate on the western side of the summit we native guide say they have be cover with a arch and constitute a long market or bazaar -- a supposition in which he may be correct from the gate which be still distinctly mark we overlook several deep valley to the west and over they all the blue horizon of the mediterranean south of cæsarea on the northern side of the hill there be upward of twenty more pillar stand besides a number hurl down and the remains of a quadrangular colonnade on the side of the hill below the total number of pillar on the summit can not be less than one hundred from twelve to eighteen foot in height the hill be strew even to its base with large hew block and fragment of sculptured stone the present name of the city be give to it by herod and it must have be at that time a most stately and beautiful place we descend to a valley on the east climb a long ascent and after cross the broad shoulder of a mountain beyond saw below we a landscape even more magnificent than that of nablous it be a great wind valley its bottom rolling in wave of wheat and barley while every hill-side up to the bare rock be mantle with grove of olive the very summit which look into this garden of israel be green with fragrant plant -- wild thyme and sage gnaphalium and camomile away to the west be the sea and in the north-west the mountain chain of carmel we go down to the garden and pasture-land and stop to rest at the village of geba which hang on the side of the mountain a spring of whitish but delicious water gush out of the soil in the midst of a fig orchard the woman pass we go back and forth with tall water-jar on they head some herd-boy bring down a flock of black goat and they be all give drink in a large wooden bowl they be beautiful animal with thick curved horn white eye and ear a foot long it be a truly biblical picture in every feature beyond this valley we pass a circular basin which have no outlet so that in winter the bottom of it must be a lake after wind among the hill a hour more we come out upon the town of jenin a turkish village with a tall white minaret at the head of the great plain of esdraelon it be suppose to be the ancient jezreel where the termagant jezebel be throw out of the window we pitch we tent in a garden near the town under a beautiful mulberry tree and as the place be in very bad repute engage a man to keep guard at night a english family be rob there two or three week ago we guard do he duty well pacing back and forth and occasionally ground he musket to keep up he courage by the sound in the evening françois catch a chameleon a droll-looking little creature which change color in a marvellous manner we road next day lay directly across the plain of esdraelon one of the richest district in the world it be now a green sea cover with field of wheat and barley or great grazing tract on which multitude of sheep and goat be wander in some respects it remind I of the valley of san josé and if i be to liken palestine to any other country i have see it would be californium the climate and succession of the season be the same the soil be very similar in quality and the landscape present the same general feature here in spring the plain be cover with that deluge of floral bloom which make californium seem a paradise here there be the same picturesque grove the same rank field of wild oats clothing the mountain-side the same aromatic herb impregnate the air with balm and above all the same blue cloudless day and dewless night while travel here i be constantly remind of we new syrium on the pacific towards noon mount tabor separated itself from the chain of hill before we and stand out singly at the extremity of the plain we water we horse at a spring in a swamp be some woman be collect beat with stick the rush they have gather to make mat after reach the mountain on the northern side of the plain a ascent of a hour and a-half through a narrow glen bring we to nazareth which be situate in a cul-de-sac under the highest peak of the range as we be pass a rocky part of the road mr harrison 's horse fall with he and severely injure he leg we be fortunately near we destination and on reach the latin convent fra joachim to whose surgical ability the traveller 's book bear witness take he in charge many other besides ourselves have have reason to be thankful for the good office of the latin monk in palestine i have never meet with a class more kind cordial and genial all the convent be bind to take in and entertain all applicant -- of whatever creed or nation -- for the space of three day in the afternoon fra joachim accompany I to the church of the virgin which be inclose within the wall of the convent it be build over the suppose site of the house in which the mother of christ be live at the time of the angelic annunciation under the high altar a flight of step lead down to the shrine of the virgin on the threshold of the house where the angel gabriel 's foot rest as he stand with a lily in he hand announce the miraculous conception the shrine of white marble and gold gleaming in the light of golden lamp stand under a rough arch of the natural rock from the side of which hang a heavy fragment of a granite pillar suspend as the devout believe by divine power fra joachim inform I that when the moslem attempt to obliterate all token of the holy place this pillar be preserve by a miracle that the locality might not be lose to the christian at the same time he say the angel of god carry away the wooden house which stand at the entrance of the grotto and after let it drop in marseille while they rest pick it up again and set it down in loretto where it still remain as he say this there be such entire absolute belief in the good monk 's eye and such happiness in that belief that not for ten time the gold on the shrine would i have express a doubt of the story he then bid I kneel that i might see the spot where the angel stand and devoutly repeat a paternoster while i contemplate the pure plate of snowy marble surround with vase of fragrant flower between which hang cresset of gold wherein perfumed oils be burn all the decoration of the place convey the idea of transcendent purity and sweetness and for the first time in palestine i wish for perfect faith in the spot behind the shrine there be two or three chamber in the rock which serve as habitation for the family of the virgin a young christian nazarene afterwards conduct I to the house of joseph the carpenter which be now inclose in a little chapel it be merely a fragment of wall undoubtedly as old as the time of christ and i feel willing to consider it a genuine relic there be a honest roughness about the large stone inclose a small room call the carpenter 's shop which i could not find it in my heart to doubt besides in a quiet country town like nazareth which have never know such vicissitude as jerusalem much more dependence can be place on popular tradition for the same reason i look with reverence on the table of christ also inclose within a chapel this be a large natural rock about nine foot by twelve nearly square and quite flat on the top it be say that it once serve as a table for christ and he disciple the building call the school of christ where he go with other child of he age be now a church of the syrian christian who be perform a doleful mass in arabic at the time of my visit it be a vaulted apartment about forty foot long and only the lower part of the wall be ancient at each of these place the nazarene put into my hand a piece of pasteboard on which be print a prayer in latin italian and arabic with the information that whoever visit the place and make the prayer would be entitle to seven year ' indulgence i duly read all the prayer and accordingly my conscience ought to be at rest for twenty-one year chapter vii the country of galilee departure from nazareth -- a christian guide -- ascent of mount tabor -- wallachian hermit -- the panorama of

inst my companion have do so well under the care of fra joachim that he be able to ride and we journey be not delay by he accident the benediction of the good franciscan accompany we as we ride away from the convent past the fountain of the virgin and out of the pleasant little valley where the boy jesus wander for many peaceful year the christian guide we engage for mount tabor have go ahead and we do not find he until we have travel for more than two hour among the hill as we approach the sacred mountain we come upon the region of oak -- the first oak i have see since leave europe last autumn there be three or four variety some with evergreen foliage and in they wild luxuriance and the picturesqueness of they form and grouping they resemble those of californium the sea of grass and flower in which they stand be sprinkle with thick tuft of wild oats -- another point of resemblance to the latter country but here there be no gold there no sacred memory the guide be wait for we beside a spring among the tree he be a tall youth of about twenty with a mild submissive face and wear the dark-blue turban which appear to be the badge of a native syrian christian i find myself involuntarily pity he for belong to a despise sect there be no disguise the fact that one feel much more respect for the mussulman ruler of the east than for they oppressed subject who profess he own faith the surest way to make a man contemptible be to treat he contemptuously and the oriental christian who have be despise for century be with some few exception despicable enough now however since the east have become a favorite field of travel and the frank possess a equal dignity with the moslem the native christian be begin to hold up they head and the return of self-respect will in the course of time make they respectable mount tabor stand a little in advance of the hill-country with which it be connect only by a low spur or shoulder its base be the plain of esdraelon this be probably the reason why it have be fix upon as the place of the transfiguration as it be not mention by name in the new testament the word be : a high mountain apart which some suppose to refer to the position of the mountain and not to the remoteness of christ and the three disciple from man the side of the mountain be cover with clump of oak hawthorn and other tree in many place overrun with the white honeysuckle its finger drop with odor of nutmeg and clove the ascent by a steep and wind path occupy a hour the summit be nearly level and resemble some overgrown american field or oak open the grass be more than knee-deep the tree grow high and strong and there be tangled thicket and bower of vine without end the eastern and highest end of the mountain be cover with the remains of a old fortress-convent once a place of great strength from the thickness of its wall in a sort of cell form among the ruin we find two monk-hermit i address they in all language of which i know a salutation without effect but at last make out that they be wallachian they be man of thirty-five with stupid face dirty garment beard run to waste and fur cap they cell be a mere hovel without furniture except a horrid caricature of the virgin and child and four book of prayer in the bulgarian character one of they walk about knit a stock and pay no attention to we but the other after give we some deliciously cold water get upon a pile of rubbish and stand regard we with open mouth while we take breakfast so far from this be a cause of annoyance i feel really glad that we presence have agitate the stagnant water of he mind the day be hazy and sultry but the panoramic view from mount tabor be still very fine the great plain of esdraelon lay below we like a vast mosaic of green and brown -- jasper and verd-antique on the west mount carmel lift he head above the blue horizon line of the mediterranean turn to the other side a strip of the sea of galilee glimmer deep down among the hill and the ghor or the valley of the jordan stretch like a broad gash through they beyond they the country of djebel adjeloun the ancient decapoli which still hold the wall of gadara and the temple and theater of djerash fade away into vapor and still further to the south the desolate hill of gilead the home of jephthah mount hermon be visible when the atmosphere be clear but we be not able to see it from the top of mount tabor to tiberia on the sea of galilee be a journey of five hour through a wild country with but one single miserable village on the road at first we ride through lonely dell grow with oak and brilliant with flower especially the large purple mallow and then over broad treeless tract of rolling land but partially cultivate the heat be very great i have no thermometer but should judge the temperature to have be at least 95 ° in the shade from the edge of the upland tract we look down on the sea of galilee -- a beautiful sheet of water sink among the mountain and more than 300 foot below the level of the mediterranean it lay unruffled in the bottom of the basin reflect the peak of the bare red mountain beyond it tiberia be at we very foot a few palm tree alone relieve the nakedness of its dull wall after take a welcome drink at the fountain of fig-tree we descend to the town which have a desolate and forlorn air its wall have be partly throw down by earthquake and never repair we find we tent already pitch on the bank above the lake and under one of the totter tower not a breath of air be stir the red hill smoulder in the heat and the water of genesareth at we foot glimmer with a oily smoothness unbroken by a ripple we untwist we turban kick off we baggy trowser and speedily release ourselves from the barbarous restraint of dress dip into the tepid sea and float lazily out until we could feel the exquisite coldness of the living spring which send up they jet from the bottom i be lie on my back move my fin just sufficiently to keep afloat and gaze dreamily through half-closed eye on the forlorn palm of tiberia when a shrill voice hail I with : o howadjus get out of we way there at the old stone gateway below we tent stand two galilean damsel with heavy earthen jar upon they head go away yourselve o maiden i answer if you want we to come out of the water but we must fill we pitcher one of they reply then fill they at once and be not afraid or leave they and we will fill they for you thereupon they put the pitcher down but remain watch we very complacently while we sink the vessel to the bottom of the lake and let they fill from the colder and purer tide of the spring in bring they back through the water to the gate the one i propel before I happen to strike against a stone and its fair owner on receive it immediately point to a crack in the side which she declare i have make and go off lament after we have resume we garment and be enjoy the pipe of indolence and the coffee of contentment she return and make such a outcry that i be fain to purchase peace by the price of a new pitcher i pass the first hour of-the night in look out of my tent-door as i lay on the star sparkling in the bosom of galilee like the sheen of assyrian spear and the glare of the great fire kindle on the opposite shore the next day we travel northward along the lake pass through continuous thicket of oleander fragrant with its heavy pink blossom the thistle be more abundant and beautiful than ever i notice in particular one with a superb globular flower of a bright blue color which would make a choice ornament for we garden at home at the north-western head of the lake the mountain fall back and leave a large tract of the richest meadow-land which narrow away into a deep dell overhung by high mountain headland face with naked cliff of red rock the feature of the landscape be magnificent up the dell i see plainly the mount of beatitude beyond which lie the village of cana of galilee in come up the meadow we pass a miserable little village of thatched mud hut almost hide by the rank weed which grow around they a withered old crone sit at one of the door sun herself what be the name of this village i ask it be mejdel be she reply this be the ancient magdalum the home of that beautiful but sinful magdalene whose repentance have make she one of the brightest of the saint the crystal water of the lake here lave a shore of the cleanest pebble the path go wind through oleander nebbuk patch of hollyhock anise-seed fennel and other spicy plant while on the west great field of barley stand ripe for the cut in some place the fellah man and woman be at work reap and bind the sheaf after cross this tract we come to the hill at the foot of which be a ruin khan and on the summit other undistinguishable ruin suppose by some to be those of capernaum the site of that exalted town however be still a matter of discussion we journey on in a most sweltering atmosphere over the ascend hill the valley of the upper jordan lie deep on we right in a shallow hollow under one of the highest peak there stand a large desert khan over a well of very cold sweet water call _ bir youssuf _ by the arab somewhere near it accord to tradition be the field where joseph be sell by he brethren and the well be no doubt look upon by many as the identical pit into which he be throw a stately turk of damascus with four servant behind he come ride up as we be rest in the gateway of the khan and in answer to my question inform I that the well be so name from nebbee youssuf -lrb- the prophet joseph -rrb- and not from sultan joseph saladin he take we for he countryman accost I first in turkish and even after i have talk with he some time in bad arabic ask I whether i have be make a pilgrimage to the tomb of certain holy moslem saint in the neighborhood of jaffa he join company with we however and share he pipe with I as we continue we journey we ride for two hour more over hill bare of tree but cover thick with grass and herb and finally lose we way françois go ahead dash through the field of barley and lentil and we reach the path again as the water of merom come in sight we then descend into the valley of the upper jordan and encamped opposite the lake at ain el-mellaha -lrb- the fountain of the salt-works -rrb- the first source of the sacred river a stream of water sufficient to turn half-a-dozen mill gush and gurgle up at the foot of the mountain there be the remains of a ancient dam by which a large pool be form for the irrigation of the valley it still supply a little arab mill below the fountain this be a frontier post between the jurisdiction of the pasha of jerusalem and damascus and the _ mukkairee _ of the greek caloyer who leave we at tiberia be oblige to pay a duty of seven and a half piastre on fifteen mat which he have buy at jerusalem for one and a half piastre each the poor man will perhaps make a dozen piastre -lrb- about half a dollar -rrb- on these mat at damascus after carry they on he mule for more than two hundred mile we pitch we tent on the grassy meadow below the mill -- a charming spot with tell el-khanzir -lrb- the hill of wild boar -rrb- just in front over the water of merom and the snow-streaked summit of djebel esh-shekh -- the great mount hermon -- tower high above the valley this be the loftiest peak of the anti-lebanon and be 10000 foot above the sea the next morning we ride for three hour before reach the second spring of the jordan at a place which françois call tell el-kadus but which do not at all answer with the description give I by dr robinson at jerusalem the upper part of the broad valley whence the jordan draw he water be flat moist and but little cultivate there be immense herd of sheep goat and buffalo wander over it the people be a dark arab tribe and live in tent and miserable clay hut where the valley begin to slope upward towards the hill they plant wheat barley and lentil the soil be the fattest brown loam and the harvest be wonderfully rich i see many tract of wheat from half a mile to a mile in extent which would average forty bushel to the acre yet the ground be never manure and the arab plough scratch up but a few inch of the surface what a paradise might be make of this country be it in better hand the second spring be not quite so large as ain el-mellaha but like it pour out a strong stream from a single source the pool be fill with woman wash the heavy fleece of they sheep and beat the dirt out of they striped camel 's hair aba with long pole we leave it and enter on a slope of stony ground form the head of the valley the view extend southward to the mountain close the northern cove of the sea of galilee it be a grand rich landscape -- so rich that its desolation seem force and unnatural high on the summit of a mountain to the west the ruin of a large crusader fortress look down upon we the soil which slowly climb upward through a long valley between lebanon and anti-lebanon be cut with deep ravine the path be very difficult to find and while we be ride forward at random look in all direction for we baggage mule we start up a beautiful gazelle at last about noon hot hungry and thirsty we reach a swift stream roaring at the bottom of a deep ravine through a bed of gorgeous foliage the odor of the wild grape-blossom which come up to we as we ride along the edge be overpower in its sweetness a old bridge of two arch cross the stream there be a pile of rock against the central pier and there we sit and take breakfast in the shade of the maple while the cold green water foam at we foot by all the naiad and triton what a joy there be in behold a run stream the river of lebanon be miracle to I after my knowledge of the desert a company of arab seven in all be gather under the bridge and from a flute which one of they blow i judge they be take a pastoral holiday we keep we pistol beside we for we do not like they look before leave they tell we that the country be full of robber and advise we to be on the lookout we ride more carefully after this and keep with we baggage on reach it a hour after leave the bridge we come to a large circular or rather annular mound overgrow with knee-deep grass and clump of oak-tree a large stream of a bright blue color gush down the north side and after half embrace the mound sweep off across the meadow to the water of merom there could be no doubt that this be tell el-kadus the site of dan the most northern town of ancient israel the mound on which it be build be the crater of a extinct volcano the hebrew word _ dan _ signify judge and tell el-kadus in arabic be the hill of the judge the anti-lebanon now rise near we its northern and western slope green with tree and grass the first range perhaps 5000 foot in height shut out the snowy head of hermon but still the view be sublime in its large and harmonious outline we road be through a country resemble arcadium -- the earth hide by a dense bed of grass and flower thicket of blossom shrub old old oak with the most gnarled of trunk the most picturesque of bough and the glossiest of green leaf olive-tree of amazing antiquity and threading and enliven all the clear-cold flood of lebanon this be the true haunt of pan whose altar be now before I grave on the marble crag of hermon look on those altar and on the landscape lovely as a grecian dream i forget that the lament have long be sing : pan pan be dead in another hour we reach this place the ancient cæsarea philippus now a poor village embower in magnificent tree and wash by glorious water there be abundant remains of the old city : fragment of immense wall break granite column trace of pavement great block of hew stone marble pedestal and the like in the rock at the foot of the mountain there be several elegant niche with greek inscription besides a large natural grotto below they the water gush up through the stone in a hundred stream form a flood of considerable size we have make we camp in a olive grove near the end of the village beside a immense terebinth tree which be inclose in a open court pave with stone this be the town-hall of bania where the shekh dispense justice and at the same time the resort of all the idler of the place we go up among they soon after we arrival and be give seat of honor near the shekh who talk with I a long time about america the people exhibit a very sensible curiosity desire to know the extent of we country the number of inhabitant the amount of taxation the price of grain and other solid information the shekh and the man of the place inform we that the drus be infest the road to damascus this tribe be in rebellion in djebel hauaran on account of the conscription and some of they it appear have take refuge in the fastness of hermon where they be begin to plunder traveller while i be talk with the shekh a druse come down from the mountain and sit for half a hour among the villager under the terebinth and we have just hear that he have go back the way he come this fact have give we some anxiety as he may have be a spy send down to gather news and if so we be almost certain to be waylay if we be well arm we should not fear a dozen but all we weapon consist of a sword and four pistol after consult together we decide to apply to the shekh for two armed man to accompany we i accordingly go to he again and exhibit the firman of the pasha of jerusalem which he read state that even without it he would have feel it he duty to grant we request this be the graceful way in which the oriental submit to a peremptory order he think that one man will be sufficient as we shall probably not meet with any large party the day have be and still be excessively hot the atmosphere be swelter and all around we over the thick patch of mallow and wild mustard the bee be hum with a continuous sultry sound the shekh with a number of lazy villager be still seat under the terebinth in a tent of shade impervious to the sun i can hear the rush of the fountain of bania -- the holy spring of hermon whence jordan be bear but what be this the odor of the velvety weed of shiraz meet my nostril a dark-eyed son of pan place the narghileh at my foot and bubble more sweetly than the stream of jordan the incense most dear to the god dim the crystal censer and float from my lip in rhythmic ejaculation i too be in arcadium chapter viii cross the anti-lebanon the harmless guard -- cæsarea philippus -- the valley of the drus -- the side of mount hermon -- a alarm -- thread a defile -- distant view of djebel hauaran -- another alarm -- camp at katana -- we ride into damascus damascus _ may _ 12 1852 we rise early so as to be ready for a long march the guard come -- a mild-looking arab -- without arm but on we refuse to take he thus he bring a turkish musket terrible to behold but quite guiltless of any murderous intent we give ourselves up to fate with true arab-resignation and begin ascend the anti-lebanon up and up by stony path under the oak beside the stream and between the wheat-field we climb for two hour and at last reach a comb or divide ridge whence we could look into a valley on the other side or rather inclose between the main chain and the offshoot name djebel heish which stretch away towards the south-east about half-way up the ascent we pass the ruin acropoli of cæsarea philippus crowning the summit of a lower peak the wall and bastion cover a great extent of ground and be evidently use as a stronghold in the middle age the valley into which we descend lay directly under one of the peak of hermon and the rill that water it be feed from he snow-field it be inhabit by drus but no man be to be see except a few poor husbandman plough on the mountain-side the woman wear those enormous horn on they head which distinguish they from the mohammedan female be wash at a pool below we cross the valley and slowly ascend the height on the opposite side take care to keep with the baggage-mule up to this time we meet very few person and we forget the anticipated peril in contemplate the rugged scenery of the anti-lebanon the mountain-side be brilliant with flower and many new and beautiful specimen arrest we attention the asphodel grow in bunch beside the stream and the large scarlet anemone outshone even the poppy whose color here be the quintessence of flame five hour after leave bania we reach the highest part of the pass -- a dreary volcanic region cover with fragment of lava just at this place a old arab meet we and after scan we closely stop and accost dervish the latter immediately come run ahead quite excite with the news that the old man have see a company of about fifty drus descend from the side of mount hermon towards the road we be to travel we immediately order the baggage to halt and mr harrison françois and myself ride on to reconnoitre we guard the valiant man of bania whose tooth already chatter with fear prudently keep with the baggage we cross the ridge and watch the stony mountain-side for some time but no spear or glitter gun-barrel could we see the caravan be then set in motion and we have not proceed far before we meet a second company of arab who inform we that the road be free leave the height we descend cautiously into a ravine with wall of rough volcanic rock on each side it be a pass where three man might have stand they ground against a hundred and we do not feel thoroughly convince of we safety till we have thread its many winding and emerge upon a narrow valley a village call beit jenn nestle under the rock and below it a grove of poplar-tree shaded the bank of a rapid stream we have now fairly cross the anti-lebanon the dazzling snow of mount hermon overhang we on the west and from the opening of the valley we look across a wild waste country to the distant range of djebel hauaran the seat of the present rebellion and one of the most interesting region of syrium i regret more than ever not be able to reach it the ruin of bozrah ezra and other ancient city would well repay the arduous character of the journey while the traveller might succeed in get some insight into the life and habit of that singular people the drus but now and perhaps for some time to come there be no chance of enter the hauaran towards the middle of the afternoon we reach a large village which be usually the end of the first day 's journey from banias we man want to stop here but we consider that to halt then would be to increase the risk and decide to push on to katana four hour ' journey from damascus they yield with a bad grace and we jog on over the stony road cross the long hill which form the eastern base of the anti-lebanon before long another arab meet we with the news that there be a encampment of drus on the plain between we and katana at this we guard who have recover sufficient spirit to ride a few pace in advance fall back and the impassive dervish become greatly agitate where there be a uncertain danger it be always better to go ahead than to turn back and we do so but the guard rein up on the top of the first ridge tremble as he point to a distant hill and cry out : _ ahò ahò henàk _ -lrb- there they be -rrb- there be in fact the shadow of some rock which bear a faint resemblance to tent before sunset we reach the last declivity of the mountain and see far in the dusky plain the long green belt of the garden of damascus and here and there the indistinct glimmer of a minaret katana we resting-place for the night lay below we bury in orchard of olive and orange we pitch we tent on the bank of a beautiful stream enjoy the pipe of tranquillity after we long march and soon forget the drus in a slumber that last unbroken till dawn in the morning we send back the man of bania leave the baggage to take care of itself and ride on to damascus as fast as we tired horse could carry we the plain at first barren and stony become enliven with vineyard and field of wheat as we advance arab be everywhere at work ploughing and direct the water-course the belt of live green the bower in which the great city the queen of the orient hide she beauty draw nearer and nearer stretch out a crescent of foliage for mile on either hand that gradually narrow and receive we into its cool and fragrant heart we sink into a sea of olive pomegranate orange plum apricot walnut and plane tree and be lose the sun sparkle in the roll surface above but we swim through the green depths below he reach and thus drift on through mile of shade enter the city since we arrival i find that two other party of traveller one of which cross the anti-lebanon on the northern side of mount hermon be oblige to take guard and see several druse spy post on the height as they pass a russian gentleman travel from here to tiberia be stop three time on the road and only escape be plunder from the fact of he have a druse dragoman the disturbance be more serious than i have anticipate four regiment leave here yesterday send to the aid of a company of cavalry which be surround by the rebel in a valley of dejebel hauaran and unable to get out chapter ix picture of damascus damascus from the anti-lebanon -- enter the city -- a diorama of bazaar -- a oriental hotel -- we chamber -- the bazaar -- pipe and coffee -- the river of damascus -- palace of the jew -- jewish lady -- a christian gentleman -- the sacred locality -- damascus blade -- the sword of haroun al-raschid -- a arrival from palmyra be not abana and pharpar river of damascus better than all the water of israel -- 2 king v 12 damascus _ Wednesday may _ 19 1852 damascus be consider by many traveller as the best remain type of a oriental city constantinople be semi-european cairo be fast become so but damascus away from the highway of commerce seat alone between the lebanon and the syrian desert still retain in its outward aspect and in the character of its inhabitant all the pride and fancy and fanaticism of the time of the caliph with this judgment in general term i agree but not to its ascendancy in every respect over cairo true when you behold damascus from the salahiyeh the last slope of the anti-lebanon it be the realization of all that you have dream of oriental splendor the world have no picture more dazzling it be beauty carry to the sublime as i have feel when overlook some boundless forest of palm within the tropics from the hill whose ridge heave behind you until in the south they rise to the snowy head of mount hermon the great syrian plain stretch away to the euphrate break at distance of ten and fifteen mile by two detach mountain chain in a terrible gorge at you side the river barrada the ancient pharpar force its way to the plain and its water divide into twelve different channel make all between you and those blue island-hill of the desert one great garden the boundary of which you vision can barely distinguish its longest diameter can not be less than twenty mile you look down on a world of foliage and fruit and blossom whose hue by contrast with the barren mountain and the yellow rim of the desert which inclose it seem brighter than all other garden in the world through its center follow the course of the river lie damascus a line of white wall top with dome and tower and tall minaret wind away for mile through the green sea nothing less than a city of palace whose wall be marble and whose door be ivory and pearl could keep up the enchantment of that distant view we ride for a hour through the garden before enter the gate the fruit-tree of whatever variety -- walnut olive apricot or fig -- be the noblest of they kind rose and pomegranate in bloom star the dark foliage and the scented jasmine overhang the wall but as we approach the city the view be obscure by high mud wall on either side of the road and we only catch glimpse now and then of the fragrant wilderness the first street we enter be low and mean the house of clay follow this we come to a uncovered bazaar with rude shop on either side protect by mat stretch in front and support by pole here all sort of common stun and utensil be sell and the street be fill with crowd of fellah and desert arab two large sycamore shaded it and the seraglio of the pasha of damascus a plain two-story building face the entrance of the main bazaar which branch off into the city we turn into this and after pass through several small bazaar stock with dry fruit pipe and pipe-bowl grocery and all the primitive wares of the east reach a large passage cover with a steep wooden roof and entirely occupy by vender of silk stuff out of this we pass through another devote to saddle and bridle then another full of spice and at last reach the grand bazaar where all the richest stuff of europe and the east be display in the shop we ride slowly along through the cool twilight cross here and there by long pencil of white light fall through aperture in the roof and illuminate the gay turban and silk caftan of the lazy merchant but out of this bazaar at interval open the grand gate of a khan give we a view of its marble court its fountain and the dark arch of its storeroom or the door of a mosque with its mosaic floor and pillared corridor the interminable line of bazaar with they atmosphere of spice and fruit and fragrant tobacco the hushed tread of the slippered crowd the plash of fall fountain and the bubbling of innumerable narghileh the picturesque merchant and they customer no longer in the big trowser of egypt but the long caftan and aba of syrium the absence of frank face and dress -- in all these there be the true spirit of the orient and so far we be charm with damascus at the hotel in the soog el-haràb or frank quarter the illusion be not dissipate it have once be the house of some rich merchant the court into which we be usher be pave with marble with a great stone basin surround with vase of flowering plant in the center two large lemon tree shade the entrance and a vine climb to the top of the house make a leafy arbor over the flat roof the wall of the house be paint in horizontal bar of blue white orange and white -- a gay grotesqueness of style which do not offend the eye under a eastern sun on the southern side of the court be the _ liwan _ a arrangement for which the house of damascus be note it be a vaulted apartment twenty foot high entirely open towards the court except a fine pointed arch at the top decorate with encaustic ornament of the most brilliant color in front a tesselated pavement of marble lead to the door of the chamber on each side beyond this be a raise floor cover with matting and along the farther end a divan whose pile cushion be the most tempting trap ever set to catch a lazy man although not naturally indolent i find it impossible to resist the fascination of this lounge lean back cross-legged against the cushion with the inseparable pipe in one 's hand the view of the court the water-basin the flower and lemon tree the servant and dragoman go back and forth or smoke they narghileh in the shade -- all frame in the beautiful arched entrance be so perfectly oriental so true a tableau from the time of good old haroun al-raschid that one be surprise to find how many hour have slip away while he have be silently enjoy it opposite the _ liwan _ be a large room pave with marble with a handsome fountain in the center it be the finest in the hotel and now occupy by lord dalkeith and he friend we own room be on the upper floor and be so rich in decoration that i have not yet finish the study of they along the side look down on the court we have a mosaic floor of white red black and yellow marble above this be raise a second floor carpet and furnish in european style the wall for a height of ten foot be cover with wooden panelling paint with arabesque device in the gayest color and along the top there be a series of arabic inscription in gold there be a number of niche or open closet in the wall whose arched top be adorn with pendent wooden ornament resemble stalactite and at the corner of the room the heavy gilded and painted cornice drop into similar grotesque incrustation a space of bare white wall intervene between this cornice and the ceiling which be form of slim poplar log lay side by side and so cover with paint and with scale and stripe and network device in gold and silver that one would take they to be clothe with the skin of the magic serpent that guard the valley of diamond my most satisfactory remembrance of damascus will be this room my walk through the city have be almost wholly confine to the bazaar which be of immense extent one can walk for many mile without go beyond the cover of they peaked wooden roof and in all this round will find no two precisely alike one be devoted entirely to soap another to tobacco through which you cough and sneeze you way to the bazaar of spice and delightedly inhale its perfumed air then there be the bazaar of sweetmeat of vegetable of red slipper of shawl of caftan of baker and oven of wooden ware of jewelry -- a great stone building cover with vaulted passage of aleppo silk of baghdad carpet of indian stuff of coffee and so on through a seemingly endless variety as i have already remark along the line of the bazaar be many khan the resort of merchant from all part of turkey and persium and even indium they be large stately building and some of they have superb gateway of sculptured marble the interior court be pave with stone with fountain in the center and many of they be cover with dome rest on massive pillar the largest have a roof of nine dome support by four grand pillar which inclose a fountain the mosque into which no christian be allow to enter be in general inferior to those of cairo but they outer court be always pave with marble adorn with fountain and surround by light and elegant corridor the grand mosque be a impose edifice and be say to occupy the site of a former christian church another pleasant feature of the city be its coffee shop which abound in the bazaar and on the outskirts of the garden beside the run stream those in the bazaar be spacious room with vaulted ceiling divan run around the four wall and fountain in the center during the afternoon they be nearly always fill with turk armenian and persian smoke the narghileh or water-pipe which be the universal custom in damascus the persian tobacco bring here by the caravan from baghdad be renown for this kind of smoke the most popular coffee-shop be near the citadel on the bank and over the surface of the pharpar it be a rough wooden building with a roof of straw mat but the sight and sound of the rush water as they shoot away with arrowy swiftness under you foot the shade of the tree that line the bank and the cool breeze that always visit the spot beguile you into a second pipe ere you be aware _ el mà wa el khòdra wa el widj el hassàn _ -- water verdure and a beautiful face say a old arab proverb be three thing which delight the heart and the syrian avow that all three be to be find in damascus not only on the three sunday of each week but every day in the garden about the city you may see whole family -lrb- and if jew or christian many group of family -rrb- spend the day in the shade beside the beautiful water there be several garden fit up purposely for these picnic with kiosk fountain and pleasant seat under the tree you bring you pipe you provision and the like with you but servant be in attendance to furnish fire and water and coffee for which on leave you give they a small gratuity of all the damascene i have yet see there be not one but declare he city to be the garden of the world the pearl of the orient and thanks god and the prophet for have permit he to be bear and to live in it but except the bazaar the khan and the bath of which there be several most luxurious establishment the city itself be neither so rich nor so purely saracenic in its architecture as cairo the street be narrow and dirty and the house which be never more than two low story in height be build of sun-dried brick coat with plaster i miss the solid pile of stone the elegant doorway and above all the exquisite hanging balcony of carve wood which meet one in the old street of cairo damascus be the representative of all that be gay brilliant and picturesque in oriental life but for stately magnificence cairo and i suspect baghdad be its superior we visit the other day the house of some of the richest jew and christian old abou-ibrahim the jewish servant of the hotel accompany and introduce we it be customary for traveller to make these visit and the family far from be annoy be flatter by it the exterior of the house be mean but after thread a narrow passage we emerge into a court rivalling in profusion of ornament and rich contrast of color one 's early idea of the palace of aladdin the floor and fountain be all of marble mosaic the arch of the _ liwan _ glitter with gold and the wall bewilder the eye with the intricacy of they adornment in the first house we be receive by the family in a room of precious marble with niche in the wall resemble grotto of silver stalactite the cushion of the divan be of the richest silk and a chandelier of bohemian crystal hang from the ceiling silver narghileh be bring to we and coffee be serve in heavy silver _ zerf _ the lady of the house be a rather corpulent lady of about thirty-five and wear a semi-european robe of embroidered silk and lace with full trowser gather at the ankle and yellow slipper she black hair be braid and fasten at the end with golden ornament and the light scarf twist around she head blaze with diamond the lid of she large eye be stain with _ kohl _ and she eyebrow be pluck out and shave away so as to leave only a thin arched line as if draw with a pencil above each eye she daughter a girl of fifteen who bear the genuine hebrew name of rachel have even bigger and blacker eye than she mother but she forehead be low she mouth large and the expression of she face exceedingly stupid the father of the family be a middle-aged man with a well-bred air and talk with a oriental politeness which be very refreshing a english lady who be of we party say to he through I that if she possess such a house she should be willing to remain in damascus why do she leave then he immediately answer : this be she house and everything that be in it speak of visit jerusalem he ask I whether it be not a more beautiful city than damascus it be not more beautiful i say but it be more holy a expression which the whole company receive with great satisfaction the second house we visit be even larger and richer than the first but have a air of neglect and decay the slab of rich marble be loose and broken about the edge of the fountain the rich painting of the wood-work be begin to fade and the balustrade lead to the upper chamber be break off in place we be usher into a room the wall and ceiling of which be compose entirely of gilded arabesque frame-work set with small mirror when new it must have have a gorgeous effect but the gold be now tarnish and the glass dim the mistress of the house be seat on the cushion divide she time between she pipe and she needle-work she merely make a slight inclination of she head as we enter and go on with she occupation presently she two daughter and a abyssinian slave appear and take they place on the cushion at she foot the whole form a charming group which i regret some of my artist friend at home could not see the mistress be so exceedingly dignified that she bestow but few word on we she seem to resent we admiration of the slave who be a most graceful creature yet she jealousy it afterwards appear have reference to she own husband for we have scarcely leave when a servant follow to inform the english lady that if she be willing to buy the abyssinian the mistress would sell she at once for two thousand piastre the last visit we pay be to the dwelling of a maronite the richest christian in damascus the house resemble those we have already see except that have be recently build it be in better condition and exhibit better taste in the ornament no one but the lady be allow to enter the female apartment the rest of we be entertain by the proprietor a man of fifty and without exception the handsomest and most dignified person of that age i have ever see he be a king without a throne and fascinate I completely by the noble elegance of he manner in any country but the orient i should have pronounce he incapable of a unworthy thought : here he may be exactly the reverse although damascus be consider the oldest city in the world the date of its foundation go beyond tradition there be very few relic of antiquity in or near it in the bazaar be three large pillar support half the pediment which be say to have belong to the christian church of st john but if so that church must have be originally a roman temple part of the roman wall and one of the city gate remain and we see the spot where accord to tradition saul be let down from the wall in a basket there be two locality point out as the scene of he conversion which from he own account occur near the city i visit a subterranean chapel claim by the latin monk to be the cellar of the house of anania in which the apostle be conceal the cellar be undoubtedly of great antiquity but as the whole quarter be for many century inhabit wholly by turk it would be curious to know how the monk ascertain which be the house of anania as for the street call straight it would be difficult at present to find any in damascus correspond to that epithet the famous damascus blade so renowned in the time of the crusader be make here no longer the art have be lose for three or four century yet genuine old sword of the true steel be occasionally to be find they be readily distinguish from modern imitation by they clear and silvery ring when strike and by the finely water appearance of the blade produce by its have be first make of weave wire and then work over and over again until it attain the requisite temper a droll turk who be the _ shekh ed-dellàl _ or chief of the auctioneer and be nickname abou-anteeka -lrb- the father of the antique -rrb- have a large collection of sabre dagger piece of mail shield pipe ring seal and other ancient article he demand enormous price but generally take about one-third of what he first ask i have spend several hour in he curiosity shop bargaining for turquoise ring carbuncle persian amulet and circassian dagger while look over some old sword the other day i notice one of exquisite temper but with a shorter blade than usual the point have apparently be snap off in fight but owe to the excellence of the sword or the owner 's affection for it the steel have be carefully shape into a new point abou-anteeka ask five hundred piastre and i who have take a particular fancy to possess it offer he two hundred in a indifferent way and then lay it aside to examine other article after he refusal to accept my offer i say nothing more and be leave the shop when the old fellow call I back say : you have forget you sword -- which i thereupon take at my own price i have show it to mr wood the british consul who pronounce it a extremely fine specimen of damascus steel and on read the inscription enamel upon the blade ascertain that it be make in the year of the hegira 181 which correspond to ad 798 this be during the caliphate of haroun al-raschid and who know but the sword may have once flash in the presence of that great and glorious sovereign -- nay be draw by he own hand who know but that the milan armor of the crusader may have shiver its point on the field of askalon i kiss the vein azure of thy blade o sword of haroun i hang the crimson cord of thy scabbard upon my shoulder and thou shalt henceforth clank in silver music at my side singing to my ear and mine alone thy chant of battle thy rejoice song of slaughter yesterday evening three gentleman of lord dalkeith 's party arrive from a trip to palmyra the road thither lie through a part of the syrian desert belong to the aneyzeh tribe who be now suppose to be in league with the drus against the government include this party only six person have succeed in reach palmyra within a year and two of they messr noel and cathcart be imprison four day by the arab and only escape by the accidental departure of a caravan for damascus the present party be oblige to travel almost wholly by night run the gauntlet of a dozen arab encampment and be only allow a day 's stay at palmyra they be all disguise as bedouin and take nothing with they but the necessary provision they make they appearance here last evening in long white aba with the bedouin _ keffie _ bind over they head they face burn they eye inflamed and they frame feverish with seven day and night of travel the shekh who conduct they be not a aneyzeh and would have lose he life have they fall in with any of that tribe chapter x the vision of hasheesh exult tremble rage faint possess beyond the muse 's painting collin during my stay in damascus that insatiable curiosity which lead I to prefer the acquisition of all lawful knowledge through the channel of my own personal experience rather than in less satisfactory and less laborious way induce I to make a trial of the celebrated _ hasheesh _ -- that remarkable drug which supply the luxurious syrian with dream more alluring and more gorgeous than the chinese extract from he darling opium pipe the use of hasheesh -- which be a preparation of the dry leaf of the _ cannabis indica _ -- have be familiar to the east for many century during the crusade it be frequently use by the saracen warrior to stimulate they to the work of slaughter and from the arabic term of _ hashasheën _ or eater of hasheesh as apply to they the word assassin have be naturally derive a infusion of the same plant give to the drink call _ bhang _ which be in common use throughout indium and malaysium its peculiar property thus prepare it be a more fierce and fatal stimulant than the paste of sugar and spice to which the turk resort as the food of he voluptuous evening reverie while its immediate effect seem to be more potent than those of opium its habitual use though attend with ultimate and permanent injury to the system rarely result in such utter wreck of mind and body as that to which the votary of the latter drug inevitably condemn themselves a previous experience of the effect of hasheesh -- which i take once and in a very mild form while in egypt -- be so peculiar in its character that my curiosity instead of be satisfy only prompt I the more to throw myself for once wholly under its influence the sensation it then produce be those physically of exquisite lightness and airiness -- of a wonderfully keen perception of the ludicrous in the most simple and familiar object during the half hour in which it last i be at no time so far under its control that i could not with the clearest perception study the change through which i pass i note with careful attention the fine sensation which spread throughout the whole tissue of my nervous fiber each thrill help to divest my frame of its earthy and material nature until my substance appear to I no grosser than the vapor of the atmosphere and while sit in the calm of the egyptian twilight i expect to be lift up and carry away by the first breeze that should ruffle the nile while this process be go on the object by which i be surround assume a strange and whimsical expression my pipe the oar which my boatman ply the turban worn by the captain the water-jar and culinary implement become in themselves so inexpressibly absurd and comical that i be provoke into a long fit of laughter the hallucination die away as gradually as it come leave I overcome with a soft and pleasant drowsiness from which i sink into a deep refreshing sleep my companion and a english gentleman who with he wife be also reside in antonio 's pleasant caravanserai -- agree to join I in the experiment the dragoman of the latter be depute to procure a sufficient quantity of the drug he be a dark egyptian speaking only the _ lingua franca _ of the east and ask I as he take the money and depart on he mission whether he should get hasheesh _ per ridere a per dormire _ oh _ per ridere _ of course i answer and see that it be strong and fresh it be customary with the syrian to take a small portion immediately before the evening meal as it be thus diffuse through the stomach and act more gradually as well as more gently upon the system as we dinner-hour be at sunset i propose take hasheesh at that time but my friend fear that its operation might be more speedy upon fresh subject and thus betray they into some absurdity in the presence of the other traveller prefer wait until after the meal it be then agree that we should retire to we room which as it rise like a tower one story higher than the rest of the building be in a manner isolate and would screen we from observation we commence by take a tea-spoonful each of the mixture which abdallah have procure this be about the quantity i have take in egypt and as the effect then have be so slight i judge that we run no risk of take a over-dose the strength of the drug however must have be far greater in this instance for whereas i could in the former case distinguish no flavor but that of sugar and rise leave i now find the taste intensely bitter and repulsive to the palate we allow the paste to dissolve slowly on we tongue and sit some time quietly wait the result but have be take upon a full stomach its operation be hinder and after the lapse of nearly a hour we could not detect the least change in we feeling my friend loudly express they conviction of the humbug of hasheesh but i unwilling to give up the experiment at this point propose that we should take a additional half spoonful and follow it with a cup of hot tea which if there be really any virtue in the preparation could not fail to call it into action this be do though not without some misgiving as we be all ignorant of the precise quantity which constitute a dose and the limit within which the drug could be take with safety it be now ten o'clock the street of damascus be gradually become silent and the fair city be bath in the yellow lustre of the syrian moon only in the marble court-yard below we a few dragoman and _ mukkairee _ linger under the lemon-tree and beside the fountain in the center i be seat alone nearly in the middle of the room talk with my friend who be lounge upon a sofa place in a sort of alcove at the farther end when the same fine nervous thrill of which i have speak suddenly shoot through I but this time it be accompany with a burning sensation at the pit of the stomach and instead of grow upon I with the gradual pace of healthy slumber and resolve I as before into air it come with the intensity of a pang and shot throb along the nerve to the extremity of my body the sense of limitation -- of the confinement of we sens within the bound of we own flesh and blood -- instantly fall away the wall of my frame be burst outward and tumble into ruin and without think what form i wear -- lose sight even of all idea of form -- i feel that i exist throughout a vast extent of space the blood pulsed from my heart speed through uncounted league before it reach my extremity the air draw into my lung expand into sea of limpid ether and the arch of my skull be broader than the vault of heaven within the concave that hold my brain be the fathomless deep of blue cloud float there and the wind of heaven roll they together and there shine the orb of the sun it be -- though i think not of that at the time -- like a revelation of the mystery of omnipresence it be difficult to describe this sensation or the rapidity with which it master I in the state of mental exaltation in which i be then plunge all sensation as they rise suggest more or less coherent image they present themselves to I in a double form : one physical and therefore to a certain extent tangible the other spiritual and revealing itself in a succession of splendid metaphor the physical feeling of extend being be accompany by the image of a explode meteor not subside into darkness but continue to shoot from its center or nucleus -- which correspond to the burning spot at the pit of my stomach -- incessant adumbration of light that finally lose themselves in the infinity of space to my mind even now this image be still the best illustration of my sensation as i recall they but i greatly doubt whether the reader will find it equally clear my curiosity be now in a way of be satisfy the spirit -lrb- demon shall i not rather say -rrb- of hasheesh have entire possession of I i be cast upon the flood of he illusion and drift helplessly whithersoever they might choose to bear I the thrill which run through my nervous system become more rapid and fierce accompany with sensation that steep my whole be in unutterable rapture i be encompass by a sea of light through which play the pure harmonious color that be bear of light while endeavor in broken expression to describe my feeling to my friend who sit look upon I incredulously -- not yet have be affect by the drug -- i suddenly find myself at the foot of the great pyramid of cheop the taper course of yellow limestone gleam like gold in the sun and the pile rise so high that it seem to lean for support upon the blue arch of the sky i wish to ascend it and the wish alone place I immediately upon its apex lift thousand of foot above the wheat-field and palm-grove of egypt i cast my eye downward and to my astonishment see that it be build not of limestone but of huge square plug of cavendish tobacco word can not paint the overwhelming sense of the ludicrous which i then experienced i writhe on my chair in a agony of laughter which be only relieve by the vision melting away like a dissolve view till out of my confusion of indistinct image and fragment of image another and more wonderful vision arise the more vividly i recall the scene which follow the more carefully i restore its different feature and separate the many thread of sensation which it weave into one gorgeous web the more i despair of represent its exceed glory i be move over the desert not upon the rock dromedary but seat in a barque make of mother-of-pearl and stud with jewel of surpass lustre the sand be of grain of gold and my keel slide through they without jar or sound the air be radiant with excess of light though no sun be to be see i inhale the most delicious perfume and harmony such as beethoven may have hear in dream but never write float around I the atmosphere itself be light odor music and each and all sublimate beyond anything the sober sens be capable of receive before I -- for a thousand league as it seem -- stretch a vista of rainbow whose color gleam with the splendor of gem -- arch of live amethyst sapphire emerald topaz and ruby by thousand and ten of thousand they fly past I as my dazzling barge speed down the magnificent arcade yet the vista still stretch as far as ever before I i revel in a sensuous elysium which be perfect because no sense be leave ungratified but beyond all my mind be fill with a boundless feeling of triumph my journey be that of a conqueror -- not of a conqueror who subdue he race either by love or by will for i forget that man exist -- but one victorious over the grandest as well as the subtlest force of nature the spirit of light color odor sound and motion be my slave and have these i be master of the universe those who be endowed to any extent with the imaginative faculty must have at least once in they life experience feeling which may give they a clue to the exalted sensuous rapture of my triumphal march the view of a sublime mountain landscape the hearing of a grand orchestral symphony or of a choral upborne by the full-voiced organ or even the beauty and luxury of a cloudless summer day suggest emotion similar in kind if less intense they take a warmth and glow from that pure animal joy which degrade not but spiritualize and ennoble we material part and which differ from cold abstract intellectual enjoyment as the flaming diamond of the orient differ from the icicle of the north those finer sens which occupy a middle ground between we animal and intellectual appetite be suddenly develop to a pitch beyond what i have ever dream and be thus at one and the same time gratify to the fullest extent of they preternatural capacity the result be a single harmonious sensation to describe which human language have no epithet mahomet 's paradise with its palace of ruby and emerald its air of musk and cassium and its river colder than snow and sweeter than honey would have be a poor and mean terminus for my arcade of rainbow yet in the character of this paradise in the gorgeous fancy of the arabian night in the glow and luxury of all oriental poetry i now recognize more or less of the agency of hasheesh the fulness of my rapture expand the sense of time and though the whole vision be probably not more than five minute in pass through my mind year seem to have elapse while i shoot under the dazzling myriad of rainbow arch by and by the rainbow the barque of pearl and jewel and the desert of golden sand vanish and still bath in light and perfume i find myself in a land of green and flowery lawn divide by hill of gently undulate outline but although the vegetation be the richest of earth there be neither stream nor fountain to be see and the people who come from the hill with brilliant garment that shine in the sun besought I to give they the blessing of water they hand be full of branch of the coral honeysuckle in bloom these i take and break off the flower one by one set they in the earth the slender trumpet-like tube immediately become shaft of masonry and sink deep into the earth the lip of the flower change into a circular mouth of rose-colored marble and the people lean over its brink lower they pitcher to the bottom with cord and draw they up again fill to the brim and drip with honey the most remarkable feature of these illusion be that at the time when i be most completely under they influence i know myself to be seat in the tower of antonio 's hotel in damascus know that i have take hasheesh and that the strange gorgeous and ludicrous fancy which possess I be the effect of it at the very same instant that i look upon the valley of the nile from the pyramid slide over the desert or create my marvellous well in that beautiful pastoral country i see the furniture of my room its mosaic pavement the quaint saracenic niche in the wall the paint and gilded beam of the ceiling and the couch in the recess before I with my two companion watch I both sensation be simultaneous and equally palpable while i be most give up to the magnificent delusion i see its cause and feel its absurdity most clearly metaphysician say that the mind be incapable of perform two operation at the same time and may attempt to explain this phenomenon by suppose a rapid and incessant vibration of the perception between the two state this explanation however be not satisfactory to I for not more clearly do a skilful musician with the same breath blow two distinct musical note from a bugle than i be conscious of two distinct condition of be in the same moment yet singular as it may seem neither conflict with the other my enjoyment of the vision be complete and absolute undisturbed by the faintest doubt of they reality while in some other chamber of my brain reason sit coolly watch they and heap the liveliest ridicule on they fantastic feature one set of nerve be thrill with the bliss of the god while another be convulse with unquenchable laughter at that very bliss my highest ecstacy could not bear down and silence the weight of my ridicule which in its turn be powerless to prevent I from run into other and more gorgeous absurdity i be double not swan and shadow but rather sphinx-like human and beast a true sphinx i be a riddle and a mystery to myself the drug which have be retard in its operation on account of have be take after a meal now begin to make itself more powerfully feel the vision be more grotesque than ever but less agreeable and there be a painful tension throughout my nervous system -- the effect of over-stimulus i be a mass of transparent jelly and a confectioner pour I into a twisted mould i throw my chair aside and writhe and tortured myself for some time to force my loose substance into the mould at last when i have so far succeed that only one foot remain outside it be lift off and another mould of still more crooked and intricate shape substitute i have no doubt that the contortion through which i go to accomplish the end of my gelatinous destiny would have be extremely ludicrous to a spectator but to I they be painful and disagreeable the sober half of I go into fit of laughter over they and through that laughter my vision shift into another scene i have laugh until my eye overflow profusely every drop that fall immediately become a large loaf of bread and tumble upon the shop-board of a baker in the bazaar at damascus the more i laugh the faster the loaf fall until such a pile be raise about the baker that i could hardly see the top of he head the man will be suffocate i cry but if he be to die i can not stop my perception now become more dim and confused i feel that i be in the grasp of some giant force and in the glimmering of my fading reason grow earnestly alarm for the terrible stress under which my frame labor increase every moment a fierce and furious heat radiate from my stomach throughout my system my mouth and throat be as dry and hard as if make of brass and my tongue it seem to I be a bar of rusty iron i seize a pitcher of water and drink long and deeply but i might as well have drunk so much air for not only do it impart no moisture but my palate and throat give I no intelligence of have drunk at all i stand in the center of the room brandish my arm convulsively a heave sigh that seem to shatter my whole be will no one i cry in distress cast out this devil that have possession of I i no longer see the room nor my friend but i hear one of they say it must be real he could not counterfeit such a expression as that but it do not look much like pleasure immediately afterwards there be a scream of the wildest laughter and my countryman spring upon the floor exclaim o ye god i be a locomotive this be he ruling hallucination and for the space of two or three hour he continue to pace to and fro with a measure stride exhale he breath in violent jet and when he speak divide he word into syllable each of which he bring out with a jerk at the same time turn he hand at he side as if they be the crank of imaginary wheel the englishman as soon as he feel the dose begin to take effect prudently retreat to he own room and what the nature of he vision be we never learn for he refuse to tell and moreover enjoin the strictest silence on he wife by this time it be nearly midnight i have pass through the paradise of hasheesh and be plunge at once into its fiercest hell in my ignorance i have take what i have since learn would have be a sufficient portion for six man and be now pay a frightful penalty for my curiosity the excite blood rush through my frame with a sound like the roaring of mighty water it be project into my eye until i could no longer see it beat thickly in my ear and so throb in my heart that i fear the rib would give way under its blow i tear open my vest place my hand over the spot and try to count the pulsation but there be two heart one beat at the rate of a thousand beat a minute and the other with a slow dull motion my throat i thought be fill to the brim with blood and stream of blood be pour from my ear i feel they gush warm down my cheek and neck with a maddened desperate feeling i flee from the room and walk over the flat terraced roof of the house my body seem to shrink and grow rigid as i wrestle with the demon and my face to become wild lean and haggard some line which have strike I year before in read mr brown 's rhyme of the duchess may flash into my mind : -- and the horse in stark despair with he front hoof poise in air on the last verge rear amain and he hang he rock between -- and he nostril curdle in -- and he shiver head and hoof and the flake of foam fall off and he face grow fierce and thin that picture of animal terror and agony be mine i be the horse hang poise on the verge of the giddy tower the next moment to be bear sheer down to destruction involuntarily i raise my hand to feel the leanness and sharpness of my face oh horror the flesh have fall from my bone and it be a skeleton head that i carry on my shoulder with one bind i spring to the parapet and look down into the silent courtyard then fill with the shadow throw into it by the sink moon shall i cast myself down headlong be the question i propose to myself but though the horror of that skeleton delusion be greater than my fear of death there be a invisible hand at my breast which push I away from the brink i make my way back to the room in a state of the keenest suffering my companion be still a locomotive rush to and fro and jerk out he syllable with the disjointed accent peculiar to a steam-engine he mouth have turn to brass like mine and he raise the pitcher to he lip in the attempt to moisten it but before he have take a mouthful set the pitcher down again with a yell of laughter cry out : how can i take water into my boiler while i be let off steam but i be now too far go to feel the absurdity of this or he other exclamation i be sink deeper and deeper into a pit of unutterable agony and despair for although i be not conscious of real pain in any part of my body the cruel tension to which my nerve have be subject fill I through and through with a sensation of distress which be far more severe than pain itself in addition to this the remnant of will with which i struggle against the demon become gradually weaker and i feel that i should soon be powerless in he hand every effort to preserve my reason be accompany by a pang of mortal fear lest what i now experience be insanity and would hold mastery over I for ever the thought of death which also haunt I be far less bitter than this dread i know that in the struggle which be go on in my frame i be bear fearfully near the dark gulf and the thought that at such a time both reason and will be leave my brain fill I with a agony the depth and blackness of which i should vainly attempt to portray i throw myself on my bed with the excite blood still roar wildly in my ear my heart throb with a force that seem to be rapidly wear away my life my throat dry as a pot-sherd and my stiffened tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth -- resist no longer but await my fate with the apathy of despair my companion be now approach the same condition but as the effect of the drug on he have be less violent so he stage of suffering be more clamorous he cry out to I that he be die implore I to help he and reproach I vehemently because i lay there silent motionless and apparently careless of he danger why will he disturb I i think he think he be die but what be death to madness let he die a thousand death be more easily bear than the pang i suffer while i be sufficiently conscious to hear he exclamation they only provoke my keen anger but after a time my sens become clouded and i sink into a stupor as near as i can judge this must have be three o'clock in the morning rather more than five hour after the hasheesh begin to take effect i lay thus all the follow day and night in a state of gray blank oblivion break only by a single wander gleam of consciousness i recollect hearing françois ' voice he tell I afterwards that i arise attempt to dress myself drink two cup of coffee and then fall back into the same death-like stupor but of all this i do not retain the least knowledge on the morning of the second day after a sleep of thirty hour i awake again to the world with a system utterly prostrate and unstrung and a brain cloud with the linger image of my vision i know where i be and what have happen to I but all that i see still remain unreal and shadowy there be no taste in what i eat no refreshment in what i drink and it require a painful effort to comprehend what be say to I and return a coherent answer will and reason have come back but they still sit unsteadily upon they throne my friend who be much further advance in he recovery accompany I to the adjoining bath which i hope would assist in restore I it be with great difficulty that i preserve the outward appearance of consciousness in spite of myself a veil now and then fall over my mind and after wander for year as it seem in some distant world i awake with a shock to find myself in the steamy hall of the bath with a brown syrian polish my limb i suspect that my language must have be rambling and incoherent and that the menial who have I in charge understand my condition for as soon as i have stretch myself upon the couch which follow the bath a glass of very acid sherbet be present to I and after drink it i experienced instant relief still the spell be not wholly broken and for two or three day i continue subject to frequent involuntary fit of absence which make I insensible for the time to all that be pass around I i walk the street of damascus with a strange consciousness that i be in some other place at the same time and with a constant effort to reunite my divide perception previous to the experiment we have decide on make a bargain with the shekh for the journey to palmyra the state however in which we now find ourselves oblige we to relinquish the plan perhaps the excitement of a forced march across the desert and a conflict with the hostile arab which be quite likely to happen might have assist we in throw off the baneful effect of the drug but all the charm which lay in the name of palmyra and the romantic interest of the trip be go i be without courage and without energy and nothing remain for I but to leave damascus yet fearful as my rash experiment prove to I i do not regret have make it it reveal to I deep of rapture and of suffer which my natural faculty never could have sound it have teach I the majesty of human reason and of human will even in the weakest and the awful peril of tamper with that which assail they integrity i have here faithfully and fully write out my experience on account of the lesson which it may convey to other if i have unfortunately fail in my design and have but awaken that restless curiosity which i have endeavor to forestall let I beg all who be thereby lead to repeat the experiment upon themselves that they be content to take the portion of hasheesh which be consider sufficient for one man and not like I swallow enough for six chapter xi a dissertation on bathing and body no swan-soft woman rub with lucid oils the gift of a enamored god more fair browning we shall not set out from damascus -- we shall not leave the pearl of the orient to glimmer through the sea of foliage wherein it lie bury -- without consecrate a day to the bath that material agent of peace and good-will unto man we have bath in the jordan like naaman and be make clean let we now see whether abana and pharpar river of damascus be better than the water of israel the bath be the peculiar institution of the east coffee have become colonize in france and america the pipe be a cosmopolite and he blue joyous breath congeal under the arctic circle or melt languidly into the soft air of the polynesian isle but the bath that sensuous elysium which cradle the dream of plato and the vision of zoroaster and the solemn meditation of mahomet be only to be find under a oriental sky the naked native of the torrid zone be amphibious they do not bathe they live in the water the european and anglo-american wash themselves and think they have bath they shudder under cold shower and perform laborious antic with coarse towel as for the hydropathist the genius of the bath whose dwelling be in damascus would be convulse with scornful laughter could he behold that aqueous diogene sit in he tub or stretch out in he wet wrapping like a sodden mummy in a catacomb of blanket and feather bed as the rose in the east have a rarer perfume than in other land so do the bath bestow a superior purification and impart a more profound enjoyment listen not unto the lamentation of traveller who complain of the heat and the steam and the dislocation of they joint they belong to the stiff-necked generation who resist the process whereunto the oriental yield himself body and soul he who be bath in damascus must be as clay in the hand of a potter the syrian marvel how the frank can walk so difficult be it to bend they joint moreover they know the difference between he who come to the bath out of a mere idle curiosity and he who have taste its delight and hold it in due honor only the latter be permit to know all its mystery the former be carelessly hurry through the ordinary form of bathing and if any trace of the cockney remain in he be quite as likely to be disgust as pleased again there be many second and third-rate bath whither cheating dragoman conduct they victim in consideration of a division of spoil with the bath-keeper hence it be that the bath have receive but partial justice at the hand of tourist in the east if any one doubt this let he clothe himself with oriental passiveness and resignation go to the hamman el-khyateën at damascus or the bath of mahmoud pasha at constantinople and demand that he be perfectly bath come with I and i will show you the mystery of the perfect bath here be the entrance a heavy saracenic arch opening upon the crowded bazaar we descend a few step to the marble pavement of a lofty octagonal hall light by a dome there be a jet of sparkling water in the center fall into a heavy stone basin a platform about five foot in height run around the hall and on this be range a number of narrow couch with they head to the wall like the pallet in a hospital ward the platform be cover with straw matting and from the wooden gallery which rise above it be suspend towel with blue and crimson border the master of the bath receive we courteously and conduct we to one of the vacant couch we kick off we red slipper below and mount the step to the platform yonder traveller in frank dress who have just enter go up with he boot on and we know from that fact what sort of a bath he will get as the work of disrobe proceeds a dark-eyed boy appear with a napkin which he hold before we ready to bind it about the waist as soon as we regain we primitive form another attendant throw a napkin over we shoulder and wrap a third around we head turban-wise he then thrust a pair of wooden clog upon we foot and take we by the arm steady we totter and clatter step as we pass through a low door and a warm ante-chamber into the first hall of the bath the light fall dimly through a cluster of bull 's - eye in the domed ceiling show first a silver thread of water playing in a steamy atmosphere next some dark motionless object stretch out on a low central platform of marble the attendant spread a linen sheet in one of the vacant place place a pillow at one end take off we clog deposit we gently on we back and leave we the pavement be warm beneath we and the first breath we draw give we a sense of suffocation but a bit of burn aloe-wood have just be carry through the hall and the steam be permeate with fragrance the dark-eyed boy appear with a narghileh which he place beside we offer the amber mouth-piece to we submissive lip the smoke we inhale have a odor of rose and as the pipe bubble with we breathing we feel that the dew of sweat gather heavily upon we the attendant now reappear kneel beside we and gently knead we with dexterous hand although no anatomist he know every muscle and sinew whose suppleness give ease to the body and so mould and manipulate they that we lose the rigidity of we mechanism and become plastic in he hand he turn we upon we face repeat the same process upon the back and leave we a little longer to lie there passively glisten in we own dew we be arouse from a reverie about nothing by a dark-brown shape who replace the clog put he arm around we waist and lead we into a inner hall with a steam tank in the center here he slip we off the brink and we collapse over head and ear in the fiery fluid once -- twice -- we dip into the delicious heat and then be lead into a marble alcove and seat flat upon the floor the attendant stand behind we and we now perceive that he hand be encase in dark hair-glove he pounce upon a arm which he rub until like a serpent we slough the worn-out skin and resume we infantile smoothness and fairness no man can be call clean until he have bath in the east let he walk directly from he accustomed bath and self-friction with towel to the hammam el-khyateën and the attendant will exclaim as he shake out he hair-glove : o frank it be a long time since you have bath the other arm follow the back the breast the leg until the work be complete and we know precisely how a horse feel after he have be curry now the attendant turn two cock at the back of the alcove and hold a basin alternately under the cold and hot stream flood we at first with a fiery dash that send a delicious warm shiver through every nerve then with milder application lessen the temperature of the water by semi-tone until from the highest key of heat which we can bear we glide rapturously down the gamut until we reach the lowest bass of coolness the skin have by this time attain a exquisite sensibility and answer to these change of temperature with thrill of the purest physical pleasure in fact the whole frame seem purge of its earthy nature and transform into something of a finer and more delicate texture after a pause the attendant make he appearance with a large wooden bowl a piece of soap and a bunch of palm-fibre he squat down beside the bowl and speedily create a mass of snowy lather which grow up to a pyramid and topple over the edge seize we by the crown-tuft of hair upon we shaven head he plant the foamy bunch of fiber full in we face the world vanish sight hearing smell taste -lrb- unless we open we mouth -rrb- and breathing be cut off we have become nebulous although we eye be shut we seem to see a blank whiteness and feeling nothing but a soft fleeciness we doubt whether we be not the olympian cloud which visit lo but the cloud clear away before strangulation begin and the velvety mass descend upon the body twice we be thus slush from head to foot and make more slippery than the anointed wrestler of the greek game then the basin come again into play and we glide once more musically through the scale of temperature the brown sculptor have now nearly complete he task the figure of clay which enter the bath be transform into polished marble he turn the body from side to side and lift the limb to see whether the workmanship be adequate to he conception he satisfied gaze proclaim he success a skilful bath-attendant have a certain aesthetic pleasure in he occupation the body he polish become to some extent he own workmanship and he feel responsible for they symmetry or deformity he experience a degree of triumph in contemplate a beautiful form which have grow more airily light and beautiful under he hand he be a great connoisseur of body and could pick you out the finest specimen with as ready a eye as a artist i envy those old greek bather into whose hand be deliver pericle and alcibiade and the perfect model of phidia they have daily before they eye the highest type of beauty which the world have ever produce for of all thing that be beautiful the human body be the crown now since the delusion of artist have be overthrow and we know that grecian art be but the simple reflex of nature -- that the old masterpiece of sculpture be no miraculous embodiment of a _ beau ideal _ but copy of live form -- we must admit that in no other age of the world have the physical man be so perfectly develop the nearest approach i have ever see to the symmetry of ancient sculpture be among the arab tribe of ethiopium we saxon race can supply the athlete but not the apollo oriental life be too full of repose and the ottoman race have become too degenerate through indulgence to exhibit many striking specimen of physical beauty the face be generally fine but the body be apt to be lank and with imperfect muscular development the best form i saw in the bath be those of laborer who with a good deal of rugged strength show some grace and harmony of proportion it may be receive as a general rule that the physical development of the european be superior to that of the oriental with the exception of the circassian and georgian whose beauty well entitle they to the distinction of give they name to we race so far as female beauty be concern the circassian woman have no superior they have preserve in they mountain home the purity of the grecian model and still display the perfect physical loveliness whose type have descend to we in the venus de medici the frank who be addict to wander about the street of oriental city can hardly fail to be favor with a sight of the face of these beauty more than once it have happen to I in meet a veil lady sailing along in she balloon-like feridjee that she have allow the veil to drop by a skilful accident as she pass and have startle I with the vision of she beauty recall the line of the persian poet : astonishment be this the dawn of the glorious sun or be it the full moon the circassian face be a pure oval the forehead be low and fair a excellent thing in woman and the skin of a ivory whiteness except the faint pink of the cheek and the ripe roseate stain of the lip the hair be dark glossy and luxuriant exquisitely outline on the temple the eyebrow slightly arched and draw with a delicate pencil while lash like ray of darkness shade the large dark humid orb below they the alabaster of the face so pure as scarcely to show the blue branch of the vein on the temple be light by those superb eye -- shine eye like antique jewel set in parian statue-stone -- whose well be so dark and deep that you be cheat into the belief that a glorious soul look out of they once by a unforeseen chance i beheld the circassian form in its most perfect development i be on board a austrian steamer in the harbor of smyrna when the harem of a turkish pasha come out in a boat to embark for alexandrium the sea be rather rough and nearly all the officer of the steamer be ashore there be six veil and swaddle woman with a black eunuch as guard in the boat which lay toss for some time at the foot of the gangway ladder before the frightened passenger could summon courage to step out at last the youngest of they -- a circassian girl of not more than fifteen or sixteen year of age -- venture upon the ladder clasp the hand-rail with one hand while with the other she hold together the fold of she cumbrous feridjee i be stand in the gangway watch she when a slight lurch of the steamer cause she to loose she hold of the garment which fasten at the neck be blow back from she shoulder leave she body screen but by a single robe of-light gauzy silk through this the marble whiteness of she skin the roundness the glorious symmetry of she form flash upon I as a vision of aphrodite see through league of shimmering water like a star it be but a momentary glimpse yet that moment convinced I that form of phidian perfection be still nurture in the vale of caucasus the necessary disguise of dress hide from we much of the beauty and dignity of humanity i have see man who appear heroic in the freedom of nakedness shrink almost into absolute vulgarity when clothe the soul not only sit at the window of the eye and hang upon the gateway of the lip she speak as well in the intricate yet harmonious line of the body and the ever-varying play of the limb look at the torso of ilioneus the son of niobe and see what a agony of terror and supplication cry out from that headless and limbless trunk decapitate laocoön and he knotted muscle will still express the same dreadful suffering and resistance none know this better than the ancient sculptor and hence it be that we find many of they statue of distinguished man wholly or partly undraped such a view of art would be consider transcendental now-a-day when we dress we costume and we mode of speech either ignore the existence of we body or treat they with little of that reverence which be they due but while we have be think these thought the attendant have be wait to give we a final plunge into the seething tank again we slide down to the eye in the fluid heat which wrap we closely about until we tingle with exquisite hot shivering now come the graceful boy with clean cool lavendered napkin which he fold around we waist and wrap softly about the head the patten be put upon we foot and the brown arm steady we gently through the sweating-room and ante-chamber into the outer hall where we mount to we couch we sink gently upon the cool linen and the boy cover we with a perfumed sheet then kneel beside the couch he press the fold of the sheet around we that it may absorb the linger moisture and the limpid perspiration shed by the depart heat as fast as the linen become damp he replace it with fresh press the fold about we as tenderly as a mother arrange the drapery of she sleeping babe for we though of the stature of a man be now infantile in we helpless happiness then he take we passive hand and warm its palm by the soft friction of he own after which move to the end of the couch he lift we foot upon he lap and repeat the friction upon they sole until the blood come back to the surface of the body with a misty glow like that which steep the cloud of a summer afternoon we have but one more process to undergo and the attendant already stand at the head of we couch this be the course of passive gymnastics which excite so much alarm and resistance in the ignorant frank it be only resistance that be dangerous completely neutralize the enjoyment of the process give yourself with a blind submission into the arm of the brown fate and he will lead you to new chamber of delight he lift we to a sit posture place himself behind we and fold he arm around we body alternately tighten and relax he clasp as if to test the elasticity of the rib then seize one arm he draw it across the opposite shoulder until the joint crack like a percussion-cap the shoulder-blade the elbow the wrist and the finger-joint be all make to fire off they muffle volley and then place one knee between we shoulder and clasp both hand upon we forehead he draw we head back until we feel a great snap of the vertebral column now he descend to the hip-joints knee ankle and foot force each and all to discharge a salvo _ de joie _ the slight languor leave from the bath be go and a airy delicate exhilaration befitting the winged mercury take its place the boy kneel present we with _ finjan _ of foamy coffee follow by a glass of sherbet cool with the snow of lebanon he presently return with a narghileh which we smoke by the effortless inhalation of the lung thus we lie in perfect repose soothe by the fragrant weed and idly watch the silent oriental who be undress for the bath or repose like ourselves through the arched entrance we see a picture of the bazaar : a shadowy painting of merchant seat amid they silk and spice dot here and there with golden drop and splash of sunshine which have trickle through the roof the scene paint itself upon we eye yet wake no slightest stir of think the brain be a becalmed sea without a ripple on its shore mind and body be drown in delicious rest and we no longer remember what we be we only know that there be a existence somewhere in the air and that wherever it be and whatever it may be it be happy more and more dim grow the picture the color fade and blend into each other and finally merge into a bed of rosy cloud flood with the radiance of some unseen sun gentlier than tired eyelid upon tired eye sleep lie upon we sens : a half-conscious sleep wherein we know that we behold light and inhale fragrance as gently the cloud dissipate into air and we be bear again into the world the bath be at a end we arise and put on we garment and walk forth into the sunny street of damascus but as we go homewards we involuntarily look down to see whether we be really tread upon the earth wonder perhaps that we should be content to do so when it would be so easy to soar above the house-tops chapter xii baalbec and

_ 27 1852 after a stay of eight day in damascus we call we man dervish and mustapha again into requisition load we enthusiastic mule and mount we despairing horse there be two other party on the way to baalbec -- a english gentleman and lady and a solitary englishman so that we united force make a impose caravan there be always a custom-house examination not on enter but on issue from a oriental city but traveller can avoid it by procure the company of a consular janissary as far as the gate mr wood the british consul lend we one of he officer for the occasion whom we find wait outside of the wall to receive he private fee for the service we mount the long barren hill west of the plain and at the summit near the tomb of a moslem shekh turn to take a last long look at the bowery plain and the minaret of the city glitter through the blue morning vapor a few pace further on the rocky road a different scene present itself to we there lay to the westward a long stretch of naked yellow mountain bask in the hot glare of the sun and through the center deep down in the heart of the arid landscape a wind line of live green show the course of the barrada we follow the river until the path reach a impassable gorge which occasion a detour of two or three hour we then descend to the bed of the dell where the vegetation owe to the radiate heat from the mountain and the fertilize stimulus of the water below be even richer than on the plain of damascus the tree be plethoric with a overplus of life the bough of the mulberry be weigh down with the burden of the leaf pomegranate be in a violent eruption of blossom and the foliage of the fig and poplar be of so deep a hue that it shine black in the sun pass through a gateway of rock so narrow that we be often oblige to ride in the bed of the stream we reach a little meadow beyond which be a small hamlet almost hide in the leaf here the mountain again approach each other and from the side of that on the right hand the main body of the barrada or pharpar gush forth in one full stream the fountain be nearly double the volume of that of the jordan at bania and much more beautiful the foundation of a ancient building probably a temple overhang it and tall poplar and sycamore cover it with impenetrable shade from the low aperture where it burst into the light its water white with foam bind away flash in the chance ray of sunshine until they be lose to sight in the dense dark foliage we sit a hour on the ruin wall listen to the roar and rush of the flood and enjoy the shade of the walnut and sycamore soon after leave we path cross a small stream which come down to the barrada from the upper valley of the anti-lebanon and enter a wild pass face with cliff of perpendicular rock a old bridge of one arch span the chasm out of which we climb to a tract of high meadow land in the pass there be some fragment of ancient column trace of a aqueduct and inscription on the rock among which mr h find the name of antoninus the place be not mention in any book of travel i have see as it be not on the usual road from damascus to baalbec as we be emerge from the pass we see a company of twelve armed man seat in the grass near the roadside they be wild-looking character and eye we somewhat sharply as we pass we greet they with the usual salaam aleikoom which they do not return the same evening as we encamp at the village of zebdenus about three hour further up the valley we be startle by a great noise and outcry with the firing of pistol it happen as we learn on inquire the cause of all this confusion that the man we see in the pass be rebel drus who be then lie in wait for the shekh of zebdenus whom with he son they have take captive soon after we pass the news have by some means be convey to the village and a company of about two hundred person be then march out to the rescue the noise they make be probably to give the drus intimation of they come and thus avoid a fight i do not believe that any of the mountaineer of lebanon would willingly take part against the drus who in fact be not fight so much against the institution of the conscription law as its abuse the law ordain that the conscript shall serve for five year but since its establishment as i have be inform there have not be a single instance of discharge it amount therefore to lifelong servitude and there be little wonder that these independent son of the mountain as well as the tribe inhabit the syrian desert should rebel rather than submit the next day we cross a pass in the anti-lebanon beyond zebdenus descend a beautiful valley on the western side under a ridge which be still dot with patch of snow and after travel for some hour over a wide barren height the last of the range see below we the plain of baalbec the grand ridge of lebanon opposite crown with glitter field of snow shone out clearly through the pure air and the hoary head of hermon far in the south lose something of its grandeur by the comparison though there be a divide or watershed between husbeiya at the foot of mount hermon and baalbec whose spring join the oronte which flow northward to antioch the great natural separation of the two chain continue unbroken to the gulf of akaba in the red sea a little beyond baalbec the anti-lebanon terminate sink into the syrian plain while the lebanon though its name and general feature be lose about twenty mile further to the north be succeed by other range which though break at interval form a regular series connect with the taurus in asia minor on leave damascus the demon of hasheesh still maintain a partial control over I i be weak in body and at time confuse in my perception wander away from the scene about I to some unknown sphere beyond the moon but the healing balm of my sleep at zebdenus and the purity of the morning air among the mountain complete my cure as i ride along the valley with the tower snow-sprinkled ridge of the anti-lebanon on my right a cloudless heaven above my head and mead enamel with the asphodel and scarlet anemone stretch before I i feel that the last shadow have roll away from my brain my mind be now as clear as that sky -- my heart as free and joyful as the elastic morning air the sun never shine so brightly to my eye the fair form of nature be never penetrate with so perfect a spirit of beauty i be again master of myself and the world glow as if new-created in the light of my joy and gratitude i thank god who have lead I out of a darkness more terrible than that of the valley of the shadow of death and while my foot stray among the flowery meadow of lebanon my heart walk on the delectable hill of he mercy by the middle of the afternoon we reach baalbec the distant view of the temple on descend the last slope of the anti-lebanon be not calculate to raise one 's expectation on the green plain at the foot of the mountain you see a large square platform of masonry upon which stand six column the body of the temple and a quantity of ruin wall as a feature in the landscape it have a fine effect but you find yourself pronounce the speedy judgment that baalbec without lebanon would be rather a poor show have come to this conclusion you ride down the hill with comfortable feeling of indifference there be a number of quarry on the left hand you glance at they with a expression which merely say : ah i suppose they get the stone here and so you saunter on cross a little stream that flow down from the modern village pass a mill return the stare of the quaint arab miller who come to the door to see you and you horse be climb a difficult path among the broken column and frieze before you think it worth while to lift you eye to the pile above you now re-assert you judgment if you dare this be baalbec : what have you to say nothing but you amazedly measure the torso of great column which lie pile across one another in magnificent wreck vast piece which have drop from the entablature beautiful corinthian capital bereft of the last graceful curve of they acanthus leave and block whose edge be so worn away that they resemble enormous natural boulder leave by the deluge till at last you look up to the six glorious pillar tower nigh a hundred foot above you head and there be a sensation in you brain which would be a shout if you could give it utterance of faultless symmetry and majesty such as no conception of yours and no other creation of art can surpass i know of nothing so beautiful in all remains of ancient art as these six column except the colonnade of the memnonium at thebe which be of much smaller proportion from every position and with all light of the day or night they be equally perfect and carry you eye continually away from the peristyle of the smaller temple which be better preserved and from the exquisite architecture of the outer court and pavilion the two temple of baalbec stand on a artificial platform of masonry a thousand foot in length and from fifteen to thirty foot -lrb- accord to the depression of the soil -rrb- in height the larger one which be suppose to have be a pantheon occupy the whole length of this platform the entrance be at the north by a grand flight of step now break away between two lofty and elegant pavilion which be still nearly entire then follow a spacious hexagonal court and three grand hall part of which with niche for statue adorn with cornice and pediment of elaborate design still remain entire to the roof this magnificent series of chamber be terminate at the southern extremity of the platform by the main temple which have originally twenty column on a side similar to the six now stand the temple of the sun stand on a smaller and lower platform which appear to have be subsequently add to the greater one the cellum or body of the temple be complete except the roof and of the colonnade surround it nearly one-half of its pillar be still stand uphold the frieze entablature and cornice which altogether form probably the most ornate specimen of the corinthian order of architecture now extant only four pillar of the superb portico remain and the saracen have nearly ruin these by build a sort of watch-tower upon the architrave the same unscrupulous race completely shut up the portal of the temple with a blank wall form of the fragment they have hurl down and one be oblige to creep through a narrow hole in order to reach the interior here the original doorway face you -- and i know not how to describe the wonderful design of its elaborate sculptured moulding and cornice the genius of greek art seem to have exhaust itself in invent ornament which while they should heighten the gorgeous effect of the work must yet harmonize with the grand design of the temple the enormous keystone over the entrance have slip down no doubt from the shock of a earthquake and hang within six inch of the bottom of the two block which uphold it on either side when it fall the whole entablature of the portal will be destroy on its lower side be a eagle with outspread wing and on the side-stone a genius with garland of flower exquisitely sculpture in bas relief hide among the wreath of vine which adorn the jamb be the laughing head of faun this portal be a continual study to I every visit reveal new refinement of ornament which i have not before observe the interior of the temple with its rich corinthian pilaster its niche for statue surmount by pediment of elegant design and its elaborate cornice need little aid of the imagination to restore it to its original perfection like that of dendera in egypt the temple of the sun leave upon the mind a impression of completeness which make you forget far grander remains but the most wonderful thing at baalbec be the foundation platform upon which the temple stand even the colossal fabric of ancient egypt dwindle before this superhuman masonry the platform itself 1000 foot long and average twenty foot in height suggest a vast mass of stone but when you come to examine the single block of which it be compose you be crush with they incredible bulk on the western side be a row of eleven foundation stone each of which be thirty-two foot in length twelve in height and ten in thickness form a wall three hundred and fifty-two foot long but while you be walk on thinking of the art which cut and raise these enormous block you turn the southern corner and come upon _ three _ stone the unite length of which be _ one hundred and eighty-seven foot _ -- two of they be sixty-two and the other sixty-three foot in length there they be cut with faultless exactness and so smoothly join to each other that you can not force a cambric needle into the crevice there be one joint so perfect that it can only be discern by the minutest search it be not even so perceptible as the junction of two piece of paper which have be paste together in the quarry there still lie a finished block ready for transportation which be sixty-seven foot in length the weight of one of these mass have be reckon at near 9000 ton yet they do not form the base of the foundation but be raise upon other course fifteen foot from the ground it be consider by some antiquarian that they be of a date greatly anterior to that of the temple and be intend as the basement of a different edifice in the village of baalbec there be a small circular corinthian temple of very elegant design it be not more than thirty foot in diameter and may have be intend as a tomb a spacious mosque now roofless and desert be construct almost entirely out of the remains of the temple adjoining the court-yard and fountain be five row of ancient pillar forty -lrb- the sacred number -rrb- in all support light saracenic arch some of they be marble with corinthian capital and eighteen be single shaft of red egyptian granite beside the fountain lie a small broken pillar of porphyry of a dark violet hue and of so fine a grain that the stone have the soft rich lustre of velvet this fragment be the only thing i would carry away if i have the power after a day 's sojourn we leave baalbec at noon and take the road for the cedar which lie on the other side of lebanon in the direction of tripolus we english fellow-traveller choose the direct road to beyrout we cross the plain in three hour to the village of dayr el-ahmar and then commence ascend the lowest slope of the great range whose topmost ridge a dazzling parapet of snow rise high above we for several hour we path lead up and down stony ridge cover with thicket of oak and holly and with wild cherry pear and olive-tree just as the sun throw the shadow of the highest lebanon over we we come upon a narrow rocky glen at he very base stream that still keep the color and the coolness of the snow-field from which they ooze foam over the stone into the chasm at the bottom the glen descend into a mountain basin in which lay the lake of yemounus cold and green under the evening shadow but just opposite we on a little shelf of soil there be a rude mill and a group of superb walnut-tree overhang the brink of the largest torrent we have send we baggage before we and the man with a eye to the picturesque which i should not have suspect in arab have pitch we tent under those tree where the stream pour its snow-cold beaker beside we and the tent-door look down on the plain of baalbec and across to the anti-lebanon the miller and two or three peasant who be live in this lonely spot be christian the next morning we commence ascend the lebanon we have sleep just below the snow-line for the long hollow with which the ridge be cloven be fill up to within a short distance of the glen out of which we come the path be very steep continually ascend now around the barren shoulder of the mountain now up some ravine where the holly and olive still flourish and the wild rhubarb-plant spread its large succulent leaf over the soil we have take a guide the day before at the village of dayr el-ahmar but as the way be plain before we and he demand a exorbitant sum we dismiss he we have not climb far however before he return profess to be content with whatever we might give he and take we into another road the first he say be impracticable up and up we toil and the long hollow of snow lay below we and the wind come cold from the topmost peak which begin to show near at hand but now the road as we have surmise turn towards that we have first take and on reach the next height we see the latter at a short distance from we it be not only a better but a shorter road the rascal of a guide have lead we out of it in order to give the greater effect to he service in order to return to it as be necessary there be several dangerous snow-field to be pass the angle of they descent be so great that a single false step would have hurl we animal baggage and all many hundred foot below the snow be melting and the crust freeze over the stream below be so thin in place that the animal break through and sink to they belly it be needless to state the number and character of the anathema bestow upon the guide the impassive dervish rave mustapha storm françois break out in a frightful eruption of greek and turkish oath and the two traveller though not -lrb- as i hope and believe -rrb- profanely incline could not avoid use a few terse saxon expression when the general indignation have find vent the man go to work and by take each animal separately succeed at imminent hazard in get they all over the snow we then dismiss the guide who far from be abashed by the discovery of he trickery have the impudence to follow we for some time claim he pay a few more steep pull over deep bed of snow and patch of barren stone and at length the summit ridge -- a sharp white wall shine against the intense black-blue of the zenith -- stand before we we climb a toilsome zig-zag through the snow hurry over the stone cumber the top and all at once the mountain fall away ridge below ridge gash with tremendous chasm whose bottom be lose in blue vapor till the last height crown with white maronite convent hang above the sea whose misty round bound the vision i have see many grander mountain view but few so sublimely rugged and break in they feature the side of the ridge drop off in all direction into sheer precipice and the few village we could see be build like eagle ' nest on the brink in a little hollow at we foot be the sacred forest of cedar appear like a patch of stunt juniper it be the highest speck of vegetation on lebanon and in winter can not be visit on account of the snow the summit on which we stand be about nine thousand foot above the sea but there be peak on each side at least a thousand foot higher we descend by a very steep path over occasional bed of snow and reach the cedar in a hour and a half not until we be within a hundred yard of the tree and below they level be i at all impressed with they size and venerable aspect but once enter into the heart of the little wood walk over its miniature hill and valley and breathe the pure balsamic exhalation of the tree all the disappointment rise to my mind be charm away in a instant there be about three hundred tree in all many of which be of the last century 's growth but at least fifty of they would be consider grand in any forest the patriarch be five in number and be undoubtedly as old as the christian era if not the age of solomon the cypress in the garden of montezuma at chapultepec be even older and grander tree but they be as entire and shapely as ever whereas these be gnarled and twist into wonderful form by the storm of twenty century and shiver in some place by lightning the hoary father of they all nine foot in diameter stand in the center of the grove on a little knoll and spread he ponderous arm each a tree in itself over the head of the many generation that have grow up below as if give he last benediction before decay he be scar less with storm and lightning than with the knife of traveller and the marble crag of lebanon do not more firmly retain they inscription than he stony trunk date of the last century be abundant and i recollect a tablet inscribe : souard 1670 around which the newer wood have grow to the height of three or four inch the seclusion of the grove shut in by peak of barren snow be complete only the voice of the nightingale singing here by daylight in the solemn shadow break the silence the maronite monk who have charge of a little stone chapel standing in the midst move about like a shade and not before you be ready to leave bring he book for you to register you name therein i be surprise to find how few of the crowd that annually overrun syrium reach the cedar which after baalbec be the finest remains of antiquity in the whole country after a stay of three hour we ride on to eden whither we man have already go with the baggage we road lead along the brink of a tremendous gorge a thousand foot deep the bottom of which be only accessible here and there by hazardous foot-path on either side a long shelf of cultivate land slope down to the top and the mountain stream after water a multitude of orchard and grain-field tumble over the cliff in long sparkling cascade to join the roar flood below this be the christian region of lebanon inhabit almost wholly by maronite who still retain a portion of they former independence and be the most thrifty industrious honest and happy people in syrium they village be not concrete mass of picturesque filth as be those of the moslem but be loosely scatter among orchard of mulberry poplar and vine wash by fresh rill and have a air of comparative neatness and comfort each have its two or three chapel with they little belfry which toll the hour of prayer sad and poetic as be the call from the minaret it never touch I as when i hear the sweet tongue of those christian bell chime vespers far and near on the side of lebanon eden merit its name it be a mountain paradise inhabit by people so kind and simple-hearted that assuredly no vengeful angel will ever drive they out with he flaming sword it hang above the gorge which be here nearly two thousand foot deep and overlook a grand wilderness of mountain-pile crowd on and over each other from the sea that gleam below to the topmost height that keep off the morning sun the house be all build of hew stone and group in cluster under the shade of large walnut-tree in walk among they we receive kind greeting everywhere and every one who be seat rise and remain standing as we pass the woman be beautiful with sprightly intelligent face quite different from the stupid mahometan female the child be charming creature and some of the girl of ten or twelve year be lovely as angel they come timidly to we tent -lrb- which the man have pitch as before under two superb tree beside a fountain -rrb- and offer we rose and branch of fragrant white jasmine they expect some return of course but do not ask it and the delicate grace with which the offering be make be beyond all pay it be Sunday and the man and boy have nothing better to do all come to see and talk with we i shall not soon forget the circle of gay and laughing villager in which we sit that evening while the dark purple shadow gradually fill up the gorge and broad golden light pour over the shoulder of the hill the man have much sport in induce the smaller boy to come up and salute we there be one whom they call the consul who elude they for some time but be finally catch and place in the ring before we peace be with you o consul i say make he a profound inclination may you day be propitious may you shadow be increase but i then see from the vacant expression on the boy 's face that he be one of those harmless witless creature whom yet one can not quite call idiot he be a unfortunate he know nothing he have no protector but god say the man cross themselves devoutly the boy take off he cap creep up and kiss my hand as i give he some money which he no sooner grasp than he spring up like a startled gazelle and be out of sight in a instant in descend from eden to the sea-coast we be oblige to cross the great gorge of which i speak further down its side be less steep and clothed even to the very bottom with magnificent orchard of mulberry fig olive orange and pomegranate tree we be three hour in reach the opposite side although the breadth across the top be not more than a mile the path be exceedingly perilous we walk down lead we horse and once be oblige to unload we mule to get they past a tree which would have force they off the brink of a chasm several hundred foot deep the view from the bottom be wonderful we be shut in by steep of foliage and blossom from two to three thousand foot high break by crag of white marble and tower almost precipitously to the very cloud i doubt if melville see anything grander in the tropical gorge of typee after reach the other side we have still a journey of eight hour to the sea through a wild and broken yet highly cultivate country beyrout be now thirteen hour distant but by make a forced march we reach it in a day travel along the shore past the town of jebeil the ancient byblus and joonieh the hill about jebeil produce the celebrated tobacco know in egypt as the _ jebelee _ or mountain tobacco which be even superior to the latakiyeh near beyrout the mulberry and olive be in the ascendant the latter tree bear the finest fruit in all the levant and might drive all other oils out of the market if any one have enterprise enough to erect proper manufactory instead of this the oil of the country be badly prepared rancid from the skin in which it be keep and the wealthy native import from france and italy in preference to use it in the bottom near the sea i see several field of the taro-plant the cultivation of which i have suppose be exclusively confine to the island of the pacific there would be no end to the wealth of syrium be the country in proper hand chapter xiii pipe and coffee -- the kind nymph to bacchus bear by morpheus ' daughter she that seem gifted upon she natal morn by he with fire by she with dream -- nicotium dearer to the muse than all the grape 's bewildering juice lowell in paint the picture of a oriental the pipe and the coffee-cup be indispensable accessory there be scarce a turk or arab or persian -- unless he be a dervish of peculiar sanctity -- but breathe he daily incense to the milder bacchus of the modern the custom have become so thoroughly naturalized in the east that we be apt to forget its comparatively recent introduction and to wonder that no mention be make of the pipe in the arabian night the practice of smoking harmonize so thoroughly with the character of oriental life that it be difficult for we to imagine a time when it never exist it have become a part of that supreme patience that wonderful repose which form so strong a contrast to the over-active life of the new world -- the enjoyment of which no one can taste to whom the pipe be not familiar howl ye reformer but i solemnly declare unto you that he who travel through the east without smoking do not know the east it be strange that we continent where the meaning of rest be unknown should have give to the world this great agent of rest there be nothing more remarkable in history than the colonization of tobacco over the whole earth not three century have elapse since knightly raleigh puff its fume into the astonished eye of spenser and shakspeare and now find I any corner of the world from nova zemblum to the mountain of the moon where the use of the plant be unknown tarshish -lrb- if indium be tarshish -rrb- be less distinguish by its ape ivory and peacock than by its hookah the valley of luzon beyond ternate and tidore send we more cheroot than spice the garden of shiraz produce more velvety _ toombek _ than rose and the only fountain which bubble in samarcand be those of the narghileh : lebanon be no longer excellent with the cedar as in the day of solomon but most excellent with its field of jebelee and latakiyeh on the unvisited plain of central africa the table-land of tartary and in the valley of japan the wonderful plant have find a home the naked negro panting at the line inhale it under the palm and the lapp and samoy on the shore of the frozen sea it be idle for those who object to the use of tobacco to attribute these phenomenon wholly to a perverted taste the fact that the custom be at once adopt by all the race of man whatever they geographical position and degree of civilization prove that there must be a reason for it in the physical constitution of man its effect when habitually use be slightly narcotic and sedative not stimulate -- or if so at time it stimulate only the imagination and the social faculty it lull to sleep the combative and destructive propensity and hence -- so far as a material agent may operate -- it exercise a humanize and refine influence a profound student of man whose name be well know to the world once inform I that he see in the eagerness with which savage tribe adopt the use of tobacco a spontaneous movement of nature towards civilization i will not pursue these speculation further for the narghileh -lrb- bubble softly at my elbow as i write -rrb- be the promoter of repose and the begetter of agreeable reverie as i inhale its cool fragrant breath and partly yield myself to the sensation of healthy rest which wrap my limb as with a velvet mantle i marvel how the poet and artist and scholar of olden time nurse those dream which the world call indolence but which be the seed that germinate into great achievement how do plato philosophize without the pipe how do gray homer sit on the temple-step in the grecian twilight drive from he heart the bitterness of beggary and blindness how do phidia charm the cerberus of he animal nature to sleep while he soul enter the elysian field and behold the form of hero for in the higher world of art body and soul be swear enemy and the pipe hold a opiate more potent than all the drowsy syrup of the east to drug the former into submission milton know this as he smoke he evening pipe at chalfont wander the while among the palm of paradise but it be also we loss that tobacco be unknown to the greek they would else have give we in verse and in marble another divinity in they glorious pantheon -- a god less drowsy than morpheus and somnus less riotous than bacchus less radiant than apollo but with something of the spirit of each : a figure beautiful with youth every muscle in perfect repose and the vague expression of dream in he half-closed eye he temple would have be build in a grove of southern pine on the border of a land-locked gulf sheltered from the surge that buffet without where service would have be render he in the late hour of the afternoon or in the evening twilight from he oracular tripod word of wisdom would have be speak and the fane of delphus and dodona would have be desert for he oh non-smoking friend who read these line with pain and incredulity -- and you lady who turn pale at the thought of a pipe -- let I tell you that you be familiar only with the vulgar form of tobacco and have never pass between the wind and its gentility the word convey no idea to you but that of long nines and pig-tail and cavendish forget these for a moment and look upon this dark-brown cake of dry leaf and blossom which exhale a odor of press flower these be the tender top of the _ jebelee _ pluck as the bud begin to expand and carefully dry in the shade in order to be use it be moisten with rose-scented water and cut to the necessary degree of fineness the test of true jebelee be that it burn with a slow hidden fire like tinder and cause no irritation to the eye when hold under it the smoke draw through a long cherry-stick pipe and amber mouth-piece be pure cool and sweet with a aromatic flavor which be very pleasant in the mouth it excite no salivation and leave behind it no unpleasant stale odor the narghileh -lrb- still bubble beside I -rrb- be a institution know only in the east it require a peculiar kind of tobacco which grow to perfection in the southern province of persium the smoke after pass through water -lrb- rose-flavored if you choose -rrb- be inhale through a long flexible tube directly into the lung it occasion not the slightest irritation or oppression but in a few minute produce a delicious sense of rest which be feel even in the finger-end the pure physical sensation of rest be one of strength also and of perfect contentment many a impatient think many a angry word have i avoid by a resort to the pipe among we aborigine the pipe be the emblem of peace and i strongly recommend the peace society to print they tract upon papers of smoking tobacco -lrb- turkish if possible -rrb- and distribute pipe with they i know of nothing more refreshing after the fatigue of a long day 's journey than a well-prepared narghileh that slight feverish and excitable feeling which be the result of fatigue yield at once to its potency the blood lose its heat and the pulse its rapidity the muscle relax the nerve be soothe into quiet and the frame pass into a condition similar to sleep except that the mind be awake and active by the time one have finish he pipe he be refresh for the remainder of the day and he nightly sleep be sound and healthy such be some of the physical effect of the pipe in eastern land morally and psychologically it work still greater transformation but to describe they now with the mouth-piece at my lip would require a active self-consciousness which the habit do not allow a servant enter with a steamy cup of coffee seat in a silver _ zerf _ or cup-holder he thumb and fore-finger be clasp firmly upon the bottom of the zerf which i inclose near the top with my own thumb and finger so that the transfer be accomplish without he hand have touch mine after drain the thick brown liquid which must be do with due deliberation and a pause of satisfaction between each sip i return the zerf hold it in the middle while the attendant place a palm of each hand upon the top and bottom and carry it off without contact the beverage be make of the berry of mocha slightly roasted pulverize in a mortar and heated to a foam without the addition of cream or sugar sometimes however it be flavor with the extract of rose or violet when skilfully make each cup be prepared separately and the quantity of water and coffee carefully measure coffee be a true child of the east and its original home be among the hill of yeman the arabium felix of the ancient fortunately for mussulman its use be unknown in the day of mahomet or it would probably have fall under the same prohibition as wine the word _ kahweh _ -lrb- whence _ café _ -rrb- be a old arabic term for wine the discovery of the property of coffee be attribute to a dervish who for some misdemeanor be carry into the mountain of yeman by he brethren and there leave to perish by starvation in order to appease the pang of hunger he gather the ripe berry from the wild coffee-tree roasted and eat they the nourishment they contain with water from the spring sustain he life and after two or three month he return in good condition to he brethren who consider he preservation as a miracle and ever afterwards look upon he as a pattern of holiness he teach the use of the miraculous fruit and the demand for it soon become so great as to render the cultivation of the tree necessary it be a long time however before coffee be introduce into europe as late as the beginning of the seventeenth century sandy the quaint old traveller describe the appearance and taste of the beverage which he call coffa and sagely ask : why not that black broth which the lacedemonian use on account of the excellence of the material and the skilful manner of its preparation the coffee of the east be the finest in the world i have find it so grateful and refreshing a drink that i can readily pardon the pleasant exaggeration of the arabic poet abd-el kader anazarus djezerus hanbalus the son of mahomet who thus celebrate its virtue after such a exalted eulogy my own praise would sound dull and tame and i therefore resume my pipe commend abd-el kader to the reader o coffee thou dispellest the care of the great thou bringest back those who wander from the path of knowledge coffee be the beverage of the people of god and the cordial of he servant who thirst for wisdom when coffee be infuse into the bowl it exhale the odor of musk and be of the color of ink the truth be not know except to the wise who drink it from the foam coffee-cup god have deprive fool of coffee who with invincible obstinacy condemn it as injurious coffee be we gold and in the place of its libation we be in the enjoyment of the best and noblest society coffee be even as innocent a drink as the purest milk from which it be distinguish only by its color tarry with thy coffee in the place of its preparation and the good god will hover over thee and participate in he feast there the grace of the saloon the luxury of life the society of friend all furnish a picture of the abode of happiness every care vanish when the cup-bearer present the delicious chalice it will circulate fleetly through thy vein and will not rankle there : if thou doubtest this contemplate the youth and beauty of those who drink it grief can not exist where it grow sorrow humble itself in obedience before its power coffee be the drink of god 's people in it be health let this be the answer to those who doubt its quality in it we will drown we adversity and in its fire consume we sorrow whoever have once see the blissful chalice will scorn the wine-cup glorious drink thy color be the seal of purity and reason proclaim it genuine drink with confidence and regard not the prattle of fool who condemn without foundation chapter xiv journey to antioch and aleppo change of plan -- route to baghdad -- asia minor -- we sail from beyrout -- yachting on the syrian coast -- tartus and latakiyeh -- the coast of syrium -- the bay of suediah -- the mouth of the oronte -- landing -- the garden of syrium -- ride to antioch -- the modern city -- the plain of the oronte -- remain of the greek empire -- the ancient road -- the plain of keftin -- approach to aleppo the chain be loose the sail be spread the living breath be fresh behind as with dew and sunrise fed come the laugh morning wind shelley aleppo _ Friday June _ 4 1852 a traveller in the east who have not unbounded time and a extensive fortune at he disposal be never certain where and how far he shall go until he journey be finish with but a limited portion of both these necessaries i have so far carry out my original plan with scarcely a variation but at present i be oblige to make a material change of route my farthest east be here at aleppo at damascus i be tell by everybody that it be too late in the season to visit either baghdad or mosul and that on account of the terrible summer heat and the fever which prevail along the tigris it would be imprudent to undertake it notwithstanding this i should probably have go -lrb- be now so thoroughly acclimate that i have nothing to fear from the heat -rrb- have i not meet with a friend of col rawlinson the companion of layard and the sharer in he discovery at nineveh this gentleman who meet col r not long since in constantinople on he way to baghdad -lrb- where he reside as british consul -rrb- inform I that since the departure of mr layard from mosul the most interesting excavation have be fill up in order to preserve the sculpture unless one be able to make a new exhumation he would be by no means repay for so long and arduous a journey the ruin of nineveh be all below the surface of the earth and the little of they that be now leave expose be less complete and interesting than the specimen in the british museum there be a route from damascus to baghdad across the desert by way of palmyra but it be rarely travel even by the native except when the caravan be sufficiently strong to withstand the attack of the bedouin the traveller be oblige to go in arab costume to leave he baggage behind except a meager scrip for the journey and to pay from $ 300 to $ 500 for the camel and escort the more usual route be to come northward to this city then cross to mosul and descend the tigri -- a journey of four or five week after weigh all the advantage and disadvantage of undertake a tour of such length as it would be necessary to make before reach constantinople i decide at beyrout to give up the fascinating field of travel in media assyrium and armenia and take a rather shorter and-perhap equally interesting route from aleppo to constantinople by way of tarsus konium -lrb- iconium -rrb- and the ancient country of phrygium bithynium and mysium the interior of asia minor be even less know to we than the persian side of asiatic turkey which have of late receive more attention from traveller and as i shall traverse it in its whole length from syrium to the bosphorus i may find it replete with green field and pasture new which shall repay I for relinquish the first and more ambitious undertaking at least i have so much reason to be grateful for the uninterrupted good health and good luck i have enjoy during seven month in africa and the orient that i can not be otherwise than content with the prospect before I i leave beyrout on the night of the 28th of may with mr harrison who have decide to keep I company as far as constantinople françois we classic dragoman whose great delight be to recite homer by the sea-side be retain for the whole tour as we have find no reason to doubt he honesty or ability we first thought be to proceed to aleppo by land by way of hom and hamah whence there might be a chance of reach palmyra but as we find a opportunity of engage a american yacht for the voyage up the coast it be think preferable to take she and save time she be a neat little craft call the american eagle bring out by mr smith we consul at beyrout so one fine moonlit night we slowly creep out of the harbor and after return a volley of salute from we friend at demetrus 's hotel run into the heart of a thunder-storm which pour down more rain than all i have see for eight month before but we raïs assad -lrb- the lion -rrb- be worthy of he name and have two good christian sailor at he command so we lay in the cramped little cabin and hear the flood wash we deck without fear in the morning we be off tripolus which be even more deeply bury than beyrout in its orange and mulberry grove and slowly waft along the bold mountain-coast in the afternoon reach tartus the ancient tortosa a mile from shore be the rocky island of aradus entirely cover by a town there be a dozen vessel lie in the harbor the remains of a large fortress and ancient mole prove it to have be a place of considerable importance tartus be a small old place on the sea-shore -- not so large nor so important in appearance as its island-port the country behind be green and hilly though but partially cultivate and rise into djebel ansairiyeh which divide the valley of the oronte from the sea it be a lovely coast especially under the fly light and shadow of such a breezy day as we have the wind fall at sunset but by the next morning we have pass the tobacco-field of latakiyeh and be in sight of the southern cape of the bay of suediah the mountain form this cape culminate in a grand conical peak about 5000 foot in height call djebel okrab at ten o'clock waft along by a slow wind we turn the point and enter the bay of suediah form by the embouchure of the river oronte the mountain headland of akma dagh form the portal of the gulf of scanderoon loom grandly in front of we across the bay and far beyond it we could just distinguish the coast of karamania the snow-capped range of taurus the coast of syrium might be divide like those of guinea accord to the nature of they production the northern division be bold and bare yet flock of sheep graze on the slope of its mountain and the inland plain behind they be cover with orchard of pistachio-tree silk be cultivate in the neighborhood of suediah but form only a small portion of the export this region may be call the wool and pistachio coast southward from latakiyeh to tartus and the northern limit of lebanon extend the tobacco coast whose undulating hill be now clothe with the pale-green leaf of the renowned plant from tripolus to tyre embrace all the western slope of lebanon and the deep rich valley lie between he knee the mulberry predominate and the land be cover with the house of thatch and matting which shelter the busy worm this be the silk coast the palmy plain of jaffa and beyond until syrium meet the african sand between gaza and el-arish constitute the orange coast the vine the olive and the fig flourish everywhere we be all day get up the bay and it seem as if we should never pass djebel okrab whose pointed top rise high above a long belt of fleecy cloud that girdle he waist at sunset we make the mouth of the oronte we lion of a captain try to run into the river but the channel be very narrow and when within three hundred yard of the shore the yacht strike we have all sail set and have the wind be a little stronger we should have capsize in a instant the lion go manfully to work and by dint of hard poling shove we off and come to anchor in deep water not until the danger be past do he open he battery on the unlucky helmsman and then the explosion of arabic oath be equal to a broadside of twenty-four pounder we lay all night rock on the swell and the next morning by firing a number of signal gun bring out a boat which take we off we enter the mouth of the oronte and sail nearly a mile between rich wheat meadow before reach the landing-place of suediah -- two or three uninhabited stone hut with three or four small turkish craft and a health officer the town lie a mile or two inland scatter along the hill-side amid garden so luxuriant as almost to conceal it from view this part of the coast be ignorant of traveller and we be oblige to wait half a day before we could find a sufficient number of horse to take we to antioch twenty mile distant when they come they be solid farmer ' horse with the rudest gear imaginable i be oblige to mount astride of a broad pack-saddle with my leg suspend in coil of rope leave the meadow we enter a lane of the wildest richest and loveliest bloom and foliage we way be overhang with hedge of pomegranate myrtle oleander and white rise in blossom and occasionally with quince fig and carob tree lace together with grape vine in fragrant bloom sometimes this wilderness of color and odor meet above we head and make a twilight then it open into long dazzling sun-bright vista where the hue of the oleander pomegranate and white rise make the eye wink with they gorgeous profusion the mountain we cross be cover with thicket of myrtle mastic daphne and arbutus and all the valley and slope mead wave with fig mulberry and olive tree look towards the sea the valley broaden out between mountain range whose summit be lose in the cloud though the soil be not so rich as in palestine the general aspect of the country be much wilder and more luxuriant so by this glorious lane over the myrtled hill and down into valley whose bed be one hue of rose from the blossom oleander we travel for five hour cross the low range of hill through which the oronte force he way to the sea at last we reach a height overlook the valley of the river and saw in the east at the foot of the mountain chain the long line of barracks build by ibrahim pasha for the defense of antioch behind they the ancient wall of the city clomb the mountain whose crest it follow to the last peak of the chain from the next hill we see the city -- a large extent of one-story house with tiled roof surround with garden and half bury in the foliage of sycamore it extend from the river oronte which wash its wall up the slope of the mountain to the crag of gray rock which overhang it we cross the river by a massive old bridge and enter the town ride along the rill of filth which traverse the street form they central avenue we pass through several line of bazaar to a large and dreary-looking khan the keeper of which give we the best vacant chamber -- a narrow place full of flea antioch present not even a shadow of its former splendor except the great wall ten to fifteen mile in circuit which the turk have do they best to destroy every vestige of the old city have disappear the house be all of one story on account of earthquake from which antioch have suffer more than any other city in the world at one time during the middle age it lose 120000 inhabitant in one day its situation be magnificent and the modern town notwithstanding its filth wear a bright and busy aspect situate at the base of a lofty mountain it overlook towards the east a plain thirty or forty mile in length produce the most abundant harvest a great number of the inhabitant be worker in wood and leather and very thrifty and cheerful people they appear to be we remain until the next day at noon by which time a gray-bearded scamp the chief of the _ mukkairee _ or muleteer succeed in get we five miserable beast for the journey to aleppo on leave the city we travel along a former street of antioch part of the ancient pavement still remain and after two mile come to the old wall of circuit which we pass by a massive gateway of roman time it be now call _ bab boulo _ or st paul 's gate christianity it will be remember be plant in antioch by paul and barnaba and the apostle peter be the first bishop of the city we now enter the great plain of the oronte -- a level sea rioting in the wealth of its ripening harvest the river line with luxuriant thicket meander through the center of this glorious picture we cross it during the afternoon and keep on we eastward course encamp at night in a meadow near the tent of some wander turcoman who furnish we with butter and milk from they herd leave the plain the next morning we travel due east all day over long stony range of mountain inclose only one valley which bear evidence of great fertility it be circular about ten mile in its greater diameter and bound on the north by the broad peak of djebel saman or mount st simon in the morning we pass a ruin castle standing in a dry treeless dell among the hot hill the muleteer call it the maiden 's palace and say that it be build long ago by a powerful sultan as a prison for he daughter for several hour thereafter we road be line with remains of building apparently date from the time of the greek empire there be tomb temple of massive masonry though in a bad style of architecture and long row of arched chamber which resemble store-house they be all more or less shatter by earthquake but in one place i notice twenty such arch each of at least twenty foot span all-the hill on either hand as far as we could see be cover with the remains of building in the plain of st simon i see two superb pillar apparently part of a portico or gateway and the village of dana be form almost entirely of church and convent of the lower empire there be but few inscription and these i could not read but the whole of this region would no doubt richly repay a antiquarian research i be tell here that the entire chain of hill which extend southward for more than a hundred mile abound with similar remains and that in many place whole city stand almost entire as if recently desert by they inhabitant during the afternoon we come upon a portion of the ancient road from antioch to aleppo which be still as perfect as when first construct it cross a very stony ridge and be much the finest specimen of road-making i ever see quite put to shame the appian and flaminian way at rome it be twenty foot wide and lay with block of white marble from two to four foot square it be apparently raise upon a more ancient road which diverge here and there from the line show the deeply-cut trace of the roman chariot-wheel in the barren depths of the mountain we find every hour cistern cut in the rock and fill with water leave by the winter rain many of they however be fast dry up and a month later this will be a desert road towards night we descend from the hill upon the plain of keftin which stretch south-westward from aleppo till the mountain-stream which fertilize it be dry up when it be merge into the syrian desert its northern edge along which we travel be cover with field of wheat cotton and castor-bean we stop all night at a village call taireb plant at the foot of a tumulus older than tradition the people be in great dread of the aneyzeh arab who come in from the desert to destroy they harvest and carry off they cattle they want we to take a guard but after we experience on the anti-lebanon we feel safer without one yesterday we travel for seven hour over a wide rolling country now waste and barren but formerly cover with wealth and support a abundant population evidence of which be find in the building everywhere scatter over the hill on and on we toil in the heat over this inhospitable wilderness and though we know aleppo must be very near yet we could see neither sign of cultivation nor inhabitant finally about three o'clock the top of a line of shatter wall and the point of some minaret issue out of the earth several mile in front of we and on climb a glaring chalky ridge the renowned city burst at once upon we view it fill a wide hollow or basin among the white hill against which its whiter house and dome glimmer for mile in the dead dreary heat of the afternoon scarcely relieve by the narrow belt of garden on the nearer side or the orchard of pistachio tree beyond in the center of the city rise a steep abrupt mound crown with the remains of the ancient citadel and shine minaret shoot up singly or in cluster around its base the prevail hue of the landscape be a whitish-gray and the long stately city and long monotonous hill gleam with equal brilliancy under a sky of cloudless and intense blue this singular monotony of color give a wonderful effect to the view which be one of the most remarkable in all the orient chapter xv life in aleppo we entry into aleppo -- we be conduct to a house -- we unexpected welcome -- the mystery explain -- aleppo -- its name -- its situation -- the trade of aleppo -- the christian -- the revolt of 1850 -- present appearance of the city -- visit to osman pasha -- the citadel -- view from the battlements -- society in

_ Tuesday June _ 8 1852 we entry into aleppo be a fitting preliminary to we experience during the five day we have spend here after pass a blackamoor who act as a advanced guard of the custom house at a ragged tent outside of the city and bribe he with two piastre we cross the narrow line of garden on the western side and enter the street there be many coffee-house fill with smoker nearly all of whom accost we in turkish though arabic be the prevail language here ignorance make we discourteous and we slight every attempt to open a conversation out of the narrow street of the suburb we advance to the bazaar in order to find a khan where we could obtain lodgings all the best khan however be fill and we be about to take a very inferior room when a respectable individual come up to françois and say : the house be ready for the traveller and i will show you the way we be a little surprised at this address but follow he to a neat quiet and pleasant street near the bazaar where we be usher into a spacious court-yard with a row of apartment open upon it and tell to make ourselves at home the place have evidently be recently inhabit for the room be well furnished with not only divan but bed in the frank style a lean kitten be scratch at one of the window to the great danger of overturn a pair of narghileh a tame sea-gull be walk about the court and two sheep bleat in a stable at the further end in the kitchen we not only find a variety of utensil but egg salt pepper and other condiment we guide have leave and the only information we could get from a dye establishment next door be that the occupant have go into the country take the good the god provide thee be my rule in such case and as we be very hungry we set françois to work at prepare dinner we arrange a divan in the open air have a table bring out and by the aid of the baker in the bazaar and the store which the kitchen supply soon rejoice over a very palatable meal the romantic character of we reception make the dinner a merry one it be a chapter out of the arabian night and be he genie or afrite caliph or merchant of bassora into whose hand we have fall we resolve to let the adventure take its course we be just finish a nondescript pastry which françois find at a baker 's and which for want of a better name he call _ méringues à la khorassan _ when there be a loud knock at the street door we feel at first some little trepidation but determine to maintain we place and gravely invite the real master to join we it be a female servant however who to we great amazement make a profound salutation and seem delighted to see we my master do not expect you excellency to-day he have go into the garden but will soon return will you excellency take coffee after you dinner and coffee be forthwith serve the old woman be unremitting in she attention and she son a boy of eight year and the most venerable child i ever see entertain we with the description of a horse which he master have just buy -- a horse which have cost two thousand piastre and be ninety year old well this aleppo be a extraordinary place be my first impression and the inhabitant be remarkable people but i wait the master 's arrival as the only means of solve the mystery about dusk there be another rap at the door a lady dress in white with a indian handkerchief bind over she black hair arrive pray excuse we say she we think you would not reach here before to-morrow but my brother will come directly in fact the brother do come soon afterwards and greet we with a still warmer welcome before leave the garden he say i hear of you arrival and have come in a full gallop the whole way in order to put a end to this comedy of error i declare at once that he be mistaken nobody in aleppo could possibly know of we come and we be perhaps transgress on he hospitality but no : he would not be convince he be a dragoman to the english consulate he master have tell he we would be here the next day and he must be prepare to receive we besides the janissary of the consulate have show we the way to he house we therefore let the matter rest until next morning when we call on mr very the consul who inform we that the janissary have mistake we for two gentleman we have meet in damascus the travel companion of lord dalkeith as they have not arrive he beg we to remain in the quarter which have be prepare for they we have every reason to be glad of this mistake as it have make we acquaint with one of the most courteous and hospitable gentleman in the east aleppo lie so far out of the usual route of travel that it be rarely visit by european one be not therefore as in the case of damascus prepared beforehand by volume of description which preclude all possibility of mistake or surprise for my part i only know that aleppo have once be the greatest commercial city of the orient though its power have long since pass into other hand but there be certain stately association linger around the name which draw I towards it and oblige I to include it at all hazard in my asiatic tour the scanty description of captain irby and mangle the only one i have read give I no distinct idea of its position or appearance and when the other day i first see it loom grand and gray among the gray hill more like a vast natural crystallization than the product of human art i revel in the novelty of that startling first impression the tradition of the city 's name be curious and worth relate it be call in arabic _ haleb el-shahba _ -- aleppo the gray -- which most person suppose to refer to the prevail color of the soil the legend however go much farther _ haleb _ which the venetian and genoese soften into aleppo mean literally : have milk accord to arab tradition the patriarch abraham once live here : he tent be pitch near the mound now occupy by the citadel he have a certain gray cow -lrb- _ el-shahba _ -rrb- which be milk every morning for the benefit of the poor when therefore it be proclaim : _ ibrahim haleb el-shahba _ -lrb- abraham have milk the gray cow -rrb- all the poor of the tribe come up to receive they share the repetition of this morning call attach itself to the spot and become the name of the city which be afterwards found aleppo be build on the eastern slope of a shallow upland basin through which flow the little river koweik there be low hill to the north and south between which the country fall into a wide monotonous plain extend unbroken to the euphrate the city be from eight to ten mile in circuit and though not so thickly populated cover a greater extent of space than damascus the population be estimate at 100000 in the excellence -lrb- not the elegance -rrb- of its architecture it surpass any oriental city i have yet see the house be all of hew stone frequently three and even four story in height and build in a most massive and durable style on account of the frequency of earthquake the street be well paved clean with narrow sidewalk and less tortuous and intricate than the bewildering alley of damascus a large part of the town be occupy with bazaar attest the splendor of its former commerce these establishment be cover with lofty vault of stone light from the top and one may walk for mile beneath the spacious roof the shop exhibit all the stuff of the east especially of persium and indium there be also a extensive display of european fabric as the eastern province of asiatic turkey as far as baghdad be supply entirely from aleppo and trebizond within ten year -- in fact since the ally power drive ibrahim pasha out of syrium -- the trade of aleppo have increase at the expense of damascus the tribe of the desert who be hold in check during the egyptian occupancy be now so unruly that much of the commerce between the latter place and baghdad go northward to mosul and thence by a safer road to this city the khan of which there be a great number build on a scale accord with the former magnificence of aleppo be nearly all fill and persian georgian and armenian merchant again make they appearance in the bazaar the principal manufacture carry on be the making of shoe -lrb- which indeed be a prominent branch in every turkish city -rrb- and the weave of silk and golden tissue two long bazaar be entirely occupy with shoe-shop and there be nearly a quarter of a mile of confectionery embrace more variety than i ever see or imagine possible i see yesterday the operation of weave silk and gold which be a very slow process the warp and the body of the woof be of purple silk the loom only differ from the old hand-loom in general use in have some thirty or forty contrivance for lift the thread of the warp so as to form by variation certain pattern the gold thread by which the pattern be work be contain in twenty small shuttle thrust by hand under the different parcel of the warp as they be raise by a boy train for that purpose who sit on the top of the loom the fabric be very brilliant in its appearance and sell as the weaver inform I at 100 piastre per _ pik _ -- about $ 7 per yard we have letter to mr ford a american missionary establish here and signor di picciotto who act as american vice-consul both gentleman have be very cordial in they offer of service and by they aid we have be enable to see something of aleppo life and society mr ford who have be here four year have a pleasant residence at jedaida a christian suburb of the city he congregation number some fifty or sixty proselyte who be mostly from the schismatic sect of the armenian dr smith who establish the mission at ain-tab -lrb- two day ' journey north of this -rrb- where he die last year be very successful among these sect and the congregation there amount to nine hundred the sultan a year ago issue a firman permit he christian subject to erect house of worship but although this be proclaim in constantinople and much laud in europe as a act of great generosity and tolerance there have be no official promulgation of it here so of the aid which the turkish government be say to have afford to its destitute christian subject whose house be sack during the fanatical rebellion of 1850 the world praise the sultan 's charity and love of justice while the sufferer to this day lack the first experience of it but for the spontaneous relief contribute in europe and among the christian community of the levant the amount of misery would have be frightful to feridj pasha who be at present the commander of the force here be mainly due the credit of have put down the rebel with a strong hand there be but few troops in the city at the time of the outbreak and as the insurgent who be compose of the turkish and arab population be in league with the aneyzeh of the desert the least falter or delay would have lead to a universal massacre of the christian fortunately the troops be divide into two portion one occupy the barracks on a hill north of the city and the other a mere corporal 's guard of a dozen man post in the citadel the leader of the outbreak go to the latter and offer he a large sum of money -lrb- the spoil of christian house -rrb- to give up the fortress with a loyalty to he duty truly miraculous among the turk he order he man to fire upon they and they beat a hasty retreat the quarter of the insurgent lay precisely between the barracks and the citadel and by order of feridj pasha a cannonade be immediately open on it from both point it be not however until many house have be batter down and a still larger number destroy by fire that the rebel be bring to submission they ally the aneyzeh appear on the hill east of aleppo to the number of five or six thousand but a few well-directed cannon-ball tell they what they might expect and they speedily retreat two or three hundred christian family lose nearly all of they property during the sack and many be leave entirely destitute the house in which mr ford life be plunder of jewel and furniture to the amount of 400000 piastre -lrb- $ 20000 -rrb- the robber it be say be amaze at the amount of spoil they find the government make some feeble effort to recover it but the greater part be already sell and scatter through a thousand hand and the unfortunate christian have only receive about seven per cent of they loss the burnt quarter have since be rebuild and i notice several christian occupy shop in various part of it but many family who flee at the time still remain in various part of syrium afraid to return to they home the aneyzeh and other desert tribe have latterly become more daring than ever even in the immediate neighborhood of the city the inhabitant be so fearful of they that all the grain be bring up to the very wall to be thresh the burying-grounds on both side be now turn into threshing-floor and all day long the turkish peasant drive they heavy sled around among the tomb-stone on the second day after we arrival we pay a visit to osman pasha governor of the city and province of aleppo we go in state accompany by the consul with two janissary in front bearing silver mace and a dragoman behind the _ seraï _ or palace be a large plain wooden building and a group of soldier about the door with a shabby carriage in the court be the only token of its character we be usher at once into the presence of the pasha who be a man of about seventy year with a good-humored though shrewd face he be quite cordial in he manners compliment we on we turkish costume and vaunt he skill in physiognomy which at once reveal to he that we belong to the highest class of american nobility in fact in the firman which he have since send we we be mention as noble he invite we to pass a day or two with he say that he should derive much benefit from we superior knowledge we reply that such a intercourse could only benefit ourselves as he greater experience and the distinguished wisdom which have make he name long since familiar to we ear preclude the hope of we being of any service to he after half a hour 's stay during which we be regale with jewelled pipe exquisite mocha coffee and sherbet breathing of the garden of gülistan we take we leave the pasha send a officer to show we the citadel we pass around the moat to the entrance on the western side consist of a bridge and double gateway the fortress as i have already state occupy the crest of a elliptical mound about one thousand foot by six hundred and two hundred foot in height it be entirely encompass by the city and form a prominent and picturesque feature in the distant view thereof formerly it be thickly inhabit and at the time of the great earthquake of 1822 there be three hundred family live within the wall nearly all of whom perish the outer wall be very much shatter on that occasion but the enormous tower and the gateway the grandest specimen of saracenic architecture in the east still remain entire this gateway by which we enter be colossal in its proportion the outer entrance through wall ten foot thick admit we into a lofty vestibule line with marble and contain many ancient inscription in mosaic over the main portal which be adorn with sculptured lion ' head there be a tablet state that the fortress be build by el melek el ashraf -lrb- the holiest of king -rrb- after which follow : prosperity to the true believer -- death to the infidel a second tablet show that it be afterwards repair by mohammed ebn-berkook who i believe be one of the fatimite caliph the shekh of the citadel who accompany we state the age of the structure at nine hundred year which as nearly as i can recollect the saracenic chronology be correct he call we attention to number of iron arrow-head stick in the solid masonry -- the mark of ancient siege before leave we be present with a bundle of arrow from the armory -- undoubted relic of saracen warfare the citadel be now a mass of ruin have be desert since the earthquake grass be grow on the rampart and the caper plant with its white-and-purple blossom flourish among the pile of rubbish since the late rebellion however a small military barrack have be build and two company of soldier be station there we walk around the wall which command a magnificent view of the city and the wide plain to the south and east it well deserve to rank with the panorama of cairo from the citadel and that of damascus from the anti-lebanon in extent picturesqueness and rich oriental character out of the gray ring of the city which inclose the mound rise the great white dome and the whiter minaret of its numerous mosque many of which be grand and impose structure the course of the river through the center of the picture be mark by a belt of the greenest verdure beyond which to the west rise a chain of naked red hill and still further fading on the horizon the blue summit of mt st simon and the coast range of akma dagh eastward over vast orchard of pistachio tree the barren plain of the euphrate fade away to a glimmer hot horizon look downward on the heart of the city i be surprise to see a number of open grassy tract out of which here and there small tree be grow but perceive what appear to be subterranean entrance at various point i find that these tract be upon the roof of the house and bazaar verify what i have frequently hear that in aleppo the inhabitant visit they friend in different part of the city by pass over the roof of the house previous to the earthquake of 1822 these vast roof-plain be cultivate as garden and present a extent of airy bower as large if not as magnificent as the renowned hanging garden of ancient babylon accompany by signor di picciotto we spend two or three day in visit the house of the principal jewish and christian family in aleppo we find it be true no such splendor as in damascus but more solid and durable architecture and a more chastened elegance of taste the building be all of hew stone the court-yard pave with marble and the wall rich with gilding and carve wood some of the larger dwelling have small but beautiful garden attach to they we be everywhere receive with the greatest hospitality and the visit be consider as a favor rather than a intrusion indeed i be frequently oblige to run the risk of give offence by decline the refreshment which be offer we each round of visit be a feat of strength and we be oblige to desist from sheer inability to support more coffee rose-water pipe and aromatic sweetmeat the character of society in aleppo be singular its very life and essence be etiquette the law which govern it be more inviolable than those of the mede and persian the question of precedence among the different family be adjust by the most delicate scale and rigorously adhere to in the most trifling matter even we humble voyager as we be have be oblige to regulate we conduct accord to it after we have visit certain family certain other would have be deeply mortified have we neglect to call upon they formerly when a traveller arrive here he be expect to call upon the different consul in the order of they established precedence : the austrian first english second french third & c after this he be oblige to stay at home several day to give the consul a opportunity of return the visit which they make in the same order there be a diplomatic importance about all he movement and the least violation of etiquette through ignorance or neglect be the town talk for day this peculiarity in society be evidently a relic of the formal time when aleppo be a semi-venetian city and the opulent seat of eastern commerce many of the inhabitant be descend from the trader of those time and they all speak the _ lingua franca _ or levantine italian the woman wear a costume partly turkish and partly european combine the grace of both it be in my eye the most beautiful dress in the world they wear a rich scarf of some dark color on the head which on festive occasion be almost conceal by they jewel and the heavy scarlet pomegranate blossom which adorn they dark hair a turkish vest and sleeve of embroidered silk open in front and a skirt of white or some light color complete the costume the jewess wear in addition a short turkish _ caftan _ and full trousers gather at the ankle at a ball give by mr very the english consul which we attend all the christian beauty of aleppo be present there be a fine display of diamond many of the lady wear several thousand dollar ' worth on they head the peculiar etiquette of the place be again illustrate on this occasion the custom be that the music must be hear for at least one hour before the guest come the hour appoint be eight but when we go there at nine nobody have arrive as it be generally suppose that the ball be give on we account several of the family have servant in the neighborhood to watch we arrival and accordingly we have not be there five minute before the guest crowd through the door in large number when the first dance -lrb- a arab dance perform by two lady at a time -rrb- be propose the wife of the french and spanish consul be first lead or rather drag out when a lady be ask to dance she invariably refuse she be ask a second and a third time and if the gentleman do not solicit most earnestly and use some gentle force in get she upon the floor she never forgive he at one of the jewish house which we visit the wedding festivity of one of the daughter be be celebrate we be welcome with great cordiality and immediately usher into the room of state a elegant apartment overlook the garden below the city wall half the room be occupy by a raise platform with a divan of blue silk cushion here the lady recline in superb dress of blue pink and gold while the gentleman be range on the floor below they all rise at we entrance and we be conduct to seat among the lady pipe and perfumed drink be serve and the bridal cake make of twenty-six different fruit be present on a golden salver we fair neighbor some of whom literally blaze with jewel be strikingly beautiful presently the bride appear at the door and we all rise and remain standing as she advance support on each side by the two _ shebeeniyeh _ or bridesmaid she be about sixteen slight and graceful in appearance though not decidedly beautiful and be attire with the utmost elegance she dress be a pale blue silk heavy with gold embroidery and over she long dark hair she neck bosom and wrist play a thousand rainbow gleam from the jewel which cover they the jewish musician seat at the bottom of the hall strike up a loud rejoice harmony on they violin guitar and dulcimer and the woman servant group at the door utter in chorus that wild shrill cry which accompany all such festival in the east the bride be careful to preserve the decorum expect of she by speak no word nor lose the sad resigned expression of she countenance she ascend to the divan bow to each of we with a low reverential inclination and seat herself on the cushion the music and dance last some time accompany by the _ zughàreet _ or cry of the woman which be repeat with double force when we rise to take leave the whole company wait on we to the street door and one of the servant station in the court shout some long sing-song phrase after we as we pass out i could not learn the word but be tell that it be a invocation of prosperity upon we in return for the honor which we visit have confer in the evening i go to view a christian marriage procession which about midnight convey the bride to the house of the bridegroom the house it appear be too small to receive all the friend of the family and i join a large number of they who repair to the terrace of the english consulate to greet the procession as it pass the first person who appear be a company of buffoon after they four janissary carry silver mace then the male friend bear color lantern and perfumed torch raise on gilded pole then the female among whom i see some beautiful madonna face in the torchlight and finally the bride herself cover from head to foot with a veil of cloth of gold and urge along by two maiden : for it be the etiquette of such occasion that the bride should resist be take and must be force every step of the way so that she be frequently three hour in go the distance of a mile we watch the procession a long time wind away through the street -- a line of torch and song and incense and noisy jubilee -- under the sweet starlit heaven the other evening signor di picciotto mount we from he fine arabian stud and we ride around the city outside of the suburb the sun be low and a pale yellow lustre touch the cluster of minaret that rise out of the stately mass of building and the bare chalky hill to the north after leave the garden on the bank of the koweik we come upon a dreary waste of ruin among which the antiquarian find trace of the ancient aleppo of the greek the mongolian conqueror of the middle age and the saracen who succeed they there be many mosque and tomb which be once impose specimen of saracenic art but now split and shiver by war and earthquake be slowly tumble into utter decay on the south-eastern side of the city its chalk foundation have be hollow into vast arched cavern which extend deep into the earth pillar have be leave at regular interval to support the mass above and they huge dim labyrinth resemble the crypt of some great cathedral they be now use as rope-walk and fill with cheerful workman we last excursion be to a country-house of signor di picciotto in the garden of babalum about four mile from aleppo we set out in the afternoon on we arabian with we host 's son on a large white donkey of the baghdad breed pass the turkish cemetery where we stop to view the tomb of general bem we loosen rein and speed away at full gallop over the hot white hill in dash down a stony rise the ambitious donkey who be do he best to keep up with the horse fall hurl master picciotto over he head the boy be bruise a little but set he tooth together and show no sign of pain mount again and follow we the garden of babalum be a wilderness of fruit-tree like those of damascus signor p 's country-house be bury in a wild grove of apricot fig orange and pomegranate-tree a large marble tank in front of the open arched _ liwan _ supply it with water we mount to the flat roof and watch the sunset fade from the beautiful landscape beyond the bower of dazzling greenness which surround we stretch the wide gray hill the minaret of aleppo and the wall of its castled mount shone rosily in the last ray of the sun a old palace of the pasha with the long low barracks of the soldiery crown the top of a hill to the north dark spiry cypress betray the place of tomb and to the west beyond the bare red peak of mount st simon rise the faint blue outline of giaour dagh whose mural chain divide syrium from the plain of cilicium as the twilight deepen over the scene there come a long melodious cry of passion and of sorrow from the heart of a starry-flowered pomegranate tree in the garden other voice answer it from the garden around until not one but fifty nightingale charm the repose of the hour they vie with each other in they burst of passionate music each strain soar over the last or unite with other near and far in a chorus of the divinest pathos -- a expression of sweet unutterable unquenchable longing it be a ecstasy yet a pain to listen away say jean paul to music : thou tellest I of that which i have not and never can have -- which i forever seek and never find but space fail I to describe half the incident of we stay in aleppo there be two thing peculiar to the city however which i must not omit mention one be the aleppo button a singular ulcer which attack every person bear in the city and every stranger who spend more than a month there it can neither be prevent nor cure and always last for a year the inhabitant almost invariably have it on the face -- either on the cheek forehead or tip of the nose -- where it often leave a indelible and disfiguring scar stranger on the contrary have it on one of the joint either the elbow wrist knee or ankle so strictly be its visitation confine to the city proper that in none of the neighbor village nor even in a distant suburb be it known physician have vainly attempt to prevent it by inoculation and be at a loss to what cause to ascribe it we be liable to have it even after five day ' stay but i hope it will postpone its appearance until after i reach home the other remarkable thing here be the hospital for cat this be found long ago by a rich cat-loving mussulman and be one of the best endowed institution in the city a old mosque be appropriate to the purpose under the charge of several director and here sick cat be nurse homeless cat find shelter and decrepit cat gratefully purr away they decline year the whole category embrace several hundred and it be quite a sight to behold the court the corridor and terrace of the mosque swarm with they here one with a bruised limb be receive a cataplasm there a cataleptic patient be tenderly care for and so on through the long concatenation of feline disease aleppo moreover rejoice in a greater number of cat than even jerusalem at a rough guess i should thus state the population of the city : turk and arab 70000 christian of all denomination 15000 jew 10000 dog 12000 and cat 8000 among other person whom i have meet here be ferhat pasha formerly general stein hungarian minister of war and governor of transylvanium he accept moslemism with bem and other and now rejoice in he circumcision and 7000 piastre a month he be a fat companionable sort of man who by he own confession never labor very zealously for the independence of hungary be a austrian by birth he converse with I for several hour on the scene in which he have participate and attribute the failure of the hungarian to the want of material mean general bem who die here be speak of with the utmost respect both by turk and christian the former have honor he with a large tomb or mausoleum cover with a dome but i must close leave half unsaid suffice it to say that no oriental city have interest I so profoundly as aleppo and in none have i receive such universal and cordial hospitality we leave to-morrow for asia minor have engage man and horse for the whole route to constantinople chapter xvi through the syrian gate a inauspicious departure -- the ruin church of st

1852 we leave aleppo on the morning of the 9th under circumstance not the most promising for the harmony of we journey we have engage horse and baggage-mule from the _ capidji _ or chief of the muleteer and in order to be certain of have animal that would not break down on the way make a particular selection from a number that be bring we when about leave the city however we discover that one of the horse have be change signor di picciotto who accompany we past the custom-house barrier immediately dispatch the delinquent muleteer to bring back the true horse and the latter make a farce of try to find he lead the consul and the capidjus -lrb- who i believe be at the bottom of the cheat -rrb- a wild-goose chase over the hill around aleppo where of course the animal be not to be see when at length we have wait three hour and have wander about four mile from the city we give up the search take leave of the consul and go on with the new horse we proper plan would have be to pitch the tent and refuse to move till the matter be settle the animal as we discover during the first day 's journey be hopelessly lame and we only add to the difficulty by take he we ride westward all day over barren and stony hill meet with abundant trace of the power and prosperity of this region during the time of the greek emperor the nevastation work by earthquake have be terrible there be scarcely a wall or arch standing which do not bear mark of have be violently shake the wall inclose the fig-orchard near the village contain many stone with greek inscription and fragment of cornice we encamp the first night on the plain at the foot of mount st simon and not far from the ruin of the celebrated church of the same name the building stand in a stony wilderness at the foot of the mountain it be about a hundred foot long and thirty in height with two lofty square tower in front the pavement of the interior be entirely conceal by the mass of pillar capital and hew block that lie heap upon it the window which be of the tall narrow arched form common in byzantine church have a common moulding which fall like a mantle over and between they the general effect of the church be very fine though there be much inelegance in the sculptured detail at the extremity be a half-dome of massive stone over the place of the altar and just in front of this formerly stand the pedestal whereon accord to tradition st simeon stylite commence he pillar-life i find a recent excavation at the spot but no pedestal which have probably be carry off by the greek monk beside the church stand a large building with a upper and lower balcony support by square stone pillar around three side there be also a paved court-yard a large cistern cut in the rock and numerous out-building all go to confirm the supposition of its have be a monastery the main building be three story high with pointed gable and bear a strong resemblance to a american summer hotel with veranda several ancient fig and walnut tree be grow among the ruin and add to they picturesque appearance the next day we cross a broad chain of hill to the plain of antioch which we reach near its northern extremity in one of the valley through which the road lay we see a number of hot sulphur spring some of they of a considerable volume of water not far from they be a beautiful fountain of fresh and cold water gush from the foot of a high rock soon after reach the plain we cross the stream of kara su which feed the lake of antioch this part of the plain be low and swampy and the stream be literally alive with fish while pass over the bridge i see many hundred from one to two foot in length we wander through the marshy meadow for two or three hour and towards sunset reach a turcoman encampment where the ground be dry enough to pitch we tent the rude tribe receive we hospitably and send we milk and cheese in abundance i visit the tent of the shekh who be very courteous but as he know no language but turkish we conversation be restricted to sign the tent be of camel 's - hair cloth spacious and open at the side a rug be spread for I and the shekh 's wife bring I a pipe of tolerable tobacco the household be seat upon the ground chat pleasantly with one another and apparently not in the least disturb by my presence one of the shekh 's son who be deaf and dumb come and sit before I and describe by very expressive sign the character of the road to scanderoon he give I to understand that there be robber in the mountain with many grim gesture descriptive of stab and firing musket the mosquito be so thick during the night that we be oblige to fill the tent with smoke in order to sleep when morning come we fancy there would be a relief for we but it only bring a worse pest in the shape of swarm of black gnat similar to those which so torment I in nubium i know of no infliction so terrible as these gnat which you can not drive away and which assail ear eye and nostril in such quantity that you become mad and desperate in you effort to eject they through glen fill with oleander we ascend the first slope of akma dagh the mountain range which divide the gulf of scanderoon from the plain of antioch then pass a natural terrace cover with grove of oak we road take the mountain side climb upward in the shadow of pine and wild olive tree and between bank of bloom lavender and myrtle we see two or three company of armed guard station by the road-side for the mountain be infested with robber and a caravan have be plunder only three day before the view look backward take in the whole plain with the lake of antioch glittering in the center the valley of the oronte in the south and the lofty cone of djebel-okrab far to the west as we approach the summit violent gust of wind blow through the pass with such force as almost to overturn we horse here the road from antioch join that from aleppo and both for some distance retain the ancient pavement from the western side we see the sea once more and go down through the _ pylæ syriæ _ or syrian gate as this defile be call by the roman it be very narrow and rugged with a abrupt descent in a hour from the summit we come upon a aqueduct of a triple row of arch cross the gorge it be still use to carry water to the town of beilan which hang over the mouth of the pass half a mile below this be one of the most picturesque spot in syrium the house cling to the side and cluster on the summit of precipitous crag and every shelf of soil every crevice where a tree can thrust its root uphold a mass of brilliant vegetation water be the life of the place it gush into the street from exhaustless fountain it trickle from the terrace in shower of misty drop it tumble into the gorge in sparkling stream and everywhere it nourish a life as bright and beautiful as its own the fruit tree be of enormous size and the crag be curtain with a magnificent drapery of vine this green gateway open suddenly upon another cut through a glittering mass of micaceous rock whence one look down on the town and gulf of scanderoon the coast of karamanium beyond and the distant snow of the taurus we descend through grove of pine and oak and in three hour more reach the shore scanderoon be the most unhealthy place on the syrian coast owe to the malaria from a marsh behind it the inhabitant be a wretched pallid set who be visit every year with devastate fever the marsh be partly drain some forty year ago by the turkish government and a few thousand dollar would be sufficient to remove it entirely and make the place -- which be of some importance as the seaport of aleppo -- healthy and habitable at present there be not five hundred inhabitant and half of these consist of the turkish garrison and the person attach to the different vice-consulate the street be depository of filth and pool of stagnant water on all side exhale the most fetid odor near the town be the ruin of a castle build by godfrey of bouillon we march directly down to the sea-shore and pitch we tent close beside the wave as the place most free from malaria there be a dozen vessel at anchor in the road and one of they prove to be the american bark columbium capt taylor we take a skiff and go on board where we be cordially welcome by the mate in the evening the captain come to we tent quite surprised to find two wander american in such a lonely corner of the world soon afterwards with true seaman-like generosity he return bring a jar of fine spanish olive and a large bottle of pickle which he insist on add to we supplies the olive have the choicest andalusian flavor and the pickle lose none of they relish from have be put up in new york the road from scanderoon to this place lie mostly along the shore of the gulf at the foot of akma dagh and be reckon dangerous on account of the maraud band of koord who infest the mountain these people like the drus have rebel against the conscription and will probably hold they ground with equal success though the turk talk loudly of invade they stronghold two week ago the post be rob about ten mile from scanderoon and a government vessel now lie at anchor in the bay open a cannonade on the plunderer before they could be secure in consequence of the warning of danger in everybody 's mouth we decide to take a escort and therefore wait upon the commander of the force with the firman of the pasha of aleppo a convoy of two soldier be at once promise we and at sunrise next morning they take the lead of we caravan in order to appear more formidable in case we should meet with robber we put on we frank pantaloons which have no other effect than to make the heat more intolerable but we form rather a fierce cavalcade six armed man in all we road follow the shore of the bay have a narrow uninhabited flat cover with thicket of myrtle and mastic between we and the mountain the two soldier more valiant than the guard of bania ride in advance and show no sign of fear as we approach the suspicious place the morning be delightfully clear and the snow-crowned range of taurus shone through the soft vapor hang over the gulf in one place we skirt the shore for some distance under a bank twenty foot in height and so completely mantle with shrubbery that a small army might have hide in it there be gulley at interval open suddenly on we path and we look up they expect every moment to see the gleam of a koordish gun-barrel or a turcoman spear above the top of the myrtle cross a promontory which make out from the mountain we come upon the renowned plain of issus where darius lose he kingdom to alexander on a low cliff overhang the sea there be the remains of a single tower of gray stone the people in scanderoon call it jonah 's pillar and say that it mark the spot where the ninevite be cast ashore by the whale -lrb- this make three place on the syrian coast where jonah be vomit forth -rrb- the plain of issus be from two to three mile long but not more than half a mile wide it be traverse by a little river suppose to be the pinarus which come down through a tremendous cleft in the akma dagh the ground seem too small for the battle-field of such army as be engage on the occasion it be bound on the north by a low hill separate it from the plain of baïas and it be possible that alexander may have make choice of this position leave the unwieldy force of darius to attack he from the plain he advantage would be greater on account of the long narrow form of the ground which would prevent he from be engage with more than a small portion of the persian army at one time the plain be now roseate with bloom oleander but almost entirely uncultivated about midway there be the remains of a ancient quay jut into the sea soon after leave the field of issus we reach the town of baïas which be pleasantly situate on the shore at the mouth of a river whose course through the plain be mark with row of tall poplar tree the wall of the town and the white dome and minaret of its mosque rise dazzlingly against the dark blue of the sea and the purple stretch of the mountain of karamania a single palm lift its crest in the foreground we dismount for breakfast under the shade of a old bridge which cross the river it be a charming spot the bank above and below be overhang with oleander white rise honeysuckle and clemati the two guardsman finish the remain half of we turcoman cheese and almost exhaust we supply of bread i give one of they a cigar which he be at a loss how to smoke until we muleteer show he baïas be celebrate fifty year ago as the residence of the robber chief kutchuk alus who for a long time brave the authority of the porte itself he be in the habit of levy a yearly tribute on the caravan to mecca and the better to enforce he claim often suspend two or three of he captive at the gate of the town a day or two before the caravan arrive several expedition be send against he but he always succeed in bribe the commander who on they return to constantinople make such representation that kutchuk alus instead of be punish receive one dignity after another until finally he attain the rank of a pasha of two tail this embolden he to commit enormity too great to be overlook and in 1812 baïas be take and the atrocious nest of land-pirates break up i know that the town have be sack on this occasion but be not prepare to find such a complete picture of desolation the place be surround with a substantial wall with two gateway on the north and south a bazaar cover with a lofty vaulted roof of stone run directly through from gate to gate and there be still a smell of spice in the air on enter the massive shop on either hand with they open door invite possession and might readily be make habitable again the great iron gate lead from the bazaar into the khan and court still swing on they rusty hinge we ride into the court of the mosque which be surround with a light and elegant corridor support by pillar the grass have as yet but partially invade the marble pavement and a stone drinking-trough still stand in the center i urge my horse up the step and into the door of the mosque it be in the form of a greek cross with a dome in the center rest on four very elegant pointed arch there be a elaborately gilded and painted gallery of wood over the entrance and the pulpit opposite be as well preserve as if the _ mollah _ have just leave it out of the mosque we pass into a second court and then over a narrow bridge into the fortress the moat be perfect and the wall as complete as if just erect only the bottom be dry and now cover with a thicket of wild pomegranate tree the heavy iron door of the fortress swing half open as we enter unchallenged the interior be almost entire and some of the cannon still lie bury in the spring grass the plan of the little town which appear to have be all build at one time be most admirable the wall of circuit include the fortress can not be more than 300 yard square and yet none of the characteristic of a large oriental city be omit leave baïas we travel northward over a waste though fertile plain the mountain on we right make a grand appearance with they foot mantle in myrtle and they top plume with pine they rise from the sea with a long bold sweep but each peak fall off in a precipice on the opposite side as if the chain be the barrier of the world and there be nothing but space beyond in the afternoon we leave the plain for a belt of glorious garden land make by stream that come down from the mountain we enter a lane embower in pomegranate white rise clemati and other flowering vine and shrub and overarch by superb plane lime and beech tree chained together with giant grape vine on either side be field of ripe wheat and barley mulberry orchard and grove of fruit tree under the shade of which the turkish family sit or sleep during the hot hour of the day bird sing in the bough and the gurgling of water make a cool undertone to they music out of fairyland where shall i see again such lovely bower we be glad when the soldier announce that it be necessary to encamp there as we should find no other habitation for more than twenty mile we tent be pitch under a grand sycamore beside a swift mountain stream which almost make the circuit of we camp beyond the top of the elm beech and fig grove we see the picturesque green summit of the lower range of giaour dagh in the north-east while over the southern meadow a golden gleam of sunshine lay upon the gulf of scanderoon the village near we be chaya where there be a military station the guard we have bring from scanderoon here leave we but the commanding officer advise we to take other on the morrow as the road be still consider unsafe chapter xvii adana and tarsus the black gate --

khan on mt taurus _ Saturday June _ 19 1852 we leave we camp at chaya at dawn with a escort of three soldier which we borrow from the guard station at that place the path lead along the shore through clump of myrtle beaten inland by the wind and round as smoothly as if they have be clip by a gardener 's shears as we approach the head of the gulf the peaked summit of giaour dagh 10000 foot in height appear in the north-east the stream we ford swarm with immense trout a brown hedgehog run across we road but when i touch he with the end of my pipe roll himself into a impervious ball of prickle soon after turn the head of the gulf the road swerve off to the west and enter a narrow pass between hill cover with thick copse-wood here we come upon a ancient gateway of black lava stone which bear mark of great antiquity it be now call _ kara kapu _ the black gate and some suppose it to have be one of the ancient gate of cilicium beyond this we road lead over high grassy hill without a sign of human habitation to the ruin khan of koord koolak we dismount and unloaded we baggage in the spacious stone archway and drive we beast into the dark vaulted hall behind the building be originally intend for a magazine of supplies and from the ruin mosque near it i suspect it be formerly one of the caravan station for the pilgrim from constantinople to mecca the weather be intensely hot and sultry and we animal be almost crazy from the attack of a large yellow gad-fly after the noonday heat be over we descend to the first cilician plain which be bound on the west by the range of durdun dagh as we have now pass the most dangerous part of the road we dismiss the three soldier and take but a single man with we the entire plain be cover with wild fennel six to eight foot in height and literally blaze with its bloomy yellow top ride through it i could barely look over they and far and wide on all side spread a golden sea out of which the long violet hill rise with the liveliest effect brown shine serpent from four to six foot in length frequently slide across we path the plain which must be sixty mile in circumference be wholly uncultivated though no land could possibly be richer out of the region of fennel we pass into one of red and white clover timothy grass and wild oats the thistle be so large as to resemble young palm-tree and the salsify of we garden grow rank and wild at length we dip into the evening shadow of durdun dagh and reach the village of koord keuus on he lower slope as there be no place for we tent on the rank grass of the plain or the steep side of the hill we take forcible possession of the winnowing-floor a flat terrace build up under two sycamore and still cover with the chaff of the last thresh the koord take the whole thing as a matter of course and even bring we a feel carpet to rest upon they come and seat themselves around we chat sociably while we lay in the tent-door smoking the pipe of refreshment the view over the wide golden plain and the hill beyond to the distant snow-tipped peak of akma dagh be superb as the shadow of the mountain behind we slowly lengthen over it blot out the mellow light of sunset there be many fragment of pillar and capital of white marble build up in the house show that they occupy the site of some ancient village or temple the next morning we cross durdun dagh and enter the great plain of cilicium the range after we have pass it present a grand bold broken outline blue in the morning vapor and wreathe with shift belt of cloud a stately castle call the palace of serpent on the summit of a isolate peak to the north stand out clear and high in the midst of a circle of fog like a phantom picture of the air the river jyhoon the ancient pyramus which rise on the border of armenia sweep the western base of the mountain it be a larger stream than the oronte with a deep rapid current flow at the bottom of a bed lower than the level of the plain in three hour we reach missis the ancient mopsuestium on the right bank of the river there be extensive ruin on the left bank which be probably those of the former city the soil for some distance around be scatter with broken pillar capital and hew stone the ancient bridge still cross the river but the central arch have be break away be replace with a wooden platform the modern town be a forlorn place and all the glorious plain around it be uncultivated the view over this plain be magnificent : unbounded towards the sea but on the north girdle by the sublime range of taurus whose great snow-fields gleam in the sun in the afternoon we reach the old bridge over the jyhoon at adana the eastern bank be occupy with the grave of the former inhabitant and there be at least fifteen acre of tombstone as thickly plant as the grave can be dig the field of wheat and barley along the river be very rich and at present the native be busily occupy in draw the sheaf on large sled to the open threshing-floor the city be build over a low eminence and its four tall minaret with a number of palm-tree rise from the mass of brown brick wall remind I of egypt at the end of the bridge we be meet by one of the quarantine officer who precede we take care that we touch nobody in the street to the quarantine building this land quarantine between syrium and asia minor when the former country be free from any epidemic seem a most absurd thing we be detain at adana three day and a half to be purify before proceed further lately the whole town be place in quarantine for five day because a turkish bey who live near baïas enter the gate without be notice and be find in the bazaar the quarantine building be once a palace of the pasha of adana but be now in a half-ruined condition the room be large and airy and there be a spacious open divan which afford ample shade and a cool breeze throughout the whole day fortunately for we there be only three person in quarantine who occupy a room distant from ours the inspector be a very obliging person and procure we a table and two chair the only table to be have in the whole place -- a town of 15000 inhabitant -- belong to a italian merchant who kindly give it for we use we employ a messenger to purchase provision in the bazaar and we day pass quietly in write smoking and gaze indolently from we window upon the flowery plain beyond the town we night however be torment by small white gnat which sting we unmercifully the physician of quarantine dr spagnolo be a venetian refugee and formerly editor of _ la lega italiana _ a paper publish in venice during the revolution he inform we that except the princess belgioioso who pass through adana on she way to jerusalem we be the only traveller he have see for eleven month after three day and four night of grateful because involuntary indolence dr spagnolo give we _ pratique _ and we lose no time in get under weigh again we be the only occupant of quarantine and as we move out of the portal of the old seraï at sunrise no one be guard it the inspector and mustapha the messenger take they back-sheesh with silent gratitude the plain on the west side of the town be well cultivate and as we ride along towards tarsus i be charm with the rich pastoral air of the scenery it be like one of the midland landscape of england bath in southern sunshine the beautiful level stretch away to the mountain stand golden with the field of wheat which the reaper be cut it be no longer bare but dot with orange grove clump of holly and a number of magnificent terebinth-tree whose dark round mass of foliage remind one of the northern oak cattle be grazing in the stubble and horse almost bury under load of fresh grass meet we as they pass to the city the sheaf be draw to the threshing-floor on sled and we could see the husbandman in the distance tread out and winnowing the grain over these bright busy scene rise the lesser height of the taurus and beyond they mingle in white cloud the snow of the crowning range the road to tarsus which be eight hour distant lie over a unbroken plain towards the sea there be two tumuli resemble those on the plain east of antioch stone well with trough for water horse occur at interval of three or four mile but there be little cultivation after leave the vicinity of adana the sun pour down a intense summer heat and hundred of large gad-fly swarm around we drive the horse wild with they sting towards noon we stop at a little village for breakfast we take possession of a shop which the good-natured merchant offer we and be about to spread we provision upon the counter when the gnat and mosquito fairly drive we away we at once go forward in search of a better place which give occasion to we chief mukkairee hadji youssuf for a violent remonstrance the term of the agreement at aleppo give the entire control of the journey into we own hand and the hadji now seek to violate it he protest against we travel more than six hour a day and conduct himself so insolently that we threaten to take he before the pasha of tarsus this silence he for the time but we hate he so cordially since then that i foresee we shall have more trouble in the afternoon a gust sweep along the side of taurus cool the air and afford we a little relief by three o'clock we reach the river cydnus which be bare of tree on its eastern side but flow between bank cover with grass and shrub it be still span by the ancient bridge and the mule now step in the hollow rut worn long ago by roman and byzantine chariot wheel the stream be not more than thirty yard broad but have a very full and rapid current of a bluish-white color from the snow which feed it i ride down to the brink and drink a cup of the water it be exceedingly cold and i do not wonder that a bath in it should have kill the emperor barbarossa from the top of the bridge there be a lovely view down the stream where it wash a fringe of willow and heavy fruit-tree on its western bank and then wind away through the grassy plain to the sea for once my fancy run parallel with the inspiration of the scene i could think of nothing but the galley of cleopatra slowly stem the current of the stream its silken sail fill with the sea-breeze its gilded oar keep time to the flute whose voluptuous melody float far out over the vernal meadow tarsus be probably almost hide then as now by its garden except just where it touch the river and the dazzling vision of the egyptian queen as she come up conquering and to conquer must have be all the more bewildering from the lovely bower through which she sail from the bridge a ancient road still lead to the old byzantine gate of tarsus part of the town be encompass by a wall build by the caliph haroun al-raschid and there be a ruin fortress which be attribute to sultan bajazet small stream bring from the cydnus traverse the environs and with such a fertile soil the luxuriance of the garden in which the city lie bury be almost incredible in we ramble in search of a place to pitch the tent we enter a superb orange-orchard the foliage of which make a perpetual twilight many of the trunk be two foot in diameter the house be mostly of one story and the material be almost wholly borrow from the ancient city pillar capital fragment of cornice and entablature abound i notice here as in adana a high wooden frame on the top of every house raise a few step above the roof and cover with light muslin like a portable bathing-house here the people put up they bed in the evening sleep and come down to the roof in the morning -- a excellent plan for get better air in these malarious plain and escape from flea and mosquito in we search for the armenian church which be say to have be found by st paul -lrb- saul of tarsus -rrb- we come upon a mosque which have be originally a christian church of greek time from the top of a mound whereupon stand the remains of a ancient circular edifice we obtain a fine view of the city and plain of tarsus a few house or cluster of house stand here and there like reef amid the billowy green and the minaret -- one of they with a nest of young stork on its very summit -- rise like the mast of sunken ship some palm lift they tufted head from the garden beyond which the great plain extend from the mountain to the sea the tumulus near mersyn the port of tarsus be plainly visible two hour from mersyn be the ruin of pompeiopoli the name give by pompey to the town of solo after he conquest of the cilician pirate from solo on account of the bad greek speak by its inhabitant come the term solecism the ruin of pompeiopoli consist of a theater temple and a number of house still in good preservation the whole coast as far as aleya three hundred mile west of this be say to abound with ruin city and i regret exceedingly that time will not permit I to explore it while search for the antiquity about tarsus i accosted a man in a frank dress who prove to be the neapolitan consul he tell we that the most remarkable relic be the _ duniktash _ -lrb- the round stone -rrb- and procure we a guide it lie in a garden near the city and be certainly one of the most remarkable monument in the east it consist of a square inclosure of solid masonry 350 foot long by 150 foot wide the wall of which be eighteen foot in thickness and twenty foot high it appear to have be originally a solid mass without entrance but a passage have be break in one place and in another there be a split or fissure evidently produce by a earthquake the material be rough stone brick and mortar inside of the inclosure be two detach square mass of masonry of equal height and probably eighty foot on a side without opening of any kind one of they have be pierce at the bottom a steep passage lead to a pit or well but the side of the passage thus broken indicate that the whole structure be one solid mass it be generally suppose that they be intend as tomb : but of whom there be no sign by which they may be recognize and what be more singular no tradition concern they the day we reach tarsus be the first of the turkish fast-month of ramazan the inhabitant have see the new moon the night before at adana where they do not keep such a close look-out the fast have not commence during its continuance which be from twenty-eight to twenty-nine day no mussulman dare eat drink or smoke from a hour before sunrise till half a hour after sunset the mohammedan month be lunar and each month make the whole round of the season once in thirty-three year when therefore the ramazan come in midsummer as at present the fulfilment of this fast be a great trial even to the strongest and most devout eighteen hour without meat or drink and what be still worse to a genuine turk without a pipe be a rigid test of faith the rich do the best they can to avoid it by feast all night and sleep all day but the poor who must perform they daily avocation as usual suffer exceedingly in walk through tarsus i see many wretched face in the bazaar and the guide who accompany we have a painfully famished air fortunately the koran expressly permit invalid child and traveller to disregard the fast so that although we eat and drink when we like we be none the less look upon as good mussulman about dark a gun be fire and a rocket send up from the mosque announce the termination of the day 's fast the meal be already prepare the pipe fill the coffee smoke in the _ finjan _ and the echo have not die away nor the last spark of the rocket become extinct before half the inhabitant be satisfy they hunger thirst and smoke-lust we leave tarsus this morning and be now encamp among the pine of mount taurus the last flush of sunset be fading from he eternal snow and i drop my pen to enjoy the silence of twilight in this mountain solitude chapter xviii the pass of mount taurus we enter the taurus -- turcoman -- forest scenery -- the palace of pan -- khan mezarluk -- morning among the mountain -- the gorge of the cydnus -- the crag of

stony jaw the abrupt mountain break and seem with its accumulate crag to overhang the world shelley ereglus _ in karamania June _ 22 1852 striking we tent in the garden of tarsus we again cross the cydnus and take a northern course across the plain the long line of taurus rise before we seemingly divide into four successive range the highest of which be fold in cloud only the long streak of snow fill the ravine be visible the outline of these range be very fine the wave line of the summit cut here and there by precipitous gorge -- the gateway of river that come down to the plain in about two hour we enter the lower hill they be barren and stony with a white chalky soil but the valley be fill with myrtle oleander and lauristinus in bloom and lavender grow in great profusion on the hill-side the flower of the oleander give out a delicate almond-like fragrance and grow in such dense cluster as frequently to hide the foliage i amuse myself with find a derivation of the name of this beautiful plant which may answer until somebody discover a better one hero when the corpse of she lover be cast ashore by the wave bury he under a oleander bush where she be accustom to sit daily and lament over he untimely fate now a foreign horticulturist happen to pass by when the shrub be in blossom be much strike with its beauty and ask hero what it be call but she absorb in grief and think only of she lover clasp she hand and sigh out : o leander o leander which the horticulturist immediately enter in he note-book as the name of the shrub and by that name it be know to the present time for two or three hour the scenery be rather tame the higher summit be obscure with a thunder-cloud towards noon however we pass the first chain and see across a strip of rolling land intervene the grand rampart of the second loom dark and large under the cloud a circular watch-tower of white stone standing on the summit of a promontory at the mouth of a gorge on we right flash out boldly against the storm we stop under a oak-tree to take breakfast but there be no water and two turk who be rest while they horse graze in the meadow tell we we should find a good spring half a mile further we ascend a long slope cover with wheat-fields where number of turcoman reaper be busy at work pass they black tent surround with drove of sheep and goat and reach a rude stone fountain of good water where two company of these people have stop to rest on they way to the mountain it be the time of noon prayer and they go through they devotions with great solemnity we nestle deep in a bed of myrtle while we breakfast for the sky be clouded and the wind blow cool and fresh from the region of rain above we some of the turcoman ask we for bread and be very grateful when we give it to they in the afternoon we come into a higher and wilder region where the road lead through thicket of wild olive holly oak and lauristinus with occasional grove of pine what a joy i feel in hearing once more the grand song of my favorite tree we way be a woodland road a storm have pass over the region in the morning the earth be still fresh and moist and there be a aromatic smell of leaf in the air we turn westward into the entrance of a deep valley over which hang a perpendicular cliff of gray and red rock fashion by nature so as to resemble a vast fortress with window portal and project bastion françois display he knowledge of mythology by declare it to be the palace of pan while we be carry out the idea by make chamber for the faun and nymph in the basement story of the precipice the path wound around the shoulder of the mountain and the glen spread away before we branch up into loftier range disclose through its gateway of cliff rise out of the steep of pine forest a sublime vista of blue mountain peak climb to the topmost snow it be a magnificent alpine landscape more glowing and rich than switzerland yet equal it in all the loftier characteristic of mountain scenery another and greater precipice tower over we on the right and the black eagle which have make they eyrie in its niched and caverned vault be wheeling around its crest a branch of the cydnus foam along the bottom of the gorge and soma turcoman boy be tend they herd on its bank further up the glen we find a fountain of delicious water beside the desert khan of mezarluk and there encamp for the night we tent be pitch on the mountain side near a fountain of the coolest clearest and sweetest water i have see in all the east there be perfect silence among the mountain and the place be as lonely as it be sublime the night be cool and fresh but i could not sleep until towards morning when i open my belated eye the tall peak on the opposite side of the glen be girdle below they waist with the flood of a sparkling sunrise the sky be pure as crystal except a soft white fleece that veil the snowy pinnacle of taurus folding and unfold rise and sink as if to make they beauty still more attractive by the partial concealment the morning air be almost cold but so pure and brace -- so aromatic with the healthy breath of the pine -- that i take it down in the fullest possible draught we ride up the glen follow the course of the cydnus through scenery of the wildest and most romantic character the basis of the mountain be completely envelop in forest of pine but they summit rise in precipitous crag many hundred of foot in height hanging above we very head even after the sun be five hour high they shadow fall upon we from the opposite side of the glen mix with the pine be occasional oak a undergrowth of hawthorn in bloom and shrub cover with yellow and white flower over these the wild grape throw its rich festoon fill the air with exquisite fragrance out of this glen we pass into another still narrower and wilder the road be the old roman way and in tolerable condition though it have evidently not be mend for many century in half a hour the pass open disclose a enormous peak in front of we crown with the ruin of a ancient fortress of considerable extent the position be almost impregnable the mountain drop on one side into a precipice five hundred foot in perpendicular height under the cliff of the loftiest ridge there be a terrace plant with walnut-tree : a charming little hamlet in the wilderness wild sycamore-tree with white trunk and bright green foliage shaded the foamy twist of the cydnus as it plunge down its difficult bed the pine thrust its root into the naked precipice and from they summit hang out over the great abyss below i thought of oenone 's -- tall dark pine that fringe the craggy ledge high over the blue gorge and all between the snowy peak and snow-white cataract foster the callow eaglet and certainly she have on mount ida no more beautiful tree than these we have double the crag of the fortress when the pass close before we shut in by two immense precipice of sheer barren rock more than a thousand foot in height vast fragment fall from above choke up the entrance whence the cydnus spout forth in foam leap into the defile the ancient road be completely destroy but trace of it be to be see on the rock ten foot above the present bed of the stream and on the broken mass which have be hurl below the path wound with difficulty among these wreck and then merge into the stream itself as we enter the gateway a violent wind blow in we face as we ride through the strait which be not ten yard in breadth while its wall rise to the region of the cloud in a few minute we have traverse it and stand look back on the enormous gap there be several greek tablet cut in the rock above the old road but so defaced as to be illegible this be undoubtedly the principal gate of the taurus and the pass through which the army of cyrus and alexander enter cilicium beyond the gate the mountain retreat and we climb up a little dell past two or three turcoman house to the top of a hill whence open a view of the principal range now close at hand the mountain in front be clothe with dark cedar to they very top and the snow-field behind they seem dazzlingly bright and near we course for several mile now lay through a more open valley drain by the upper water of the cydnus on two oppose terrace of the mountain chain be two fortress build by ibraham pasha but now wholly desert they be large and well-constructed work of stone and surround by ruin of stable oven and the rude house of the soldiery pass between these we ascend to the shelf divide the water of the cydnus and the sihoon from the point where the slope descend to the latter river there open before I one of the most glorious landscape i ever behold i stand at the extremity of a long hollow or depression between the two range of the taurus -- not a valley for it be divide by deep cloven chasm hem in by steep overgrow with cedar on my right rise a sublime chain soar far out of the region of tree and lift its peaked summit of gray rock into toe sky another chain nearly as lofty but not so broken nor with such large impose feature overhang I on the left and far in front fill up the magnificent vista -- fill up all between the lower steep crown with pine and the round white cloud hang on the verge of heaven -- be the shine snow of the taurus great god how shall i describe the grandeur of that view how draw the wonderful outline of those mountain how paint the airy hue of violet-gray the soft white light the thousandfold pencilling of mellow shadow the height the depth the far-reaching vastness of the landscape in the middle distance a great blue gorge pass transversely across the two range and the region between this as i rightly conjecture be the bed of the sihoon we road lead downward through grove of fragrant cedar and we travel thus for two hour before reach the river take a northward course up he bank we reach the second of the _ pylæ ciliciæ _ before sunset it be on a grander scale than the first gate though not so startling and violent in its feature the bare wall on either side fall sheer to the water and the road cross the sihoon by a lofty bridge of a single arch be cut along the face of the rock near the bridge a subterranean stream almost as large as the river burst forth from the solid heart of the mountain on either side gigantic mass of rock with here and there a pine to adorn they sterility tower to the height of 6000 foot in some place almost perpendicular from summit to base they be worn and broken into all fantastic form there be pyramid tower bastion minaret and long sharp spire splintered and jagged as the turret of a iceberg i have see higher mountain but i have never see any which look so high as these we camp on a narrow plot of ground in the very heart of the tremendous gorge a soldier pass along at dusk tell we that a merchant and he servant be murder in the same place last winter and advise we to keep watch but we sleep safely all night while the star sparkle over the chasm and slip of misty cloud hang low on the thousand pinnacle of rock when i awake the gorge lay in deep shadow but high up on the western mountain above the enormous black pyramid that arise from the river the topmost pinnacle of rock sparkle like molten silver in the full gush of sunrise the great mountain block up the gorge behind we be bath almost to its foot in the ray and see through such a dark vista be glorified beyond all other mountain of earth the air be piercingly cold and keen and i could scarcely bear the water of the sihoon on my sun-inflamed face there be a little spring not far off from which we obtain sufficient water to drink the river be too muddy the spring be but a thread ooze from the soil but the hadji collect it in handful which he empty into he water-skin and then bring to we the morning light give a still finer effect to the manifold form of the mountain than that of the afternoon sun the soft gray hue of the rock shine clearly against the cloudless sky fret all over with the shadow throw by they innumerable spire and jut point and by the natural arch scoop out under the cliff after travel less than a hour we pass the riven wall of the mighty gateway and ride again under the shade of pine forest the height of the mountain now gradually diminish and they side cover with pine and cedar become less broken and abrupt the summit nevertheless still retain the same rocky spine shooting up into tall single tower or long line of even parapet occasionally through gap between we catch glimpse of the snow-field dazzlingly high and white after travel eight or nine mile we emerge from the pass and leave the sihoon at a place call chiftlik khan -- a stone building with a small fort adjoining wherein fifteen splendid bronze cannon lay neglect on they broken and rot carriage as we cross the stone bridge over the river a valley open suddenly on the left disclose the whole range of the taurus which we now see on its northern side a vast stretch of rocky spire with sparkling snow-field between and long ravine fill with snow extend far down between the dark blue cliff and the dark green plumage of the cedar immediately after pass the central chain of the taurus the character of the scenery change the height be round the rocky stratum only appear on the higher peak and the slope of loose soil be deeply cut and scar by the rain of age both in appearance especially in the scatter growth of tree dot over the dark red soil and in they formation these mountain strongly resemble the middle range of the californian sierra nevada we climb a long wind glen until we have attain a considerable height when the road reach a divide ridge give we a view of a deep valley beyond which a chain of barren mountain rise to the height of some five thousand foot as we descend the rocky path a little caravan of ass and mule clamber up to meet we along the brink of steep gulf the narrow strip of bottom land along the stream be plant with rye now in head and rolling in silvery wave before the wind after we noonday halt we go over the hill to another stream which come from the north-west its valley be broader and greener than that we have leave and the hill inclose it have soft and undulating outline they be bare of tree but color a pale green by they thin clothing of grass and herb in this valley the season be so late owing to its height above the sea that the early spring-flower be yet in bloom poppy flame among the wheat and the bank of the stream be brilliant with patch of a creep plant with a bright purple blossom the asphodel grow in great profusion and a ivy-leaved shrub cover with flake of white bloom make the air faint with its fragrance still further up we come to orchard of walnut and plum tree and vineyard there be no house but the innabitant who be mostly turcoman live in village during the winter and in summer pitch they tent on the mountain where they pasture they flock directly over this quiet pastoral vale tower the taurus and i look at once on its secluded loveliness and on the wintry height whose bleak and sublime head be mantle in cloud from no point be there a more impose view of the whole snowy range near the head of the valley we pass a large turcoman encampment surround with herd of sheep and cattle we halt for the evening at a place call kolü-kushlum -- a immense fortress-village resemble baïas and like it wholly desert near it there be a small town of very neat house which be also desert the inhabitant have go into the mountain with they flock i walk through the fortress which be a massive building of stone about 500 foot square erect by sultan murad as a resting-place for the caravan to mecca it have two spacious portal in which the iron door be still hang connect by a vaulted passage twenty foot high and forty wide with bazaar on each side side gateway open into large court surround with arched chamber there be a mosque entire with its pulpit and gallery and the gilded crescent still glitter over its dome behind it be a bath contain a entrance hall and half a dozen chamber in which the water-pipe and stone tank still remain with a little alteration the building would make a capital phalanstery where the fourierite might try they experiment without contact with society there be no field for they equal to asia minor -- a glorious region abound in natural wealth almost depopulate and contain a great number of phalanstery ready build we succeed in get some egg fowl and milk from a old turcoman who have charge of the village a man who ride by on a donkey sell we a bag of _ yaourt _ -lrb- sour milk-curd -rrb- which be delicious notwithstanding the suspicious appearance of the bag it be make before the cream have be remove and be very rich and nourishing the old turcoman sit down and watch we while we eat but would not join we as these wander tribe be very strict in keep ramazan when we have reach we dessert -- a plate of fine cherry -- another white-bearded and dignified gentleman visit we we hand he the cherry expect that he would take a few and politely return the dish : but no such thing he coolly produce he handkerchief empty everything into it and march off he also do not venture to eat although we point to the taurus on whose upper snow the last gleam of daylight be just melting away we arise this morning in a dark cloudy dawn there be a heavy black storm hang low in the west and another be gather its force along the mountain behind we a cold wind blow down the valley and long peal of thunder roll grandly among the gorge of taurus a isolate hill crown with a shatter crag which bear a striking resemblance to a ruin fortress stand out black and sharp against the far misty sunlit peak as far as the spring be yet undried the land be cover with flower in one place i see a large square plot of the most brilliant crimson hue burning amid the green wheat-field as if some tyrian mantle have be fling there the long harmonious slope and round summit of the hill be cover with drift of a beautiful purple clover and a diminutive variety of the _ achillea _ or yarrow with glowing yellow blossom the leaf have a pleasant aromatic odor and fill the air with they refreshing breath as they be crush under the hoof of we horse we have now reach the highest ridge of the hilly country along the northern base of taurus and see far and wide before we the great central plain of karamania two isolate mountain at forty or fifty mile distance break the monotony of the desert-like level : kara dagh in the west and the snow-capped summit of hassan dagh in the north-east beyond the latter we try to catch a glimpse of the famous mon argseus at the base of which be kaisariyeh the ancient cæsarea of cappadocium this mountain which be 13000 foot high be the loftiest peak of asia minor the cloud hang low on the horizon and the rain be fall veil it from we sight we road for the remainder of the day be over barren hill cover with scanty herbage the sun shine out intensely hot and the glare of the white soil be exceedingly painful to my eye the locality of ereglus be betray some time before we reach it by its dark-green belt of fruit tree it stand in the mouth of a narrow valley which wind down from the taurus and be water by a large rapid stream that finally lose itself in the lake and morass of the plain there have be a heavy black thunder-cloud gathering and as we reach we camping-ground under some fine walnut-tree near the stream a sudden blast of cold wind sweep over the town fill the air with dust we pitch the tent in all haste expect a storm but the rain finally pass to the northward we then take a walk through the town which be a forlorn place a spacious khan build apparently for the mecca pilgrim be in ruin but the mosque have a exquisite minaret eighty foot high and still bear trace of the device in blue tile which once cover it the shop be mostly close and in those which be still open the owner lay at full length on they belly they face gaunt with fast they seem annoyed at we trouble they even with purchase one would have think that some fearful pestilence have fall upon the town the cobbler only who somewhat languidly ply they implement seem to retain a little life the few jew and armenian smoke they pipe in a tantalizing manner in the very face of the poor mussulman we buy a oka of excellent cherry which we be cruel enough to taste in the street before the hungry eye of the suffering merchant this evening the ass belong to the place be drive in from pasture -- four or five hundred in all and such a show of curious asinine specimen as i never before behold a dervish who be with we in quarantine at adana have just arrive he have lose he _ teskeré _ -lrb- passport -rrb- and on issue

suffer for he delinquency we tent be in a charming spot and from without make a picture to be remember the yellow illumination from within strike on the under side of the walnut bough while the moonlight silver they from above beyond garden where the nightingale be sing the tall minaret of ereglus stand reveal in the vapory glow the night be too sweet and balmy for sleep and yet i must close my eye upon it for the hot plain of karamanium await we to-morrow chapter xix the plain of karamania the plain of karamanium -- afternoon heat -- a well -- volcanic phenomenon -- kara-bounar -- a grand ruin khan -- moonlight picture -- a landscape of the plains-mirage -- a short interview -- the village of ismil -- third day on the plain -- approach to konia a weary waste expand to the sky -- goldsmith konium capital of karamania _ Friday June _ 25 1854 françois awake we at the break of day at ereglus as we have a journey of twelve hour before we pass through the town we traverse a narrow belt of garden and orchard land and enter the great plain of karamania we road lead at first northward towards a range call karadja dagh and then skirt its base westward after three hour ' travel we pass a village of neat whitewashed house which be entirely desert all the inhabitant have go off to the mountain there be some herd scatter over the plain near the village as the day wear on the wind which have be chill in the morning cease and the air become hot and sultry the glare from the white soil be so painful that i be oblige to close my eye and so run a continual risk of fall asleep and tumble from my horse thus drowsy and half unconscious of my whereabouts i ride on in the heat and arid silence of the plain until noon when we reach a well it be a shaft sink about thirty foot deep with a long sloping gallery slant off to the surface the well be nearly dry but by descend the gallery we obtain a sufficient supply of cold pure water we breakfast in the shaded doorway share we provision with a turcoman boy who be accompany he father to ereglus with a load of salt we road now cross a long barren pass between two part of karadja dagh near the northern side there be a salt lake of one hundred yard in diameter sink in a deep natural basin the water be intensely saline on the other side of the road and a quarter of a mile distant be a extinct volcano the crater of which near two hundred foot deep be a salt lake with a trachytic cone three hundred foot high rise from the center from the slope of the mountain we overlook another and somewhat deeper plain extend to the north and west it be bound by broken peak all of which betray a volcanic origin far before we we see the tower on the hill of kara-bounar we resting-place for the night the road thither be over a barren plain cheer here and there by patch of a cushion-like plant which be cover with pink blossom mr harrison scare up some covey of the frankolin a large bird resemble the pheasant and enriched we larder with a dozen starling kara-bounar be build on the slope of a mound at the foot of which stand a spacious mosque visible far over the plain it have a dome and two tall pencil-like tower similar to those of the citadel-mosque of cairo near it be the remains of a magnificent khan-fortress say to have be build by the eunuch of one of the former sultan as there be no water in the well outside of the town we enter the khan and pitch the tent in its grass-grown court six square pillar of hew stone make a aisle to we door and the lofty roofless wall of the court 100 by 150 foot inclose we another court of similar size communicate with it by a broad portal and the remains of bath and bazaar lay beyond a handsome stone fountain with two stream of run water stand in front of the khan we be royally lodge but almost starve in we splendor as only two or three turcoman remain out of two thousand -lrb- who have go off with they herd to the mountain -rrb- and they be unable to furnish we with provision but for we frankolin and starling we should have go fast the mosque be a beautiful structure of white limestone and the gallery of its minaret be adorn with rich arabesque ornament while the muezzin be cry he sunset-call to prayer i enter the portico and look into the interior which be so bare as to appear incomplete as we sit in we palace-court after dinner the moon arise light up the niche in the wall the cluster of window in the immense eastern gable and the row of massive column the large dimension of the building give it a truly grand effect and but for the whine of a distant jackal i could have believe that we be sit in the aisle of a roofless gothic cathedral in the heart of europe françois be somewhat fearful of thief but the peace and repose of the place we have so perfect that i would not allow any such apprehension to disturb I in two minute after i touch my bed i be insensible and i do not move a limb until sunrise beyond kara-bounar there be a low barren ridge climb which we overlook a immense plain uncultivated apparently unfertile and without a sign of life as far as the eye could reach kara dagh in the south lift nearer we its cluster of dark summit to the north the long ridge of üsedjik dagh -lrb- the pigmy mountain -rrb- stretch like a cape into the plain hassan dagh wrap in a soft white cloud recede behind we and the snow of taurus seem almost as distant as when we first behold they from the syrian gate we ride for four hour over the dead level the only object that meet we eye be a occasional herd of camel in the distance about noon we reach a well similar to that of the previous day but of recent construction a long steep gallery lead down to the water which be very cold but have a villainous taste of lime salt and sulphur after a hour 's halt we start again the sun be intensely hot and for hour we jog on over the dead level the bare white soil blind we eye with its glare the distant hill be lift above the horizon by a mirage long sheet of blue water be spread along they basis island the isolate peak and turn into ship and boat the black speck of camel far away but the phenomenon be by no means on so grand a scale as i have see in the nubian desert on the south-western horizon we discern the summit of the karaman range of taurus cover with snow in the middle of the afternoon we see a solitary tent upon the plain from which a individual advanced to meet we as he draw nearer we notice that he wear white frank pantaloons similar to the turkish soldiery with a jacket of brown cloth and a heavy sabre when he be within convenient speaking distance he cry out : stop why be you run away from I what do you call run away rejoin françois we be go on we journey where do you come from he then ask from there say françois point behind we where be you go there and the provoke greek simply pointed forwards you have neither faith nor religion say the man indignantly then turn upon he heel he stride back across the plain about four o'clock we see a long line of object rise before we but so distort by the mirage that it be impossible to know what they be after a while however we decide that they be house intersperse with tree but the tree prove to be stack of hay and lentil heap on the flat roof this be ismil we halting-place the house be miserable mud hut but the village be large and unlike most of those we have see this side of taurus inhabit the people be turcoman and they possession appear to be almost entirely in they herd immense number of sheep and goat be pasture on the plain there be several well in the place provide with bucket attach to long swing-pole the water be very cold but brackish we tent be pitch on the plain on a hard gravelly strip of soil a crowd of wild-haired turcoman boy gather in front to stare at we and the shepherd quarrel at the well as to which should take he turn at water he flock in the evening a handsome old turk visit we and find that we be bind to constantinople request françois to take a letter to he son who be settle there françois arouse we this morning before the dawn as we have a journey of thirty-five mile before we he be in a bad humor for a man whom he have request to keep watch over he tent while he go into the village have steal a fork and spoon the old turk who have return as soon as we be stir go out to hunt the thief but do not succeed in find he the inhabitant of the village be up long before sunrise and drive away in they wooden-wheeled cart to the meadow where they cut grass the old turk accompany we some distance in order to show we a nearer way avoid a marshy spot we road lay over a vast plain seemingly boundless for the lofty mountain-range that surround it on all side be so distant and cloud-like and so lift from the horizon by the deceptive mirage that the eye do not recognize they connection with it the wind blow strongly from the north-west and be so cold that i dismounted and walk ahead for two or three hour before noon we pass two village of mud hut partly inhabit and with some wheat-field around they we breakfast at another well which furnish we with a drink that taste like iced sea-water thence we ride forth again into the heat for the wind have fall by this time and the sun shine out with great force there be ever the same dead level and we ride directly towards the mountain which to my eye seem nearly as distant as ever at last there be a dark glimmer through the mirage at they base and a half-hour 's ride show it to be a line of tree in another hour we could distinguish a minaret or two and finally wall and the stately dome of mosque this be konia the ancient iconium one of the most renowned city of asia minor chapter xx scene in konium kpproach to konia -- tomb of hazret mevlana -- lodgings in a khan -- a american luxury -- a night-scene in ramazan -- prayer in the mosque -- remain of the ancient city -- view from the mosque -- the interior -- a lean minaret -- the divert history of the muleteer but they shake off the dust on they foot and come unto iconium -- act xiii 51 konium -lrb- ancient iconium -rrb- _ June _ 27 1852 the view of konium from the plain be not striking until one have approach within a mile of the suburb when the group of mosque with they heavy central dome lift on cluster of smaller one and they tall light glitter minaret rise above the foliage of the garden against the background of airy hill have a very please effect we approach through a long line of dirty suburb which look still more forlorn on account of the ramazan some turkish official in shabby frank dress follow we to satisfy they curiosity by talk with we _ katurjee _ or muleteer outside the city wall we pass some very large barracks for cavalry build by ibrahim pasha on the plain north-east of the city the battle between he and the force of the sultan result in the defeat of the latter be fight we next come upon two magnificent mosque build of white limestone with a multitude of leaden dome and lofty minaret adorn with gallery rich in arabesque ornament attach to one of they be the tomb of hazret mevlana the founder of the sect of mevlevus dervish which be repute one of the most sacred place in the east the tomb be surmount by a dome upon which stand a tall cylindrical tower reed with channel between each projection and terminate in a long taper cone this tower be make of glazed tile of the most brilliant sea-blue color and sparkle in the sun like a vast pillar of icy spar in some polar grotto it be a most striking and fantastic object surround by a cluster of minaret and several cypress-tree amid which it seem place as the central ornament and crown of the group the aspect of the city be so filthy and uninviting that we prefer pitch we tent but it be impossible to find a place without go back upon the plain so we turn into the bazaar and ask the way to a khan there be a tolerable crowd in the street although many of the shop be shut the first khan we visit be too filthy to enter but the second though most unpromising in appearance turn out to be better than it look the _ oda-bashus _ -lrb- master of the room -rrb- thoroughly sweep and sprinkle the narrow little chamber he give we lay clean mat upon the floor and when we carpet and bed be place within its wall of mud look somewhat comfortable its single window with a iron grate in lieu of glass look upon a oblong court on the second story surround by the room of armenian merchant the main court -lrb- the gate of which be always close at sunset -rrb- be two story in height with a rough wooden balcony run around it and a well of muddy water in the center the oda-bashi lend we a turkish table and supply we with dinner from he own kitchen kibab stew bean and cucumber salad mr h and i forget the ramazan go out to hunt for a iced sherbet but all the coffee-shop be close until sunset the people stare at we egyptian costume and a fellow in official dress demand my _ teskeré _ soon after we return françois appear with a splendid lump of ice in a basin and some lemon the ice so the _ khangee _ say be take from a lake among the mountain which in winter freeze to the thickness of a foot behind the lake be a natural cavern which the people fill with ice and then close up at this season they take it out day by day and bring it down to the city it be very pure and thick and justify the turkish proverb in regard to konium which be celebrate for three excellent thing : _ dooz booz küz _ -- salt ice and girl soon after sunset a cannon announce the close of the fast we wait a hour or two longer to allow the people time to eat and then sally out into the street every minaret in the city blaze with a crown of light lamp around its upper gallery while the long shaft below and the taper cone above top with brazen crescent shine fair in the moonlight it be a strange brilliant spectacle in the square before the principal mosque we find a crowd of person frolic around the fountain in the light of a number of torch on pole plant in the ground mat be spread on the stone and row of turk of all class sit thereon smoking they pipe large earthen water-jar stand here and there and the people drink so often and so long that they seem determine to provide against the morrow the boy be have they amusement in wrestle shout and firing off squib which they throw into the crowd we kick off we slipper sit down among the turk smoke a narghileh drink a cup of coffee and a iced sherbet of raisin juice and so enjoy the ramazan as well as the best of they number of true believer be drink and wash themselves at the picturesque fountain and just as we rise to depart the voice of a boy-muezzin on one of the tallest minaret send down a musical call to prayer immediately the boy leave off they sport and start on a run for the great mosque and the grave gray-bearded turk get up from the mat shove on they slipper and march after they we follow get a glimpse of the illuminate interior of the building as we pass but the oda-bashus conduct we still further to a smaller though more beautiful mosque surround with a garden-court it be a truly magical picture we enter the gate and pass on by a marble pavement under tree and arbor of vine that almost shut out the moonlight to a paved space in the center whereof be a beautiful fountain in the purest saracenic style its heavy project cornice and tall pyramidal roof rest on a circle of elegant arch surround a marble structure whence the water gush forth in a dozen sparkling stream on three side it be inclose by the moonlit tree and arbor on the fourth by the outer corridor of the mosque the door of entrance be exactly opposite large number of person be wash they hand and foot at the fountain after which they enter and kneel on the floor we stand unobserved in the corridor and look in on the splendidly illuminate interior and the crowd at prayer all bend they body to the earth at regular interval and murmur the name of allah they resemble a plain of reed bend before the gust of wind which precede a storm when all have enter and be unite in solemn prayer we return pass the grand mosque i steal up to the door lift the heavy carpet that hang before it and look in there be a mevlevus dervish standing in the entrance but he eye be lift in heavenly abstraction and he do not see I the interior be brilliantly light by white and colored lamp suspend from the wall and the great central dome it be a impose structure simple in form yet grand from its dimension the floor be cover with kneel figure and a deep voice come from the other end of the mosque be utter pious phrase in a kind of chant i satisfied my curiosity quickly and we then return to the khan yesterday afternoon i make a more thorough examination of the city pass through the bazaar i reach the seraus or pasha 's palace which stand on the site of that of the sultan of iconium it be a long wooden building with no pretension to architectural beauty near it there be a large and ancient mosque with a minaret of singular elegance it be about 120 foot high with two hang gallery the whole build of blue and red brick the latter project so as to form quaint pattern or design several ancient building near this mosque be surmount with pyramidal tower resemble pagoda of indium follow the long crooked lane between mud building we pass these curious structure and reach the ancient wall of the city in one of the street lay a marble lion badly execute and apparently of the time of the lower empire in the wall be insert many similar figure with fragment of frieze and cornice this be the work of the seljook king who in build the wall take great pain to exhibit the fragment of the ancient city the number of altar they have preserve be quite remarkable on the square tower be sunken tablet contain long arabic inscription the high wall of a ruin building in the southern part of the city attract we and on go thither we find it to be a ancient mosque standing on a eminence form apparently of the debris of other building part of the wall be also ancient and in some place show the mark of a earthquake a long flight of step lead up to the door of the mosque and as we ascend we be reward by the most charming view of the city and the grand plain konium lay at we foot -- a wide straggling array of low mud dwelling dot all over with patch of garden verdure while its three superb mosque with the many smaller tomb and place of worship appear like building leave from some former and more magnificent capital outside of this circle run a belt of garden land adorn with grove and long line of fruit tree still further the plain a sea of fade green fleck with the softest cloud-shadow and beyond all the beautiful outline and dreamy tint of the different mountain chain it be in every respect a lovely landscape and the city be unworthy such surroundings the sky which in this region be of a pale soft delicious blue be dot with scatter fleece of white cloud and there be a exquisite play of light and shade over the hill there be half a dozen man and boy about the door amusing themselves with burst percussion cap on the stone they address we as _ hadji _ -lrb- pilgrim -rrb- beg for more cap i tell they i be not a turk but a arab which they believe at once and request I to enter the mosque the interior have a remarkably fine effect it be a maze of arch support by column of polished black marble forty in number in form it be nearly square and cover with a flat wooden roof the floor be cover with a carpet whereon several person be lie at full length while a old man seat in one of the most remote corner be read in a loud solemn voice it be a peculiar structure which i should be glad to examine more in detail not far from this eminence be a remarkable lean minaret more than a hundred foot in height while in diameter it can not be more than fifteen foot in design it be light and elegant and the effect be not injure by its deviation from the perpendicular which i should judge to be about six foot from the mosque we walk over the mound of old iconium to the eastern wall pass another mosque wholly in ruin but which must have once be more splendid than any now stand the portal be the richest specimen of saracenic sculpture i have ever see : a very labyrinth of intricate ornament the artist must have see the great portal of the temple of the sun at baalbec the minaret have tumble down the roof have fall in but the wall be still cover with white and blue tile of the finest workmanship resemble a mosaic of ivory and lapi lazulus some of the chamber seem to be inhabit for two old man with white beard lay in the shade and be not a little startled by we sudden appearance we return to the great mosque which we have visit on the evening of we arrival and listen for some time to the voice of a mollah who be preach a afternoon sermon to a small and hungry congregation we then enter the court before the tomb of hazret mevlana it be apparently forbid ground to christian but as the dervish do not seem to suspect we we walk about boldly and be about to enter when a indiscretion of my companion frustrated we plan forget he assumed character he go to the fountain and drink although it be no later than the _ asser _ or afternoon prayer the dervish be shock and scandalize by this violation of the fast in the very court-yard of they holiest mosque and we judge it best to retire by degree we send this morning to request a interview with the pasha but he have go to pass the day in a country palace about three hour distant it be a still hot bright afternoon and the silence of the famished populace dispose we to repose we view be bound by the mud wall of the khan and i already long for the freedom of the great karamanian plain here in the heart of asia minor all life seem to stagnate there be sleep everywhere and i feel that a wide barrier separate I from the living world we have be detain here a whole day through a chain of accident all result from the rascality of we muleteer on leave aleppo the lame horse they palm upon we be unable to go further so we oblige they to buy another animal which they succeed in get for 350 piastre we advance the money although they be still in we debt hope to work we way through with the new horse and thus avoid the risk of loss or delay but this morning at sunrise hadji youssuf come with a woeful face to say that the new horse have be steal in the night and we who be ready to start must sit down and wait till he be recover i suspect another trick but when after the lapse of three hour françois find the hadji sit on the ground weep and achmet beat he breast it seem probable that the story be true all search for the horse be vain françois go with they to the shekh of the horse who promise in case it should hereafter be find to place it in the general pen where they would be sure to get it on they return the man who sell they the horse offer they another for the lame one and 150 piastre and there be no other alternative but to accept it but _ we _ must advance the 150 piastre and so in mid-journey we have already pay they to the end with the risk of they horse break down or they horse and all abscond from we but the knavish varlet be hardly bold enough for such a climax of villany chapter xxi the heart of asia minor scenery of the hill -- ladik the ancient laodicea -- the plague of gad-fly -- camp at ilgün -- a natural warm bath -- the gad-fly again -- a

the last in he attention to we not only help load the mule but accompany we some distance on we way all the merchant in the khan collect in the gallery to see we start and we make we exit in some state the morning be clear fresh and delightful turn away from the city wall we soon emerge from the line of fruit-tree and interminable field of tomb-stone and come out upon the great bare plain of karamania a ride of three hour bring we to a long sloping hill which give we a view of the whole plain and its circuit of mountain a dark line in the distance mark the garden of konium on the right near the center of the plain the lake now contract to very narrow limit glimmer in the sun notwithstanding the waste and unfertile appearance of the country the soft sweet sky that hang over it the pure transparent air the grand sweep of the plain and the varied form of the different mountain chain that encompass it make we journey a inspiring one a descent of the hill soon shut out the view and the rest of the day 's journey lay among they skirt the eastern base of allah dagh the country improve in character as we advance the bottom of the dry glen be cover with wheat and shrubbery begin to make its appearance on the mountain-side in the afternoon we cross a watershed divide karamanium from the great central plain of asia minor and descend to a village call ladik occupy the site of the ancient laodicea at the foot of allah dagh the plain upon which we come be greener and more flourishing than that we have leave tree be scatter here and there in clump and the grassy waste stretch beyond the grain-field be dot with herd of cattle emir dagh stand in the north-west blue and distant while towards the north and north-east the plain extend to the horizon -- a horizon fifty mile distant -- without a break in that direction lay the great salt lake of yüzler and the string of camel we meet on the road laden with salt be return from it ladik be surround with poppy-field brilliant with white and purple blossom when the petal have fall the native go carefully over the whole field and make incision in every stalk whence the opium exude we pitch we tent under a large walnut tree which we find standing in a desert inclosure the graveyard of the village be stud with relic of the ancient town there be pillar cornice entablature jamb altar mullion and sculptured

water its fertile garden we pass through the town and pitch we tent upon a beautiful grassy meadow we customary pipe of refreshment be never more heartily enjoy than at this place behind we be a barren hill at the foot of which be a natural hot bath wherein a number of woman and child be amusing themselves the afternoon heat have pass away the air be calm sweet and temper with the freshness of come evening and the long shadow of the hill creep over the meadow have almost reach the town beyond the line of sycamore poplar and fig-tree that shaded the garden of ilgün rise the distant chain of allah dagh and in the pale-blue sky not far above it the dim face of the gibbous moon show like the ghost of a planet we horse be feed on the green meadow a old turk sit beside we silent with fasting and there be no sound but the shout of the child in the bath such hour as these after a day 's journey make in the drowsy heat of a eastern summer be indescribably grateful after the woman have retire from the bath we be allow to enter the interior consist of a single chamber thirty foot high vault and almost dark in the center be a large basin of hot water fill by four stream which pour into it a ledge run around the side and niche in the wall supply place for we clothes the bath-keeper furnish we with towel and we undress and plunge in the water be agreeably warm -lrb- about 90 ° -rrb- have a sweet taste and a very slight sulphury smell the vaulted hall redouble the slightest noise and a shaven turk who keep we company sing in he delight that he might hear the echo of he own voice when we go back to the tent we find we visitor lie on the ground try to stay he hunger it be rather too bad in we to light we pipe make a sherbet and drink and smoke in he face while we joke he about the ramazan and he at last get up and walk off the picture of distress we make a early start the next morning and ride on briskly over the roll grassy hill a beautiful lake with a island in it lay at the foot of emir dagh after two hour we reach a guard-house where we _ teskerés _ be demand and the lazy guardsman invite we in to take coffee that he might establish a right to the backsheesh which he could not demand he have see we afar off and the coffee be smoking in the _ finjan _ when we arrive the sun be already terribly hot and the large green gad-fly come in such quantity that i seem to be ride in the midst of a swarm of bee my horse suffer very much and strike out he hind foot so violently in he endeavor to get rid of they that he rack every joint in my body they be not content with suck he blood but settle on the small segment of my calf expose between the big tartar boot and the flow trowser bit through my stocking with fierce bill i kill hundred of they to no purpose and at last to relieve my horse tie a bunch of hawthorn to a string by which i swing it under he belly and against the inner side of he flank in this way i give he some relief -- a service which he acknowledge by a grateful motion of he head as we descend towards ak-sheher the country become exceedingly rich and luxuriant the range of sultan dagh -lrb- the mountain of the sultan -rrb- rise on we leave its side cover with a thick screen of shrubbery and its highest peak dot with patch of snow opposite the lower range of emir dagh -lrb- the mountain of the prince -rrb- lay blue and bare in the sun shine the base of sultan dagh be girdle with grove of fruit-tree stretch out in long line on the plain with field of ripening wheat between in the distance the large lake of ak-sheher glitter in the sun towards the north-west the plain stretch away for fifty mile before reach the hill it be evidently on a much lower level than the plain of konium the heat be not only greater but the season be further advanced wheat be nearly ready for cut and the poppy-field where the day previous the man be make they first incision for opium here have yield they harvest and be fast ripen they seed ak-sheher be beautifully situate at the entrance of a deep gorge in the mountain it be so bury in its embowered garden that little except the mosque be see as you approach it it be a large place and boast a fine mosque but contain nothing worth see the bazaar after that of konium be the largest we have see since leave tarsus the greater part of the shopkeeper lay at full length doze sleeping or stay they appetite till the sunset gun we find some superb cherry and plenty of snow which be bring down from the mountain the native be very friendly and good-humored but seem surprise at mr harrison tasting the cherry although i tell they we be upon a journey we tent be pitch under a splendid walnut tree outside of the town the green mountain rise between we and the fading sunset and the yellow moon be hang in the east as we take we dinner at the tent-door turk be ride homewards on donkey with load of grass which they have be cut in the meadow the gun be fire and the shout of the child announce the close of the day 's fast while the sweet melancholy voice of a boy muezzin call we to sunset prayer from the minaret leave ak-sheher this morning we ride along the base of sultan dagh the plain which we overlook be magnificent the wilderness of shrubbery which fringe the slope of the mountain give place to great orchard and garden intersperse with field of grain which extend far out on the plain to the wild thicket and waste of reed surround the lake the side of sultan dagh be terraced and cultivate wherever it be practicable and i see some field of wheat high up on the mountain there be many people in the road or labor in the field and during the forenoon we pass several large village the country be more thickly inhabit and have a more thrifty and prosperous air than any part of asia minor which i have see the people be better clothe have more open honest cheerful and intelligent face and exhibit a genuine courtesy and good-will in they demeanor towards we i never feel more perfectly secure or more certain of be among people whom i could trust we pass under the summit of sultan dagh which shine out so clear and distinct in the morning sun that i could scarcely realize its actual height above the plain from a tremendous gorge cleft between the two higher peak issue a large stream which divide into a hundred channel fertilize a wide extent of plain about two hour from ak-sheher we pass a splendid fountain of crystal water gush up beside the road i believe it be the same call by some traveller the fountain of mida but be ignorant wherefore the name be give it we ride for several hour through a succession of grand rich landscape a smaller lake succeed to that of ak-sheher emir dagh rise higher in the pale-blue sky and sultan dagh show other peak break and strip with snow but around we be the same glorious orchard and garden the same golden-green wheat and rustling phalanx of poppy -- army of vegetable round-head beside the bristling and bearded cavalier the sun be intensely hot during the afternoon as we cross the plain and i become so drowse that it require a agony of exertion to keep from tumble off my horse we here leave the great post-road to constantinople and take a less frequented track the plain gradually become a meadow cover with shrub cypress flag reed and wild water-plant there be vast waste of luxuriant grass whereon thousand of black buffalo be feed a stone causeway contain many elegant fragment of ancient sculpture extend across this part of the plain but we take a summer path beside it through bed of iris in bloom -- a fragile snowy blossom with a lip of the clearest golden hue the causeway lead to a bare salt plain beyond which we come to the town of bolawadün and terminate we day 's journey of forty mile bolawadün be a collection of mud house about a mile long situate on a eminence at the western base of emir dagh i go into the bazaar which be a small place and not very well supply though as it be near sunset there be quite a crowd of people and the baker be shovel out they fresh bread at a brisk rate every one take I for a good egyptian mohammedan and i be jostle right and leave among the turban in a manner that certainly would not have happen I have i not also wear one mr h who have fall behind the caravan come up after we have encamp and might have wander a long time without find we but for the good-natured effort of the inhabitant to set he aright this evening he knock over a hedgehog mistake it for a cat the poor creature be severely hurt and its sob of distress precisely like those of a little child be to painful to hear that we be oblige to have it remove from the vicinity of the tent chapter xxii the forest of phrygium the frontier of phrygium -- ancient quarry and tomb -- we enter the pine forest -- a guard-house -- encampment of the turcoman -- pastoral scenery -- a summer village -- the valley of the tomb -- rock sepulchre of the phrygian king -- the titan 's camp -- the valley of kümbeh -- a land of flower -- turcoman hospitality -- the exile effendi -- the old turcoman -- a glimpse of arcadium -- a landscape -- interested friendship -- the valley of the pursek -- arrival at kiutahya and round we all the thicket ring to many a flute of arcady tennyson kiutahya _ July _ 5 1852 we have now pass through the ancient province of cilicium cappadocium and lycaonium and reach the confines of phrygium -- a rude mountain region which be never wholly penetrate by the light of grecian civilization it be still comparatively a wilderness pierce but by a single high-road and almost unvisited by traveller yet inclose in its depths many curious relic of antiquity leave bolawadün in the morning we ascend a long treeless mountain-slope and in three or four hour reach the divide ridge -- the watershed of asia minor divide the affluent of the mediterranean and the central lake from the stream that flow to the black sea look back sultan dagh along whose base we have travel the previous day lay high and blue in the background streak with shine snow and far away behind it arise a still higher peak hoary with the linger winter we descend into a grassy plain shut in by a range of broken mountain cover to they summit with dark-green shrubbery through which the stratum of marble rock gleam like patch of snow the hill in front be scar with old quarry once work for the celebrated phrygian marble there be neither a habitation nor a human be to be see and the landscape have a singularly wild lonely and picturesque air turn westward we cross a high rolling tract and enter a valley entirely cover with dwarf oak and cedar in spite of the dusty road the heat and the multitude of gad-fly the journey present a agreeable contrast to the great plain over which we have be travel for many day the opposite side of the glen be crown with a tall crest of shattered rock in which be many old phrygian tomb they be mostly simple chamber with square aperture there be trace of many more the rock have be blow up or quarry down -- the tomb instead of protect it only furnish one facility the more for destruction after a hour 's rest at a fountain we thread the winding of the glen to a lower plain quite shut in by the hill whose rib of marble show through the forest of oak holly cedar and pine which dot they we be now fully enter into the hill-country and we road pass over height and through hollow cover with picturesque clump of foliage it resemble some of the wild western downs of america and but for the phrygian tomb whose doorway stare at we from every rock seem as little familiar with the presence of man hadji youssuf in stop to arrange some of the baggage lose he hold of he mule and in spite of every effort to secure she the provoke beast keep she liberty for the rest of the day in vain do we head she off chase she coax she set trap for she : she be too cunning to be take in and march along at she ease run into every field of grain stop to crop the choicest bunch of grass or walk demurely in the caravan allow the hadji to come within arm 's length before she kick up she heel and dash away again we have a long chase through the clump of oak and holly but all to no purpose the great green gad-fly swarm around we bite myself as well as my horse hecatomb crush by my whip drop dead in the dust but the rank be immediately fill from some invisible reserve the soil be no longer bare but entirely cover with grass and flower in one of the valley i see a large patch of the crimson larkspur so thick as to resemble a pool of blood while cross a long hot hill we come upon a little arbor of stone cover with pine branch it inclose a ancient sarcophagus of marble nearly fill with water beside it stand a square cup with a handle rudely hew out of a piece of pine wood this be a charitable provision for traveller and constantly supply by the turcoman who live in the vicinity the last two hour of we journey that day be through a glorious forest of pine the road lay in a wind glen green and grassy and cover to the summit on both side with beautiful pine tree intermix with cedar the air have the true northern aroma and be more grateful than wine every turn of the glen disclose a charming woodland view it be a wild valley of the northern hill fill with the burning lustre of a summer sun and canopy by the brilliant blue of a summer sky there be sign of the woodman 's axe and the char ember of forest camp-fire i thought of the lovely _ cañadas _ in the pine forest behind monterey and could really have imagine myself there towards evening we reach a solitary guard-house on the edge of the forest the glen here open a little and a stone fountain of delicious water furnish all that we want for a camping-place the house be inhabit by three soldier sturdy good-humored fellow who immediately spread a mat in the shade for we and make we some excellent coffee a turcoman encampment in the neighborhood supply we with milk and egg the guardsman be good mussulman and take we for the same one of they ask I to let he know when the sun be down and i prolong he fast until it be quite dark when i give he permission to eat they all have tolerable stallion for they service and seem to live pleasantly enough in they wild way the fat stumpy corporal with he enormously broad pantaloons and automaton leg go down to the fountain with he musket and after take a rest and sighting full five minute fire at a dive without hit it he afterwards join we in a social pipe and we sit on a carpet at the door of the guard-house watch the splendid moonrise through the pine bough when the pipe have burn out i go to bed and sleep a long sweet sleep until dawn we know that the tomb of the phrygian king could not be far off and on make inquiry of the corporal find that he know the place it be not four hour distant by a by-road and as it would be impossible to reach it without a guide he would give we one of he man in consideration of a fee of twenty piastre the difficulty be evident in a hilly wooded country like this traverse by a labyrinth of valley and ravine and so we accept the soldier as we be about leave a old turcoman whose beard be dye a bright red come up say that he know mr h be a physician and could cure he of he deafness the morning air be sweet with the breath of cedar and pine and we ride on through the wood and over the open turfy glade in high spirit we be in the heart of a mountainous country clothe with evergreen forest except some open upland tract which show a thick green turf dot all over with park-like clump and single great tree the pine be noble trunk often sixty to eighty foot high and with bough dispose in all possible picturesqueness of form the cedar frequently show a solid white bole three foot in diameter we take a wind footpath often a mere track striking across the hill in a northern direction everywhere we meet the turk of the plain who be now encamp in the mountain to tend they flock through the summer month herd of sheep and goat be scatter over the green pasture-slope and the idle herd-boy bask in the morning sun play lively air on a reed flute resemble the arabic _ zumarra _ here and there be a woodman busy at a recently fell tree and we meet several of the creak cart of the country haul log all that we see have a pleasant rural air a smack of primitive and unsophisticated life from the higher ridge over which we pass we could see far to the east and west other range of pine-covered mountain and in the distance the cloudy line of loftier chain the trunk of the pine be nearly all char and many of the smaller tree dead from the fire which later in the year rage in these forest after four hour of varied and most inspiring travel we reach a district cover for the most part with oak wood -- a more open though still mountainous region there be a summer village of turk scatter over the nearest slope -- probably fifty house in all almost perfect counterpart of western log-cabin they be build of pine log lay crosswise and cover with rough board these as we be tell be the dwelling of the people who inhabit the village of khosref pasha khan during the winter great number of sheep and goat be browse over the hill or lie around the door of the house the latter be beautiful creature with heavy curved horn and long white silky hair that entirely hide they eye we stop at a house for water which the man bring out in a little cask he at first propose give we _ yaourt _ and he wife suggest _ kaïmak _ -lrb- sweet curd -rrb- which we agree to take but it prove to be only boil milk leave the village we take a path lead westward mount a long hill and again enter the pine forest before long we come to a well-built country-house somewhat resemble a swiss cottage it be two story high and there be a upper balcony with cushion divan overlook a thrive garden-patch and some fruit-tree three or four man be weed in the garden and the owner come up and welcome we a fountain of ice-cold water gush into a stone trough at the door make a tempting spot for we breakfast but we be bent on reach the tomb there be convenient out-house for fowl sheep and cattle the herd be out grazing along the edge of the forest and we hear the shrill joyous melody of the flute blow by the herd-boy we now reach a ridge whence we look down through the forest upon a long valley nearly half a mile wide and border on the opposite side by range of broken sandstone crag this be the place we seek -- the valley of the phrygian tomb already we could distinguish the hew face of the rock and the dark aperture to the chamber within the bottom of the valley be a bed of glorious grass blazon with flower and redolent of all vernal smell several peasant find it too hot to mow have throw they scythe along the swarth and be lie in the shade of a oak we ride over the new-cut hay up the opposite side and dismount at the face of the crag as we approach they the number of chamber hew in the rock the door and niche now open to the day surmount by shatter spire and turret give the whole mass the appearance of a grand fortress in ruin the crag which be of a very soft reddish-gray sandstone rise a hundred and fifty foot from they base and they summit be worn by the weather into the most remarkable form the principal monument be a broad project cliff one side of which have be cut so as to resemble the façade of a temple the sculptured part be about sixty foot high by sixty in breadth and represent a solid wall with two pilaster at the end uphold a architrave and pediment which be surmount by two large volute the whole face of the wall be cover with ornament resemble panel-work not in regular square but a labyrinth of intricate design in the center at the bottom be a shallow square recess surround by a elegant though plain moulding but there be no appearance of a entrance to the sepulchral chamber which may be hide in the heart of the rock there be a inscription in greek run up one side but it be of a later date than the work itself on one of the tomb there be a inscription : to king mida these relic be suppose to date from the period of the gordian dynasty about seven century before christ a little in front of a headland form by the summit wall of two meeting valley rise a mass of rock one hundred foot high cut into sepulchral chamber story above story with the trace of step between they lead to other still higher the whole rock which may be a hundred and fifty foot long by fifty foot broad have be scoop out leave but narrow partition to separate the chamber of the dead these chamber be all plain but some be of very elegant proportion with arched or pyramidal roof and arched recess at the side contain sarcophagus hew in the solid stone there be also many niche for cinerary urn the principal tomb have a portico support by column but the front be now entirely hurl down and only the elegant panelling and stone joist of the ceiling remain the entire hill be a succession of tomb there be not a rock which do not bear trace of they i might have count several hundred within a stone 's throw the position of these curious remains in a lonely valley shut in on all side by dark pine-covered mountain -- two of which be crown with a natural acropoli of rock resemble a fortress -- increase the interest with which they inspire the beholder the valley on the western side with its bed of ripe wheat in the bottom its tall wall tower and pinnacle of rock and its distant vista of mountain and forest be the most picturesque in phrygium the turcoman reaper who come up to see we and talk with we say that there be the remains of wall on the summit of the principal acropoli opposite we and that further up the valley there be a chamber with two column in front mr harrison and i saddle and ride off pass along a wall of fantastic rock-turret at the base of which be a natural column about ten foot high and five in diameter almost perfectly round and uphold a immense rock shape like a cocked hat in cross the meadow we see a turk sit in the sun beside a spring and busily engage in knit a stock after a ride of two mile we find the chamber hew like the façade of a temple in a isolate rock overlook two valley of wild meadow-land the pediment and cornice be simple and beautiful but the column have be break away the chamber be perfectly plain but the panel-work on the ceiling of the portico be entire after pass three hour in examine these tomb we take the track which we guide point out as the road to kiutahya we ride two hour through the forest and come out upon a wooded height overlook a grand open valley rich in grain-field and pasture land while i be contemplate this lovely view the road turn a corner of the ridge and lo before I there appear -lrb- as i thought -rrb- above the top of the pine high up on the mountain side a line of enormous tent those snow-white cone uprear they sharp spire and spread out they broad basis -- what could they be but a encampment of monster tent yet no they be pinnacle of white rock -- perfect cone from thirty to one hundred foot in height twelve in all and range side by side along the edge of the cliff with the precision of a military camp they be snow-white perfectly smooth and full and they basis touch what make the spectacle more singular there be no other appearance of the same rock on the mountain all around they be the dark-green of the pine out of which they rise like drift horn of unbroken snow i name this singular phenomenon -- which seem to have escape the notice of traveller -- the titan 's camp in another hour we reach a fountain near the village of kümbeh and pitch we tent for the night the village which be half a mile in length be build upon a singular crag which shoot up abruptly from the center of the valley rise at one extremity to a height of more than a hundred foot it be entirely desert the inhabitant have all go off to the mountain with they herd the solitary muezzin who cry the _ mughreb _ at the close of the fast and light the lamp on he minaret go through with he work in most unclerical haste now that there be no one to notice he we send achmet the _ katurgee _ to the mountain camp of the villager to procure a supply of fowl and barley we rise very early yesterday morning shiver in the cold air of the mountain and just as the sun burst through the pine look down the little hollow where we tent be pitch set the caravan in motion the ride down the valley be charming the land be naturally rich and highly cultivate which make its desertion the more singular league of wheat rye and poppy spread around we leave for the summer warmth to do its silent work the dew sparkle on the field as we ride through they and the splendor of the flower in blossom be equal to that of the plain of palestine there be purple white and scarlet poppy the rich crimson larkspur the red anemone the golden daisy the pink convolvulus and a host of smaller bloom so intensely bright and dazzling in they hue that the meadow be richer than a pavement of precious jewel to look towards the sun over a field of scarlet poppy be like look on a bed of live coal the light strike through the petal make they burn as with a inward fire out of this wilderness of gorgeous color rise the tall spire of a larger plant cover with great yellow flower while here and there the snowy blossom of a clump of hawthorn sweeten the morning air a short distance beyond kümbeh we pass another group of ancient tomb one of which be of curious design a isolate rock thirty foot in height by twenty in diameter be cut so as to resemble a triangular tower with the apex bevel a chamber contain a sarcophagus be hew out of the interior the entrance be ornament with double column in bas-relief and a pediment there be another arched chamber cut directly through the base of the triangle with a niche on each side hollow out at the bottom so as to form a sarcophagus leave these the last of the phrygian tomb we strike across the valley and ascend a high range of hill cover with pine to a upland wooded region here we find a summer village of log cabin scatter over a grassy slope the people regard we with some curiosity and the woman hastily conceal they face mr h ride up to a large new house and peep in between the log there be several woman inside who start up in great confusion and throw over they head whatever article be most convenient a old man with a long white beard neatly dress in a green jacket and shawl turban come out and welcome we i ask for _ kaïmak _ which he promise and immediately bring out a carpet and spread it on the ground then follow a large basin of kaïmak with wooden spoon three loaf of bread and a plate of cheese we seat ourselves on the carpet and delve in with the spoon while the old man retire lest he appetite should be provoke the milk be excellent nor be the bread and cheese to be despise while we be eat the khowagee or schoolmaster of the community a genteel little man in a round white turban come op to inquire of françois who we be that effendi in the blue dress say he be the bey be he not yes say f and the other with the striped shirt and white turban be a writer -lrb- here he be not far wrong -rrb- but how be it that the effendis do not speak turkish he persist because say françois they father be exile by sultan mahmoud when they be small child they have grow up in aleppo like arab and have not yet learn turkish but god grant that the sultan may not turn he face away from they and that they may regain the rank they father once have in stamboul god grant it reply the khowagee greatly interested in the story by this time we have eat we full share of the kaïmak which be finish by françois and the katurgee the old man now come up mount on a dun mare state that he be bind for kiutahya and be delighted with the prospect of travel in such good company i give one of he young child some money as the kaïmak be tender out of pure hospitality and so we ride off we new companion be arm to the tooth have a long gun with a heavy wooden stock and nondescript lock and a sword of excellent metal it be in fact a weapon of the old greek empire and the cross be still enamel in gold at the root of the blade in spite of all he effort to scratch it out he be something of a _ fakeer _ have make a pilgrimage to mecca and jerusalem he be very inquisitive ply françois with question about the government the latter answer that we be not connect with the government but the old fellow shrewdly hint that he know better -- we be person of rank travel incognito he be very attentive to we offer we water at every fountain although he believe we to be good mussulman we find he of some service as a guide shorten we road by take by-path through the wood for several hour we traverse a beautifully wood region of hill graceful clump of pine shaded the grassy knoll where the sheep and silky-haired goat be bask at rest and the air be fill with a warm summer smell blow from the bank of golden broom now and then from the thicket of laurel and arbutus a shrill shepherd 's reed pipe some joyous woodland melody be it a faun astray among the hill green dell open to the sunshine and beautiful as dream of arcady divide the grove of pine the sky overhead be pure and cloudless clasp the landscape with its belt of peace and silence oh that delightful region haunt by all the bright spirit of the immortal grecian song chase away from the rest of the earth here they have find a home -- here secret altar remain to they from the time that be depart out of these wood we pass into a lonely plain inclose by piny hill that brighten in the thin pure ether in the distance be some shepherd ' tent and musical goat-bell tinkle along the edge of the wood from the crest of a lofty ridge beyond this plain we look back over the wild solitude wherein we have be travel for two day -- long range of dark hill fading away behind each other with a perspective that hint of the hidden gulf between from the western slope a still more extensive prospect open before we over ridge cover with forest of oak and pine we see the valley of the pursek the ancient thymbrius stretch far away to the misty line of keshish dagh the mountain behind kintahya loom up high and grand make a fine feature in the middle distance we catch but fleeting glimpse of the view through the tree and then plunge into the forest again descend to a cultivate slope whereon there be a little village now desert the graveyard beside it be shaded with large cedar-tree and near it there be a fountain of excellent water here say the old man you can wash and pray and then rest awhile under the tree françois excuse we by say that while on a journey we always bath before pray but not to slight he faith entirely i wash my hand and face before sit down to we scanty breakfast of bread and water we path now lead down through long wind glen over grow with oak from which the wild yellow honeysuckle fall in a shower of blossom as we draw near the valley the old man begin to hint that he presence have be of great service to we and deserve recompense god know say he to françois in what corner of the mountain you might now be if i have not accompany you oh reply françois there be always plenty of people among the wood who would have be equally as kind as yourself in show we the way he then speak of the robber in the neighborhood and point out some grave by the road-side as those of person who have be murder but he add everybody in these part know I and whoever be in company with I be always safe the greek assure he that we always depend on ourselves for we safety defeat on these tack he boldly affirm that he service be worthy of payment but say françois you tell we at the village that you have business in kiutahya and would be glad to join we for the sake of have company on the road well then rejoin the old fellow make a last effort i leave the matter to you politeness certainly reply the imperturbable dragoman we could not be so impolite as to offer money to a man of you wealth and station we could not insult you by give you alms the old turcoman thereupon give a shrug and a grunt make a sullen good-by salutation and leave we it be nearly six o'clock when we reach the pursek there be no sign of the city but we could barely discern a old fortress on the lofty cliff which command the town a long stone bridge cross the river which here separate into half a dozen channel the water be swift and clear and wind away in devious maze through the broad green meadow we hurry on think we see minaret in the distance but they prove to be poplar the sun sink lower and lower and finally go down before there be any token of we be in the vicinity of the city soon however a line of tiled roof appear along the slope of a hill on we left and turn its base we see the city before we fill the mouth of a deep valley or gorge which open from the mountain but the horse be saddle and françois tell I it be time to put up my

residence of kossuth and he companion in exile beyond they we come to a broad street down which flow the vilest stream of filth of which even a turkish city could ever boast the house on either side be two story high the upper part of wood with hang balcony over which shoot the eaves of the tiled roof the welcome cannon have just sound announce the close of the day 's fast the coffee-shop be already crowd with lean and hungry customer the pipe be fill and light and the coffee smoke in the finjan in half a minute such whiff arise on all side as it would have cheer the heart of a genuine smoker to behold out of these cheerful place we pass into other street which be entirely desert the inhabitant be at dinner it have a weird uncomfortable effect to ride through street where the clatter of we horse ' hoof be the only sound of life at last we reach the entrance to a bazaar and near it a khan -- a new khan very neatly build and with a spare room so much better than we expect that we congratulate ourselves heartily we unpack in a hurry and françois run off to the bazaar from which he speedily return with some roast kid cucumber and cherry we light two lamp i borrow the oda-bashus 's narghileh and françois learning that it be we national anniversary procure we a flask of greek wine that we might do it honor the beverage however resemble a mixture of vinegar and sealing-wax and we contented ourselves with drinking patriotic toast in two finjan of excellent coffee but in the midst of we enjoyment happen to cast my eye on the wall i see a sight that turn all we honey into gall score on score -- nay hundred on hundred -- of enormous bed-bug swarm on the plaster and be already descend to we bed and baggage to sleep there be impossible but we succeed in get possession of one of the outside balcony where we make we bed after search they thoroughly in the evening a merchant who speak a little arabic come up to I and ask : be not you excellency 's friend the _ hakim pasha _ -lrb- chief physician -rrb- i do not venture to assent but reply : no he be a _ sowakh _ this be beyond he comprehension and he go away with the impression that mr h be much greater than a _ hakim pasha _ i sleep soundly on my out-doors bed but be awaken towards morning by two tremendous clap of thunder echo in the gorge and the rattle of rain on the roof of the khan i spend two or three hour next morning in take a survey of kiutahya the town be much larger than i have suppose : i should judge it to contain from fifty to sixty thousand inhabitant the situation be remarkable and give a picturesque effect to the place when see from above which make one forget its internal filth it be build in the mouth of a gorge and around the basis of the hill on either side the lofty mountain which rise behind it supply it with perpetual spring of pure water at every dozen step you come upon a fountain and every large street have a brook in the center the house be all two and many of they three story high with hang balcony which remind I much of switzerland the bazaar be very extensive cover all the base of the hill on which stand the ancient citadel the goods display be mostly european cotton fabric _ quincaillerie _ boot and slipper pipe-stick and silk in the part devote to the produce of the country i see very fine cherry cucumber and lettuce and bundle of magnificent clover three to four foot high we climb a steep path to the citadel which cover the summit of a abrupt isolate hill connect by a shoulder with the great range the wall be nearly a mile in circuit consist almost wholly of immense circular buttress place so near each other that they almost touch the connect wall be break down on the northern side so that from below the buttress have the appearance of enormous shattered column they be build of rough stone with regular layer of flat burnt brick on the highest part of the hill stand the fortress or stronghold a place which must have be almost impregnable before the invention of cannon the structure probably date from the ninth or tenth century but be build on the foundation of more ancient edifice the old greek city of cotyaeum -lrb- whence kiutahya -rrb- probably stand upon this hill within the citadel be a upper town contain about a hundred house the residence apparently of poor family from the circuit of the wall on every side there be grand view over the plain the city and the gorge of the mountain behind the valley of the pursek freshen by the last night 's shower spread out a sheet of vivid green to the pine-covered mountain which bound it on all side around the city it be adorn with grove and garden and in the direction of brousa white road go wind away to other garden and village in the distance the mountain of phrygium through which we have pass be the loftiest in the circle that inclose the valley the city at we foot present a thick array of red-tiled roof out of which rise here and there the taper shaft of a minaret or the dome of a mosque or bath from the southern side of the citadel we look down into the gorge which supply kiutahya with water -- a wild desert landscape of white crag and shatter peak of gray rock hang over a narrow wind bed of the greenest foliage instead of take the direct road to brousa we decide to make a detour of two day in order to visit the ruin of the old greek city of oezanus which be thirty-six mile south of kiutahya leave at noon we ascend the gorge behind the city by delightfully embowered path at first under the eaves of superb walnut-tree and then through wild thicket of willow hazel privet and other shrub tangle together with the odorous white honeysuckle near the city the mountain-side be bare white mass of gypsum and other rock in many place with the purest chrome-yellow hue but as we advance they be clothe to the summit with copsewood the stream that foam down these perennial height be lead into bury channel to come to light again in sparkling fountain pour into ever-full stone basin the day be cool and cloudy and the heavy shadow which hang on the great side of the mountain gateway heighten by contrast the glory of the sunlit plain see through they after pass the summit ridge probably 5000 foot above the sea we come upon a wooded hilly region stretch away in long misty line to murad dagh whose head be spot with snow there be patch of wheat and rye in the hollow and the bell of distant herd tinkle occasionally among the tree there be no village on the road and we be on the way to one which we see in the distance when we come upon a meadow of good grass with a small stream run through it here we encamp send achmet the katurgee to the village for milk and egg the ewe have just be milk for the supper of they owner but they go over the flock again strip they udder which greatly improve the quality of the milk the night be so cold that i could scarcely sleep during the morning hour there be a chill heavy dew on the meadow but when françois awake I at sunrise the sky be splendidly clear and pure and the early beam have a little warmth in they we coffee before start make with sheep 's milk be the richest i ever drink after ride for two hour across broad wild ridge cover with cedar we reach a height overlook the valley of the rhyndacus or rather the plain whence he draw he source -- a circular level ten or twelve mile in diameter and contracting towards the west into a narrow dell through which he water find outlet several village each embower in garden be scatter along the basis of the hill that inclose it we take the wrong road but be set aright by a herdsman and after thread a lane between thriving grain-field be cheer by the sight of the temple of oezani lift on its acropoli above the orchard of chavdür and stand out sharp and clear against the purple of the hill we approach to the city be mark by the block of sculptured marble that line the way : elegant moulding cornice and entablature throw together with common stone to make wall between the field the village be build on both side of the rhyndacus it be a ordinary turkish hamlet with tiled roof and chimney and exhibit very few of the remains of the old city in its composition this i suspect be owe to the great size of the hew block especially of the pillar cornice and entablature nearly all of which be from twelve to fifteen foot long it be from the size and number of these scatter block rather than from the building which still partially exist that one obtain a idea of the size and splendor of the ancient oezanus the place be fill with fragment especially of column of which there be several hundred nearly all finely flute the rhyndacus be still span by a ancient bridge of three arch and both bank be line with pier of hew stone tall poplar and massy walnut of the richest green shade the clear water and there be many picturesque combination of foliage and ruin -- death and life -- which would charm a painter 's eye near the bridge we stop to examine a pile of immense fragment which have be throw together by the turk -- pillar cornice altar piece of a frieze with bull ' head bind together by hang garland and a large square block with a legible tablet it resemble a altar in form and from the word _ artemidoron _ appear to have belong to some temple to diana pass through the village we come to a grand artificial platform on its western side call the acropoli it be of solid masonry five hundred foot square and average ten foot in height on the eastern side it be support on rude though massive arch resemble etruscan workmanship on the top and around the edge of this platform lie great number of fluted column and immense fragment of cornice and architrave in the center on a foundation platform about eight foot high stand a beautiful ionic temple one hundred foot in length on approach it appear nearly perfect except the roof and so many of the column remain stand that its ruin condition scarcely injure the effect there be seventeen column on the side and eight at the end ionic in style fluted and fifty foot in height about half the cellum remain with a elegant frieze and cornice along the top and a series of tablet set in panel of ornamental sculpture run along the side the front of the cellum include a small open peristyle with two composite corinthian column at the entrance make with those of the outer colonnade eighteen column stand the tablet contain greek inscription perfectly legible where the stone have not be shatter under the temple there be large vault which we find fill up with young kid who have go in there to escape the heat of the sun the portico be occupy by sheep which at first refuse to make room for we and give strong olfactory evidence of they partiality for the temple as a resting-place on the side of a hill about three hundred yard to the north be the remains of a theater cross some patch of barley and lentil we enter a stadium form a extension of the theater -- that be it take the same breadth and direction so that the two might be consider as one grand work more than one thousand foot long by nearly four hundred wide the wall of the stadium be hurl down except a entrance of five arch of massive masonry on the western side we ride up the artificial valley between high grassy hill completely cover with what at a distance resemble loose board but which be actually the long marble seat of the stadium urge we horse over pile of loose block we reach the base of the theater climb the fragment that cumber the main entrance and look on the spacious arena and gallery within although greatly ruin the material of the whole structure remain and might be put together again it be a grand wreck the colossal fragment which have tumble from the arched proscenium fill the arena and the row of seat though broken and disjointed still retain they original order it be somewhat more than a semicircle the radius be about one hundred and eighty foot the original height be upward of fifty foot and there be fifty row of seat in all each row capable of seat two hundred person so that the number of spectator who could be accommodate be eight thousand the fragment cumber the arena be enormous and highly interesting from they character there be rich block of cornice ten foot long fluted and reeded pillar great arc of heavily-carved sculpture which appear to have serve as architrave from pillar to pillar along the face of the proscenium where there be every trace of have be a colonnade and other block sculpture with figure of animal in alto-relievo there be generally two figure on each block and among those which could be recognize be the dog and the lion door open from the proscenium into the retiring-room of the actor under which be the vault where the beast be keep a young fox or jackal start from he siesta as we enter the theater and take refuge under the loose block look backwards through the stadium from the seat of the theater we have a lovely view of the temple stand out clear and bright in the midst of the summer plain with the snow-streaked summit of murad dagh in the distance it be a picture which i shall long remember the desolation of the magnificent ruin be make all the more impressive by the silent solitary air of the region around they leave chavdür in the afternoon we strike northward down the valley of the rhyndacus over tract of rolling land intersperse with grove of cedar and pine there be so many branch road and crossing that we could not fail to go wrong and after two or three hour find ourselves in the midst of a forest on the broad top of a mountain without any road at all there be some herdsman tend they flock near at hand but they could give we no satisfactory direction we thereupon take we own course and soon bring up on the brink of a precipice overhang a deep valley away to the eastward we catch a glimpse of the rhyndacus and the wooden minaret of a little village on he bank follow the edge of the precipice we come at last to a glen down which run a rough footpath that finally conduct we by a long road through the forest to the village of daghje köi where we be now encamp the place seem to be devote to the making of flint and the street be fill with pile of the chip fragment we tent be pitch on the bank of the river in a barren meadow the people tell we that the whole region round about have just be visit by a plague of grasshopper which have destroy they crop we beast have wander off to the hill in search for grass and the disconsolate hadji be hunting they achmet the katurgee lie near the fire sick mr harrison complain of fever and françois move about languidly with a dismal countenance so here we be in the solitude of bithynium but there be no god but god and that which be destine come to pass chapter xxiv the mysian olympus journey down the valley -- the plague of grasshopper -- a defile -- the town of taushanlü -- the camp of famine -- we leave the rhyndacus -- the base of olympus -- primeval forest -- the guard-house -- scenery of the summit -- forest of beech -- saw-mill -- descent of the mountain -- the view of olympus -- morning -- the land of harvest -- aineghiöl -- a showery ride -- the plain of brousa -- the structure of olympus -- we reach brousa -- the tent be furl i look yet farther and higher and see in the heaven a silvery cloud that stand fast and still against the breeze \* \* \* \* and so it be as a sign and a testimony -- almost as a call from the neglect god that i now saw and acknowledge the snowy crown of the mysian olympus kinglake brousa _ July _ 9 1852 from daghje küi there be two road to taushanlü but the people inform we that the one which lead across the mountain be difficult to find and almost impracticable we therefore take the river road which we find picturesque in the highest degree the narrow dell of the rhyndacus wound through a labyrinth of mountain sometimes turn at sharp angle between craggy buttress cover with forest and sometimes broaden out into a sweep of valley where the villager be work in company among the grain and poppy field the bank of the stream be line with oak willow and sycamore and forest of pine descend from the mountain frequently overhang the road we meet number of peasant go to and from the field and once a company of some twenty woman who on see we cluster together like a flock of frightened sheep and throw they mantle over they head they have curiosity enough however to peep at we as we go by and i make they a salutation which they return and then burst into a chorus of hearty laughter all this region be ravage by a plague of grasshopper the earth be black with they in many place and we horse plough up a living spray as they drive forward through the meadow every spear of grass be destroy and the wheat and rye field be terribly cut up we pass a large crag where myriad of starling have build they nest and every starling have a grasshopper in he mouth we cross the river in order to pass a narrow defile by which it force its way through the rocky height of dumanidj dagh soon after pass the ridge a broad and beautiful valley expand before we it be about ten mile in breadth nearly level and surround by picturesque range of wooded mountain it be well cultivate principally in rye and poppy and more thickly populated than almost any part of europe the tinned top of the minaret of taushanlü shone over the top of a hill in front and there be a large town nearly opposite on the other bank of the rhyndacus and seven small village scatter about in various direction most of the latter however be merely the winter habitation of the herdsman who be now live in tent on the mountain top all over the valley the peasant be at work in the harvest-field cut and bind grain gathering opium from the poppy or weed the young tobacco in the south over the rim of the hill that shut in this pastoral solitude rise the long blue summit of urus dagh we ride into taushanlü which be a long town fill up a hollow between two stony hill the house be all of stone two story high with tiled roof and chimney so that but for the clapboard and shingled minaret it would answer for a north-german village the street be nearly desert and even in the bazaar which be of some extent we find but few person those few however show a laudable curiosity with regard to we cluster about we whenever we stop and stare at we with provoke pertinacity we have some difficulty in procure information concern the road the direction be so contradictory that we be as much in the dark as ever we lose half a hour in wander among the hill and after travel four hour over piny upland without find the village of kara köi encamp on a dry plain on the western bank of the river there be not a spear of grass for the beast everything be eat up by the grasshopper and there be no turcoman near who could supply we with food so we dine on hard bread and black coffee and we forlorn beast walk languidly about crop the dry stalk of weed and the juiceless root of the dead grass we cross the river next morning and take a road follow its course and shaded with willow and sycamore the lofty wooded range of the mysian olympus lay before we and we day 's work be to pass they after pass the village of kara köi we leave the valley of the rhyndacus and commence ascend one of the long project spur thrust out from the main chain of olympus at first we ride through thicket of scrubby cedar but soon come to magnificent pine forest that grow taller and sturdier the higher we clomb a superb mountain landscape open behind we the valley sink deeper and deeper and at last disappear behind the great ridge that heave themselves out of the wilderness of smaller hill all these ridge be cover with forest and as we look backwards out of the tremendous gulf up the side of which we be climb the scenery be wholly wild and uncultivated we path hang on the imminent side of a chasm so steep that one slip might have be destruction to both horse and rider far below we at the bottom of the chasm roar a invisible torrent the opposite side vapory from its depth rise like a immense wall against heaven the pine be even grander than those in the wood of phrygium here they grow taller and more dense hang they cloudy bough over the giddy depths and clutch with desperate root to the almost perpendicular side of the gorge in many place they be the primeval forest of olympus and the hamadryad be not yet frighten from they haunt thus slowly toiling up through the sublime wilderness breathe the cold pure air of those lofty region we come at last to a little stream slowly trickle down the bed of the gorge it be shaded not by the pine but by the northern beech with its white trunk and close confidential bough make for the talk of lover and the meditation of poet here we stop to breakfast but there be nothing for the poor beast to eat and they wait for we droopingly with they head thrust together while we sit there three camel descend to the stream and after they a guard with a long gun he be a well-made man with a brown face keen black eye and piratical air and would have make a good hero of modern romance higher up we come to a guard house on a little clear space surround by beech forest it be a rough stone hut with a white flag plant on a pole before it and a miniature water-wheel run a miniature saw at a most destructive rate beside the door continue we way we enter on a region such as i have no idea could be find in asia the mountain from the bottom of the gorge to they topmost summit be cover with the most superb forest of beech i ever see -- mass of impenetrable foliage of the most brilliant green touch here and there by the darker top of a pine we road be through a deep dark shade and on either side up and down we see but a cool shadowy solitude sprinkle with dot of emerald light and redolent with the odor of damp earth moss and dead leave it be a forest the counterpart of which could only be find in america -- such primeval magnitude of growth such wild luxuriance such complete solitude and silence through the shaft of the pine we have catch glorious glimpse of the blue mountain world below we but now the beech fold we in its arm and whisper in we ear the legend of we northern home there on the ridge of the mysian olympus sacred to the bright god of grecian song i find the inspiration of we darker and colder clime and age _ o gloriosus spiritus degli boschi _ i could scarcely contain myself from surprise and joy françois fail to find french adjective sufficient for he admiration and even we cheating katurgee be touch by the spirit of the scene on either side whenever a glimpse could be have through the bough we look upon lean wall of tree whose tall round top bask in the sunshine while they basis be wrap in the shadow cast by themselves thus fold over each other like scale or feather on a falcon 's wing they clothe the mountain the tree be taller and have a darker and more glossy leaf than the american beech by and by patch of blue shone between the bough before we a sign that the summit be near and before one o'clock we stand upon the narrow ridge form the crest of the mountain here although we be between five and six thousand foot above the sea the wood of beech be a hundred foot in height and shut out all view on the northern side the forest scenery be even grander than on the southern the beech be magnificent tree straight as a arrow and from a hundred to a hundred and fifty foot in height only now and then could we get any view beyond the shadowy depths sink below we and then it be only to see similar mountain range bury in foliage and roll far behind each other into the distance twice in the depth of the gorge we see a saw-mill turn by the snow-cold torrent pile of pine and beechen board be heap around they and the sawyer be busily ply they lonely business the axe of the woodman echo but rarely through the gulf though many large tree lay fell by the roadside the rock which occasionally crop out of the soil be white marble and there be a shine precipice of it three hundred foot high on the opposite side of the gorge after four hour of steady descent during the last hour of which we pass into a forest entirely of oak we reach the first terrace at the base of the mountain here as i be ride in advance of the caravan i meet a company of turkish officer who salute I with a inclination of the most profound reverence i reply with due oriental gravity which seem to justify they respect for when they meet françois who be everywhere look upon as a turkish janissary they ask : be not you master a _ shekh el-islàm _ you be right : he be answer the unscrupulous greek a shekh el-islàm be a sort of high-priest corresponding in dignity to a cardinal in the roman catholic church it be rather singular that i be generally take for a secretary of some kind or a moslem priest while my companion who by this time have assume the oriental expression be suppose to be either medical or military we have no sooner leave the forest and enter the copsewood which follow than the blue bulk of olympus suddenly appear in the west tower far into the sky it be a magnificent mountain with a broad though broken summit streak with snow before we stretch away almost to he base lay a grand mountain slope cover with orchard and golden harvest-field through lane of hawthorn and chestnut tree in blossom which be overgrow with snowy clemati and make a shady roof above we head we reach the little village of orta köi and encamp in a grove of pear-tree there be grass for we beast who be on the brink of starvation and fowl and cucumber for ourselves who have be limit to bread and coffee for two day but as one necessity be restore another disappear we have smoke the last of we delicious aleppo tobacco and that which the villager give we be of very inferior quality nevertheless the pipe which we smoke with they in the twilight beside the marble fountain promote that peace of mind which be the sweetest preparative of slumber françois be determine to finish we journey to-day he have a presentiment that we should reach brousa although i expect nothing of the kind he call we long before the lovely pastoral valley in which we lay have a suspicion of the sun but just in time to see the first ray strike the high head of olympus the long line of snow blush with a opaline radiance against the dark-blue of the morning sky and all the forest and field below lay still and cool and dewy lap in dream yet unrecalled by the fading moon i bathed my face in the cold well that perpetually pour over its full brim drink the coffee which françois have already prepare spring into the saddle and begin the last day of we long pilgrimage the tent be fold alas for the last time and now farewell to the freedom of we wander life shall i ever feel it again the dew glisten on the chestnut and the walnut on the wild grape-vine and wild rose that shaded we road as we follow the course of a olympian stream through a charming dell into the great plain below everywhere the same bountiful soil the same superb orchard the same ripe field of wheat and barley and silver rye the peasant be at work man and woman cut the grain with rude scythe bind it into sheaf and stack it in the field as we ride over the plain the boy come run out to we with handful of grain salute we from afar bidding we welcome as pilgrim wish we as many year of prosperity as there be kernel in they sheaf and kiss the hand that give they the harvest-toll the whole landscape have a air of plenty peace and contentment the people all greet we cordially and once a mevlevus dervish and a stately turk ride in company salute I so respectfully stop to speak with I that i quite regret be oblige to assume a air of dignified reserve and ride away from they ere long we see the two white minaret of aineghiöl above the line of orchard in front of we and in three hour after start reach the place it be a small town not particularly clean but with brisk-looking bazaar in one of the house i see half-a-dozen pair of superb antler the spoil of olympian stag the bazaar be cover with a trellised roof overgrow with grape-vine which hang enormous bunch of young grape over the shop-board we be cheer by the news that brousa be only eight hour distant and i now begin to hope that we might reach it we jog on as fast as we could urge we weary horse pass another belt of orchard land pay more harvest-toll to the reaper and commence ascend a chain of low hill which divide the plain of aineghiöl from that of brousa at a fountain call the mid-day _ konnàk _ we meet some traveller come from brousa who inform we that we could get there by the time of _ asser _ prayer round the north-eastern base of olympus we now see before we the long headland which form he south-western extremity a storm be arise from the sea of marmora and heavy white cloud settle on the topmost summit of the mountain the wind begin to blow fresh and cool and when we have reach a height overlook the deep valley in the bottom of which lie the picturesque village of ak-su there be long showery line come up from the sea and a filmy sheet of gray rain descend between we and olympus throw he vast bulk far into the background at ak-su the first shower meet we pour so fast and thick that we be oblige to put on we capote and halt under a walnut-tree for shelter but it soon pass over lay the dust for the time and make the air sweet and cool we push forward over height cover with young forest of oak which be protect by the government in order that they may furnish ship-timber on the right we look down into magnificent valley open towards the west into the the plain of brousa but when in the middle of the afternoon we reach the last height and see the great plain itself the climax be attain it be the crown of all that we have yet see this superb plain or valley thirty mile long by five in breadth spread away to the westward between the mighty mass of olympus on the one side and a range of lofty mountain on the other the side of which present a charming mixture of forest and cultivate land olympus cover with wood of beech and oak tower to the cloud that conceal he snowy head and far in advance under the last cape he throw out towards the sea the hundred minaret of brousa stretch in a white and glittering line like the mast of a navy whose hull be bury in the leafy sea no word can describe the beauty of the valley the blending of the richest cultivation with the wildest natural luxuriance here be garden and orchard there grove of superb chestnut-tree in blossom here field of golden grain or green pasture-land there arcadian thicket overgrow with clemati and wild rise here lofty poplar grow beside the stream there spiry cypress look down from the slope : and all blended in one whole so rich so grand so gorgeous that i scarcely breathe when it first burst upon I and now we descend to its level and ride westward along the base of olympus grandest of asian mountain this after-storm view although he head be shroud be sublime he base be a vast sloping terrace league in length resemble the night of step by which the ancient temple be approach from this foundation rise four mighty pyramid two thousand foot in height and completely mantle with forest they be very nearly regular in they form and size and be flank to the east and west by headland or abutment the slope of which be longer and more gradual as if to strengthen the great structure pile upon the four pyramid be other nearly as large above whose green pinnacle appear still other and higher one bare and bleak and clustering thickly together to uphold the great central dome of snow between the basis of the lowest the stream which drain the gorge of the mountain issue forth cut they way through the foundation terrace and widen they bed downward to the plain like the throat of bugle where in winter rain they pour forth the hoarse grand monotone of they olympian music these broad bed be now dry and stony tract dot all over with clump of dwarf sycamore and thread by the summer stream shrunken in bulk but still swift cold and clear as ever we reach the city before night and françois be glad to find he presentiment fulfil we have safely pass through the untravelled heart of asia minor and be now almost in sight of europe the camp-fire be extinguish the tent be furl we be no longer happy nomad masquerade in moslem garb we shall soon become prosaic christian and meekly hold out we wrist for the handcuffs of civilization ah prate as we will of the progress of the race we be but forge additional fetter unless we preserve that

the whole length of the town which be build on the side of olympus and on three bluff or spur which project from it the situation be more picturesque than that of damascus and from the remarkable number of its white dome and minaret shoot upward from the grove of chestnut walnut and cypress-tree the city be even more beautiful there be large mosque on all the most prominent point and near the center of the city the ruin of a ancient castle build upon a crag the place as we ride along present a shift diorama of delightful view the hotel be at the extreme western end of the city not far from its celebrated hot bath it be a new building in european style and be build high on the slope command one of the most glorious prospects i ever enjoy from window make with hand what a comfort it be to go up stair into a clean bright cheerful room to drop at full length on a broad divan to eat a christian meal to smoke a narghileh of the softest persian tobacco and finally most exquisite of all luxury to creep between cool clean sheet on a curtained bed and find it impossible to sleep on account of the delicious novelty of the sensation at night another storm come up from the sea of marmora tremendous peal of thunder echo in the gorge of olympus and sharp broad flash of lightning give we blind glimpse of the glorious plain below the rain fall in heavy shower but we tent-life be just close and we sit securely at we window and enjoy the sublime scene the sun rise over the distant mountain of isnik shone full in my face awake I to a morning view of the valley which freshen by the night 's thunder-storm shone wonderfully bright and clear after coffee we go to see the bath which be on the side of the mountain a mile from the hotel the finest one call the kalputcha hammam be at the base of the hill the entrance hall be very large and cover by two lofty dome in the center be a large marble urn-shaped fountain pour out a abundant flood of cold water out of this we pass into a immense rotunda fill with steam and traverse by long pencil of light fall from hole in the roof a small but very beautiful marble fountain cast up a jet of cold water in the center beyond this be still another hall of the same size but with a circular basin twenty-five foot in diameter in the center the floor be marble mosaic and the basin be line with brilliantly-colored tile it be keep constantly full by the natural hot stream of the mountain there be a number of person in the pool but the atmosphere be so hot that we do not long disturb they by we curiosity we then ascend to the armenian bath which be the neatest of all but it be give up to the woman and we be therefore oblige to go to a turkish one adjoining the room into which we be take be so hot that a violent perspiration immediately break out all over my body and by the time the _ dellèks _ be ready to rasp I i be as limp as a wet towel and as plastic as a piece of putty the man who take I be sweat away almost to nothing he very bone appear to have become soft and pliable the water be slightly sulphureous and the pailful which he dash over my head be so hot that they produce the effect of a chill -- a violent nervous shudder the temperature of the spring be 180 ° fahrenheit and i suppose the tank into which he afterwards plunge I must have be nearly up to the mark when at last i be lay on the couch my body be so parboil that i perspire at all pore for full a hour -- a feeling too warm and unpleasant at first but presently merge into a mood which be wholly rapturous and heavenly i be like a soft white cloud that rest all of a summer afternoon on the peak of a distant mountain i feel the couch on which i lay no more than the cloud might feel the cliff on which it linger so airily i see nothing but peaceful glorious sight space of clear blue sky stretch of quiet lawn lovely valley thread by the gentlest of stream azure lake unruffled by a breath calm far out on mid-ocean and alpine peak bath in the flush of a autumnal sunset my mind retrace all we journey from aleppo and there be a halo over every spot i have visit i dwelt with rapture on the piny hill of phrygium on the gorge of taurus on the beechen solitude of olympus would to heaven that i might describe those scene as i then feel they all be reveal to I : the heart of nature lay bare and i read the meaning and know the inspiration of she every mood then as my frame grow cooler and the fragrant cloud of the narghileh which have help my dream diminish i be like that same summer cloud when it feel a gentle breeze and be lift above the hill float along independent of earth but for its shadow brousa be a very long straggling place extend for three or four mile along the side of the mountain but present a very picturesque appearance from every point the house be nearly all three story high build of wood and unburnt brick and each story project over the other after the manner of german town of the middle age they have not the hang balcony which i have find so quaint and pleasing in kiutahya but especially in the greek quarter many of they be plaster and paint of some bright color which give a gay cheerful appearance to the street besides brousa be the cleanest turkish town i have see the mountain stream traverse most of the street and every heavy rain wash they out thoroughly the whole city have a brisk active air and the workman appear both more skilful and more industrious than in the other part of asia minor i notice a great many worker in copper iron and wood and a extensive manufactory of shoe and saddle brousa however be principally note for its silk which be produce in this valley and other to the south and east the manufactory be near the city i look over some of the fabric in the bazaar but find they nearly all imitation of european stuff weave in mixed silk and cotton and even more costly than the silk of damascus we pass the whole length of the bazaar and then turn up one of the side street on we right cross a deep ravine by a high stone bridge above and below we there be other bridge under which a stream flow down from the mountain thence we ascend the height whereon stand the largest and one of the oldest mosque in brousa the position be remarkably fine command a view of nearly the whole city and the plain below it we enter the court-yard boldly françois take the precaution to speak to I only in arabic as there be a turk within mr h go to the fountain wash he hand and face but do not dare to swallow a drop put on a most dolorous expression of countenance as if perish with thirst the mosque be a plain square building with a large dome and two minaret the door be a rich and curious specimen of the _ stalactitic _ style so frequent in saracenic building we peep into the window and although the mosque which do not appear to be in common use be darken saw enough to show that the interior be quite plain just above this edifice stand a large octagonal tomb surmount by a dome and richly adorn with arabesque cornice and coating of green and blue tile it stand in a small garden inclosure and there be a sort of porter 's lodge at the entrance as we approach a old gray-bearded man in a green turban come out and on françois request entrance for we take a key and conduct we to the building he have not the slightest idea of we be christian we take off we slipper before touch the lintel of the door as the place be particularly holy then throw open the door the old man linger a few moment after we enter so as not to disturb we prayer -- a mark of great respect we advance to the edge of the parapet turn we face towards mecca and imitate the usual mohammedan prayer on enter a mosque by hold both arm outspread for a few moment then bring the hand together and bow the face upon they this do we leisurely examine the building and the old man be ready enough to satisfy we curiosity it be a rich and elegant structure light from the dome the wall be line with brilliant tile and have a elaborate cornice with arabic inscription in gold the floor be cover with a carpet whereon stand eight or ten ancient coffin surround a larger one which occupy a raise platform in the center they be all of wood heavily carve and many of they entirely cover with gilded inscription these accord to the old man be the coffin of the ottoman sultan who have reign at brousa previous to the taking of constantinople with some member of they family there be four sultan among whom be mahomet i and a certain achmet orchan the founder of the ottoman dynasty be bury somewhere in brousa and the great central coffin may have be he françois and i talk entirely in arabic and the old man ask : who be these hadji whereupon f immediately answer : they be effendi from baghdad we have intend make the ascent of olympus but the summit be too thickly cover with cloud on the morning of the second day therefore we determine to take up the line of march for constantinople the last scene of we strange eventful history with the katurgee have just transpire by they desert we be two hundred piastre in we debt they leave they khan on the afternoon after we arrival ostensibly for the purpose of take they beast out to pasture and be never hear of more we let they go thankful that they have not play the trick sooner we engage fresh horse for moudanium on the sea of marmora and dispatch françois in advance to procure a caïque for constantinople while we wait to have we passport sign but after wait a hour as there be no appearance of the precious document we start the baggage also under the charge of a _ surroudjee _ and remain alone another hour pass by and yet another and the bey be still occupy in sleep off he hunger mr harrison in desperation go to the office and after some delay receive the passport with a visè but not as we afterwards discover the necessary one it be four o'clock by the time we leave brousa we horse be stiff clumsy pack-beast but by dint of whip and the sharp shovel-stirrup we force they into a trot and make they keep it the road be well travel and by ask everybody we meet : _ bou yôl moudanium yedermus _ -lrb- be this the way to moudanium -rrb- we have no difficulty in find it the plain in many place be marshy and traverse by several stream a low range of hill stretch across and nearly close it the unite water find they outlet by a narrow valley to the north from the top of the hill we have a grand view look back over the plain with the long line of brousa 's minaret glitter through the interminable grove at the foot of the mountain olympus now show a superb outline the cloud hang about he shoulder but he snowy head be bare before we lay a broad rich valley extend in front to the mountain of moudanium the country be well cultivate with large farming establishment here and there the sun be set as we reach the summit ridge where stand a little guard-house as we ride over the crest olympus disappear and the sea of marmora lay before we spread out from the gulf of moudanium which be deep and blue among the hill to a open line against the sunset beyond that misty line lay europe which i have not see for nearly nine month and the gulf below I be the bind of my tent and saddle life but one hour more old horse have patience with my ethiopian thong and the sharp corner of my turkish stirrup : but one hour more and i promise never to molest you again we path be downward and i marvel that the poor brute do not sometimes tumble headlong with I he have be too long use to the pack however and he habit be as settle as a turk 's we pass a beautiful village in a valley on the right and come into olive grove and vineyard as the dusk be creep on it be a lovely country of orchard and garden with fountain spout by the wayside and country house perch on the steep in another hour we reach the sea-shore it be now nearly dark but we could see the tower of moudania some distance to the west still in a continual trot we ride on and as we draw near mr h fire he gun to announce we approach at the entrance of the town we find the sourrudjee wait to conduct we we clatter through the rough street for what seem a endless length of time the ramazan gun have just fire the minaret be illuminate and the coffee-house be fill with people finally françois who have be almost in despair at we non-appearance hail we with the welcome news that he have engage a caïque and that we baggage be already embark we only need the visès of the authority in order to leave he take we teskerés to get they and we go upon the balcony of a coffee-house overhang the sea and smoke a narghileh but here there be another history the teskerés have not be properly visèd at brousa and the governor at first decide to send we back take françois however for a turk and finding that we have regularly pass quarantine he sign they after a delay of a hour and a half and we leave the shore weary impatient and wolfish with twelve hour ' fast a cup of brousan beer and a piece of bread bring we into a better mood and i who begin to feel sick from the rolling of the caïque lay down on my bed which be spread at the bottom and find a kind of uneasy sleep the sail be hoist at first to get we across the mouth of the gulf but soon the greek take to they oar they be silent however and though i only sleep by fit the night wear away rapidly as the dawn be deepen we run into a little bight in the northern side of a promontory where a picturesque greek village stand at the foot of the mountain the house be of wood with balcony overgrow with grape-vine and there be a fountain of cold excellent water on the very beach some greek boatman be smoking in the portico of a café on shore and two fisherman who have be out before dawn to catch sardine be empty they net of the spoil we man kindle a fire on the sand and roasted we a dish of the fish some of the last night 's hunger remain and the meal have enough of that seasoning to be delicious after give we man a hour 's rest we set off for the prince ' island which now appear to the north over the glassy plain of the sea the gulf of iskmid or nicomedium open away to the east between two mountain headland the morning be intensely hot and sultry and but for the protection of a umbrella we should have suffer greatly there be a fiery blue vapor on the sea and a thunder-cloud hide the shore of thrace now and then come a light puff of wind whereupon the man would ship the little mast and crowd on a enormous quantity of sail so sailing and rowing we near the island with the storm but it advance slowly enough to allow a sight of the mosque of st sophium and sultan achm gleaming far and white like iceberg astray on a torrid sea another cloud be pour its rain over the asian shore and we make haste to get to the landing at prinkipo before it could reach we from the south the group of island be not remarkable for beauty only four of they -- prinkipo chalkus prote and antigone -- be inhabit the other five be merely barren rock there be a ancient convent on the summit of prinkipo where the empress irene -- the contemporary of charlemagne -- be bury the town be on the northern side of the island and consist mostly of the summer residence of greek and armenian merchant many of these be large and stately house surround with handsome garden the street be shaded with sycamore and the number of coffee-house show that the place be much frequent on festal day a company of drunken greek be singing in violation of all metre and harmony -- a discord the more remarkable since nothing could be more affectionate than they conduct towards each other nearly everybody be in frank costume and we oriental habit especially the red tartar boot attract much observation i begin to feel awkward and absurd and long to show myself a christian once more leave prinkipo we make for constantinople whose long array of marble dome and gilded spire gleam like a far mirage over the waveless sea it be too faint and distant and dazzling to be substantial it be like one of those imaginary city which we build in a cloud fuse in the light of the setting sun but as we near the point of chalcedon run along the asian shore those airy pile gather form and substance the pinnacle of the seraglio shoot up from the midst of cypress grove fantastic kiosk line the shore the minaret of st sophium and sultan achm rise more clearly against the sky and a fleet of steamer and men-of-war gay with flag mark the entrance of the golden horn we pass the little bay where st chrysostom be bury the point of chalcedon and now look up the renowned bosphorus see the maiden 's tower opposite scutarus a enormous pile the barracks of the anatolian soldiery hang over the high bank and as we row abreast of it a fresh breeze come up from the sea of marmora the prow of the caïque be turn across the stream the sail be set and we glide rapidly and noiselessly over the bosphorus and into the golden horn between the bank of the frank and moslem -- pera and stamboul where on the earth shall we find a panorama more magnificent the air be fill with the shout and noise of the great oriental metropolis the water be alive with caïques and little steamer and all the world of work and trade which have grow almost to be a fable welcome we back to its restless heart we thread we rather perilous way over the populous wave and land in a throng of custom-house officer and porter on the wharf at galata chapter xxvi the night of predestination constantinople in ramazan -- the origin of the fast -- nightly illuminations -- the night of predestination -- the golden horn at night -- illumination of the shore -- the cannon of constantinople -- a fiery panorama -- the sultan 's caïque -- close of the celebration -- a turkish mob -- the dancing dervish sky full of splendid moon and shooting star and spout exhalation diamond fire keat constantinople _ Wednesday July _ 14 1862 constantinople during the month of ramazan present a very different aspect from constantinople at other time the city it be true be much more stern and serious during the day there be none of that gay careless life of the orient which you see in smyrna cairo and damascus but when once the sunset gun have fire and the painful fast be at a end the picture change as if by magic in all the outward symbol of they religion the mussulman show they joy at be relieve from what they consider a sacred duty during the day it be quite a science to keep the appetite dormant and the people not only abstain from eating and drinking but as much as possible from the sight of food in the bazaar you see the famished merchant either sit prop back against they cushion with the shawl about they stomach tighten so as to prevent the void under it from be so sensibly feel or lie at full length in the vain attempt to sleep it be whisper here that many of the turk will both eat and smoke when there be no chance of detection but no one would dare infringe the fast in public most of the mechanic and porter be armenian and the boatman be greek i have endeavor to ascertain the origin of this fast month the syrian christian say that it be a mere imitation of a incident which happen to mahomet the prophet have lose he camel go day after day seek they in the desert take no nourishment from the time of he departure in the morning until he return at sunset after have seek they thus daily for the period of one entire moon he find they and in token of joy give a three day ' feast to the tribe now imitate in the festival of bairam which last for three day after the close of ramazan this reason however seem too trifling for such a rigid fast and the turkish tradition that the koran be send down from heaven during this month offer a more probable explanation during the fast the mussulman as be quite natural be much more fanatical than at other time they be oblige to attend prayer at the mosque every night or to have a _ mollah _ read the koran to they at they own house all the prominent feature of they religion be keep constantly before they eye and they natural aversion to the giaour or infidel be increase tenfold i have hear of several recent instance in which stranger have be expose to insult and indignity at dusk the minaret be illuminate a peal of cannon from the arsenal echo by other from the fort along the bosphorus relieve the suffer follower of the prophet and after a hour of silence during which they be all at home feast the street be fill with noisy crowd and every coffee-shop be throng every night there be illuminations along the water which add to the crown of light sparkling on the hundred minaret and dome give a magical effect to the night view of the city towards midnight there be again a season of comparative quiet most of the inhabitant have retire to rest but about two hour afterwards a watchman come along with a big drum which he beat lustily before the door of the faithful in order to arouse they in time to eat again before the daylight-gun which announce the commencement of another day 's fast last night be the holiest night of islam be the twenty-fifth of the fast it be call the _ leilet-el-kadr _ or night of the predestination the anniversary of that on which the koran be miraculously communicate to the prophet on this night the sultan accompany by he whole suite attend service at the mosque and on he return to the seraglio the sultana valide or sultana-mother present he with a virgin from one of the noble family of constantinople formerly st sophium be the theater of this celebration but this year the sultan choose the mosque of tophaneh which stand on the shore -- probably as be nearer to he imperial palace at beshiktashe on the bosphorus i consider myself fortunate in have reach constantinople in season to witness this ceremony and the illumination of the golden horn which accompany it after sunset the mosque crowning the hill of stamboul the mosque of tophaneh on this side of the water and the turkish men-of-war and steamer afloat at the mouth of the golden horn begin to blaze with more than they usual brilliance the outline of the minaret and dome be draw in light on the deepen gloom and the mast and yard of the vessel be hang with color lantern from the battery in front of the mosque and arsenal of tophaneh a blaze of intense light stream out over the water illuminate the glide form of a thousand caïques and the dark hull of the vessel lie at anchor the water be the best place from which to view the illumination and a party of we descend to the landing-place the street of tophaneh be crowd with swarm of turk greek and armenian the square around the fountain be brilliantly light and vender of sherbet and kaïmak be range along the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the mosque the crowd be so dense that we could with difficulty make we way through all the open space next the water be fill up with the clumsy _ araba _ or carriage of the turk in which sit the wife of the pasha and other dignitary we take a caïque and be soon pull out into the midst of a multitude of other caïques swarm all over the surface of the golden horn the view from this point be strange fantastic yet inconceivably gorgeous in front three or four large turkish frigate lay in the bosphorus they hull and spar outline in fire against the dark hill and distant twinkling light of asia look to the west the shore of the golden horn be equally trace by the multitude of lamp that cover they and on either side the hill on which the city be build rise from the water -- mass of dark building dot all over with shaft and dome of the most brilliant light the gateway on seraglio point be illuminate as well as the quay in front of the mosque of tophaneh all the cannon of the battery be cover with lamp the commonest object share in the splendor even a large lever use for hoist goods be hang with lantern from top to bottom the mosque be a mass of light and between the tall minaret flank it burn the inscription in arabic character long life to you o we sovereign the discharge of a cannon announce the sultan 's departure from he palace and immediately the gun on the frigate and the battery on both shore take up the salute till the grand echo fill the hollow throat of the golden horn crash from side to side strike the hill of scutarus and the point of chalcedon and finally die away among the summit of the prince ' island out on the sea of marmora the hull of the frigate be now light up with intense chemical fire and a abundance of rocket be spout from they deck a large drummond light on seraglio point and another at the battery of tophaneh pour they rival stream across the golden horn reveal the thousand of caïques jostle each other from shore to shore and the endless variety of gay costume with which they be fill the smoke of the cannon hanging in the air increase the effect of this illumination and become a screen of auroral brightness through which the superb spectacle loom with large and unreal feature it be a picture of air -- a phantasmagoric spectacle build of luminous vapor and meteoric fire and hang in the dark round of space in spite of ourselves we become eager and excited half fear that the whole pageant would dissolve the next moment and leave no trace behind meanwhile the cannon thunder from a dozen battery and the rocket burst into glittering rain over we head grander discharge i never hear the earth shake and tremble under the mighty burst of sound and the reverberation which rattle along the hill of galata break by the scatter building into innumerable fragment of sound resemble the crash of a thousand fall house the distant echo from asia and the island in the sea fill up the pause between the nearer peal and we seem to be in the midst of some great naval engagement but now the caïque of the sultan be discern approach from the bosphorus a signal be give and a sunrise of intense rosy and golden radiance suddenly light up the long arsenal and stately mosque of tophaneh play over the tall building on the hill of pera and fall with a fainter lustre on the genoese watch-tower that overlook galata it be impossible to describe the effect of this magical illumination the mosque with its taper minaret its airy gallery and its great central dome be build of compact transparent flame and in the shift of the red and yellow fire seem to flicker and waver in the air it be as lofty and gorgeous and unsubstantial as the cloudy palace in cole 's picture of youth the long white front of the arsenal be fuse in crimson heat and burn against the dark as if it be one mass of live coal and over all hang the luminous canopy of smoke redouble its lustre on the water of the golden horn and mingle with the phosphorescent gleam that play around the oar of the caïques a long barge propel by sixteen oar glide around the dark corner of tophaneh and shoot into the clear brilliant space in front of the mosque it be not light and pass with great swiftness towards the brilliant landing-place there be several person seat under a canopy in the stern and we be try to decide which be the sultan when a second boat drive by twenty-four oarsman come in sight the man rise up at each stroke and the long sharp craft fly over the surface of the water rather than force its way through it a gilded crown surmount the long curved prow and a light though superb canopy cover the stern under this we catch a glimpse of the sultan and grand vizier as they appear for a instant like black silhouette against the burst of light on shore after the sultan have enter the mosque the fire diminish and the cannon cease though the illuminated mast minaret and gateway still throw a brilliant gleam over the scene after more than a hour spend in devotion he again enter he caïque and speed away to greet he new wife amid a fresh discharge from the frigate and the battery on both shore and a new dawn of auroral splendor we make haste to reach the landing-place in order to avoid the crowd of caïques but although we be among the first we come near be precipitate into the water in the struggle to get ashore the market-place at tophaneh be so crowded that nothing but main force bring we through and some of we party have they pocket pick a number of turkish soldier and police-man be mix up in the melee and they be not spare of blow when they come in contact with a giaour in make my way through i find that a collision with one of the soldier be inevitable but i manage to plump against he with such force as to take the breath out of he body and be out of he reach before he have recover himself i see several turkish woman striking right and leave in they endeavor to escape and place they hand against the face of those who oppose they push they aside this crowd be contrived by thief for the purpose of plunder and from what i have since learn must have be very successful i visit to-day the college of the mevlevus dervish at pera and witness they peculiar ceremony they assemble in a large hall where they take they seat in a semi-circle face the shekh after go through several time with the usual moslem prayer they move in slow march around the room while a choir in the gallery chant arabic phrase in a manner very similar to the mass in catholic church i could distinguish the sentence god be great praise be to god and other similar ejaculation the chant be accompany with a drum and flute and have not last long before the dervish set themselves in a rotary motion spin slowly around the shekh who stand in the center they stretch both arm out drop they head on one side and glide around with a steady regular motion they long white gown spread out and float on the air they step be very similar to those of the modern waltz which it be possible may have be derive from the dance of the mevlevi baron von hammer find in this ceremony a imitation of the dance of the sphere in the ancient samothracian mystery but i see no reason to go so far back for its origin the dance last for about twenty minute and the dervish appear very much exhaust at the close as they be oblige to observe the fast very strictly chapter xxvii the solemnity of bairam the appearance of the new moon -- the festival of bairam

sultan achmed and a great crowd of spectator fill up the street and the square of the hippodrome coffee be serve to we after which we be all conduct into the inner court of the seraglio to await the return of the cortège this court be not more than half the size of the outer one but be shaded with large sycamore embellish with fountain and surround with light and elegant gallery in pure saracenic style the picture which it present be therefore far richer and more characteristic of the orient than the outer court where the architecture be almost wholly after italian model the portal at either end rest on slender pillar over which project broad eaves decorate with elaborate carve and gilded work and above all rise a dome surmount by the crescent on the right the tall chimney of the imperial kitchen tower above the wall the sycamore throw they broad cool shadow over the court and group of servant in gala dress loiter about the corridor after wait nearly half a hour the sound of music and the appearance of the sultan 's body-guard proclaim the return of the procession it come in reversed order head by the sultan after whom follow the grand vizier and other minister of the imperial council and the pasha each surround by he staff of officer the sultan dismount at the entrance to the seraglio and disappear through the door he be absent for more than half a hour during which time he receive the congratulation of he family he wife and the principal personage of he household all of whom come to kiss he foot meanwhile the pasha range themselves in a semicircle around the arched and gilded portico the servant of the seraglio bring out a large persian carpet which they spread on the marble pavement the throne a large square seat richly carve and cover with gilding be place in the center and a dazzling piece of cloth-of-gold throw over the back of it when the sultan re-appear he take he seat thereon place he foot on a small footstool the ceremony of kiss he foot now

from the presence the minister and pasha follow in single file and after they have make the salutation take they station on the right hand of the throne most of they be fat and they glittering frock-coat be button so tightly that they seem ready to burst it require a great effort for they to rise from they knee during all this time the band be play operatic air and as each pasha kneel a marshal or master of ceremony with a silver wand give the signal to the imperial guard who shout at the top of they voice : prosperity to we sovereign may he live a thousand year this part of the ceremony be really grand and impose all the adjunct be in keep : the portico work in rich arabesque design the swell dome and sunlit crescent above the sycamore and cypress shade the court the red tunic and peacock plume of the guard the monarch himself radiant with jewel as he sit in he chair of gold -- all these feature combine to form a stately picture of the lose orient and for the time abdul-medjid seem the true representative of caliph haroun al-raschid after the pasha have finish the inferior officer of the army navy and civil service follow to the number of at least a thousand they be not consider worthy to touch the sultan 's person but kiss he golden scarf which be hold out to they by a pasha who stand on the left of the throne the grand vizier have he place on the right and the chief of the eunuch stand behind he the kissing of the scarf occupy a hour the sultan sit quietly during all this time he face express a total indifference to all that be go on the most skilful physiognomist could not have find in it the shadow of a expression if this be the etiquette prescribe for he he certainly act it with marvellous skill and success the long line of officer at length come to a end and i fancy that the solemnity be now over but after a pause appear the _ shekh el-islàm _ or high priest of the mahometan religion he authority in religious matter transcend that of the sultan and be final and irrevocable he be a very venerable man of perhaps seventy-five year of age and he totter step be support by two mollah he be dress in a long green robe embroider with

flash of lightning could have illumine it more vividly the sacred writer or transcriber of the koran close the procession after which the sultan rise and enter the seraglio the crowd slowly disperse and in a few minute the grand report of the cannon on seraglio point announce the departure of the sultan for he palace on the bosphorus the festival of bairam be now fairly inaugurate and all stamboul be give up to festivity there be no turk so poor that he do not in some sort share in the rejoice we fourth could scarcely show more flag let off more big gun or send forth greater crowd of

and bright sign and melody and flower audrey de vere constantinople _ Tuesday August _ 8 1852 the length of my stay in constantinople have enable I to visit many interesting spot in its vicinity as well as to familiarize myself with the peculiar feature of the great capital i have see the beautiful bosphorus from steamer and caïques ride up the valley of buyukdere and through the chestnut wood of belgrade bath in the black sea under the lee of the symplegade where the marble altar to apollo still invite a oblation from pass mariner walk over the flowery meadow beside the heavenly water of asia gallop around the ivy-grown wall where dandolo and mahomet ii conquer and the last of the palæologi fall and dream away many a afternoon-hour under the funereal cypress of pera and beside the delphian tripod in the hippodrome the historic interest of these spot be familiar to all nor with one exception have they natural beauty be exaggerate by traveller this exception be the village of belgrade over which mary montague go into rapture and set the fashion for tourist ever since i must confess to have be wofully disappoint the village be a miserable cluster of rickety house on a open piece of barren land surround by the forest or rather thicket which keep alive the spring that supply constantinople with water we reach there with appetite sharpen by we morning 's ride expect to find at least a vender of _ kibab _ -lrb- bit of fried meat -rrb- in so renown a place but the only thing to be have be raw salt mackerel and bread which belong to the primitive geological formation the general feature of constantinople and the bosphorus be so well know that i be spare the dangerous task of painting scene which have be color by abler pencil von hammer lamartine willi miss pardoe albert smith and thou most inimitable thackeray have make pera and scutarus the bazaar and bath the seraglio and the golden horn as familiar to we ear as cornhill and wall street besides constantinople be not the true orient which be to be find rather in cairo in aleppo and brightest and most vital in damascus here we tread european soil the frank be fast crowd out the follower of the prophet and stamboul itself be its mosque and seraglio remove would differ little in outward appearance from a third-rate italian town the sultan live in a palace with a grecian portico the pointed saracenic arch the arabesque sculpture the latticed balcony give place to clumsy imitation of palladio and every fire that sweep away a recollection of the palmy time of ottoman rule sweep it away forever but the mosque -- that blossom of oriental architecture with its crowning dome like the inverted bell of the lotus and its reed-like minaret its fountain and marble court -- can only perish with the faith it typify i for one rejoice that so long as the religion of islam exist -lrb- and yet may its time be short -rrb- no christian model can shape its house of worship the minaret must still lift its airy tower for the muezzin the dome must rise like a gilded heaven above the prayer of the faithful with its starry lamp and emblazon phrase the fountain must continue to pour its water of purification a reformation of the moslem faith be impossible when it begin to give way the whole fabric must fall its ceremony as well as its creed rest entirely on the recognition of mahomet as the prophet of god however the turk may change in other respects in all that concern they religion they must continue the same until within a few year a visit to the mosque especially the more sacred one of st sophium and sultan achm be attend with much difficulty miss pardoe accord to she own account risk she life in order to see the interior of st sophium which she effect in the disguise of a turkish effendi i accomplish the same thing a few day since but without recourse to any such romantic expedient mr brown the interpreter of the legation procure a firman from the grand vizier on behalf of the officer of the san jacinto and kindly invite I with several other american and english traveller to join the party during the month of ramazan no firman be give and as at this time there be few traveller in constantinople we should otherwise have be subject to a heavy expense the cost of a firman include backsheesh to the priest and doorkeeper be 700 piastre -lrb- about $ 33 -rrb- we cross the golden horn in caïques and first visit the garden and palace on seraglio point the sultan at present reside in he summer palace of beshiktashe on the bosphorus and only occupy the seraus bornou as it be call during the winter month the seraglio cover the extremity of the promontory on which constantinople be build and be nearly three mile in circuit the scattered building erect by different sultan form in themselves a small city whose dome and point turret rise from amid grove of cypress and pine the sea-wall be line with kiosk from whose cushion window there be the loveliest view of the european and asian shore the newer portion of the palace where the sultan now receive the ambassador of foreign nation show the influence of european taste in its plan and decoration it be by no means remarkable for splendor and suffer by contrast with many of the private house in damascus and aleppo the building be of wood the wall ornament with detestable fresco by modern greek artist and except a small but splendid collection of arm and some wonderful specimen of arabic chirography there be nothing to interest the visitor in ascend to the ancient seraglio which be found by mahomet ii on the site of the palace of the palæologi we pass the column of theodosius a plain corinthian shaft about fifty foot high the seraglio be now occupy entirely by the servant and guard and the greater part of it show a neglect amount almost to dilapidation the saracenic corridor surround its court be support by pillar of marble granite and porphyry the spoil of the christian capital we be allow to walk about at leisure and inspect the different compartment except the library which unfortunately be lock this library be for a long time suppose to contain many lose treasure of ancient literature -- among other thing the missing book of livy -- but the recent research of logotheto the prince of samo prove that there be little of value among its manuscript before the door hang a wooden globe which be suppose to be efficacious in neutralize the influence of the evil eye there be many ancient altar and fragment of pillar scatter about the court and the turk have even commence make a collection of antiquity which with the exception of two immense sarcophagus of red porphyry contain nothing of value they show however one of the brazen head of the delphian tripod in the hippodrome which they say mahomet the conqueror strike off with a single blow of he sword on enter constantinople the most interesting portion of the seraglio be the ancient throne-room now no longer use but still guard by a company of white eunuch the throne be a immense heavy bedstead the post of which be thickly incrust with ruby turquoise emerald and sapphire there be a funnel-shaped chimney-piece in the room a master-work of benevenuto cellinus there half a century ago the foreign ambassador be present after have be bath feed and clothe with a rich mantle in the outer apartment they be usher into the imperial presence support by a turkish official on either side in order that they might show no sign of break down under the load of awe and reverence they be suppose to feel in the outer court adjoining the sublime porte be the chapel of the empress irene now convert into a armory which for its size be the most tasteful and picturesque collection of weapon i have ever see it be especially rich in saracenic armor and contain many superb casque of inlaid gold in a large glass case in the chancel one see the key of some thirty or forty city with the date of they capture it be not likely that another will ever be add to the list we now pass out through the sublime porte and direct we step to the famous _ aya sophium _ -- the temple dedicate by justinian to the divine wisdom the repair make to the outer wall by the turk and the addition of the four minaret have entirely change the character of the building without injure its effect as a christian church it must have be less impose than in its present form a priest meet we at the entrance and after read the firman with a very discontented face inform we that we could not enter until the mid-day prayer be conclude after take off we shoe however we be allow to ascend to the gallery whence we look down on the bow worshipper here the majesty of the renowned edifice despoil as it now be burst at once upon the eye the wonderful flat dome glitter with its golden mosaic and the sacred phrase from the koran : _ god be the light of the heaven and the earth _ swim in the air one hundred and eighty foot above the marble pavement on the eastern and western side it rest on two half dome which again rise from or rest upon a group of three small half-dome so that the entire roof of the mosque unsupported by a pillar seem to have be drop from above on the wall rather than to have be build up from they around the edifice run a upper and a lower gallery which alone preserve the peculiarity of the byzantine style these gallery be support by the most precious column which ancient art could afford : among they eight shaft of green marble from the temple of diana at ephesus eight of porphyry from the temple of the sun at baalbek besides egyptian granite from the shrine of isis and osiri and pentelican marble from the sanctuary of palla athena almost the whole of the interior have be cover with gilding but time have soften its brilliancy and the rich subdue gleam of the wall be in perfect harmony with the varied coloring of the ancient marble under the dome four christian seraph execute in mosaic have be allow to remain but the name of the four archangel of the moslem faith be inscribe underneath the bronze door be still the same the turk have take great pain to obliterate the cross with which they be adorn around the center of the dome as on that of sultan achm may be read in golden letter and in all the intricacy of arabic penmanship the beautiful verse : -- god be the light of the heaven and the earth he wisdom be a light on the wall in which burn a lamp cover with glass the glass shine like a star the lamp be light with the oil of a bless tree no eastern no western oil it shine for whoever will after the prayer be over and we have descend to the floor of the mosque i spend the rest of my time under the dome fascinate by its marvellous lightness and beauty the worshipper present look at we with curiosity but without ill-will and before we leave one of the priest come slyly with some fragment of the ancient gilded mosaic which he be heathen enough to sell and we to buy from st sophium we go to sultan achm which face the hippodrome and be one of the stateliest pile of constantinople it be avowedly a imitation of st sophium and the turk consider it a more wonderful work because the dome be seven foot higher it have six minaret exceed in this respect all the mosque of asia the dome rest on four immense pillar the bulk of which quite oppress the light gallery run around the wall this and the uniform white color of the interior impair the effect which its bold style and impose dimension would otherwise produce the outside view with the group of dome swell grandly above the row of broad-armed sycamore be much more satisfactory in the tomb of sultan achm in one corner of the court we see he coffin turban sword and jewel harness i have just be read old sandy ' account of he visit to constantinople in 1610 during this sultan 's reign and could only think of he as sandy represent he in the title-page to he book as a fat man with bloated cheek in a long gown and big turban and the word underneath : -- _ achm sive tyrannus _ the other note mosque of constantinople be the _ yenus djami _ or mosque of the sultana valide on the shore of the golden horn at the end of the bridge to galata that of sultan bajazet of mahomet ii the conqueror and of he son suleyman the magnificent whose superb mosque well deserve this title i regret exceedingly that we time do not allow we to view the interior for outwardly it not only surpass st sophium and all other mosque in the city but be undoubtedly one of the purest specimen of oriental architecture extant it stand on a broad terrace on one of the seven hill of stamboul and its exquisitely proportioned dome and minaret shine as if crystalize in the blue of the air it be a type of oriental as the parthenon be of grecian and the cologne cathedral of gothic art as i see it the other night light by the flame of a conflagration stand out red and clear against the darkness i feel inclined to place it on a level with either of those renowned structure it be a product of the rich fancy of the east splendidly ornate and not without a high degree of symmetry -- yet here the symmetry be that of ornament alone and not the pure absolute proportion of form which we find in grecian art it require a certain degree of enthusiasm -- nay a slight inebriation of the imaginative faculty -- in order to feel the sentiment of this oriental architecture if i rightly express all that it say to I i touch the verge of rapsody the east in almost all its aspect be so essentially poetic that a true picture of it must be poetic in spirit if not in form constantinople have be terribly ravage by fire no less than fifteen have occur during the past two week almost every night the sky have be redden by burn house and the minaret of the seven hill light with a illumination brighter than that of the bairam all the space from the hippodrome to the sea of marmora have be sweep away the lard honey and oil magazine on the golden horn with the bazaar adjoining several large block on the hill of gala with the college of the dancing dervish a part of scutarus and the college of the howling dervish all have disappear and to-day the ruin of 3700 house which be destroy last night stand smoking in the greek quarter behind the aqueduct of valen the entire amount of building consume in these two week be estimate at between _ five and six thousand _ the fire on the hill of galata threaten to destroy a great part of the suburb of pera it come sweep over the brow of the hill towards my hotel turn the tall cypress in the burial ground into shaft of angry flame and eat away the crackling dwelling of horde of hapless turk i be in bed from a sudden attack of fever but see the other guest pack up they effect and prepare to leave i be oblige to do the same and this in my weak state bring on such a perspiration that the ailment leave I the officer of the united state steamer _ san jacinto _ and the french frigate _ charlemagne _ come to the rescue with they man and fire-engine and the flame be finally quell the proceedings of the american who cut hole in the roof and play through they upon the fire within be watch by the turk with stupid amazement máshallah say a fat bimbashus as he stand swelter in the heat the frank be a wonderful people to those initiate into the mystery of turkish politics these fire be more than accidental they have a most weighty significance they indicate either a general discontent with the exist state of affair or else a powerful plot against the sultan and he ministry set fire to house be in fact the turkish method of hold a indignation meeting and from the rate with which they be increase the political crisis must be near at hand the sultan with he usual kindness of heart have send large quantity of tent and other supplies to the guiltless sufferer but no amount of kindness can soften the rancor of these turkish intrigue reschid pasha the present grand vizier and the leader of the party of progress be the person against whom this storm of opposition be now gather in spite of all effort the ottoman power be rapidly waste away the life of the orient be nerveless and effete the native strength of the race have die out and all attempt to resuscitate it by the adoption of european institution produce mere galvanic spasm which leave it more exhaust than before the rosy-colored account we have have of turkish progress be for the most part mere delusion the sultan be a well-meaning but weak man and tyrannical through he very weakness have he strength enough to break through the mesh of falsehood and venality which be weave so close about he he might accomplish some solid good but turkish rule from he minister down to the lowest _ cadi _ be a monstrous system of deceit and corruption these people have not the most remote conception of the true aim of government they only seek to enrich themselves and they parasite at the expense of the people and the national treasury when we add to this the conscript system which be drain the province of they best moslem subject to the advantage of the christian and jew and the blindness of the revenue law which impose on domestic manufacture double the duty levy on foreign product it will easily be foresee that the next half-century or less will completely drain the turkish empire of its last linger energy already in effect turkey exist only through the jealousy of the european nation the treaty of unkiar-iskelessi in 1833 throw she into the hand of russium although the influence of england have of late year reign almost exclusively in she council these be the two power who be lower at each other with sleepless eye in the dardanelle and the bosphorus the people and most probably the government be strongly preposess in favor of the english but the russian bear have a heavy paw and when he put it into the scale all other weight kick the beam it will be a long and wary struggle and no man can prophecy the result the turk be a people easy to govern be even the imperfect law now in existence fairly administer they would thrive and improve under a better state of thing but i can not avoid the conviction that the regeneration of the east will never be effect at they hand chapter xxix farewell to the orient -- malta embarcation -- farewell to the orient -- leave

be now familiar as every-day experience i set out determine to be satisfy with no slight taste of eastern life but to drain to the bottom its beaker of mingled sunshine and sleep all this have be accomplish and if i have not wander so far nor enriched myself with such varied knowledge of the relic of ancient history as i might have purpose or wish i have at least learn to know the turk and the arab be soothe by the patience inspire by they fatalism and warm by the gorgeous gleam of fancy that animate they poetry and religion these ten month of my life form a episode which seem to belong to a separate existence just refine enough to be poetic and just barbaric enough to be free from all conventional fetter it be as grateful to brain and soul as a eastern bath to the body while i look forward not without pleasure to the luxury and convenience of europe i relinquish with a sigh the refreshing indolence of asia we have pass between the castle of the two continent guard the mouth of

mosque of st sophium and sultan achm shine faintly in the moonlight as we steam down the sea of marmora the _ caire _ leave at nine o'clock freight with the news of reschid pasha 's deposition and there be no sign of conflagration in all the long mile of the city that lay behind we so we speculate no more on the exciting topic of the day but go below and take a vapor bath in we berth for i need not assure you that the night on the mediterranean at this season be anything but chilly and here i must note the fact that the french steamer while dearer than the austrian be more cramped in they accommodation and fill with a set of most uncivil servant the table be good and this be the only thing to be commend in all other respects i prefer the lloyd vessel early next morning we pass the promontory of cyzicus and the island of marmora the marble quarry of which give name to the sea as we be approach the entrance to the dardanelle we notice a austrian brig drift in the current the whiff of she flag indicate distress she rudder be entirely go and she be float helplessly towards the thracian coast a boat be immediately lower and a hawser carry to she bow by which we tow she a short distance but we steam engine do not like this drudgery and snap the rope repeatedly so that at last we be oblige to leave she to she fate the lift we give however have its effect and by dexterous maneuver with the sail the captain bring she safely into the harbor of gallipolus where she drop anchor beside we beyond gallipolus the dardanelle contract and the oppose continent rise into lofty and barren hill in point of natural beauty this strait be greatly inferior to the bosphorus it lack the stream and wooded valley which open upon the latter the country be but partially cultivate except around the town of dardanelle near the mouth of the strait the site of the bridge of xerx be easily recognize the conformation of the different shore second the decision of antiquarian here too be sesto and abydo of passionate and poetic memory but as the sun dip towards the sea we pass out of the narrow gateway on we left lay the plain of troy back by the blue range of mount ida the tamulus of patroclus crown a low bluff look on the sea on the right appear the long irregular island of imbro and the peak of misty samothrace over and beyond it tenedo be before we the red flush of sunset tinge the grand homeric landscape and linger and linger on the summit of ida as if loth to depart i pace the deck until long after it be too dark to distinguish it any more the next morning we drop anchor in the harbor of smyrna where we remain five hour i engage a donkey and ride out to the caravan bridge where the greek driver and i smoked narghileh and drink coffee in the shade of the acacia i contrast my impression with those of my first visit to smyrna last October -- my first glimpse of oriental ground then every dog bark at I and all the horde of human creature who prey upon innocent traveller run at my heel but now with my brown face and turkish aspect of grave indifference i be suffer to pass as quietly as my donkey-driver himself nor do the latter nor the ready _ cafidjus _ who fill we pipe on the bank of the mele attempt to overcharge I -- a sure sign that the orient have leave its seal on my face return through the city the same mishap befel I which traveller usually experience on they first arrival my donkey while dash at full speed through a crowd of smyrniote in they Sunday dress slip up in a little pool of black mud and come down with a crash i fly over he head and alight firmly on my foot but the spruce young greek whose snowy fustanelle be terribly bespatter come off much worse the donkey shy back level he ear and twist he head on one side await a beating but he bleeding leg save he we leave at two o'clock touch at scio in the evening and the next morning at sunrise lay-to in the harbor of syra the piræus be only twelve hour distant but after my visitation of fever in constantinople i fear to encounter the pestilential summer heat of athen besides i have reason for hasten with all speed to italy and germany at ten o'clock we weigh anchor again and steer southwards between the group of the cyclade under a cloudless sky and over a sea of the brightest blue the day be endurable under the canvas awning of we quarter-deck but the night in we berth be sweat-bath which leave we so limp and exhaust that we be almost fit to vanish like ghost at daybreak we last glimpse of the morea -- cape matapan -- fade away in the moonlight and for _ two _ day we travel westward over the burning sea on the evening of the 11th the long low outline of malta rise gradually against the last flush of sunset and in two hour thereafter we come to anchor in quarantine harbor the quarantine for traveller return from the east which formerly vary from fourteen to twenty-one day be now reduce to one day for those arrive from greece or turkey and three day for those from egypt and syrium in we case it be reduce to sixteen hour by a official courtesy i have intend proceed directly to naple but by the contemptible trickery of the agent of the french steamer -- a long history which it be unnecessary to recapitulate -- be leave here to wait ten day for another steamer it be enough to say that there be six other traveller at the same hotel some come from constantinople and some from alexandrium in the same predicament because a single ticket to naple cost some thirty or forty franc less than by divide the trip into two part the agent in those city refuse to give ticket further than malta to those who be not keen enough to see through the deception i make every effort to obtain a second ticket in time to leave by the branch steamer for italy but in vain la valetta be to my eye the most beautiful small city in the world it be a jewel of a place not a street but be full of picturesque effect and all the look-out which you catch at every turn let you eye rest either upon one of the beautiful harbor on each side or the distant horizon of the sea the street be so clean that you might eat you dinner off the pavement the white balcony and cornice of the house all cleanly cut in the soft maltese stone stand out in intense relief against the sky and from the manifold reflection and counter reflection the shadow -lrb- where there be any -rrb- become a sort of milder light the steep side of the promontory on which the city be build be turn into staircase and it be a inexhaustible pastime to watch the group compose of all nation who inhabit the shore of the mediterranean ascend and descend the auberge of the old knight the palace of the grand master the church of st john and other relic of past time but more especially the fortification invest the place with a romantic interest and i suspect that after venice and granada there be few city where the middle age have leave more impressive trace of they history the maltese be contented and appear to thrive under the english administration they be a peculiar people remind I of the arab even more than the italian while a certain rudeness in they build and motion suggest they punic ancestry they language be a curious compound of arabic and italian the former be the basis i find that i can understand more than half that be say the arabic termination be apply to italian word i believe it have never be successfully reduce to write and the restoration of pure arabic have be propose with much reason as preferable to a attempt to improve or refine it italian be the language use in the court of justice and polite society and be speak here with much more purity than either in naple or sicily the heat have be so great since i land that i have not venture outside of the city except last evening to a amateur theater get up by the non-commissioned officer and private in the garrison the performance be quite tolerable except a love-sick young damsel who speak with a rough masculine voice and make long stride across the stage when she rush into she lover 's arm i be at a loss to account for the exhausting character of the heat the thermometer show 90 ° by day and 80 ° to 85 ° by night -- a much lower temperature than i have find quite comfortable in africa and syrium in the desert 100 ° in the shade be rather brace than otherwise here 90 ° render all exercise more severe than smoke a pipe impossible even in a state of complete inertia a shirt-collar will fall starchless in five minute rather than waste eight more day in this glimmer half-existence i have take passage in a maltese _ speronara _ which sail this evening for catanium in sicily where the grand festival of st agatha which take place once in a hundred year will be celebrate next week the trip promise a new experience and i shall get a taste slight though it be of the golden trinacrium of the ancient perhaps after all this delay which so vex I -lrb- bear in mind

cunningly-stationed music die and swell in echo place when the wind respire light flag stream out like gauzy tongue of fire -- keat catanium sicily _ Friday _ _ August _ 20 1852 i go on board the _ speronara _ in the harbor of la valetta at the appoint hour -lrb- 5 pm -rrb- and find the remain sixteen passenger already embark the captain make he appearance a hour later with we bill of health and passport and as the sun go down behind the brown hill of the island we pass the wave-worn rock of the promontory divide the two harbor and slowly move off towards sicily the maltese _ speronara _ resemble the ancient roman galley more than any modern craft it have the same high curved poop and stern the same short mast and broad square sail the hull be too broad for speed but this add to the security of the vessel in a gale with a fair wind it rarely make more than eight knot a hour and in a calm the sailor -lrb- if not too lazy -rrb- propel it forward with six long oar the hull be paint in a fanciful style generally blue red green and white with bright red mast the bulwark be low and the deck of such a convexity that it be quite impossible to walk it in a heavy sea such be the vessel to which i find myself consign it be not more than fifty foot long and of less capacity than a nile _ dahabiyeh _ there be a sort of deck cabin or crib with two berth but most of the passenger sleep in the hold for a passage to catanium i be oblige to pay forty franc the owner swearing that this be the regular price but as i afterwards discover the maltese only pay thirty-six franc for the whole trip however the captain try to make up the money 's worth in civility and be incessant in he attention to you lordship as he style myself and my companion cæsar di cagnola a young milanese the maltese be tailor and clerk who be take a holiday trip to witness the great festival of st agatha with two exception they be a wild and senseless though good-natured set and in spite of sea-sickness which exercise they terribly for the first two day keep up a constant jabber in they bastard arabic from morning till night as be usual in such a company one of they be oblige to serve as a butt for the rest and maestro paolo as they term he wear such a profoundly serious face all the while from he sea-sickness that the fun never come to a end as they be go to a religious festival some of they have bring they breviary along with they but i be oblige to testify that after the first day prayer be totally forget the sailor however wear linen bag print with a figure of the madonna around they neck the sea be rather rough but cæsar and i fortify we stomach with a bottle of english ale and as it be dark by this time seek we resting-place for the night as we have pay double _ place _ be assure we in the coop on deck but bed be not include in the bargain the maltese who have bring mattress and spread a large phalansteriau bed in the hold fare much better i take one of my carpet bag for a pillow and lay down on the plank where i succeed in get a little sleep between the groan of the helpless land-lubber we have the _ ponente _ or west-wind all night but the speronara move sluggishly and in the morning it change to the _ greco-levante _ or north-east no land be in sight but towards noon the sky become clearer and we see the southern coast of sicily -- a bold mountain-shore loom phantom-like in the distance cape passaro be to the east and the rest of the day be spend in beat up to it at sunset we be near enough to see the village and olive-grove of the beautiful shore and far behind the nearer mountain ninety mile distant the solitary cone of etna the second night pass like the first except that we bruised limb be rather more sensitive to the texture of the plank we crawl out of we coop at dawn expect to behold catanium in the distance but there be cape passaro still stare we in the face the maltese be patient and we do not complain though cæsar and i begin to make nice calculation as to the probable duration of we two cold fowl and three loaf of bread the promontory of syracuse be barely visible forty mile ahead but the wind be against we and so another day pass in beat up the eastern coast at dusk we overtake another speronara which have leave malta two hour before we and this be quite a triumph to we captain all the oar be ship the sailor and some of the more courageous passenger take hold and we shoot ahead scud rapidly along the dark shore to the sound of the wild maltese song at length the promontory be gain and the restless current roll down from scyllum and charybdi toss we little bark from wave to wave with a recklessness that would have make any one nervous but a old sailor like myself to-morrow morning say the captain we shall sail into catanium but after a third night on the plank which be now a little softer we rise to find ourselves abreast of syracuse with etna as distant as ever the wind be light and what little we make by tack be sweep away by the current so that after waste the whole forenoon we keep a straight course across the mouth of the channel and at sunset see the calabrian mountain this move only lose we more ground as it happen cæsar and i mournfully and silently consume we last fragment of beef with the remain dry crust of bread and then sit down doggedly to smoke and see whether the captain would discover we situation but no while we be supply the whole vessel be at we lordship ' command and now that we be destitute he take care to make no rash offer cæsar at last with a imperial dignity become he name command dinner it come and the pork and maccaronus moisten with red sicilian wine give we patience for another day the fourth morning dawn and -- great neptune be praise -- we be actually within the gulf of catanium etna loom up in all he sublime bulk unobscured by cloud or mist while a slender jet of smoke rise from he crater be slowly curl its wreath in the clear air as if happy to receive the first beam of the sun the tower of syracuse which have mock we all the precede day be no longer visible the land-locked little port of augusta lay behind we and as the wind continue favorable ere long we see a faint white mark at the foot of the mountain this be catanium the shore of the bay be enliven with olive-grove and the gleam of the village while here and there a single palm dream of its brother across the sea etna of course have the monarch 's place in the landscape but even he large magnificent outline could not usurp all my feeling the purple peak to the westward and farther inland have a beauty of they own and in the gentle curve with which they lean towards each other there be a promise of the flowery meadow of enna the smooth blue water be speckled with fishing-boat we hail one inquire when the _ festa _ be to commence but mistake we question they answer : anchovy thereupon a waggish maltese inform they that maestro paolo thank they heartily all the other boat be hail in the name of maestro paolo who have recover from he sea-sickness take he banter good-humoredly catanium present a lovely picture as we draw near the harbor plant at the very foot of etna it have a background such as neither naple nor genoa can boast the hill next the sea be cover with garden and orchard sprinkle with little village and the country palace of the noble -- a rich culture landscape which gradually merge into the forest of oak and chestnut that girdle the waist of the great volcano but all the wealth of southern vegetation can not hide the footstep of that ruin which from time to time visit the soil half-way up the mountain-side be dot with cone of ash and cinder some cover with the scanty shrubbery which century have call forth some barren and recent while two dark wind stream of sterile lava descend to the very shore where they stand congeal in ragged needle and pyramid part of one of these black flood have sweep the town and tumble into the sea wall one side of the port we glide slowly past the mole and drop anchor a few yard from the shore there be a sort of open promenade plant with tree in front of we surround with high white house above which rise the dome of the cathedral and the spire of other church the magnificent palace of prince biscarus be on we right and at its foot the custom and revenue office every roof portico and window be line with lamp a triumphal arch span the street before the palace and the landing-place at the office be festoon with crimson and white drapery spangled with gold while we be wait permission to land a scene present itself which recall the pagan day of sicily to my mind a procession come in sight from under the tree and pass along the shore in the center be bear a stately shrine hang with garland and contain a image of st agatha the sound of flute and cymbal accompany it and a band of child bear orange and palm branch dance riotously before have the image be pan instead of st agatha the ceremony would have be quite as appropriate the speronara 's boat at last take we to the gorgeous landing place where we be carefully count by a fat sicilian official and declare free from quarantine we be then call into the passport office where the maltese undergo a search examination one of the officer sit with the black book or list of suspect person of all nation open before he and look for each name as it be call out another scan the face of the frightened tailor as if compare they with certain revolutionary visage in he mind terrible be the keen detective glance of he eye and it go straight through the poor maltese who vanish with great rapidity when they be declare free to enter the city at last they all pass the ordeal but cæsar and i remain look in at the door there be still these two frenchman say the captain i be no frenchman i protest i be a american and i say cæsar be a austrian subject thereupon we receive a polite invitation to enter the terrible glance soften into a benign respectful smile he of the black book run lightly over the c 's and t 's and say with a courteous inclination : there be nothing against the signor i feel quite relieve by this for in the mediterranean one be never safe from spy and no person be too insignificant to escape the ban if once suspect calabrium be fill to overflow with stranger from all part of the two sicily and we have some difficulty in find very bad and dear lodgings it be the first day of the _ festa _ and the street be fill with peasant the man in black velvet jacket and breeches with stocking and long white cotton cap hang on the shoulder and the woman with gay silk shawl on they head after the manner of the mexican _ reboza _ in all the public square the market scene in masaniello be act to the life the sicilian dialect be harsh and barbarous and the original italian be so disguise by the admixture of arabic spanish french and greek word that even my imperial friend who be a bear italian have great difficulty in understand the people i purchase a guide to the festa which among other thing contain a biography of st agatha it be a beautiful specimen of pious writing and i regret that i have not space to translate the whole of it agatha be a beautiful catanian virgin who secretly embrace christianity during the reign of nero catanium be then govern by a prætor name quintianus who become enamored of agatha use the most brutal means to compel she to submit to he desire but without effect at last drive to the cruelest extreme he cut off she breast and throw she into prison but at midnight st peter accompany by a angel appear to she restore the maim part and leave she more beautiful than ever quintianus then order a furnace to be heat and cast she therein a terrible earthquake shake the city the sun be eclipse the sea roll backwards and leave its bottom dry the prætor 's palace fall in ruin and he pursue by the vengeance of the populace flee till he reach the river simeto where he be drown in attempt to cross the thunder of the vengeance of god say the biography strike he down into the profoundest hell this be in the year 252 the body be carry to constantinople in 1040 although the catanian weep incessantly at they loss but in 1126 two french knight name gilisbert and goselin be move by angelic influence to restore it to its native town which they accomplish and the eye of the catanian again burn with joy the miracle effect by the saint be numberless and she power be especially efficacious in prevent earthquake and eruption of mount etna nevertheless catanium have suffer more from these cause than any other town in sicily but i would that all saint have as good a claim to canonization as st agatha the honor of such a festival as this be not out of place when pay to such youth beauty and heavenly chastity as she typify the guide which i have already consult give a full account of the festa in advance with a description of catanium the author say : if thy heart be not inspire by gaze on this lovely city it be a fatal sign -- thou wert not bear to feel the sweet impulse of the beautiful then in announce the illuminations and pyrotechnic display he exclaim : oh the amazing spectacle oh how happy art thou that thou beholdest it i what pyramid of lamp what myriad of rocket what wonderful temple of flame the mountain himself be astonish at such a display and truly except the illumination of the golden horn on the night of predestination i have see nothing equal to the spectacle present by catanium during the past three night the city which have be build up from she ruin more stately than ever be in a blaze of light -- all she dome tower and the long line of she beautiful palace reveal in the vary red and golden flame of a hundred thousand lamp and torch pyramid of fire transparency and illuminate triumphal arch fill the four principal street and the fountain in the cathedral square gleam like a jet of molten silver spin up from one of the pore of etna at ten o'clock a gorgeous display of firework close the day 's festivity but the lamp remain burn nearly all night on the second night the grand procession of the veil take place i witness this impose spectacle from the balcony of prince gessina 's palace long line of waxen torch lead the way follow by a military band and then a company of the highest prelate in they most brilliant costume surround the bishop who walk under a canopy of silk and gold bear the miraculous veil of st agatha i be bless with a distant view of it but could see no trace of the rosy hue leave upon it by the flame of the saint 's martyrdom behind the priest come the _ intendente _ of sicily gen filangierus the same who three year ago give up catanium to sack and slaughter he be follow by the senate of the city who have just have the cringe cowardice to offer he a ball on next Sunday night if ever a man deserve the vengeance of a outraged people it be this filangierus who be first a liberal when the cause promise success and then make himself the scourge of the vilest of king as he pass I last night in he carriage of state while the music peal in rich rejoice strain that solemn chant with which the monk break upon the reveller in lucrezium borgium come into my mind : la gioja del profani ' e un fumo passagier ' -- -lrb- the rejoicing of the profane be a transitory mist -rrb- i hear under the din of all these festivity the voice of that retribution which even now lie in wait and will not long be delay to-night signor scavo the american vice-consul take I to the palace of prince biscarus overlook the harbor in order to behold the grand display of firework from the end of the mole the shower of rocket and color star and the temple of blue and silver fire be repeat in the dark quiet bosom of the sea produce the most dazzling and startling effect there be a large number of the catanese nobility present and among they a marchesa giovenus the descendant of the bloody house of anjou prince biscarus be a benign courtly old man and greatly esteem here he son be at present in exile on account of the part he take in the late revolution during the sack of the city under filangierus the palace be plunder of property to the amount of ten thousand dollar the museum of greek and roman antiquity attach to it and which the house of biscarus have be collect for many year be probably the finest in sicily the state apartment be throw open this evening and when i leave a hour ago the greater portion of the guest be go through mazy quadrille on the mosaic pavement among the antiquity of catanium which i have visit be the amphitheatre capable of hold 15000 person the old greek theater the same in which alcibiade make he note harangue to the catanian the odeon and the ancient bath the theater which be in tolerable preservation be build of lava like many of the modern edifice in the city the bath prove to I what i have suppose that the oriental bath of the present day be identical with that of the ancient why so admirable a institution have never be introduce into europe -lrb- except in the _ bain chinoi _ of pari -rrb- be more than i can tell from the pavement of these bath which be nearly twenty foot below the surface of the earth the lava of later eruption have burst up in place in hard black jet the most wonderful token of that flood which whelm catanium two hundred year ago be to be see at the grand benedictine convent of san nicolum in the upper part of the city here the stream of lava divide itself just before the convent and flow past on both side leave the building and garden untouch the marble court the fountain the splendid gallery and the garden of richest southern bloom and fragrance stand like a epicurean island in the midst of the terrible stony wave whose edge bristle with the thorny aloe and cactus the monk of san nicolum be all choose from the sicilian nobility and live a comfortable life of luxury and vice each one have he own carriage horse and servant and each he private chamber outside of the convent wall and he keep concubine these fact be know and acknowledge by the catanian to whom they be a lasting scandal it be past midnight and i must close cæsar start this afternoon alone for the ascent of etna i would have accompany he but my only chance of reach messina in time for the next steamer to naple be the diligence which leave here to-morrow the mountain have be cover with cloud for the last two day and i have have no view at all comparable to that of the morning of my arrival to-morrow the grand procession of the body of st agatha take place but i be quite satisfied with three day of procession and horse race and three night of illuminations i leave in the morning with a sicilian passport my own avail I nothing after landing chapter xxxi the eruption of mount etna the mountain threaten -- the sign increase -- we leave

before sunrise by my sicilian landlord o excellenza have you hear the mountain he be go to break out again may the holy santa agatha protect we it be rather ill-timed on the part of the mountain be my involuntary first thought that he should choose for a new eruption precisely the centennial festival of the only saint who be suppose to have any power over he it show a disregard of female influence not at all suit to the present day and i scarcely believe that he seriously mean it next come along the jabber landlady : i do not like he look it be just so the last time come excellenza you can see he from the back terrace the sun be not yet rise but the east be bright with he come and there be not a cloud in the sky all the feature of etna be sharply sculpture in the clear air from the topmost cone a thick stream of white smoke be slowly puff out at short interval and roll lazily down the eastern side it have a heavy languid character and i should have think nothing of the appearance but for the alarm of my host it be like the slow fire of earth 's incense burning on that grand mountain altar i hurry off to the post office to await the arrival of the diligence from palermo the office be in the strada etnea the main street of catanium which run straight through the city from the sea to the base of the mountain whose peak close the long vista the diligence be a hour later than usual and i pass the time in watch the smoke which continue to increase in volume and be mingle from time to time with jet of inky blackness the postilion say he have see fire and hear loud noise during the night accord to he account the disturbance commence about midnight i could not but envy my friend cæsar who be probably at that moment on the summit look down into the seething fire of the crater at last we roll out of catanium there be in the diligence besides myself two man and a woman sicilian of the secondary class the road follow the shore over rugged tract of lava the different epoch of which could be distinctly trace in the character of the vegetation the last great flow -lrb- of 1679 -rrb- stand pile in long ridge of terrible sterility barely allow the aloe and cactus to take root in the hollow between the older deposit be sufficiently decompose to nourish the olive and vine but even here the orchard be stud with pyramid of the harder fragment which be laboriously collect by the husbandman in the few favored spot which have be untouched for so many age that a tolerable depth of soil have accumulate the vegetation have all the richness and brilliancy of tropical land the palm orange and pomegranate thrive luxuriantly and the vine almost break under they heavy cluster the village be frequent and well build and the hill be stud far and near with the villa of rich proprietor mostly building of one story with verandah extend they whole length look up towards etna whose base the road encircle the view be gloriously rich and beautiful on the other hand be the blue mediterranean and the irregular outline of the shore here and there send forth promontory of lava cool by the wave into the most fantastic form we have sot proceed far before a new sign call my attention to the mountain not only be there a perceptible jar or vibration in the earth but a dull groan sound like the muttering of distant thunder begin to be hear the smoke increase in volume and as we advance further to the eastward and much nearer to the great cone i perceive that it consist of two jet issue from different mouth a broad stream of very dense white smoke still flow over the lip of the topmost crater and down the eastern side as its breadth do not vary and the edge be distinctly define it be no doubt the sulphureous vapor rise from a river of molten lava perhaps a thousand yard below a much stronger column of mingled black and white smoke gush up in regular beat or pants from a depression in the mountain side between two small extinct cone all this part of etna be scar with deep chasm and in the bottom of those nearest the opening i could see the red gleam of fire the air be perfectly still and as yet there be no cloud in the sky when we stop to change horse at the town of acus reale i first feel the violence of the tremor and the awful sternness of the sound the smoke by this time seem to be gather on the side towards catanium and hang in a dark mass about half-way down the mountain group of the villager be gather in the street which look upward to etna and discuss the chance of a eruption ah say a old peasant the mountain know how to make himself respect when he talk everybody listen the sound be the most awful that ever meet my ear it be a hard painful moan now and then flutter like a suppress sob and have at the same time a expression of threatening and of agony it do not come from etna alone it have no fix location it pervade all space it be in the air in the depths of the sea in the earth under my foot -- everywhere in fact and as it continue to increase in violence i experience a sensation of positive pain the people look anxious and alarmed although they say it be a good thing for all sicily that last year they have be in constant fear from earthquake and that a eruption invariably leave the island quiet for several year it be true that during the past year part of sicily and calabrium have be visit with severe shock occasion much damage to property a merchant of this city inform I yesterday that he whole family have sleep for two month in the vault of he warehouse fear that they residence might be shake down in the night as we ride along from aci reale to taormina all the rattle of the diligence over the rough road could not drown the awful noise there be a strong smell of sulphur in the air and the thick pants of smoke from the lower crater continue to increase in strength the sun be fierce and hot and the edge of the sulphureous cloud shine with a dazzling whiteness a mount soldier overtake we and ride beside the diligence talk with the postillion he have be up to the mountain and be take he report to the governor of the district the heat of the day and the continue tremor of the air lull I into a sort of doze when i be suddenly arouse by a cry from the soldier and the stop of the diligence at the same time there be a terrific peal of sound follow by a jar which must have shake the whole island we look up to etna which be fortunately in full view before we a immense mass of snow-white smoke have burst up from the crater and be rise perpendicularly into the air its rounded volume rapidly whirling one over the other yet urge with such impetus that they only roll outwards after they have ascend to a immense height it might have be one minute or five -- for i be so entranced by this wonderful spectacle that i lose the sense of time -- but it seem instantaneous -lrb- so rapid and violent be the effect of the explosion -rrb- when there stand in the air base on the summit of the mountain a mass of smoke four or five mile high and shaped precisely like the italian pine tree word can not paint the grandeur of this mighty tree its trunk of columned smoke one side of which be silver by the sun while the other in shadow be lurid with red flame rise for more than a mile before it send out its cloudy bough then parting into a thousand stream each of which again throw out its branch tuft of smoke rolling and wave in the air it stand in intense relief against the dark blue of the sky its round mass of foliage be dazzlingly white on one side while in the shadowy depths of the branch there be a constant play of brown yellow and crimson tint reveal the central shaft of fire it be like the tree celebrate in the scandinavian saga as see by the mother of harold hardrada -- that tree whose root pierce through the earth whose trunk be of the color of blood and whose branch fill the uttermost corner of the heaven this outburst seem to have relieve the mountain for the tremor be now less violent though the terrible noise still drone in the air and earth and sea and now from the base of the tree three white stream slowly creep into as many separate chasm against the wall of which play the flickering glow of the burning lava the column of smoke and flame be still hurl upward and the tree after stand about ten minute -- a new and awful revelation of the active force of nature -- gradually rise and spread lose its form and slowly move by a light wind -lrb- the first that disturb the dead calm of the day -rrb- bent over to the eastward we resume we course the vast belt of smoke at last arched over the strait here about twenty mile wide and sink towards the distant calabrian shore as we drive under it for some mile of we way the sun be totally obscure and the sky present the singular spectacle of two hemisphere of clear blue with a broad belt of darkness draw between they there be a hot sulphureous vapor in the air and shower of white ash fall from time to time we be distant about twelve mile in a straight line from the crater but the air be so clear even under the shadow of the smoke that i could distinctly trace the downward movement of the river of lava this be the eruption at last to which all the phenomenon of the morning have be only preparatory for the first time in ten year the depths of etna have be stir and i thank god for my detention at malta and the singular hazard of travel which have bring I here to he very base to witness a scene the impression of which i shall never lose to my die day although the eruption may continue and the mountain pour forth fiercer fire and broader tide of lava i can not but think that the first upheaval which let out the long-imprisoned force will not be equal in grandeur by any later spectacle after pass taormina we road lead we under the hill of the coast and although i occasionally catch glimpse of etna and see the reflection of fire from the lava which be fill up he savage ravine the smoke at last encircle he waist and he be then shut out of sight by the intervene mountain we lose a bolt in a deep valley opening on the sea and during we stoppage i could still hear the groan of the mountain though farther off and less painful to the ear as evening come on the beautiful hill of calabrium with white town and village on they side gleam in the purple light of the setting sun we drive around headland after headland till the strait open and we look over the harbor of messina to capo faro and the distant island of the tyrrhene sea \* \* \* \* \* i leave this afternoon for naple and leghorn i have lose already so much time between constantinople and this place that i can not give up ten day more to etna besides i be so thoroughly satisfy with what i have see that i fear no second view of the eruption could equal it etna can not be see from here nor from a nearer point than a mountain six or eight mile distant i try last evening to get a horse and ride out to it in order to see the appearance of the eruption by night but every horse mule and donkey in the place be engage except a miserable lame mule for which five dollar be demand however the night happen to be cloudy so that i could have see nothing my passport be finally _ en règle _ it have cost the labor of myself and a able-bodied valet-de-place since yesterday morning and the expenditure of five dollar and a half to accomplish this great work i have just be righteously abuse the neapolitan government to a native merchant whom from he name i take to be a frenchman but as i be off in a

that there be the least actual danger but mr -- would not be persuade that we be not on the brink of destruction and write to friend at home a voluminous account of she feeling there be a irishman on board bind to italy with he sister it be he first tour and when ask why he do not go direct through france he reply with brotherly concern that he be anxious he sister should see the bay of biscay this youth 's perception be of such a emerald hue that a lot of wicked englishman have they own fun out of he the other day he be try to shave to the great danger of slice off he nose as the vessel be roll fearfully why do not you have the ship head to the wind say one of the englishman who hear he complaint she will then lie steady and you can shave beautifully thereupon the irishman send one of the steward upon deck with a polite message to the captain beg he to put the vessel about for five minute towards noon of the fifth day we see the dark rugged mountain that guard the north-western corner of the spanish peninsula we pass the bay of corunna and round the bold headland of finisterre leave the biscayan billow behind we but the sea be still rough and the sky cloud although the next morning the mildness of the air show the change in we latitude about noon that day we make the burling a cluster of rock forty mile north of lisbon and just before sunset a transient lifting of the cloud reveal the rock of cintra at the mouth of the tagus the tall perpendicular cliff and the mountain slope behind cover with garden orchard and scatter villa and hamlet make a grand though dim picture which be soon hide from we view on the 4th we be nearly all day cross the mouth of the bay of cadiz and only at sunset saw cape trafalgar afar off glimmer through the reddish haze i remain on deck as there be patch of starlight in the sky after pass the light-house at tarifa the spanish shore continue to be visible in another hour there be a dim cloudy outline high above the horizon on we right this be the lesser atla in morocco and now right ahead distinctly visible though fifteen mile distant lay a colossal lion with he head on he outstretched paw look towards africa if i have be bring to the spot blindfold i should have know what it be the resemblance be certainly very striking and the light-house on europa point seem to be a lamp hold in he paw the light of the city and fortification rise one by one glitter along the base and at midnight we drop anchor before they on the western side i land yesterday morning the mist which have follow I from england have collect behind the rock and the sun still hide by its huge bulk shone upward through they make a luminous background against which the lofty wall and jagged rampart of this tremendous natural fortification be clearly define i announce my name and the length of time i design remain at a little office on the quay and be then allow to pass into the city a number of familiar white turban meet I on enter and i could not resist the temptation of cordially salute the owner in they own language the town be long and narrow lie steeply against the rock the house be white yellow and pink as in spanish town but the street be clean and well pave there be a square about the size of a ordinary building-lot where a sort of market of dry goods and small article be hold the club-house hotel occupy one side of it and as i look out of my window upon it i see the topmost cliff of the rock above I threaten to topple down from a height of 1500 foot my first walk in gibraltar be in search of a palm-tree after thread the whole length of the town i find two small one in a garden in the bottom of the old moat the sun be shine and he ray seem to fall with double warmth on they feathery crest three brown spaniard bare-armed be draw water with a pole and bucket and fill the little channel which convey it to the distant vegetable the sea glitter blue below a indian fig-tree shaded I but on the rock behind a aloe lift its blossoming stem some twenty foot high into the sunshine to describe what a weight be lift from my heart would seem foolish to those who do not know on what little thing the whole tone of we spirit sometimes depend but if a even balance be restore yesterday the opposite scale kick the beam this morning not a speck of vapor blur the spotless crystal of the sky as i walk along the hang path of the alameda the sea be dazzling ultra-marine with a purple lustre every crag and notch of the mountain across the bay every shade of brown or gray or the green of grassy patch be draw and tint with a pencil so exquisitely delicate as almost to destroy the perspective the white house of algecira five mile off appear close at hand : a little toy-town back by miniature hill ape ' hill the ancient abylum in africa advance to meet calpe its opposing pillar and atla sweep away to the east ward its blue become paler and paler till the power of vision finally fail from the top of the southern point of the rock i see the mountain-shore of spain as far as malaga and the snowy top of one of the sierra nevada look eastward to the horizon line of the mediterranean my sight extend so far in the wonderful clearness of the air that the convexity of the earth 's surface be plainly to be see the sea instead of be a plane be slightly convex and the sky instead of rest upon it at the horizon curve down beyond it as the upper side of a horn curve over the lower when one look into the mouth there be none of the many aspect of nature more grand than this which be so rarely see that i believe the only person who have ever describe it be humboldt who see it look from the silla de caraccas over the caribbean sea it give you the impression of standing on the edge of the earth and look off into space from the mast-head the ocean appear either flat or slightly concave and æronauts declare that this apparent concavity become more marked the higher they ascend it be only at those rare period when the air be so miraculously clear as to produce the effect of _ no air _ -- render impossible the slightest optical illusion -- that we eye can see thing as they really be so pure be the atmosphere to-day that at meridian the moon although a thin sickle three day distant from the sun shine perfectly white and clear as i loitered in the alameda between thick hedge of ever-blooming geranium clump of heliotrope three foot high and luxuriant mass of ivy around whose warm flower the bee cluster and hum i could only think of the voyage as a hideous dream the fog and gloom have be in my own eye and in my own brain and now the bless sun shine full in my face awake I i be a worshipper of the sun i take off my hat to he as i stand there in a wilderness of white crimson and purple flower and let he blaze away in my face for a quarter of a hour and as i walk home with my back to he i often turn my face from side to side that i might feel he touch on my cheek how a man can live who be sentence to a year 's imprisonment be more than i can understand but all this -lrb- you will say -rrb- give you no picture of gibraltar the rock be so familiar to all the world in print and description that i find nothing new to say of it except that it be by no means so barren a rock as the island of malta be clothe in many place with beautiful grove and the greenest turf besides i have not yet see the rock-gallery have take passage for cadiz this afternoon when i return -- as i hope to do in twenty day after visit seville and granada -- i shall procure permission

dream until i see its tower in every cloud that hide the setting sun george h boker seville _ November _ 10 1852 i leave gibraltar on the evening of the 6th in the steamer iberium the passage to cadiz be make in nine hour and we come to anchor in the harbor before day-break it be a cheerful picture that the rise sun present to we the long white front of the city face the east glow with a bright rosy lustre on a ground of the clearest blue the tongue of land on which cadiz stand be low but the house be lift by the heavy sea-wall which encompass they the main-land consist of a range of low but graceful hill while in the south-east the mountain of ronda rise at some distance i go immediately on shore where my carpet-bag be seize upon by a boy with the rich brown complexion of one murillo 's beggar who trudge off with it to the gate after some little detention there i be conduct to a long desert barn-like building where i wait half a hour before the proper officer come when the latter have take he private toll of my contraband cigar the brown imp conduct I to blanco 's english hotel a neat and comfortable house on the alameda cadiz be soon see notwithstanding its venerable age of three thousand year -- have be found by hercule who figure on its coat-of-arm -- it be purely a commercial city and have neither antiquity nor historic association that interest any but englishman it be compactly build and cover a smaller space than accord with my idea of its former splendor i first walk around the sea-rampart enjoy the glorious look-off over the blue water the city be almost insulate the triple line of fortification on the land side be of but trifling length a rocky ledge stretch out into the sea from the northern point and at its extremity rise the massive light-house tower 170 foot high the wall toward the sea be cover with company of idle angler fishing with cane rod of enormous length on the open waste space between the bastion boy have spread they lime cord to catch singing bird with chirp decoy place here and there in wicker cage number of boatman and peasant in they brown jacket stud with tag and bugle and those round black cap which resemble smash bandbox loiter about the wall or lounge on the grass in the sun except along the alameda which front the bay the exterior of the city have a aspect of neglect and desertion the interior however atone for this in the gay and lively air of its street which though narrow be regular and charmingly clean the small plaza be neatness itself and one be too content with this to ask for striking architectural effect the house be tall and stately of the most dazzling whiteness and though you could point out no one as a pattern of style the general effect be chaste and harmonious in fact there be two or three street which you would almost pronounce faultless the number of hang balcony and of court-yard pave with marble and surround with elegant corridor show the influence of moorish taste there be not a mean-looking house to be see and i have no doubt that cadiz be the best build city of its size in the world it lie white as new-fallen snow like a cluster of ivory palace between sea and sky blue and silver be its color and as everybody know there can be no more charming contrast i visit both the old and new cathedral neither of which be particularly interesting the latter be unfinished and might have be a fine edifice have the labor and money expend on its construction be direct by taste the interior rich as it be in marble and sculpture have a heavy confused effect the pillar divide the nave from the side-aisle be enormous composite mass each one consist of six corinthian column stick around and against a central shaft more satisfactory to I be the opera-house which i visit in the evening and where the dazzling array of dark-eyed gaditana put a stop to architectural criticism the woman of cadiz be note for they beauty and they graceful gait some of they be very beautiful it be true but beauty be not the rule among they they gait however be the most graceful possible because it be perfectly free and natural the commonest serving-maid who walk the street of cadiz would put to shame a whole score of we mincing and wriggle belle honest old blanco prepare I a cup of chocolate by sunrise next morning and accompany I down to the quay to embark for seville a furious wind be blow from the south-east and the large green wave race and chase one another incessantly over the surface of the bay i take a heavy craft which the boatman push along under cover of the pier until they reach the end when the sail be drop in the face of the wind and away we shoot into the watery tumult the boat rock and bounce over the agitate surface run with one gunwale on the wave and sheet of briny spray break over I i feel considerably relieve when i reach the deck of the steamer but it be then diversion enough to watch those who follow the crowd of boat pitch tumultuously around the steamer jostle against each other they hull gleam with wet as they rise on the beryl-colored wave strip with long curded line of wind-blown foam would have make a fine subject for the pencil of achenbach at last we push off with a crowd of passenger fore and aft and a pyramid of luggage pile around the smoke-pipe there be a party of four englishman on board and on make they acquaintance i find one of they to be a friend to some of my friend -- sir john potter the progressive ex-mayor of manchester the wind be astern we run rapidly along the coast and in two hour enter the mouth of the guadalquivir -lrb- this name come from the arabic _ wadi el-kebeer _ -- literally the great valley -rrb- the shore be a dead flat the right bank be a dreary forest of stunt pine abound with deer and other game on the left be the dilapidated town of san lucar whence magellan set sail on he first voyage around the world a mile further be bonanza the port of xere where we touch and take on board a fresh lot of passenger thenceforth for four hour the scenery of the guadalquivir have a most distressing sameness the bank be as flat as a board with here and there a straggle growth of marshy thicket now and then we pass a herdsman 's hut but there be no human being to be see except the peasant who tend the large flock of sheep and cattle a sort of breakfast be serve in the cabin but so great be the number of guest that i have much difficulty in get anything to eat the waiter be model of calmness and deliberation as we approach seville some low hill appear on the leave near the river dazzling white village be plant at they foot and all the slope be cover with olive orchard while the bank of the stream be border with silvery birch tree this give the landscape in spite of the african warmth and brightness of the day a gray and almost wintry aspect soon the graceful giralda or famous tower of seville arise in the distance but from the winding of the river we be half a hour in reach the landing-place one see nothing of the far-famed beauty of seville on approach it the boat stop below the alameda where the passenger be receive by custom-house officer who in my case do not verify the story tell of they in cadiz i give my carpet-bag to a boy who conduct I along the hot and dusty bank to the bridge over the guadalquivir where he turn into the city on pass the gate two loafer-like guard stop my baggage notwithstanding it have already be examine what say i do you examine twice on enter seville yes answer one twice and even three time but add in a lower tone it depend entirely on yourself with that he slip behind I and let one hand fall beside my pocket the transfer of a small coin be dexterously make and i pass on without further stoppage to the fonda de madrid sir john potter engage antonio baillus the note guide of seville who profess to have be the cicerone of all distinguish traveller from lord byron and washington irve down to owen jone and i readily accept he invitation to join the party baillus be recommend by ford as fat and good-humored fat he certainly be and very good-humored when speaking of himself but he have be rather spoil by popularity and be much too profuse in he critical remark on art and architecture nevertheless as my stay in seville be limited i have derive no slight advantage from he service on the first morning i take a early stroll through the street the house be glaringly white like those of cadiz but be smaller and have not the same stately exterior the window be protect by iron grating of florid pattern and as many of these be paint green the general effect be please almost every door open upon a _ patio _ or courtyard pave with black and white marble and adorn with flower and fountain many of these remain from the time of the moor and be still surround by the delicate arch and brilliant tile-work of that period the populace in the street be entirely spanish -- the jaunty _ majo _ in he queer black cap sash and embroidered jacket and the nut-brown dark-eyed damsel swimming along in she mantilla and arm with the irresistible fan we go first to the cathedral build on the site of the great mosque of abou youssuf yakoub the tall giralda beckon to we over the top of the intervene building and finally a turn in the street bring we to the ancient moorish gateway on the northern side this be a admirable specimen of the horse-shoe arch and be cover with elaborate tracery it originally open into the court or _ hàram _ of the mosque which still remain and be shaded by a grove of orange tree the giralda to my eye be a more perfect tower than the campanile of florence or that of san marco at venice which be evidently a idea borrow from it the moorish structure with a base of fifty foot square rise to the height of two hundred and fifty foot it be of a light pink color and the side which be break here and there by exquisitely proportioned double saracenic arch be cover from top to bottom with arabesque tracery cut in strong relief upon this tower a spanish architect have place a taper spire one hundred foot high which fortunately harmonize with the general design and give the crowning grace to the work the cathedral of seville may rank as one of the grandest gothic pile in europe the nave lack but five foot of be as high as that of st peter 's while the length and breadth of the edifice be on a commensurate scale the ninety-three window of stain glass fill the interior with a soft and richly-tinted light mellower and more gentle than the sombre twilight of the gothic cathedral of europe the wealth lavish on the smaller chapel and shrine be prodigious and the high altar inclose within a gilded railing fifty foot high be probably the most enormous mass of wood-carving in existence the cathedral in fact be encumber with its riches while they bewilder you as monument of human labor and patience they detract from the grand simplicity of the build the great nave on each side of the transept be quite block up so that the choir and magnificent royal chapel behind it have almost the effect of detach edifice we return again this morning remain two hour and succeed in make a thorough survey include a number of trashy picture and barbarously rich shrine murillo 's guardian angel and the vision of st antonio be the only gem the treasury contain a number of sacred vessel of silver gold and jewel -- among other thing the key of moorish seville a cross make of the first gold bring from the new-world by columbus and another from that rob in mexico by cortez the cathedral win my admiration more and more the placing of the numerous window and they rich color produce the most glorious effect of light in the lofty aisle and one be constantly find new vista new combination of pillar arch and shrine the building be in itself a treasury of the grandest gothic picture from the cathedral we go to the alcazar _ -lrb- el-kasr -rrb- _ or palace of the moorish king we enter by a long passage with round arch on either side rest on twin pillar place at right angle to the line of the arch as one see both in saracenic and byzantine structure finally old baillus bring we into a dull desert court-yard where we be surprise by the sight of a entire moorish façade with its pointed arch its project roof its rich sculptured ornament and its illuminations of red blue green and gold it have be lately restore and now rival in freshness and brilliancy any of the rich house of damascus a doorway entirely too low and mean for the splendor of the wall above it admit we into the first court on each side of the passage be the room of the guard and the moorish noble within all be pure saracenic and absolutely perfect in its grace and richness it be the realization of a oriental dream it be the poetry and luxury of the east in tangible form where so much depend on the proportion and harmony of the different part -- on those correspondence the union of which create that nameless soul of the work which can not be express in word -- it be useless to describe detail from first to last -- the chamber of state the fringed arch the open tracery light and frail as the frost-stars crystallize on a window-pane the court fit to be vestibule to paradise the audience-hall with its wondrous sculpture its column and pavement of marble and its gilded dome the garden gorgeous with its palm banana and orange-tree -- all be in perfect keep all jewel of equal lustre form a diadem which still lend a royal dignity to the phantom of moorish power we then pass into the garden lay out by the spanish monarch -- trim mathematical design in box and myrtle with conceal fountain spring up everywhere unawares in the midst of the paven walk yet still make beautiful by the rose and jessamine that hang in rank cluster over the marble balustrade and by the clump of tall orange tree bend to earth under the weight of they fruitage we afterward visit pilate 's house as it be call -- a fine spanish-moresco palace now belong to the duke of medina coeli it be very rich and elegant but stand in the same relation to the alcazar as a good copy do to the original picture the grand staircase nevertheless be a marvel of tile work unlike anything else in seville and exhibit a genius in the invention of elaborate ornamental pattern which be truly wonderful a number of workman be busy in restore the palace to fit it for the residence of the young duke the moorish sculpture be reproduce in plaster which at least have a better effect than the fatal whitewash under which the original tint of the alcazar be hide in the court stand a number of roman bust -- spanish antiquity and therefore not of great merit -- singularly out of place in niche surround by arabic device and sentence from the koran this morning i climb the giralda the sun have just rise and the clay be fresh and crystal-clear a little door in the cathedral near the foot of the tower stand open and i enter a rather slovenly sevillaña have just complete she toilet but two child be still in undress however she open a door in the tower and i go up without hindrance the ascent be by easy ramp and i walk four hundred yard or nearly a quarter of a mile before reach the top of the moorish part the panoramic view be superb to the east and west the great valley make a level line on a far-distant horizon there be range of hill in the north and south and those rise near the city clothe in a gray mantle of olive-tree be picturesquely crown with village the guadalquivir wind in the most sinuous maze have no longer a turbid hue he reflect the blue morning sky and gleam brightly between he border of birch and willow seville sparkle white and fair under my foot she paint tower and tile dome rise thickly out of the mass of building the level sun throw shadow into the numberless court permit the mixture of spanish and moorish architecture to be plainly discern even at that height a thin golden vapor soften the feature of the landscape towards the sun while on the opposite side every object stand out in the sharpest and clearest outline on we way to the muséo baillus take we to the house of a friend of he in order that we might taste real manzanillum wine this be a pale straw-colored vintage produce in the valley of the guadalquivir it be flavor with camomile blossom and be say to be a fine tonic for weak stomach the master then produce a dark-red wine which he declare to be thirty year old it be almost a syrup in consistence and taste more of sarsaparilla than grape none of we relish it except baillus who be so inspire by the draught that he sing we two moorish song and a andalusian catch full of fun and drollery the muséo contain a great amount of bad picture but it also contain twenty-three of murillo 's work many of they of he best period to those who have only see he tender spiritual conception and assumption he vision of st franci in this gallery reveal a mastery of the higher walk of he art which they would not have anticipate but it be in he cherub and he infant christ that he excel no one ever paint infantile grace and beauty with so true a pencil there be but one velasquez in the collection and the only thing that interest I in two hall fill with rubbish be a conception by murillo 's mulatto pupil say by some to have be he slave although a imitation of the great master it be a picture of much sweetness and beauty there be no other work of the artist in existence and this as the only production of the kind by a painter of mixed african blood ought to belong to the republic of liberium among the other guest at the fonda de madrid be mr thomas hobhouse brother of byron 's friend we have a pleasant party in the court this evening listen to blind pépé who sing to he guitar a medley of merry andalusian refrain singing make the old man courageous and at the close he give we the radical song of spain which be now strictly prohibit the air be charming but too gay one would sooner dance than fight to its measure it do not bring the hand to the sword like the glorious marseillaise _ adio _ beautiful seville chapter xxxiv journey in a spanish diligence spanish diligence line -- leave seville -- a unlucky start -- alcalà of the baker -- dinner at carmona -- a dehesa -- the mayoral and he team -- ecija -- night journey -- cordova -- the cathedral-mosque -- moorish architecture -- the sierra morena -- a rainy journey -- a chapter of accident -- baylen -- the fascination of spain -- jaen -- the vega of granada granada _ November _ 14 1852 it be a enviable sensation to feel for the first time that you be in granada no amount of travel can weaken the romantic interest which cling about this storied place or take away aught from the freshness of that emotion with which you first behold it i sit almost at the foot of the alhambra whose wall i can see from my window quite satisfied for to-day with be here it have be rain since i arrive the thunder be crash overhead and the mountain be cover with cloud so i be keep in-door with the luxury of know that all the wonder of the place be within my reach and now let I beguile the dull weather by give you a sketch of my journey from seville hither there be three line of stage from seville to madrid and they competition have reduce the fare to $ 12 which for a ride of 350 mile be remarkably cheap the trip be usually make in three day and a half a branch line from baylen -- nearly half-way -- strike southward to granada and as there be no competition on this part of the road i be charge $ 15 for a through seat in the _ coupé _ on account of the lateness of the season and the limited time at my command this be preferable to take horse and ride across the country from seville to cordova accordingly at a early hour on Thursday morning last furnished with a travel ticket inscribe : don valtar de talor -lrb- myself -rrb- i take leave of my english friend at the fonda de madrid get into a immense lumbering yellow vehicle draw by ten mule and start trust to my good luck and bad spanish to get safely through the commencement however be unpropitious and very often a stumble at start make the whole journey limp the near mule in the foremost span be a horse ridden by we postillion and nothing could prevent that horse from dart into all sort of street and alley where we have no desire to go as all mule have implicit faith in horse of course the rest of the animal follow we be half a hour in get out of seville and when at last we reach the open road and dash off at full gallop one of the mule in the trace fall and be drag in the dust some twenty or thirty yard before we could stop my companion in the coupé be a young spanish officer and he pretty andalusian bride who be make she first journey from home and after these mishap be in a state of constant fear and anxiety the first stage across the valley of the guadalquivir take we to the town of alcalà which lie in the lap of the hill above the beautiful little river guadaira it be a picturesque spot the naked cliff overhang the stream have the rich red hue of cinnabar and the tree and shrubbery in the meadow and on the hill-side be ready group to the artist 's hand the town be call alcalà de los panadore -lrb- of the baker -rrb- from its hundred of flour mill and bake-oven which supply seville with those white fine delicious twist of which spain may be justly proud they should have be send to the exhibition last year with the toledo blade and the wooden mosaic we leave the place and its mealy-headed population and turn eastward into wide rolling tract scatter here and there with gnarled olive tree the soil be loose and sandy and hedge of aloe line the road the country be thinly populated and very little of it under cultivation about noon we reach carmona which be found by the roman as indeed be nearly all the town of southern spain it occupy the crest and northern slope of a high hill whereon the ancient moorish castle still stand the alcazar or palace and the moorish wall also remain though in a very ruinous condition here we stop to dinner for the nueva peninsular in which i be embark have its hotel all along the route like that of zurutuza in mexico we be conduct into a small room adjoining the stable and adorn with color print illustrate the history of don john of austrium the table-cloths plate and other appendage be of very ordinary quality but indisputably clean we seat ourselves and presently the dinner appear first a vermicelli _ pilaff _ which i find palatable then the national _ ollum _ a dish of enormous yellow pea sprinkle with bit of bacon and flavor with oil then three successive course of chicken boil stew and roasted but in every case do to rag and without a particle of the original flavor this be the usual style of we meal on the road whether breakfast dinner or supper except that kid be sometimes substitute for fowl and that the oil employ be more or less rancid give different flavor to the dish a course of melon grape or pomegranate wind up the repast the price of which vary from ten to twelve real -- a real be about a half-dime in seville at the fonda de madrid the cooking be really excellent but further in the interior judge from what i have hear it be even worse than i have describe continue we journey we pass around the southern brow of the hill under the moorish battlements here a superb view open to the south and east over the wide vega of carmona as far as the mountain chain which separate it from the plain of granada the city have for a coat of arm a silver star in a azure field with the pompous motto : as lucifer shine in the morning so shine carmona in andalusium if it shine at all it be because it be a city set upon a hill for that be the only splendor i could find about the place the vega of carmona be partially cultivate and now wear a sombre brown hue from its tract of ploughed land cultivation soon cease however and we enter on a _ dehesa _ a boundless plain of waste land cover with thicket of palmetto flock of goat and sheep guard by shepherd in brown cloak wander here and there and except they hut and a isolate house with its group of palm-tree there be no sign of habitation the road be a deep red sand and we mule toil along slowly and painfully urge by the incessant cry of the _ mayoral _ or conductor and he _ mozo _ as the mayoral 's whip could only reach the second span the business of the latter be to jump down every ten minute run ahead and belabor the flank of the foremost mule utter at the same time a series of sharp howl which seem to strike the poor beast with quite as much severity as he whip i defy even a spanish ear to distinguish the import of these cry and the great wonder be how they could all come out of one small throat when it come to a hard pull they crack and explode like volley of musketry and fly like hail-stone about the ear of the _ machos _ -lrb- he-mule -rrb- the postillion have only the care of the foremost span be a silent man but he have contract a habit of sleep in the saddle which i mention for the benefit of timid traveller as it add to the interest of a journey by night the cloud which have be gather all day now settle down upon the plain and night come on with a dull rain at eight o'clock we reach the city of ecija where we have two hour ' halt and supper it be so dark and rainy that i see nothing not even the classic xenil the river of granada which flow through the city on its way to the guadalquivir the night wear slowly away and while the _ mozo _ drowse on he post i catch snatch of sleep between he cry as the landscape begin to grow distinct in the gray cloudy dawn we see before we cordova with the dark range of the sierra morena rise behind it this city once the glory of moorish spain the capital of the great abd-er-rahman contain when in its prime a million of inhabitant be now a melancholy wreck it have not a shadow of the art science and taste which then distinguish it and the only interest it now possess be from these association and the despoil remnant of its renowned mosque we cross the guadalquivir on a fine bridge build on roman foundation and drive slowly down the one long rough crooked street the diligence stop for a hour to allow passenger to breakfast but my first thought be for the cathedral-mosque _ la mezquita _ as it be still call it be close say the ragged crowd that congregate about we you can not get in until eight o'clock but i remember that a silver key will open anything in spain and take a mozo as a guide we hurry off as fast as the rough pavement would permit we have to retrace the whole length of the city but on reach the cathedral find it open the exterior be low and quite plain though of great extent a moorish gateway admit I into the original court-yard or _ hàram _ of the mosque which be plant with orange tree and contain the fountain for the ablutions of moslem worshipper in the center the area of the mosque proper exclusive of the court-yard be about 400 by 350 foot it be build on the plan of the great mosque of damascus about the end of the eighth century the material -- include twelve hundred column of marble jasper and porphyry from the ruin of carthage and the temple of asia minor -- belong to a christian basilica of the gothic domination which be build upon the foundation of a roman temple of janus so that the three great creed of the world have here at different time have they seat the moor consider this mosque as second in holiness to the kaaba of mecca and make pilgrimage to it from all part of moslem spain and barbary even now although shear of much of its glory it surpass any oriental mosque into which i have penetrate except st sophium which be a christian edifice all the nineteen original entrance -- beautiful horse-shoe arch -- be close except the central one i enter by a low door in one corner of the corridor a wilderness of column connect by double arch -lrb- one spring above the other with a opening between -rrb- spread they dusky aisle before I in the morning twilight the eight hundred and fifty shaft of this marble forest form labyrinth and maze which at that early hour appear boundless for they long vista disappear in the shadow lamp be burn before distant shrine and a few worshipper be kneel silently here and there the sound of my own footstep as i wandered through the rank of pillar be all that i hear in the center of the wood -lrb- for such it seem -rrb- rise the choir a gaudy and tasteless excrescence add by the christian even charle v who lay a merciless hand on the alhambra reprove the bishop of cordova for this barbarous and unnecessary disfigurement the sacristan light lamp in order to show I the moorish chapel nothing but the precious material of which these exquisite structure be compose could have save they from the holy hand of the inquisition which intentionally destroy all the roman antiquity of cordova here the fringed arch the lace-like filigree the wreathed inscription and the dome of pendent stalactite which enchant you in the alcazar of seville be repeat not in stucco but in purest marble while the entrance to the holy of holy be probably the most glorious piece of mosaic in the world the pavement of the interior be deeply worn by the knee of the moslem pilgrim who compass it seven time kneel as they now do in the kaaba at mecca the side be embroider with sentence from the koran in cufic character and the roof be in the form of a fluted shell of a single piece of pure white marble fifteen foot in diameter the roof of the vestibule be a wonderful piece of workmanship form of pointed arch wreathe and twine through each other like basket-work no people ever work poetry into stone so perfectly as the saracen in look on these precious relic of a elegant and refined race i can not help feel a strong regret that they kingdom ever pass into other hand leave cordova we road follow the guadalquivir along the foot of the sierra morena which rise dark and stern a barrier to the central table-land of la mancha at alcolea we cross the river on a noble bridge of black marble out of all keep with the miserable road it rain incessantly and the scenery through which we pass have a wild and gloomy character the only tree to be see be the olive which cover the hill far and near the profusion of its fruit show the natural richness of the soil this part of the road be sometimes infested with robber and once when i see two individual wait for we in a lonely defile with gun-barrel thrust out from under they black cloak i anticipate a recurrence of a former unpleasant experience but they prove to be member of the _ guardium civil _ and therefore we protector the rut and quagmire make by the rain retard we progress and it be dark when we reach andujar fourteen league from cordova to baylen where i be to quit the diligence and take another come down from madrid to granada be four league further we journey on in the dark in a pour rain up and down hill for some hour when all at once the cry of the mozo cease and the diligence come to a dead stop there be some talk between we conductor and then the mayoral open the door and invite we to get out the postillion have fall asleep and the mule have take we into a wrong road a attempt be make to turn the diligence but fail leave it stand plump against a high bank of mud we stand meanwhile shiver in the cold and wet and the fair andalusian shed abundance of tear fortunately baylen be close at hand and after some delay two man come with lantern and escort we to the _ posada _ or inn where we arrive at midnight the diligence from madrid which be due six hour before have not make its appearance and we pass the rest of the night in a cold room fasting for the meal be only to be serve when the other passenger come at day-break finally a single dish of oily meat be vouchsafe to we and as it be now certain that some accident have happen the passenger to madrid request the _ administrador _ to send they on in a extra conveyance this he refuse and they begin to talk about get up a pronunciamento when a messenger arrive with the news that the diligence have break down at midnight about two league off tool be thereupon dispatch nine hour after the accident happen and we might hope to be release from we imprisonment in four or five more baylen be a wretched place celebrate for have the first palm-tree which those see who come from madrid and for the victory gain by castaños over the french force under dupont which occasion the flight of joseph buonaparte from madrid and the temporary liberation of spain from the french yoke castaños who receive the title of duke de baylen and be compare by the spaniard to wellington die about three month ago the battle-field i pass in the night the palm-tree i find but it be now a mere stump the leaf have be strip off to protect the house of the inhabitant from lightning we posada have one of they hang at the window at last the diligence come and at three pm when i ought to have be in sight of granada i leave the forlorn wall of baylen my fellow-passenger be a young sprig of the spanish nobility and three chubby-faced nun the rest of the journey that afternoon be through a wide hilly region entirely bare of tree and habitation and but partially cultivate there be something sublime in its very nakedness and loneliness and i feel attract to it as i do towards the desert in fact although i have see little fine scenery since leave seville have have the worst of weather and no very pleasant travel experience the country have exercise a fascination over I which i do not quite understand i find myself constantly on the point of make a vow to return again much to my regret night set in before we reach jaen the capital of the moorish kingdom of that name we halt for a short time in the large plaza of the town where the dash of fountain mingle with the sound of the rain and the black jagged outline of a mountain overhang the place be visible through the storm all night we journey on through the mountain sometimes splash through swollen stream sometimes come almost to a halt in bed of deep mud when this morning dawn we be ascend through wild stony hill overgrow with shrubbery and the driver say we be six league from granada still on through a lonely country with now and then a large _ venta _ or country inn by the road-side and about nine o'clock as the sky become more clear i saw in front of we high up under the cloud the snow-field of the sierra nevada a hour afterwards we be ride between garden vineyard and olive orchard with the magnificent vega of granada stretch far away on the right and the vermilion tower of the alhambra crowning the height before we chapter xxxv granada and the alhambra mateo ximenez the younger -- the cathedral of granada -- a monkish miracle -- catholic shrine -- military cherub -- the royal chapel -- the tomb of ferdinand and isabellum -- chapel of san juan de dio -- the albaycin -- view of the vega -- the generalife -- the alhambra -- torra de la vela -- the wall and tower -- a visit to old mateo -- the court of the fish-pond -- the hall of the alhambra -- character of the architecture -- hall of the abencerrage -- hall of the two sister -- the moorish dynasty in spain who have not in granada be verily he have nothing see _ andalusian proverb _ granada _ Wednesday nov _ 17 1852 immediately on reach here i be set upon by a old gentleman who want to act as guide but the mozo of the hotel put into my hand a card inscribe don mateo ximenez guide to the celebrated washington irving and i dismiss the other applicant the next morning as the mozo bring I my chocolate he say señor _ el chico _ be wait for you the little one turn out to be the son of old mateo honest mateo who still live up in the alhambra but be now rather too old to continue he business except on great occasion i accept the young mateo who speak with the greatest enthusiasm of mr irving avow that the whole family be devote to he in life and death it be still rain furiously and the golden darro which roar in front of the hotel be a swollen brown flood i do not wonder that he sometimes threaten as the old couplet say to burst up the zacatin and bear it down to he bride the xenil towards noon the cloud break away a little and we sally out pass through the gate and square of vivarramblum -lrb- may not this name come from the arabic _ bob er-raml _ the gate of the sand -rrb- we soon reach the cathedral this massive structure which make a good feature in the distant view of granada be not at all impose near at hand the interior be a mixture of gothic and roman glaring with whitewash and break like that of seville by a wooden choir and two grand organ block up the nave some of the side chapel nevertheless be splendid mass of carve and gilding in one of they there be two full-length portrait of ferdinand and isabellum suppose to be by alonzo cano the cathedral contain some other good picture by the same master but all its former treasure be carry off by the french we next go to the picture gallery which be in the franciscan convent there be two small murillo much damage some tolerable alonzo cano a few common-place picture by juan de sevillum and a hundred or more by author whose name i do not inquire for a more hideous collection of trash never meet my eye one of they represent a miracle perform by two saint who cut off the diseased leg of a sick white man and replace it by the sound leg of a dead negro whose body be see lie beside the bed judge from the ghastly face of the patient the operation be rather painful though the story go that the black leg grow fast and the man recover the picture at least illustrate the absence of prejudice of color among the saint we go into the adjoining church of santo domingo which have several very rich shrine of marble and gold a sort of priestly sacristan open the church of the madonna del rosario -- a glitter mixture of marble gold and looking-glass which have rather a rich effect the beautiful yellow and red veined marble be from the sierra nevada the sacred madonna -- a big doll with stare eye and pink cheek -- have a dress of silver shape like a extinguisher and encrust with ruby and other precious stone the utter absence of taste in most catholic shrine be a extraordinary thing it seem remarkable that a church which have produce so many glorious artist should so constantly and grossly violate the simplest rule of art the only shrine which i have see which be in keep with the object adore be that of the virgin at nazareth where there be neither picture nor image but only vase of fragrant flower and perfumed oil in golden lamp burn before a tablet of spotless marble among the decoration of the chapel there be a host of cherub fresco on the ceiling and one of they be represent in the act of firing off a blunderbuss be it true that the angel carry blunderbuss i ask the priest he shrug he shoulder with a sort of half-smile and say nothing in the cathedral on the plinth of the column in the outer aisle be several notice to the effect that whoever speak to woman either in the nave or the aisle thereby put himself in danger of excommunication i could not help laugh as i read this monkish and yet most _ un_monk-like statute oh say mateo all that be in the despotic time it be not so now a deluge of rain put a stop to my sight-seeing until the next morning when i set out with mateo to visit the royal chapel a murder have be commit in the night near the entrance of the zacatin and the paving-stone be still red with the blood of the victim a _ funcion _ of some sort be go on in the chapel and we go into the sacristy to wait the priest and chorister be there change they robe they salute I good-humoredly though there be a expression in they face that plainly say : a heretic when the service be conclude i go into the chapel and examine the high altar with its rude wood-carving represent the surrender of granada the portrait of ferdinand and isabellum cardinal ximenez gonzalvo of cordova and king boabdil be very curious another tablet represent the baptism of the conquer moor in the center of the chapel stand the monument erect to ferdinand and isabellum and they successor philip l and marium by charle v they be tall catafalque of white marble superbly sculpture with the full length effigy of the monarch upon they the figure be admirable that of isabellum especially though the feature be settle in the repose of death express all the grand and noble trait which belong to she character the sacristan remove the matting from a part of the floor disclose a iron grate underneath a damp mouldly smell significant of death and decay come up through the opening he light two long waxen taper lift the grate and i follow he down the narrow step into the vault where lie the coffin of the catholic sovereign they be bring here from the alhambra in 1525 the leaden sarcophagus contain the body of ferdinand and isabellum lie side by side on stone slab and as i stand between the two rest a hand on each the sacristan place the taper in aperture in the stone at the head and foot they sleep as they wish in they beloved granada and no profane hand have ever disturb the repose of they ash after visit the church of san jeronimo found by gonzalvo of cordova i go to the adjoining church and hospital of san juan de dio a fat priest wash he hand in the sacristy send a boy to show I the chapel of san juan and the relic the remains of the saint rest in a silver chest standing in the center of a richly-adorned chapel among the relic be a thorn from the crown of christ which as any botanist may see must have grow on a different plant from the other thorn they show at seville and neither kind be find in palestine the true _ spina christus _ the nebbuk have very small thorn but nothing could be more cruel as i find when ride through patch of it near jericho the boy also show I a tooth of san lorenzo a crooked brown _ bicuspi _ from which i should infer that the saint be rather a ill-favored man the gilded chapel of san juan be in singular contrast with one of the garment which he wear when live -- a cowl of plaited reed look like a old fish basket -- which be keep in a glass case he portrait be also to be see -- a mild and beautiful face truly that of one who go about do good he be a sort of spanish john howard and deserve canonization if anybody ever do i ascend the street of the darro to the albaycin which we enter by one of the ancient gate this suburb be still surround by the original fortification and undermine by the capacious cistern of the moor it look down on granada and from the crumble parapet there be superb view over the city the vega and its inclosing mountain the alhambra rise opposite against the dark-red and purple background of the sierra nevada and a canopy of heavy rain-cloud rest on all the height a fitful gleam of sunshine now and then break through and wander over the plain touch up white tower and olive grove and reach of the wind xenil with a brilliancy which suggest the splendor of the whole picture if once thus restore to its proper light i could see santa fé in the distance toward loxa nearer and more eastward the sierra de elvira of a deep violet color with the wood of the soto de roma the duke of wellington 's estate at its base and beyond it the mountain of parapanda the weather-guage of granada still cover with cloud there be a old granadian proverb which say : -- when parapanda wear he bonnet it will rain whether god will it or no from the chapel of san miguel above the albaycin there be a very striking view of the deep gorge of the darro at one 's foot with the garden and white wall of the generalife rise beyond and the sillum del moro and the mountain of the sun towering above it the long irregular line of the alhambra with the huge red tower rise here and there remind I somewhat of a distant view of karnak and like karnak the alhambra be picturesque from whatever point it be view we descend through waste of cactus to the darro in whose turbid stream a group of man be wash for gold i watch one of they as he twirl he bowl in precisely the californium style but get nothing for he pain mateo say that they often make a dollar a day each pass under the tower of comare and along the battlements of the alhambra we climb up to the generalife this charming villa be still in good preservation though its exquisite filigree and scroll-work have be greatly injure by whitewash the elegant colonnade surround garden rich in rose myrtle and cypress and the fountain that lull the moorish king in they summer idleness still pour they fertilize stream in one of the room be a small and bad portrait gallery contain a suppose portrait of boabdil it be a mild amiable face but wholly lack strength of character to-day i devote to the alhambra the storm which as the people say have not be equal for several year show no sign of break up and in the midst of a drive shower i ascend to the vermilion tower which be suppose to be of phoenician origin they stand on the extremity of a long narrow ledge which stretch out like a arm from the hill of the alhambra the _ paséo _ lie between and be shaded by beautiful elm which the moor plant i enter the alhambra by the gate of justice which be a fine specimen of moorish architecture though of common red brick and mortar it be singular what a grace the horse-shoe arch give to the most heavy and lumbering mass of masonry the round arch of the christian edifice of granada seem tame and inelegant in comparison over the arch of the vestibule of this gate be the colossal hand and over the inner entrance the key celebrated in the tale of washington irving and the superstition of the people i first ascend the torre de la vela where the christian flag be first plant on the 2d of January 1492 the view of the vega and city of granada be even grander than from the albaycin parapanda be still bonnet in cloud but patch of blue sky begin to open above the mountain of loxa a little boy accompany we to see that i do not pull the bell the sound of which would call together all the troops in the city while we stand there the funeral procession of the man murder two night before come up the street of gomerez and pass around the hill under the vermilion tower i make the circuit of the wall before enter the palace in the place of the cistern i stop to take a drink of the cool water of the darro which be bring thither by subterranean channel from the hill then pass the ostentatious pile commence by charle v but which be never finish and never will be nor ought to be we walk along the southern rampart to the tower of the seven floor amid the ruin of winch i discern the top of the arch by which the unfortunate boabdil quit granada and which be thenceforth close for ever in the tower of the infanta a number of workman be busy restore the interior which have be cruelly damage the brilliant _ azulejo _ or tile-work the delicate arch and filigree sculpture of the wall still attest its former elegance and give some color to the tradition that it be the residence of the moorish princess as we pass through the little village which still exist among the ruin of the fortress mateo invite I to step in and see he father the genuine honest mateo immortalize in the tale of the alhambra the old man have take up the trade of silk-weaving and have a number of gay-colored ribbon on he loom he be more than sixty year old and now quite gray-headed but have the same simple manners the same honest face that attract he temporary master he speak with great enthusiasm of mr irving and bring out from a place of safety the alhambra and the chronicle of the conquest which he have carefully preserve he then produce a andalusian sash the work of he own hand which he insist on bind around my waist to see how it would look i must next take off my coat and hat and put on he Sunday jacket and jaunty sombrero _ por dio _ he exclaim : _ que buen mozo _ senor you be a legitimate andalusian after this of course i could do no less than buy the sash you must show it to washington irving say he and tell he it be make by mateo 's own hand which i promise i must then go into the kitchen and eat a pomegranate from he garden -- a glorious pomegranate with kernel of crimson and so full of blood that you could not touch they but it trickle through you finger el marque a sprightly dog and a great slate-colored cat take possession of my leg and beg for a share of every mouthful i take while old mateo sit beside I rejoice in the flavor of a gibraltar cigar which i give he but my time be precious and so i let the son of the alhambra go back to he loom and set out for the palace of the moorish king this palace be so hidden behind the ambitious shell of that of charle v that i be at a loss where it could be i think i have compass the hill and yet have see no indication of the renowned magnificence of the alhambra but a little door in a blank wall usher I into a true moorish realm the court of the fishpond or of the myrtle as it be sometimes call here i see again the slender pillar the fringed and embroidered arch and the perforated lace-like tracery of the fairy corridor here hedge of rose and myrtle still bloom around the ancient tank wherein hundred of gold-fish disport the noise of the hill do not penetrate here and the solitary porter who admit I go back to he post and suffer I to wander at will through the enchanted hall i pass out of this court by a opposite door and see through the vista of marble pillar and the wonderful fret-work which seem a thing of air rather than of earth the fountain of the lion thence i enter in succession the hall of the abencerrage the hall of the two sister the apartment of the sultana the mosque and the hall of the ambassador these place -- all that be leave of the renowned palace -- be now well keep and carefully guard restoration be go on here and there and the place be scrupulously watch that no foreign vandal may further injure what the native goth have do they best to destroy the rubbish have be clear away the rent in the wall have be fill up and for the first time since it pass into spanish hand there seem a hope that the alhambra will be allow to stand what have be already destroy we can only partially conjecture but no one see what remain without complete the picture in he own imagination and place it among the most perfect and marvellous creation of human genius nothing can exceed the richness of invention which in this series of hall corridor and court never repeat the same ornament but from the simplest primitive form and color produce a thousand combination not one of which be in discord with the grand design it be useless to attempt a detailed description of this architecture and it be so unlike anything else in the world that like karnak and baalbec those only know the alhambra who see it when you can weave stone and hang you hall with marble tapestry you may rival it it be nothing to I that these ornament be stucco to sculpture they in marble be only the work of the hand they great excellence be in the design which like all great thing suggest even more than it give if i could create all that the court of lion suggest to I for its completion it would fulfil the dream of king sheddad and surpass the palace of the moslem paradise the pavilion of the court of lion and the hall which open into it on either side approach the nearest to they original perfection the floor be marble the wainscoting of paint tile the wall of embroidery still gleam with the softened lustre of they original tint and the lofty conical dome seem to be huge sparry crystalization hang with drop stalactite rather than any work of the human hand each of these dome be compose of five thousand separate piece and the pendent prismatic block color and gilded gradually resolve themselves as you gaze into the most intricate and elegant design but you must study long ere you have win all the secret of they beauty to comprehend they one should spend a whole day lie on he back under each one mateo spread he cloak for I in the fountain in the hall of the abencerrage over the blood-stain make by the decapitation of those gallant chief and i lay half a hour look upward : and this be what i make out of the dome from its central pinnacle hang the chalice of a flower with feathery petal like the crape myrtle of we southern state outside of this branch downward the eight ray of a large star whose point touch the base of the dome yet the star be itself compose of flower while between its ray and around its point fall a shower of blossom shell and sparry drop from the base of the dome hang a gorgeous pattern of lace with a fringe of bugle project into eight point so as to form a star of drapery hanging from the point of the flowery star in the dome the space between the angle be fill with mass of stalactite drop one below the other till they taper into the plain square side of the hall in the hall of the two sister i lay likewise for a considerable time resolve its misty glory into shape the dome be still more suggestive of flower the highest and central piece be a deep trumpet-flower whose mouth be cleft into eight petal it hang in the center of a superb lotus-cup the leaf of which be exquisitely vein and chase still further below swing a mass of mimosa blossom intermix with pod and lance-like leaf and around the base of the dome open the bell of sixteen gorgeous tulip these picture may not be very intelligible but i know not how else to paint the effect of this fairy architecture in granada as in seville and cordova one 's sympathy be wholly with the moor the few mutilate trace which still remain of they power taste and refinement surpass any of the monument erect by the race which conquer they the moorish dynasty in spain be truly as irving observe a splendid exotic doomed never to take a lasting root in the soil it be choke to death by the native weed and in place of land richly cultivate and teem with plenty we now have barren and-almost depopulate waste -- in place of education industry and the cultivation of the art and science a enslaved ignorant and degenerate race andalusium would be far more prosperous at this day have she remain in moslem hand true she would not have receive that faith which be yet destine to be the redemption of the world but the doctrine of mahomet be more acceptable to god and more beneficial to man than those of that inquisition which in spain alone have shed ten time as much christian blood as all the moslem race together for the last six century it be not from a mere romantic interest that i lament the fate of boabdil and the extinction of he dynasty have he be a king worthy to reign in those wonderful hall he never would have leave they have he perish there fight to the last he would have be free from forty year of weary exile and a obscure death well do charle v observe when speaking of he : better a tomb in the alhambra than a palace in the alpujanas chapter xxxvi the bridle-road of andalusium change of weather -- napoleon and he horse -- departure from granada -- my guide josé garcium -- he domestic trouble -- the tragedy of the umbrella -- the vow against aguardiente -- cross the vega -- the sierra nevada --

into its court they must be roof with blue sky in order to give the full impression of they brightness and beauty mateo procure I a bottle of _ vino rancio _ and we drink it together in the court of lion six hour have pass away before i know it and i reluctantly prepare to leave the cloud by this time have disappear the vega sleep in brilliant sunshine and the peak of the sierra nevada shone white and cold against the sky on reach the hotel i find a little man nickname napoleon await I he be desirous to furnish I with horse and have a prophetic knowledge of the weather promise I a bright sky as far as gibraltar i furnish all the señors say he they know I and never complain of I or my horse but by way of security on make the bargain i threaten to put up a card in the hotel at gibraltar warn all traveller against he in case i be not satisfied my contract be for two horse and a guide who be to be ready at sunrise the next morning napoleon be as good as he word and before i have finish a early cup of chocolate there be a little black andalusian stallion await I the _ alforja _ or saddle-bag of the guide be strengthen by a stock of cold provision the leathern bota hang beside it be fill with ripe granada wine and now behold I amble over the vega accoutred in a gay andalusian jacket a sash weave by mateo ximene and one of those bandboxy sombrero which i at first think so ungainly but now consider quite picturesque and elegant my guide a short but sinewy and well-knit son of the mountain name josé garcium set off at a canter down the bank of the darro do not ride so fast cry napoleon who watch we set out from the door of the fonda but josé be already out of hear this guide be a companion to my liking although he be only twenty-seven he have be for a number of year a _ correo _ or mail-rider and a guide for travel party he olive complexion be make still darker by exposure to the sun and wind and he coal-black eye shine with southern heat and fire he have one of those rare mouth which be bear with a broad smile in each corner and which seem to laugh even in the midst of grief we have not be two hour together before i know he history from begin to end he have already be marry eight year and he only trouble be a debt of twenty-four dollar which the illness of he wife have cause he this money be owe to the pawnbroker who keep he best clothes in pledge until he could pay it señor say he if i have ten million dollar i would rather give they all away than have a sick wife he have a brother in puerto principe cuba who send over money enough to pay the rent of the house but he find that child be a great expense it be most astonishing he say how much child can eat from morning till night the bread be never out of they mouth josé have recently be travel with some spaniard one of whom make he pay two dollar for a umbrella which be lose on the road this umbrella be a thorn in he side at every venta where we stop the story be repeat and he be not spare of he malediction the ghost of that umbrella be continually raise and it will be a long time before he can shut it one reason why i like to travel with foreign señors say he to I be that when i lose anything they never make I pay for it for all that i answer take care you do not lose my umbrella : it cost three dollar since then nothing can exceed josé 's attention to that article he be at he wit 's end how to secure it best it appear sometimes before sometimes behind he lash to the saddle with innumerable cord now he stick it into the alforja now carry it in he hand and i verily believe that he sleep with it in he arm every evening as he tell he story to the muleteer around the kitchen fire he always wind up by triumphantly appeal to I with : well señor have i lose _ you _ umbrella yet we bargain be that i shall feed he on the way and as we travel in the primitive style of the country we always sit down together to the same dish to he supervision the ollum be often indebted for a additional flavor and no thorough-bred gentleman could behave at table with more ease and propriety he be as moderate as a bedouin in he want and never touch the burning aguardiente which the muleteer be accustom to drink i ask he the reason of this i drink wine senor he reply because that you know be like meat and bread but i have make a vow never to drink aguardiente again two of we get drunk on it four or five year ago in granada and we quarrel my comrade draw he knife and stab I here in the left shoulder i be furious and cut he across the breast we both go to the hospital -- i for three month and he for six -- and he die in a few day after get out it cost my poor father many a thousand real and when i be able to go to work i vow before the virgin that i would never touch aguardiente again for the first league we road lay over the rich vega of granada but gradually become wilder and more waste pass the long desert ridge know as the last sigh of the moor we strike across a region of low hill the road be very deep from the recent rain and stud at short interval by rude cross erect to person who have be murder josé take a grim delight in give I the history of each beyond the village of lamalum which lie with its salt-pan in a basin of the hill we ascend the mountain ridge which form the southern boundary of the vega granada nearly twenty mile distant be still visible the alhambra be dwindle to a speck and i take my last view of it and the magnificent landscape which lie spread out before it the sierra nevada rise to the height of 13000 foot above the sea be perfectly free from cloud and the whole range be visible at one glance all its chasm be fill with snow and for nearly half-way down its side there be not a speck of any other color its summit be almost wholly devoid of shadow and they notch and jag outline rest flatly against the sky like ivory inlay on a table of lapis-lazuli from these waste hill we descend into the valley of cacium whose poplar-fringed river have be so swollen by the rain that the _ correo _ from malaga have only succeed in pass it that morning we ford it without accident and cross a loftier and bleaker range come down into the valley of the marchan high on a cliff over the stream stand alhama my resting-place for the night the natural warm bath on account of which this spot be so beloved by the moor be still resort to in the summer they lie in the bosom of a deep and rugged gorge half a mile further down the river the town occupy the crest of a narrow promontory bound on all side but one by tremendous precipice it be one of the most picturesque spot imaginable and remind I -- to continue the comparison between syrium and andalusium which i find so striking -- of the gorge of the barrada near damascus alhama be now a poor insignificant town only visit by artist and muleteer the population wear long brown cloak and slouch hat like the native of la mancha i find tolerable quarter in a house on the plaza and take the remain hour of daylight to view the town the people look at I with curiosity and some boy walk on the edge of the _ tajo _ or precipice throw over stone that i might see how deep it be the rock in some place quite overhang the bed of the marchan which half-girdle its base the close scrutiny to which i be subject by the crowd in the plaza call to mind all i have hear of spanish spy and robber at the venta i be well treat but receive such a exorbitant bill in the morning that i be ready to exclaim with king boabdil woe be I alhama on compare note with josé i find that he have be oblige to pay in addition for what he receive -- a discovery which so exasperate that worthy that he fold he hand bow he head make three kiss in the air and cry out : i swear before the virgin that i will never again take a traveller to that inn we leave alhama a hour before daybreak for we have a rough journey of more than forty mile before we the bridle-path be barely visible in the darkness but we continue ascend to a height of probably 5000 foot above the sea and thus meet the sunrise half-way cross the _ llano _ of ace faraya we reach a tremendous natural portal in the mountain from whence as from a door we look down on all the country lie between we and the sea the valley of the river vélez wind among the hill point out the course of we road on the left tower over we the barren sierra tejeda a isolate group of peak about 8000 foot in height for mile the road be a rocky ladder which we scramble down on foot lead we horse the vegetation gradually become of a warmer and more luxuriant cast the southern slope be plant with the vine that produce the famous malaga raisin and the orange grove in the sunny depths of the valley be as yellow as autumnal beech with they enormous load of fruit as the bell of vélez malaga be ring noon we emerge from the mountain near the mouth of the river and ride into the town to breakfast we halt at a queer old inn more like a turkish khan than a christian hostlery it be keep by a fat landlady who make we a ollum of kid and garlic which with some coarse bread and the red malaga wine soon take off the sharp edge of we mountain appetite while i be wash my hand at a well in the court-yard the _ mozo _ notice the pilgrim-seal of jerusalem which be stamp indelibly on my left arm he admiration and reverence be so great that he call the fat landlady who on learn that it have be make in jerusalem and that i have visit the holy sepulchre summon she child to see it here my child she say cross yourselve kneel down and kiss this holy seal for as long as you live you may never see the like of it again thus i a protestant heretic become a catholic shrine the child kneel and kiss my arm with touching simplicity and the seal will henceforth be more sacred to I than ever the remain twenty mile or more of the road to malaga follow the line of the coast pass headland crown by the _ atalaya _ or watch-tower of the moor it be a new road and practicable for carriage so that for spain it may be consider a important achievement the late rain have however already undermine it in a number of place here as among the mountain we meet crowd of muleteer all of whom greet I with : _ vaya ust con dio caballero _ -- -lrb- may you go with god cavalier -rrb- by this time all my forget spanish have come back again and a little experience of the simple way of the people make I quite at home among they in almost every instance i be treat precisely as a spaniard would have be and less annoyed by the curiosity of the native than i have be in germany and even america we be still two league from malaga at sunset the fisherman along the coast be haul in they net and we soon begin to overtake company of they carry they fish to the city on donkey one stout strap fellow with flesh as hard and yellow as a sturgeon 's be seat sideways on a very small donkey between two immense pannier of fish as he trot before we shout and slapping the flank of the sturdy little beast josé and i begin to laugh whereupon the fellow break out into the follow monologue address to the donkey : who laugh at this _ burrico _ who say he be not fine gold from head to foot what be it that he can not do if there be a mountain ever so high he would gallop over it if there be a river ever so deep he would swim through it if he could but speak i might send he to market alone with the fish and not a _ chavo _ of the money would he spend on the way home who say he can not go as far as that limp horse arrrre burrico punate -- ar-r-r-r-r-e-e we reach malaga at last we horse sorely fag at the fonda de la alameda a new and very elegant hotel i find a bath and a good dinner both welcome thing to a tired traveller the winter of malaga be like spring in other land and on that account it be much visit by invalid especially english it be a lively commercial town of about 80000 inhabitant and if the present scheme of railroad communication with madrid be carry out must continue to increase in size and importance a number of manufacture establishment have lately be start and in this department it bid fair to rival barcelona the harbor be small but good and the country around rich in all the production of temperate and even tropical climate the city contain little to interest the tourist i visit the cathedral a immense unfinished mass without a particle of architectural taste outwardly though the interior have a fine effect from its large dimension at noon to-day we be again in the saddle and take the road to the bath of caratraca the tall factory chimney of malaga vomit forth stream of black smoke mar the serenity of the sky but the distant view of the city be very fine the broad vega water by the guadaljorce be rich and well cultivate and now rejoice in the verdure of spring the meadow be clothe with fresh grass butter-cup and daisy be in blossom and lark sing in the olive-tree now and then we pass a _ casa del campo _ with its front half bury in orange-tree over which tower two or three sentinel palm after two league of this delightful travel the country become more hilly and the group of mountain which inclose we assume the most picturesque and enchanting form the soft haze in which the distant peak be bath the lovely violet shadow fill up they chasm and gorge and the fresh meadow vineyard and olive grove below make the landscape one of the most beautiful i have see in spain as we be trot along through the palmetto thicket josé ask I if i should not like to hear a andalusian story nothing would please I better i reply ride close beside I then say he that you may understand every word of it i comply and he give I the follow just as i repeat it : there be once a very rich man who have thousand of cattle in the sierra nevada and hundred of house in the city well : this man put a plate with he name on it on the door of the great house in which he live and the name be this : don pedro without fear and without care now when the king be make he _ paséo _ he happen to ride by this house in he carriage and see the plate on the door ` read I the name on that plate ' say he to he officer then the officer read the name : don pedro without fear and without care ' i will see whether don pedro be without fear and without care ' say the king the next day come a messenger to the house and when he see don pedro say he to he ` don pedro without fear and without care the king want you ' ` what do the king want with I ' say don pedro ` he send you four question which you must answer within four day or he will have you shoot and the question be : -- how can the sierra nevada be clear of snow how can the sea be make smaller how many arroba do the moon weigh and : how many league from here to the land of heavenly glory ' then don pedro without fear and without care begin to sweat from fright and know not what he should do he call some of he arriero and loaded twenty mule with money and go up into the sierra nevada where he herdsman tend he flock for as i say he have many thousand cattle ` god keep you my master ' say the chief herdsman who be young and _ buen mozo _ and have as good a head as ever be set on two shoulder ' _ anda hombre _ say don pedro ' i be a dead man ' and so he tell the herdsman all that the king have say ` oh be that all ' say the know mozo ' i can get you out of the scrape let I go and answer the question in you name my master ' ` ah you fool what can you do ' say don pedro without fear and without care throw himself upon the earth and ready to die but nevertheless the herdsman dress himself up as a _ caballero _ go down to the city and on the fourth day present himself at the king 's palace ` what do you want ' say the officer ' i be don pedro without fear and without care come to answer the question which the king send to I ' ` well ' say the king when he be bring before he ` let I hear you answer or i will have you shoot this day ' ` you majesty ' say the herdsman ' i think i can do it if you be to set a million of child to playing among the snow of the sierra nevada they would soon clear it all away and if you be to dig a ditch as wide and as deep as all spain you would make the sea that much smaller ' ` but ' say the king ` that make only two question there be two more yet ' ' i think i can answer those also ' say the herdsman : ` the moon contain four quarter and therefore weigh only one arroba and as for the last question it be not even a single league to the land of heavenly glory -- for if you majesty be to die after breakfast you would get there before you have a appetite for dinner ' ` well do say the king and he then make he count and marquez and i do not know how many other title in the meantime don pedro without fear and without care have die of he fright and as he leave no family the herdsman take possession of all he estate and until the day of he death be call don pedro without fear and without care i write sit by the grate window of this lonely inn look out on the meadow of the guadaljorce the chain of mountain which rise to the west of malaga be purple by the light of the setting sun and the house and castle of carlama hang on its side in full view further to the right i see the smoke of monda where one of the greatest battle of antiquity be fight -- that which overthrow the son of pompey and give the roman empire to cæsar the mozo of the venta be busy prepare my kid and rice and josé be at he elbow gently suggest ingredient which may give the dish a richer flavor the landscape be soften by the hush of come evening a few bird be still twitter among the bush and the half-moon grow whiter and clearer in mid-heaven the people about I be humble but appear honest and peaceful and nothing indicate

Thursday November _ 25 1852 i pass a uncomfortable night at the venta de villalon lie upon a bag stuff with equal quantity of wool and flea start before dawn we follow a path which lead into the mountain where herdsman and boy be take out they sheep and goat to pasture then it descend into the valley of a stream border with rich bottom-land i never see the orange in a more flourishing state we pass several orchard of tree thirty foot high and every bough and twig so completely laden with fruit that the foliage be hardly to be see at the venta del vicario we find a number of soldier just set out for ronda they appear to be escort a convoy of goods for there be twenty or thirty laden mule gather at the door we now ascend a most difficult and stony path wind through bleak waste of gray rock till we reach a lofty pass in the mountain range the wind sweep through the narrow gateway with a force that almost unhorse we from the other side a sublime but most desolate landscape open to my view opposite at ten mile ' distance rise a lofty ridge of naked rock overhang with cloud the country between be a chaotic jumble of stony hill separate by deep chasm with just a green patch here and there to show that it be not entirely forsake by man nevertheless as we descend into it we find valley with vineyard and olive grove which be invisible from above as we be both get hungry josé stop at a ventorillo and order two cup of wine for which he insist on pay if i have as many horse as my master napoleon say he i would regale the señors whenever i travel with they i would have _ puro _ and sweetmeat with plenty of malaga or valdepeñas in the bota and they should never complain of they fare part of we road be stud with gray cork-tree at a distance hardly to be distinguish from olive and josé dismount to gather the mast which be as sweet and palatable as chestnut with very little of the bitter quercine flavor at eleven o'clock we reach el burgo so call probably from its ancient moorish fortress it be a poor starve village build on a barren hill over a stream which be still span by a lofty moorish bridge of a single arch the remain three league to ronda be exceedingly rough and difficult climb a barren ascent of nearly a league in length we reach the _ puerto del viento _ or gate of the wind through which drive such a current that we be oblige to dismount and even then it require all my strength to move against it the peak around far and near face with precipitous cliff wear the most savage and forbid aspect : in fact this region be almost a counterpart of the wilderness lie between jerusalem and the dead sea very soon we touch the skirt of a cloud and be envelop in mass of chill whirling vapor through which we travel for three or four mile to a similar gate on the western side of the chain descend again we emerge into a clearer atmosphere and see below we a wide extent of mountain country but of a more fertile and cheerful character olive orchard and wheat-field now appear and at four o'clock we ride into the street of ronda no town can surpass this in the grandeur and picturesqueness of its position it be build on the edge of a broad shelf of the mountain which fall away in a sheer precipice of from six to eight hundred foot in height and from the window of many of the house you can look down the dizzy abyss this shelf again be divide in the center by a tremendous chasm three hundred foot wide and from four to six hundred foot in depth in the bed of which roar the guadalvin boil in foam whirlpool or leap in sparkling cascade till it reach the valley below the town lie on both side of the chasm which be span by a stone bridge of a single arch with abutment nearly four hundred foot in height the view of this wonderful cleft either from above or below be one of the finest of its kind in the world honda be as far superior to tivolus as tivolus be to a dutch village on the dead level of holland the panorama which it command be on the grandest scale the valley below be a garden of fruit and vine bold yet cultivate hill succeed and in the distance rise the lofty summit of another chain of the serrania de honda be these sublime cliff these charming cascade of the guadalvin and this daring bridge in italy instead of in spain they would be sketch and paint every day in the year but i have yet to know where a good picture of ronda may be find in the bottom of the chasm be a number of corn-mill as old as the time of the moor the water gush out from the arch of one drive the wheel of that below so that a single race supply they all i descend by a very steep zig-zag path nearly to the bottom on a little point or promontory overhang the black depths there be a moorish gateway still stand the sunset throw a lovely glow over the brown cliff and the airy town above but they be far grander when the cascade glitter in the moonlight and the gulf out of which they leap be lose in profound shadow the window of my bed-room hang over the chasm honda be wrap in fog when josé awake I on the morning of the 22d as we have but about twenty-four mile to ride that day we do not leave until sunrise we ride across the bridge through the old town and down the hill pass the triple line of the moorish wall by the original gateway the road stony and rugged beyond measure now take to the mountain from the opposite height there be a fine view of the town perch like a eagle 's nest on the verge of its tremendous cliff but a curtain of rain soon fall before it and the dense dark cloud settle around we and fill up the gorge on either hand hour after hour we toil along the slippery path scale the high ridge by rocky ladder up which we horse climb with the greatest difficulty the scenery whenever i could obtain a misty glimpse of it be sublime lofty mountain ridge rise on either hand bleak jagged summit of naked rock pierce the cloud and the deep chasm which separate they sink far below we dark and indistinct through the rain sometimes i catch sight of a little hamlet hanging on some almost inaccessible ledge the home of the lawless semi-moorish mountaineer who inhabit this wild region the face of those we meet exhibit marked trace of they moslem ancestry especially in the almond-shaped eye and the dusky olive complexion they dialect retain many oriental form of expression and i be not a little surprised at find the arabic _ eiwa _ -lrb- yes -rrb- in general use instead of the spanish _ si _ about eleven o'clock we reach the rude village of atajate where we procure a very good breakfast of kid egg and white ronda wine the wind and rain increase but i have no time to lose as every hour swell the mountain flood and make the journey more difficult this district be in the worst repute of any in spain it be a very nest of robber and contrabandista at the venta in atajate they urge we to take a guard but my valiant josé declare that he have never take one and yet be never rob so i trust to he good luck the weather however be we best protection in such a driving rain we could bid defiance to the flint lock of they escopette if indeed any could be find so fond of they trade as to ply it in a storm wherein the cub-drawn bear would crouch the lion and the belly-pinched wolf keep they fur dry nevertheless i notice that each of the few convoy of laden mule which we meet have one or more of the _ guardium cicium _ accompany it besides these the only person abroad be some wild-looking individual arm to the tooth and muffle in long cloak towards whom as they pass josé would give he head a slight toss and whisper to I : more contrabandista we be soon in a condition to defy the weather the rain beat furiously in we face especially when thread the wind-blown pass between the higher peak i raise my umbrella as a defense but the first blast snap it in twain the mountain-side be vein with rill roar downward into the hollow and smaller rill soon begin to trickle down my own side during the last part of we way the path be notch along precipitous steep where the storm be so thick that we could see nothing either above or below it be like ride along the outer edge of the world when once you be thoroughly wet it be a great satisfaction to know that you can be no wetter and so josé and i go forward in the best possible humor finding so much diversion in we plight that the dreary league be considerably shorten at the venta of gaucin where we stop the people receive we kindly the house consist of one room -- stable kitchen and dining-room all in one there be a small apartment in a windy loft where a bed -lrb- much too short -rrb- be prepare for I a fire of dry heather be make in the wide fire-place and the ruddy flame with a change of clothing and a draught of the amber vintage of estepona soon thaw out the chill of the journey but i receive news which cause I a great deal of anxiety the river guadiaro be so high that nobody could cross and two forlorn muleteer have be wait eight day at the inn for the water to subside augmented by the rain which have fall and which seem to increase as night come on how could i hope to cross it on the morrow in two day the indium steamer would be at gibraltar my passage be already take and i _ must _ be there the matter be discuss for some time it be pronounced impossible to travel by the usual road but the landlord know a path among the hill which lead to a ferry on the guadiaro where there be a boat and from thence we could make we way to san roque which be in sight of gibraltar he demand rather a large fee for accompany I but there be nothing else to be do josé and i sit down in great tribulation to we accustomed ollum but neither of we could do justice to it and the greater part gladden the landlord 's two boy -- beautiful little imp with face like murillo 's cherub nevertheless i pass rather a merry evening chat with some of the villager over a brazier of coal and one of the aforesaid boy who although only eight year old already perform the duty of mozo light I to my loft when he have put down the lamp he try ' the door and ask I : have you the key no say i i do not want one i be not afraid but he rejoin perhaps you may get afraid in the night and if you do strike on this part of the wall -lrb- suit the action to the word -rrb- -- _ i _ sleep on that side i willingly promise to call he to my aid if i should get alarmed i sleep but little for the wind be howl around the tile over my head and i be busy with plan for construct raft and swim current with a rope around my waist finally i find a little oblivion but it seem that i have scarcely close my eye when josé push open the door thanks be to god senor say he it begin to dawn and the sky be clear : we shall certainly get to gibraltar to-day the landlord be ready so we take some bread and a basket of olive and set out at once leave gaucin we commence descend the mountain staircase by which the serranium of ronda be scale on the side towards gibraltar the road say mr ford seem make by the evil one in a hang garden of eden after four mile of frightfully rugged descent we reach a orange grove on the bank of the xenar and then take a wild path lead along the hill on the right of the stream we overtake a few muleteer who be tempt out by the fine weather and before long the _ correo _ or mail-rider from ronda to san roque join we after eight mile more of toilsome travel we reach the valley of the guadiaro the river be not more than twenty yard wide flow with a deep strong current between high bank two rope be stretch across and a large clumsy boat be moor to the shore we call to the ferryman but they hesitate say that nobody have yet be able to cross however we all get in with we horse and two of the man with much reluctance draw we over the current be very powerful although the river have fall a little during the night but we reach the opposite bank without accident we have still another river the guargante to pass but we be cheer by some peasant whom we meet with the news that the ferry-boat have resume operation after this current lay behind we and there be now nothing but firm land all the way to gibraltar josé declare with much earnestness that he be quite as glad for my sake as if somebody have give he a million of dollar we horse too seem to feel that something have be achieve and show such a fresh spirit that we loosen the rein and let they gallop to they heart ' content over the green meadow the mountain be now behind we and the moorish castle of gaucin crest a peak blue with the distance over hill cover with broom and heather in blossom and through hollow grow with oleander arbutus and the mastic shrub we ride to the cork-wood forest of san roque the sporting-ground of gibraltar officer the bark of dog the crack of whip and now and then a distant halloo announce that a hunt be in progress and soon we come upon a company of thirty or forty horseman in cap white glove and top-boot scatter along the crest of a hill i have no desire to stop and witness the sport for the mediterranean now lay before I and the huge gray mass of the rock loom in the distance at san roque which occupy the summit of a conical hill about half-way between gibraltar and algecira the landlord leave we and immediately start on he return have now exchange the rugged bridle-path of ronda for a smooth carriage-road josé and i dash on at full gallop to the end of we journey we be both bespatter with mud from head to foot and we jacket and sombrero have lose something of they spruce air we meet a great many ruddy cleanly-shaven englishman who rein up on one side to let we pass with a look of wonder at we andalusian impudence nothing divert josé more than to see one of these englishman rise in he stirrup as he go by on a trot look look señor he exclaim do you ever see the like and then break into a fresh explosion of laughter pass the spanish line which stretch across the neck of the sandy little peninsula connect gibraltar with the main land we ride under the terrible battery which snarl at spain from this side of the rock row after row of enormous gun bristle the wall or look out from the gallery hew in the side of inaccessible cliff a artificial moat be cut along the base of the rock and a simple bridge-road lead into the fortress and town after give up my passport i be allow to enter josé have already obtain a permit from the spanish authority i clatter up the long street of the town to the club house where i find a company of english friend in the evening josé make he appearance to settle we account and take he leave of I while scramble down the rocky stair-way of gaucin josé have say to I : look you señor i be very fond of english beer and if i get you to gibraltar to day you must give I a glass of it when therefore he come in the evening he eye sparkle at the sight of a bottle of alsop 's ale and a handful of good gibraltar cigar ah señor say he after we book be square and he have pocket he _ gratification _ i be sorry we be go to part for we be good friend be we not señor yes josé say i if i ever come to granada again i shall take no other guide than josé garcium and i will have you for a longer journey than this we shall go over all spain together _ mi amigo _ may god grant it respond josé cross himself and now señor i must go i shall travel back to granada _ muy triste _ señor _ muy triste _ the faithful fellow eye be full of tear and as he lift my hand twice to he lip some warm drop fall upon it god bless he honest heart wherever he go and now a word as to travel in spain which be not attend with half the difficulty and annoyance i have be lead to expect my experience of course be limit to the province of andalusium but my route include some of the roughest road and most dangerous robber-district in the peninsula the people with whom i come in contact be invariably friendly and oblige and i be deal with much more honestly than i should have be in italy with every disposition to serve you there be nothing like servility among the spaniard the native dignity which characterize they demeanor prepossess I very strongly in they favor there be but one dialect of courtesy and the muleteer and common peasant address each other with the same grave respect as the don and grandee my friend josé be a model of good-breeding i have little trouble either with passport-officer or custom-house my passport in fact be never once demand although i take the precaution to have it visèd in all the large city in seville and malaga it be sign by the american consul without the usual fee of two dollar -- almost the only instance which have come under my observation the regulation of the american consular system which give the consul no salary but permit they instead to get they pay out of traveller be a disgrace to we government it amount in effect to _ a direct tax on travel _ and fall heavily on the hundred of young man of limited means who annually visit europe for the purpose of complete they education every american citizen who travel in italy pay a passport tax of ten dollar in all the port of the mediterranean there be a american vice-consul who do not even get the postage pay on he dispatch and to whom the advent of a traveller be of course a welcome sight mislead by a false notion of economy we government be fast become proverbial for its meanness if those of we own citizen who represent we abroad only work as they be pay and if the foreigner who act as vice-consul without pay do not derive some petty trading advantage from they position we should be almost without protection \* \* \* \* \* with my departure from spain close the record of my journey in the land of the saracen for although i afterwards behold more perfect type of saracenic art on the bank of the jumna and the gange they grow up under the great empire of the descendant of tamerlane and be the creation of artist foreign to the soil it would no doubt be interesting to contrast the remains of oriental civilization and refinement as they still exist at the extreme eastern and western limit of the moslem sway and to show how that art which have its birth in the capital of the caliph -- damascus and baghdad -- attain its most perfect development in spain and indium but my visit to the latter country connect itself naturally with my voyage to china loo-choo and japan form a separate and distinct field of travel on the 27th of November the overland mail steamer arrive at gibraltar and i embark in she for alexandrium enter upon another year of even more varied strange and adventurous experience than that which have close i be almost afraid to ask those patient reader who have accompany I thus far to travel with I through another volume but next to the pleasure of see the world come the pleasure of tell of it and i must need finish my story end of project gutenberg 's the land of the saracen by bayard taylor
