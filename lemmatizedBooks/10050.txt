the evening before with a friend and have describe she own sensation after a long illness when she have be at the point of death i suppose she say that i be as nearly go as any one ever be to come back again there be no pain in it only a sense of sink down down -- through the bed as if nothing could hold I or give I support enough -- but no pain and then they have speak of another friend in the same circumstance who also have come back from the very verge and who describe she sensation as those of one float upon a summer sea without pain or suffering in a lovely nook of the mediterranean blue as the sky these soft and soothing image of the passage which all man dread have be talk over with low voice yet with smile and a grateful sense that the warm precinct of the cheerful day be once more familiar to both and very cheerfully she go to rest that night talk of what be to be do on the morrow and fall asleep sweetly in she little room with its shaded light and curtain window and little picture on the dim wall all be quiet in the house : soft breathing of the sleeper soft murmur of the spring wind outside a wintry moon very clear and full in the sky a little town all hushed and quiet everything lie defenceless unconscious in the safe keep of god how soon she wake no one can tell she wake and lay quite still half roused half hush in that soft languor that attend a happy waking she be happy always in the peace of a heart that be humble and faithful and pure but yet have be use to wake to a consciousness of little pain and trouble such as even to she meekness be sometimes hard to bear but on this morning there be none of these she lay in a kind of hush of happiness and ease not care to make any further movement linger over the sweet sensation of that wake she have no desire to move nor to break the spell of the silence and peace it be still very early she suppose and probably it might be hour yet before any one come to call she it might even be that she should sleep again she have no wish to move she lay at such luxurious ease and calm but by and by as she come to full possession of she waking sens it appear to she that there be some change in the atmosphere in the scene there begin to steal into the air about she the soft dawn as of a summer morning the lovely blueness of the first opening of daylight before the sun it could not be the light of the moon which she have see before she go to bed and all be so still that it could not be the bustling wintry day which come at that time of the year late to find the world awake before it this be different it be like the summer dawn a soft suffusion of light grow every moment and by and by it occur to she that she be not in the little room where she have lie down there be no dim wall or roof she little picture be all go the curtain at she window the discovery give she no uneasiness in that delightful calm she lay still to think of it all to wonder yet undisturbed it half amuse she that these thing should be change but do not rouse she yet with any shock of alteration the light grow fuller and fuller round grow into day clear she eye from the sweet mist of the first waking then she raise herself upon she arm she be not in she room she be in no scene she know indeed it be scarcely a scene at all nothing but light so soft and lovely that it soothe and caress she eye she think all at once of a summer morning when she be a child when she have wake in the deep night which yet be day early so early that the bird be scarcely astir and have rise up with a delicious sense of daring and of be all alone in the mystery of the sunrise in the unawakened world which lay at she foot to be explore as if she be eve just enter upon eden it be curious how all those childish sensation long forget come back to she as she find herself so unexpectedly out of she sleep in the open air and light in the recollection of that lovely hour with a smile at herself so different as she now know herself to be she be move to rise and look a little more closely about she and see where she be when i call she a little pilgrim i do not mean that she be a child on the contrary she be not even young she be little by nature with as little flesh and blood as be consistent with mortal life and she be one of those who be always little for love the tongue find diminutive for she the heart keep she in a perpetual youth she be so modest and so gentle that she always come last so long as there be any one whom she could put before she but this little body and the soul which be not little and the heart which be big and great have know all the round of sorrow that fill a woman 's life without know any of its warmer blessing she have nurse the sick she have entertain the weary she have console the die she have go about the world which have no prize or recompense for she with a smile she little presence have be always bright she be not clever you might have say she have no mind at all but so wise and right and tender a heart that it be as good as genius this be to let you know what this little pilgrim have be she rise up and it be strange how like she feel to the child she remember in that still summer morning so many year ago she little body which have be worn and rack with pain feel as light and unconscious of itself as then she take she first step forward with the same sense of pleasure yet of awe suppress delight and daring and wild adventure yet perfect safety but then the recollection of the little room in which she have fall asleep come quickly strangely over she confusing she mind i must be dream i suppose she say to herself regretfully for it be all so sweet that she wish it to be true she movement call she attention to herself and she find that she be dress not in she night-dress as she have lie down but in a dress she do not know she pause for a moment to look at it and wonder she have never see it before she do not make out how it be make or what stuff it be but it fall so pleasantly about she it be so soft and light that in she confused state she abandon that subject with only a additional sense of pleasure and now the atmosphere become more distinct to she she see that under she foot be a greenness as of close velvet turf both cool and warm cool and soft to touch but with no damp in it as might have be at that early hour and with flower show here and there she stand look round she not able to identify the landscape because she be still confuse a little and then walk softly on all the time afraid lest she should awake and lose the sweetness of it all and the sense of rest and happiness she feel so light so airy as if she could skim across the field like any child it be bliss enough to breathe and move with every organ so free after more than fifty year of hard service in the world to feel like this even in a dream she smile to herself at she own pleasure and then once more yet more potently there come back upon she the appearance of she room in which she have fall asleep how have she get from there to here have she be carry away in she sleep or be it only a dream and would she by and by find herself between the four dim wall again then this shadow of recollection fade away once more and she move forward walk in a soft rapture over the delicious turf presently she come to a little mound upon which she pause to look about she every moment she see a little farther : blue hill far away extend in long sweet distance a indefinite landscape but fair and vast so that there could be see no end to it not even the line of the horizon -- save at one side where there seem to be a great shadowy gateway and something dim beyond she turn from the brightness to look at this and when she have look for some time she see what please she still more though she have be so happy before people come in they be too far off for she to see clearly but many come each apart one figure only at a time to watch they amuse she in the delightful leisure of she mind who be they she wonder but no doubt soon some of they would come this way and she would see then suddenly she seem to hear as if in answer to she question some one say those who be come in be the people who have die on earth die she say to herself aloud with a wonder sense of the inappropriateness of the word which almost come the length of laughter in this sweet air with such a sense of life about to suggest such a idea be almost ludicrous she be so occupy with this that she do not look round to see who the speaker might be she think it over amuse but with some new confusion of the mind then she say perhaps i have die too with a laugh to herself at the absurdity of the thought yes say the other voice echo that gentle laugh of hers you have die too she turn round and see another standing by she a woman younger and fairer and more stately than herself but of so sweet a countenance that we little pilgrim feel no shyness but recognize a friend at once she be more occupied look at this new face and feeling herself at once so much happier -lrb- though she have be so happy before -rrb- in find a companion who would tell she what everything be than in consider what these word might mean but just then once more the recollection of the four wall with they little picture hang and the window with its curtain draw seem to come round she for a moment so that she whole soul be in a confusion and as this vision slowly fade away -lrb- though she could not tell which be the vision the darkened room or this lovely light -rrb- she attention come back to the word at which she have laugh and at which the other have laugh as she repeat they die -- be it possible that this could be the meaning of it all die she say look with wonder in she companion 's face which smile back to she but do you mean -- you can not mean -- i have never be so well : i be so strong : i have no trouble -- anywhere : i be full of life the other nod she beautiful head with a more beautiful smile and the little pilgrim burst out in a great cry of joy and say -- be this all be it over -- be it all over be it possible that this can be all be you afraid of it the other say there be a little agitation for the moment in she heart she be so glad so relieved and thankful that it take away she breath she could not get over the wonder of it to think one should look forward to it so long and wonder and be even unhappy try to divine what it will be -- and this all ah but the angel be very gentle with you say the young woman you be so tender and worn that he only smile and take you sleep there be other way but it be always wonderful to think it be over as you say the little pilgrim could do nothing but talk of it as one do after a very great event be you sure quite sure it be so she say it would be dreadful to find it only a dream to go to sleep again and wake up -- there -- this thought trouble she for a moment the vision of the bedchamber come back but this time she feel it be only a vision be you afraid too she say in a low voice i never think of it at all the beautiful stranger say i do not think it would come to I but i be very sorry for the other to whom it come and grudge that they should lose the beautiful earth and life and all that be so sweet my dear cry the pilgrim as if she have never die oh but this be far sweeter and the heart be so light and it be happiness only to breathe be it heaven here it must be heaven i do not know if it be heaven we have so many thing to learn they can not tell you every thing at once say the beautiful lady i have see some of the people i be sorry for and when i tell they we laugh -- as you and i laugh just now -- for pleasure that make I think say the little pilgrim if i have die as you say -- which be so strange and I so live -- if i have die they will have find it out the house will be all dark and they will be break they heart oh how could i forget they in my selfishness and be happy i so light-hearted while they -- she sit down hastily and cover she face with she hand and weep the other look at she for a moment then kiss she for comfort and cry too the two happy creature sit there weep together think of those they have leave behind with a exquisite grief which be not unhappiness which be sweet with love and pity and oh say the little pilgrim what can we do to tell they not to grieve can not you send can not you speak can not one go to tell they the heavenly stranger shake she head it be not well they all say sometimes one have be permit but they do not know you she say with a pitiful look in she sweet eye my mother tell I that she heart be so sick for I she be allow to go and she go and stand by I and speak to I and i do not know she she come back so sad and sorry that they take she at once to we father and there you know she find that it be all well all be well when you be there ah say the little pilgrim i have be think of other thing of how happy i be and of _ they _ but never of the father -- just as if i have not die the other smile upon she with a wonderful smile do you think he will be offend -- we father -- as if he be one of we she say and then the little pilgrim in she sudden grief to have forget he become conscious of a new rapture unexplainable in word she feel he understanding to envelop she little spirit with a soft and clear penetration and that nothing she do or say could ever be misconceive more will you take I to he she say tremble yet glad clasp she hand and once again the other shake she head they will take we both when it be time she say : we do not go at we own will but i have see we brother -- oh take I to he the little pilgrim cry let I see he face i have so many thing to say to he i want to ask he -- oh take I to where i can see he face and then once again the heavenly lady smile i have see he she say he be always about -- now here now there he will come and see you perhaps when you be not think but when he please we do not think here of what we will -- the little pilgrim sit very still wonder at all this she have think when a soul leave the earth that it go at once to god and thought of nothing more except worship and singing of praise but this be different from she thought she sit and ponder and wonder she be baffle at many point she be not change as she expect but so much like herself still -- still perplexed and feeling herself foolish not understanding : toiling after a something which she could not grasp the only difference be that it be no trouble to she now she smile at herself and at she dullness feeling sure that by and by she would understand and do not you wonder too she say to she companion which be a speech such as she use to make upon the earth when people think she little remark disjointed and do not always see the connection of they but she friend of heaven know what she mean i do nothing but wonder she say for it be all so natural not what we think be it long since you have be here the pilgrim say i come before you but how long or how short i can not tell for that be not how we count we count only by what happen to we and nothing yet have happen to I except that i have see we brother my mother see he always that mean she have live here a long time and well -- be it possible to live ill -- in heaven the little pilgrim 's eye grow large as if they be go to have tear in they and a little shadow seem to come over she but the other laugh softly and restore all she confidence i have tell you i do not know if it be heaven or not no one do ill but some do little and some do much just as it use to be do you remember in dante there be a lazy spirit that stay about the gate and never get farther but perhaps you never read that i be not clever say the little pilgrim wistfully no i never read it i wish i have know more upon which the beautiful lady kiss she again to give she courage and say -- it do not matter at all it all come to you whether you have know it or not then you mother come here long ago say the pilgrim ah then i shall see my mother too oh very soon as soon as she can come but there be so many thing to do sometimes we can go and meet those who be come but it be not always so i remember that she have a message she could not leave she business you may be sure or she would have be here then you know my mother oh and my dearest father too we all know each other the lady say with a smile and you do you come to meet I -- only out of kindness though i do not know you the little pilgrim say i be nothing but a idler say the beautiful lady make acquaintance i be of little use as yet i be very hard work before i come here and they think it well that we should sit in the sun and take a little rest and find thing out then the little pilgrim sit still and muse and feel in she heart that she have find many thing out what she have hear have be wonderful and it be more wonderful still to be sit here all alone save for this lady yet so happy and at ease she want to sing she be so happy but remember that she be old and have lose she voice and then remember again that she be no longer old and perhaps have find it again and then it occur to she to remember how she have learn to sing and how beautiful she sister 's voice be and how heavenly to hear she -- which make she remember that this dear sister would be weep not sing down where she have come from and immediately the tear stand in she eye oh she say i never think we should cry when we come here i think there be no tear in heaven do you think then that we be all turn into stone cry the beautiful lady it say god shall wipe away all tear from we face which be not like say there be to be no tear upon which the little pilgrim glad that it be permit to be sorry though she be so happy allow herself to think upon the place she have so lately leave and she seem to see she little room again with all the picture hang as she have leave they and the house darken and the dear face she know all sad and troubled and to hear they say over to each other all the little careless word she have say as if they be out of the scripture and cry if any one but mention she name and put on crape and black dress and lament as if that which have happen be something very terrible she cry at this and yet feel half inclined to laugh but would not because it would be disrespectful to those she love one thing do not occur to she and that be that they would be carry she body which she have leave behind she away to the grave she do not think of this because she be not aware of the loss and feel far too much herself to think that there be another part of she be bury in the ground from this she be arouse by she companion ask she a question have you leave many there she say no one say the little pilgrim to whom i be the first on earth but they love I all the same and if i could only only let they know -- but i leave one to whom i be the first on earth say the other with tear in she beautiful eye and oh how glad i should be to be less happy if he might be less sad and you can not go you can not go to he and tell he oh i wish cry the little pilgrim but then she pause for the wish die all away in she heart into a tender love for this poor sorrowful man whom she do not know this give she the sweetest pang she have ever feel for she know that all be well and yet be so sorry and would have willingly give up she happiness for he all this the lady read in she eye or she heart and love she for it and they take hand and be silent together think of those they have leave as we upon earth think of those who have go from we but only with far more understanding and far greater love and have you never be able to do anything for he we pilgrim say then the beautiful lady 's face flush all over with the most heavenly warmth and light she smile run over like the burst out of the sun oh i will tell you she say there be a moment when he be very sad and perplexed not know what to think there be something he could not understand nor could i understand nor do i know what it be until it be say to I ` you may go and tell he ' and i go in the early morning before he be awake and kiss he and say it in he ear he wake up in a moment and understand and everything be clear to he afterward i hear he say ` it be true that the night bring counsel i have be trouble and distressed all day long but in the morning it be quite clear to I ' and the other answer ` you brain be refresh and that make you judgment clear ' but they never know it be i that be a great delight the dear soul they be so foolish she cry with the sweetest laughter that run into tear one cry because one be so happy it be just a silly old habit she say and you be not grieve -- it do not hurt you -- that he do not know -- oh not then not then i do not go to he for that when you have be here a little longer you will see the difference when you go for yourself out of impatience because it still seem to you that you must know best and they do not know you then it strike to you heart but when you go to help they -- ah she cry when he come how much i shall have to tell he ` you think it be sleep when it be i when you wake so fresh and clear it be i that kiss you you think it you duty to I to be sad afterward and be angry with yourself because you have wrong I of the first thought of you waking -- when it be all I all through ' i begin to understand say the little pilgrim but why should they not see we and why should not we tell they it would seem so natural if they see we it would make they so happy and so sure upon this the lady shake she head the worst of it be not that they be not sure it be the parting if this make we sorry here how can they escape the sorrow of it even if they see we -- for we must be part we can not go back to live with they or why should we have die and then we must all live we life they in they way we in ours we must not weigh they down but only help they when it be see that there be need for it all this we shall know better by and by you make it so clear and you face be so bright say we little pilgrim gratefully you must have know a great deal and understand even when you be in the world i be as foolish as i could be say the other with she laugh that be as sweet as music yet think i know and they think i know but all that do not matter now i think it matter for look how much you have show I but tell I one thing more : how be it say to you that you must go and tell he be it some one who speak be it -- she face grow so bright that all the past brightness be as a dull sky to this it give out such a light of happiness that the little pilgrim be dazzle i be wander about she say to see this new place my mother have come back between two errand she have and have come to see I and tell I everything and i be stray about wonder what i be to do when suddenly i see some one come along as it might be now -- she pause and look up and the little pilgrim look up too with she heart beating but there be no one then she give a little sigh and turn and listen again i have not be look for he or think you know my mind be too light i be please with whatever be before I and i be so curious for my mother have tell I many thing when suddenly i catch sight of he pass by he be go on and when i see this a panic seize I lest he should pass and say nothing i do not know what i do i flung myself upon he robe and get hold of it -- or at least i think so i be in such a agony lest he should pass and never notice I but that be my folly he pass as if that could be and what do he say to you cry the little pilgrim she heart almost ache it beat so high with sympathy and expectation the lady look at she for a little without say anything i can not tell you she say any more than i can tell if this be heaven it be a mystery when you see he you will know it will be all you have ever hope for and more besides for he understand everything he know what be in we heart about those we have leave and why he send for we before they there be no need to tell he anything he know he will come when it be time and after you have see he you will know what to do then the beautiful lady turn she eye toward the gate and while the little pilgrim be still gaze disappear from she and go to comfort some other stranger they be dear friend always and meet often but not again in the same way when she be thus leave alone again the little pilgrim sit still upon the grassy mound quite tranquil and happy without wish to move there be such a sense of well-being in she that she like to sit there and look about she and breathe the delightful air like the air of a summer morning without wish for anything how idle i be she say to herself in the very word she have often use before she die but then she be idle from weakness and now from happiness she want for nothing to be alive be so sweet there be a great deal to think about in what she have hear but she do not even think about that only resigned herself to the delight of sit there in the sweet air and be happy many people be come and go and they all know she and smile upon she and those who be at a distance would wave they hand this do not surprise she at all for though she be a stranger she too feel that she know they all but that they should be so kind be a delight to she which word could not tell she sit and muse very sweetly about all that have be tell she and wonder whether she too might go sometimes and with a kiss and a whisper clear up something that be dark in the mind of some one who love she i that never be clever she say to herself with a smile and chiefly she think of a friend whom she love who be often in great perplexity and do not know how to guide herself amid the difficulty of the world the little pilgrim half laugh with delight and then half cry with longing to go as the beautiful lady have do and make something clear that have be dark before to this friend as she be think what a pleasure it would be some one come up to she cross over the flowery greenness leave the path on purpose this be a be younger than the lady who have speak to she before with flow hair all crisp with touch of sunshine and a dress all white and soft like the feather of a white dive there be something in she face different from that of the other by which the little pilgrim know somehow without know how that she have come here as a child and grow up in this celestial place she be tall and fair and come along with so musical a motion as if she foot scarcely touch the ground that she might have have wing : and the little pilgrim indeed be not sure as she watch whether it might not perhaps be a angel for she know that there be angel among the bless people who be come and go about but have not be able yet to find one out she know that this new-comer be come to she and turn towards she with a smile and a throb at she heart of expectation but when the heavenly maiden draw nearer she face though it be so fair look to the pilgrim like another face which she have know very well -- indeed like the homely and troubled face of the friend of whom she have be think and so she smile all the more and hold out she hand and say i be sure i know you upon which the other kiss she and say we all know each other but i have see you often before you come here and kneel down by she among the flower that be grow just in front of some tall lily that grow over she and make a lovely canopy over she head there be something in she face that be like a child : she mouth so soft as if it have never speak anything but heavenly word she eye brown and golden as if they be fill with light she take the little pilgrim 's hand in hers and hold they and smooth they between she own these hand have be very thin and worn before but now when the pilgrim look at they she see that they become softer and whiter every moment with the touch of this immortal youth i know you be come say the maiden when my mother have want I i have see you there and you be think of she now that be how i find you do you know then what one think say the little pilgrim with wonder eye it be in the air and when it concern we it come to we like the breeze but we who be the child here we feel it more quickly than you be you a child say the little pilgrim or be you a angel sometimes you be like a child but then you face shine and you be like -- you must have some name for it here there be nothing among the word i know and then she pause a little still look at she and cry oh if she could but see you little margaret that would do she most good of all then the maiden margaret shake she lovely head what do she most good be the will of the father she say at this the little pilgrim feel once more that thrill of expectation and awe oh child you have see he she cry and the other smile have you forget who they be that always behold he face we have never have any fear or tremble we be not angel and there be no other name we be the child there be something give to we beyond the other we have have no other home oh tell I tell I the little pilgrim cry upon this margaret kiss she put she soft cheek against hers and say it be a mystery it can not be put into word in you time you will know when you touch I you change I and i grow like you the pilgrim say ah if she could see we together you and I and will you go to she soon again and do you see they always what they be do and take care of they it be we father who take care of they and we lord who be we brother i do he errand when i be able sometimes he will let I go sometimes another accord as it be best who be i that i should take care of they i serve they when i may but you do not forget they the pilgrim say with wistful eye we love they always say margaret she be more still than the lady who have first speak with the pilgrim she countenance be full of a heavenly calm it have never know passion nor anguish sometimes there be in it a far-seeing look of vision sometimes the simplicity of a child but what be we in comparison for he love they more than we do when he keep we from they it be for love we must each live we own life but it be hard for they sometimes say the little pilgrim who could not withdraw she thought from those she have leave they be never forsake say the angel maiden but oh there be worse thing than sorrow the little pilgrim say there be wrong there be evil margaret will not he send you to step in before they to save they from wrong it be not for we to judge say the young margaret with eye full of heavenly wisdom we brother have it all in he hand we do not read they heart like he sometimes you be permit to see the battle -- the little pilgrim cover she eye with she hand i could not -- i could not unless i know they be to win the day they will win the day in the end but sometimes when it be be lose i have see in he face a something -- i can not tell -- more love than before something that seem to say ` my child my child would that i could do it for thee my child ' oh that be what i have always feel cry the pilgrim clasp she hand she eye be dim she heart for a moment almost forget its blessedness but he could oh little margaret he could you have forget ` lord if thou wilt thou canst -- ' the child of heaven look at she mutely with sweet grave eye in which there be much that confuse she who be a stranger here and once more softly shake she head be it that he will not then say the other with a low voice of awe we lord who die -- he -- listen say the other i hear he step on the way the little pilgrim rise up from the mound on which she be sit she soul be confuse with wonder and fear she have think that a angel might step between a soul on earth and sin and that if one but pray and pray the dear lord would stand between and deliver the tempt she have mean when she see he face to ask he to save be not he bear do not he live and die to save the angel maiden look at she all the while with eye that understand all she perplexity and she doubt but speak not thus it be that before the lord come to she the sweetness of she first blessedness be obscure and she find that here too even here though in a moment she should see he there be need for faith young margaret who have be kneel by she rise up too and stand among the lily wait she soft countenance shine she eye turn towards he who be come upon she there be no cloud nor doubt she be one of the child of that land familiar with he presence and in the air there be a sound such as those who hear it alone can describe -- a sound as of help come and safety like the sound of a deliverer when one be in deadly danger like the sound of a conqueror like the step of the dearest beloved come home as it come nearer the fear melt away out of the beating heart of the pilgrim who could fear so near he she breath go away from she she heart out of she bosom to meet he come oh never fear could live where he be she soul be all confused but it be with hope and joy she hold out she hand in that amaze and drop upon she knee not know what she do he be go about he father 's business not linger yet neither make haste and the calm and peace which the little pilgrim have see in the face of the bless be but reflection from the majestic gentleness of the countenance to which all quiver with happiness and wonder she lift up she eye many thing there have be in she mind to say to he she want to ask for those she love some thing which perhaps he have overlook she want to say send I it seem to she that here be the occasion she have long for all she life oh how many time have she wish to be able to go to he to fall at he foot to show he something which have be leave undo something which perhaps for she ask he would remember to do but when this dream of she life be fulfil and the little pilgrim kneel and all shake and tremble with devotion and joy be at he foot lift she face to he see he hear he -- then she say nothing to he at all she no longer want to say anything or want anything except what he choose or have power to think of anything except that all be well and everything -- everything as it should be in he hand it seem to she that all that she have ever hope for be fulfil when she meet the look in he eye at first it seem too bright for she to meet but next moment she know it be all that be need to light up the world and in it everything be clear she tremble cease she little frame grow inspire though she still kneel she head rise erect draw to he like the flower to the sun she could not tell how long it be nor what be say nor if it be in word all that she know be that she tell he all that ever she have think or wish or intend in all she life although she say nothing at all and that he open all thing to she and show she that everything be well and no one forget and that the thing she would have tell he of be more near he heart than hers and those to whom she want to be send be in he own hand but whether this pass with word or without word she could not tell she soul expand under he eye like a flower it open out it comprehend and feel and know she smite she hand together in she wonder that she could have miss see what be so clear and laugh with a sweet scorn at she folly as two people who love each other laugh at the little misunderstanding that have part they she be bold with he though she be so timid by nature and venture to laugh at herself not to reproach herself for he divine eye speak no blame but smile upon she folly too and then he lay a hand upon she head which seem to fill she with current of strength and joy run through all she vein and then she seem to come to herself say loud out and that i will and that i will and lo she be kneel on the warm soft sod alone and hear the sound of he footstep as he go about he father 's business fill all the air with echo of blessing and all the people who be come and go smile upon she and she know they be all glad for she that she have see he and get the desire of she heart some of they wave they hand as they pass and some pause a moment and speak to she with tender congratulation they seem to have the tear in they eye for joy remember every one the first time they have themselves see he and the joy of it so that all about there sound a concord of happy thought all echo to each other she have see the lord why do she say and that i will and that i will with such fervor and delight she could not have tell but yet she know the first thing be that she have yet to wait and believe until all thing should be accomplish neither doubt nor fear but know that all should be well and the second be that she must delay no longer but rise up and serve the father accord to what be give she as she reward when she have recover a little of she rapture she rise from she knee and stand still for a little to be sure which way she be to go and she be not aware what guide she but yet turn she face in the appoint way without any doubt for doubt be now go away forever and that fear that once give she so much trouble lest she might not be do what be best as she move along she wonder at herself more and more she feel no longer as at first like the child she remember to have be venture out in the awful lovely stillness of the morning before any one be awake but she feel that to move along be a delight and that she foot scarcely touch the grass and she whole be be instinct with such lightness of strength and life that it do not matter to she how far she go nor what she carry nor if the way be easy or hard the way she choose be one of those which lead to the great gate and many meet she come from thence with look that be somewhat bewildered as if they do not yet know whither they be go or what have happen to they -- upon whom she smile as she pass they with soft look of tenderness and sympathy know what they be feel but do not stop to explain to they because she have something else that have be give she to do for this be what always follow in that country when you meet the lord that you instantly know what it be that he would have you do the little pilgrim thus go on and on toward the gate which she have not see when she herself come through it have be lift in he arm by the great death angel and set down softly inside so that she do not know it or even the shadow of it as she draw nearer the light become less bright though very sweet like a lovely dawn and she wonder to herself to think that she have be here but a moment ago and yet so much have pass since then and still she be not aware what be she errand but wonder if she be to go back by these same gate and perhaps return where she have be she go up to they very closely for she be curious to see the place through which she have come in she sleep -- as a traveller go back to see the city gate with its bridge and portcullis through which he have pass by night the gate be very great of a wonderful curious architecture have strange delicate arch and canopy above some part of they seem cut very clean and clear but the outline be all soften with a sort of mist and shadow so that it look greater and higher than it be the lower part be not one great doorway as the pilgrim have suppose but have innumerable door all separate and very narrow so that but one could pass at a time though the arch inclose all and seem fill with great folding gate in which the smaller door be set so that if need arise a vast opening might be make for many to enter of the little door many be shut as the pilgrim approach but from moment to moment one after another would be push softly open from without and some one would come in the little pilgrim look at it all with great interest wonder which of the door she herself have come by but while she stand absorb by this a door be suddenly push open close by she and some one flung forward into the bless country fall upon the ground and stretch out wild arm as though to clutch the very soil this sight give the pilgrim a great surprise for it be the first time she have hear any sound of pain or see any sight of trouble since she enter here in that moment she know what it be that the dear lord have give she to do she have no need to pause to think for she heart tell she and she do not hesitate as she might have do in the other life not know what to say she go forward and gather this poor creature into she arm as if it have be a child and draw she quite within the land of peace for she have fall across the threshold so as to hinder any one enter who might be come after she it be a woman and she have fling herself upon she face so that it be difficult for the little pilgrim to see what manner of person it be for though she feel herself strong enough to take up this new-comer in she arm and carry she away yet she forbear see the will of the stranger be not so for some time this woman lay moan with now and then a great sob shake she as she lay the little pilgrim have take she by both she arm and draw she head to rest upon she own lap and be still hold the hand which the poor creature have throw out as if to clutch the ground thus she lay for a little while as the little pilgrim remember she herself have lie not wish to move wonder what have happen to she then she clutch the hand which grasp she and say muttering -- you be some one new have you come to save I oh save I oh save I do not let I die this be very strange to the little pilgrim and go to she heart she soothe the stranger hold she hand warm and light and stoop over she dear she say you must try and not be afraid you say so say the woman because you be well and strong you do not know what it be to be seize in the middle of you life and tell that you have get to die oh i have be a sinful creature i be not fit to die can not you give I something that will cure I what be the good of doctor and nurse if they can not save a poor soul that be not fit to die at this the little pilgrim smile upon she always hold she fast and say -- why be you so afraid to die the woman raise she head to see who it be who put such a strange question to she you be some one new she say i have never see you before be there any one that be not afraid to die would _ you _ like to have to give you account all in a moment without any time to prepare but you have have time to prepare say the pilgrim oh only a very very little time and i never think it be true i be not a old woman and i be not fit to die and i be poor oh if i be rich i would bribe you to give I something to keep I alive will not you do it for pity -- will not you do it for pity when you be as bad as i be oh you will perhaps call for some one to help you and find nobody like I i will help you for love say the little pilgrim some one who love you have send I the woman lift herself up a little and shake she head there be nobody that love I then she cast she eye round she and begin to tremble again -lrb- for the touch of the little pilgrim have still she -rrb- oh where be i she say they have take I away they have bring I to a strange place and you be new oh where have they take I -- where be i -- where be i she cry have they bring I here to die then the little pilgrim bent over she and soothe she you must not be so much afraid of die that be all over you need not fear that any more she say softly for here where you now be we have all die the woman start up out of she arm and then she give a great shriek that make the air ring and cry out dead be i dead with a shudder and convulsion throw herself again wildly with outstretched hand upon the ground this be a great and terrible work for the little pilgrim -- the first she have ever have to do -- and she heart fail she for a moment but afterward she remember we brother who send she and know what be best she draw closer to the new-comer and take she hand again try she say in a soft voice and think a little do you feel now so ill as you be do not be frightened but think a little i will hold you hand and look at I you be not afraid of I the poor creature shudder again and then she turn she face and look doubtfully with great dark eye dilate and the brow and cheek so curved and puckered round they that they seem to glow out of deep cavern she face be full of anguish and fear but as she look at the little pilgrim she troubled gaze soften of she own accord she clasp she other hand upon the one that hold hers and then she say with a gasp -- i be not afraid of you that be not true that you say you be one of the sister and you want to frighten I and make I repent you do repent the pilgrim say oh cry the poor woman what have the like of you to do with I now i look at you i never see any one that be like you before do not you hate I -- do not you loathe I i do myself it be so ugly to go wrong i think now i would almost rather die and be do with it you will say that be because i be go to get better i feel a great deal better now do you think i be go to get over it oh i be better i could get up out of bed and walk about yes but i be not in bed -- where have you bring I never mind it be a fine air i shall soon get well here the pilgrim be silent for a little hold she hand and then she say -- tell I how you feel now in she soft voice the woman have sit up and be gaze round she it be very strange she say it be all confused i think upon my mother and the old prayer i use to say for a long long time i always say my prayer but now i have get harden they say oh i be once as fresh as any one it all come over I now i feel as if i be young again -- just come out of the country i be sure that i could walk the little pilgrim raise she up hold she by she hand and she stand and gaze round about she make one or two doubtful step she be very pale and the light be dim she eye peer into it with a scared yet eager look she make another step then stop again i be quite well she say i could walk a mile i could walk any distance what be that you say oh i tell you i be better i be not go to die you will never never die say the little pilgrim be you not glad it be all over oh i be so glad and all the more you should be glad if you be so much afraid but this woman be not glad she shrink away from she companion then come close to she again and grip she with she hand it be you -- fun she say or just to frighten I perhaps you think it will do I no harm as i be get so well you want to frighten I to make I good but i mean to be good without that -- i do -- i do when one be so near die as i have be and yet get better -- for i be go to get better yes you know it as well as i the little pilgrim make no reply but stand by look at she charge not feel that anything be give she to say -- and she be so new to this work that there be a little tremble in she lest she should not do everything as she ought and the woman look round with those anxious eye gaze all about the light do not brighten as it have do when the pilgrim herself first come to this place for one thing they have remain quite close to the gate which no doubt throw a shadow the woman look at that and then turn and look into the dim morning and do not know where she be and she heart be confuse and trouble where be we she say i do not know where it be they must have bring I here in my sleep -- where be we how strange to bring a sick woman away out of she room in she sleep i suppose it be the new doctor she go on look very closely in the little pilgrim 's face then pause and draw a long breath say softly it have do I good it be better air -- it be -- a new kind of cure but though she speak like this she do not convince herself she eye be wild with wonder and fear she grip the pilgrim 's arm more and more closely and tremble lean upon she why do not you speak to I she say why do not you tell I oh i do not know how to live in this place what do you do -- how do you speak i be not fit for it and what be you i never see you before nor any one like you what do you want with I why be you so kind to I why -- why -- and here she go off into a murmur of question why why always hold fast by the little pilgrim always gaze round she groping as it be in the dimness with she great eye i have come because we dear lord who be we brother send I to meet you and because i love you the little pilgrim say love I the woman cry throw up she hand but no one love I i have not deserve it here she grasp she close again with a sudden clutch and cry out if this be what you say where be god be you afraid of he the little pilgrim say upon which the woman tremble so that the pilgrim tremble too with the quiver of she frame then loose she hold and fall upon she face and cry -- hide I hide I i have be a great sinner hide I that he may not see I and with one hand she try to draw the pilgrim 's dress as a veil between she and something she fear how should i hide you from he who be everywhere and why should i hide you from you father the little pilgrim say this she say almost with indignation wonder that any one could put more trust in she who be no better than a child than in the father of all but then she say look into you heart and you will see you be not so much afraid as you think this be how you have be accustom to frighten yourself but now look into you heart you think you be very ill at first but not now and you think you be afraid but look into you heart -- there be a silence and then the woman raise she head with a wonderful look in which there be amazement and doubt as if she have hear some joyful thing but dare not yet believe that it be true once more she hide she face in she hand and once more raise it again she eye soften a long sigh or gasp like one take breath after drown shake she breast then she say i think -- that be true but if i be not afraid it be because i be -- bad it be because i be harden oh should not i fear he who can send I away into -- the lake that burn -- into the pit -- and here she give a great cry but hold the little pilgrim all the while with she eye which seem to plead and ask for better news then there come into the pilgrim 's heart what to say and she take the woman 's hand again and hold it between she own that be the change she say that come when we come here we be not afraid any more of we father we be not all happy perhaps you will not be happy at first but if he say to you ` go ' -- even to that place you speak of -- you will know that it be well and you will not be afraid you be not afraid now -- oh i can see it in you eye you be not happy but you be not afraid you know it be the father do not say god -- that be far off -- father say the little pilgrim hold up the woman 's hand clasp in she own and there come into she soul a ecstasy and tear that be tear of blessedness fall from she eye and all about she there seem to shine a light when she come to herself the woman who be she charge have come quite close to she and have add she other hand to that the pilgrim hold and be weep and say i be not afraid with now and then a gasp and sob like a child who after a passion of tear have be console yet go on sob and can not quite forget and be afraid to own that all be well again then the pilgrim kiss she and bid she rest a little for even she herself feel shake and long for a little quiet and to feel the true sense of the peace that be in she heart she sit down beside she upon the ground and make she lean she head against she shoulder and thus they remain very still for a little time say no more it seem to the little pilgrim that she companion have fall asleep and perhaps it be so after so much agitation all this time there have be people pass enter by the many door and most of they pause a little to see where they be and look round they then go on and it seem to the little pilgrim that accord to the door by which they enter each take a different way while she watch another come in by the same door as that at which the woman who be she charge have come in and he too stumble and look about he with a air of great wonder and doubt when he see she seat on the ground he come up to she hesitating as one in a strange place who do not want to betray that he be bewildered and have lose he way he come with a little pretence of smile though he countenance be pale and scared and say draw he breath quick i ought to know where i be but i have lose my head i think will you tell I which be -- the way what way cry the little pilgrim for she strength be go from she and she have no word to say to he he look at she with that bewilderment on he face and say i find myself strange strange i ought to know where i be but it be scarcely daylight yet it be perhaps foolish to come out so early in the morning this he say in he confusion not know where he be nor what he say i think all the way lead to we father say the little pilgrim -lrb- though she have not know this till now -rrb- and the dear lord walk about they all here you never go astray upon this the stranger look at she and ask in a falter voice be you a angel still not know what he say oh no no i be only a pilgrim she reply may i sit by you a little say the man he sit down draw long breath as though he have go through great fatigue and look about with wonder eye you will wonder but i do not know where i be he say i feel as if i must he dream this be not where i expect to come i look for something very different do you think there can have be any -- mistake oh never that she say there be no mistake here then he look at she again and say -- i perceive that you belong to this country though you say you be a pilgrim i should be grateful if you would tell I do one live -- here and be this all be there no -- no -- but i do not know what word to use all be so strange different from what i expect do you know that you have die yes -- yes i be quite acquaint with that he say hurriedly as if it have be a idea he dislike to dwell upon but then i expect -- be there no one to tell you where to go or what you be to be or to take any notice of you the little pilgrim be startle by this tone she do not understand its meaning and she have not any word to say to he she look at he with as much bewilderment as he have show when he approach she and reply falter -- there be a great many people here but i have never hear if there be any one to tell you -- what do it matter how many people there be if you know none of they he say we all know each other she answer he but then pause and hesitate a little because this be what have be say to she and of herself she be not assure of it neither do she know at all how to deal with this stranger to whom she have not any commission it seem that he have no one to care for he and the little pilgrim have a sense of compassion yet of trouble in she heart for what could she say and it be very strange to she to see one who be not content here ah but there should be some one to point out the way and tell we which be we circle and where we ought to go he say and then he too be silent for a while look about he as all be fain to do on they first arrival finding everything so strange there be people come in at every moment and some be meet at the very threshold and some go away alone with peaceful face and there be many group about talk together in soft voice but no one interrupt the other and though so many be there each voice be as clear as if it have speak alone and there be no tumult of sound as when many people assemble together in the lower world the little pilgrim wonder to find herself with the woman rest upon she on one side and the man seat silent on the other neither have it appear any guide but only herself who know so little how be she to lead they in the path which she do not know -- and she be exhaust by the agitation of she struggle with the woman whom she feel to be she charge but in this moment of silence she have time to remember the face of the lord when he give she this commission and she heart be strengthen the man all this time sit and watch look eagerly all about he examine the face of those who go and come : and sometimes he make a little start as if to go and speak to some one he know but always draw back again and look at the little pilgrim as if he have say this be the one who will serve I best he speak to she again after a while and say i suppose you be one of the guide that show the way no say the little pilgrim anxiously i know so little it be not long since i come here i come in the early morning -- why it be morning now you could not come earlier than it be now you mean yesterday i think say the pilgrim that yesterday be the other side there be no yesterday here he look at she with the keen look he have to understand she the better and then he say -- no division of time i think that must be monotonous it will be strange to have no night but i suppose one get use to everything i hope though there be something to do i have always live a very busy life perhaps this be just a little pause before we go -- to be -- to have -- to get we -- appoint place he have a uneasy look as he say this and look at she with a anxious curiosity which the little pilgrim do not understand i do not know she say softly shake she head i have so little experience i have not be tell of a appoint place the man look at she very strangely i do not think he say that i should have find such ignorance here be it not well know that we must all appear before the judgment-seat of god there word seem to cause a tremble on the still air and the woman on the other side raise herself suddenly up clasp she hand and some of those who have just enter hear the word and come and crowd about the little pilgrim some stand some fall down upon they knee all with they face turn towards she she who have always be so simple and small so little used to teach she be frighten with the sight of all these stranger crowd hang upon she lip look to she for knowledge she know not what to do or what to say the tear come into she eye oh she say i do not know anything about a judgment-seat i know that we father be here and that when we be in trouble we be take to he to be comfort and that we dear lord we brother be among we every day and every one may see he listen she say stand up suddenly among they feel strong as a angel i have see he though i be nothing so little as you see and often silly never clever as some of you be i have see he and so will all of you there be no more that i know of she say softly clasp she hand when you see he it come into you heart what you must do and then there be a murmur of voice about she some say that be best and some wonder if that be all and some cry if he would but come now -- while the little pilgrim stand among they with she face shine and they all look at she ask she to tell they more to show they how to find he but this be far above what she could do for she too be not much more than a stranger and have little strength she would not go back a step nor desert those who be so anxious to know though she heart flutter almost as it have use to do before she die what with she longing to tell they and know that she have no more to say but in that land it be never permit that one who stand bravely and fail not shall be leave without succor for it be no longer needful there to stand even to death since all die be over and all soul be test when it be see that the little pilgrim be thus surround by so many that question she there suddenly come about she many other from the brightness out of which she have come who one go to one hand and one to another safely lead they into the way in which they course lay : so that the pilgrim be free to lead forth the woman who have be give she in charge and whose path lay in a dim but pleasant country outside of that light and gladness in which the pilgrim 's home be but she say you be not to fear or be cast down because he go likewise by these way and there be not a corner in all this land but he be to be see pass by and he will come and speak to you and lay he hand upon you and afterwards everything will be clear and you will know what you be to do stay with I till he come -- oh stay with I the woman cry cling to she arm unless another be send the little pilgrim say and it be nothing to she that the air be less bright there for she mind be full of light so that though she heart still flutter a little with all that have pass she have no longing to return nor to shorten the way but go by the lower road sweetly with the stranger hanging upon she who be stronger and taller than she thus they go on and the pilgrim tell she all she know and everything that come into she heart and so full be she of the great thing she have to say that it be a surprise to she and leave she tremble when suddenly the woman take away she clinging hand and fly forward with arm out-spread and a cry of joy the little pilgrim stand still to see and on the path before they be a child come towards they singing with a look such as be never see but upon the face of child who have come here early and who behold the face of the father and have never know fear nor sorrow the woman fly and fall at the child 's foot and he put he hand upon she and raise she up and call she mother then he smile upon the little pilgrim and lead she away now she need I no longer say the pilgrim and it be a surprise to she and for a moment she wonder in herself if it be know that this child should come so suddenly and she work be over and also how she be to return again to the sweet place among the flower from which she have come but when she turn to look if there be any way she find one standing by such as she have not yet see this be a youth with a face just touch with manhood as at the moment when the boy end when all be still fresh and pure in the heart but he be taller and greater than a man i be send he say little sister to take you to the father because you have be very faithful and go beyond you strength and he take the little pilgrim by the hand and she know he be a angel and immediately the sweet air melt about they into light and a hush come upon she of all think and all sense attend till she should receive the blessing and she new name and see what be beyond tell and hear and understand ii the little pilgrim go up higher when the little pilgrim come out of the presence of the father she find herself in the street of a great city but what she see and hear when she be with he it be not give to the tongue of mortal to say for it be beyond word and beyond even think as the mystery of love be not to be speak but to be feel even in the lower earth so but much less be that great mystery of the love of the father to be express in sound the little pilgrim be very happy when she go into that sacred place but there be a great awe upon she and it might even be say that she be afraid but when she come out again she fear nothing but look with clear eye upon all she see love they but no more overawe by they have see that which be above all when she come forth again to she common life -- for it be not permit save for those who have attain the greatest height to dwell there -- she have no longer need of any guide but come alone know where to go and walk where it please she with reverence and a great delight in see and know all that be around but no fear it be a great city but it be not like the great city which she have see she understand as she pass along how it be that those who have be dazzle but by a pass glance have describe the wall and the pavement as gold they be like what gold be beautiful and clear of a lovely color but softer in tone than metal ever be and as cool and fresh to walk upon and to touch as if they have be velvet grass the building be all beautiful of every style and form that it be possible to think of yet in great harmony as if every man have follow he own taste yet all have be so combined and group by the master architect that each individual feature enhance the effect of the rest some of the house be greater and some smaller but all of they be rich in carving and picture and lovely decoration and the effect be as if the richest material have be employ marble and beautiful sculptured stone and wood of beautiful tint though the little pilgrim know that these be not like the marble and stone she have once know but heavenly representative of they far better than they there be people at work upon they build new house and make addition and a great many painter paint upon they the history of the people who live there or of other who be worthy that commemoration and the street be full of pleasant sound and of crowd go and come and the commotion of much business and many thing to do and this movement and the brightness of the air and the wonderful thing that be to be see on every side make the pilgrim gay so that she could have sing with pleasure as she go along and all who meet she smile and every group exchange greeting as they pass along all know each other many of they as might be see have come there as she do to see the wonder of the beautiful city and all who live there be ready to tell they whatever they desire to know and show they the finest house and the greatest picture and this give a feeling of holiday and pleasure which be delightful beyond description for all the busy people about be full of sympathy with the stranger bid they welcome invite they into they house make the warmest fellowship and friend be meet continually on every side but the pilgrim have no sense that she be forlorn in be alone for all be friend and it please she to watch the other and see how one turn this way and one another every one finding something that delight he above all other thing she herself take a great pleasure in watch a painter who be stand upon a balcony a little way above she painting upon a great fresco : and when he see this he ask she to come up beside he and see he work she ask he a great many question about it and why it be that he be work only at the drapery of the figure and do not touch they face some of which be already finish and seem to be look at she as live as she be out of the wall while some be merely outline as yet he tell she that he be not a great painter to do this or to design the great work but that the master would come presently who have the chief responsibility for we have not all the same genius he say and if i be to paint this head it would not have the gift of life as that one have but to stand by and see he put it in you can not think what a happiness that be for one know every touch and just what effect it will have though one could not do it one 's self and it be a wonder and a delight perpetual that it should be do the little pilgrim look up at he and say that be very beautiful to say and do you never wish to be like he -- to make the lovely living face as well as the other part be not this lovely too he say and show she how he have just put in a billowy robe buoy out with the wind and sweep down from the shoulder of a stately figure in such free and graceful fold that she would have like to take it in she hand and feel the silken texture and then he tell she how absorb it be to study the mystery of color and the difference of light there be enough in that to make one happy he say it be think by some that we will all come to the higher point with work and thought : but that be not my feeling and whether it be so or not what do it matter for we father make no difference : and all of we be necessary to everything that be do : and it be almost more delight to see the master do it than to do it with one 's own hand for one thing you own work may rejoice you in you heart but always with a little tremble because it be never so perfect as you would have it -- whereas in you master 's work you have full content because he idea go beyond yours and as he make every touch you can feel ` that be right -- that be complete -- that be just as it ought to be ' do you understand what i mean he say turn to she with a smile i understand it perfectly she cry clasp she hand together with the delight of accord do not you think that be one of the thing that be so happy here you understand at half a word not everybody he say and smile upon she like a brother for we be not all alike even here be you a painter she say in -- in the other -- in the old time i be one of those that strive for the mastery and sometimes grudge -- we remember these thing at time he say gravely to make we more aware of the blessedness of be content it be long since then she say with some wistfulness upon which he smile again so long he say that we have wear out most of we link to the world below we have all come away and those who be after we for generation but you be a new-comer and be they all with you be you all -- together do you live -- as in the old time upon this the painter smile but not so brightly as before not as in the old time he say nor be they all here some be still upon the way and of some we have no certainty only news from time to time the angel be very good to we they never miss a occasion to bring we news for they go everywhere you know yes say the little pilgrim though indeed she have not know it till now but it seem to she as if it have come to she mind by nature and she have never need to be tell they be so tender-hearted the painter say and more than that they be very curious about man and woman they have know it all from the beginning and it be a wonder to they there be a friend of mine a angel who be more wise in man 's heart than any one i know and yet he will say to I sometimes ' i do not understand you -- you be wonderful ' they like to find out all we be think it be a endless pleasure to they just as it be to some of we to watch the people in the other world do you mean -- where we have come from say the little pilgrim not always there we in this city have be long separate from that country for all that we love be out of it but not here the little pilgrim cry again with a little sorrow -- a pang that she know be go to be put away -- in she heart but come come say the painter cheerfully and some be here before we and some have arrive since they be everywhere but some in trouble -- some in trouble she cry with the tear in she eye we suppose so he say gravely for some be in that place which once be call among we the place of despair you mean -- and though the little pilgrim have be make free of fear at that word which she would not speak she tremble and the light grow dim in she eye well say she new friend and what then the father see through and through it as he do here they can not escape he : so that there be love near they always i have a son he say then sigh a little but smile again who be there the little pilgrim at this clasp she hand with a piteous cry nay nay he say little sister my friend i be tell you of the angel bring I news of he just now indeed there be news of he through all the city do you not hear all the bell ring but perhaps that be before you come the angel who know I best come one after another to tell I and we lord himself come to wish I joy my son have find the way the little pilgrim do not understand this and almost think that the painter must be mistaken or dream she look at he very anxiously and say -- i think that those unhappy -- never come out any more the painter smile at she in return and say -- have you child in the old time she pause a little before she reply i have child in love she say but none that be bear mine it be the same he say it be the same and if one of they have sin against you injure you do wrong in any way would you have cast he off or what would you have do oh say the little pilgrim again with a vivid light of memory come into she face which show she have no need to think of this as a thing that might have happen but know i bring he home i nurse he well again i pray for he night and day do you say cast he off when he have most need of I then i never could have love he she cry the painter nod he head and he hand with the pencil in it for he have turn from he picture to look at she then you think you love better than we father he say and turn to he work and paint a new fold in the robe which look as if a soft air have suddenly blow into it and not the touch of a skilful hand this make the pilgrim tremble as though in she ignorance she have do something wrong after that there come a great joy into she heart oh how happy you have make I she cry i be glad with all my heart for you and you son -- then she pause a little and add but you say he be still there it be true for the land of darkness be very confusing they tell I for want of the true light and we dear friend the angel be not permit to help : but if one follow they that show the way you may be in that land yet on you way hither it be very hard to understand at first say the painter there be some sketch i could show you no one have ever make a picture of it though many have try but i could show you some sketch -- if you wish to see to this the little pilgrim 's look be so plain a answer that the painter lay down he pallet and he brush and leave he work to show they to she as he have promise they go down from the balcony and along the street until they come to one of the great palace where many be come and go here they walk through some vast hall where student be work at easel do every kind of beautiful work : some painting picture some prepare drawing plan house and palace the pilgrim would have like to pause at every moment to see one lovely thing or another but the painter walk on steadily till he come to a room which be full of sketch some of they like picture in little with many figure -- some of they only a representation of a flower or the wing of a bird these be all the master 's he say sometimes the sight of they will be enough to put something great into the mind of another in this corner be the sketch i tell you of there be two of they hang together upon the wall and at first it seem to the little pilgrim as if they represent the flame and fire of which she have read and this make she shudder for the moment but then she see that it be a red light like a stormy sunset with mass of cloud in the sky and a low sun very fiery and dazzling which no doubt to a hasty glance must have look with its dark shadow and high lurid light like the fire of the bottomless pit but when you look down you see the reality what it be the country that lay beneath be full of tropical foliage but with many stretch of sand and dry plain and in the foreground be a town that look very prosperous and crowded though the figure be very minute the subject be so great but no one to see it would have take it for anything but a busy and wealthy place in a thunderous atmosphere with a storm come on in the next there be a section of a street with a great banqueting hall open to the view and many people sit about the table you could see that there be a great deal of laughter and conversation go on some very noisy group but other that sit more quietly in corner and converse and some who sing and every kind of entertainment the little pilgrim be very much astonished to see this and turn to the painter who answer she directly though she have not speak we use to think differently once there be some who be there and do not know it they think only it be the old life over again but always worse and they be lead on in the way of evil but they do not feel the punishment until they begin to find out where they be and to struggle and wish for other thing the little pilgrim feel she heart beat very wildly while she look at this and she think upon the rich man in the parable who though he be himself in torment pray that he brother might be save and she say to herself we dear lord would never leave he there who could think of he brother when he be himself in such a strait and when she look at the painter he smile upon she and nod he head then he lead she to the other corner of the room where there be other picture one of they be of a party seat round a table and a angel look on the angel have the aspect of a traveller as if he be pass quickly by and have but pause a moment to look and one of the man glance up suddenly see he the picture be dim but the startled look upon this man 's face and the sorrow on the angel 's appear out of the misty background with such truth that the tear come into the little pilgrim 's eye and she say in she heart oh that i could go to he and help he the other sketch be dimmer and dimmer you seem to see out of the darkness gleam light and company of reveller out of which here and there be one try to escape and then the wide plain in the night and the white vision of the angel in the distance and here and there by different path a fugitive strive to follow oh sir say the little pilgrim how do you learn to do it you have never be there it be the master not i and i can not tell you if he have ever be there when the father have give you that gift you can go to many place without leave the one where you be and then he have hear what the angel say and will they all get safe at the last and even that great spirit he that fall from heaven -- the painter shake he head and say it be not permit to you and I to know such great thing perhaps the wise will tell you if you ask they : but for I i ask the father in my heart and listen to what he say that be best the little pilgrim say and she ask the father in she heart : and there come all over she such a glow of warmth and happiness that she soul be satisfied she look in the painter 's face and laugh for joy and he put out he hand as if welcome some one and he countenance shone and he say -- my son have a great gift he be a master bear though it be not give to I he shall paint it all for we so that the heart shall rejoice and you will come again and see after that it happen to the little pilgrim to enter into another great palace where there be many people read and some sit at they desk and write and some consulting together with many great volume stretch out open upon the table one of these who be seat alone look up as she pause wonder at he and smile as every one do and greet she with such a friendly tone that the pilgrim who always have a great desire to know come nearer to he and look at the book then beg he pardon and say she do not know that book be need here and then he tell she that he be one of the historian of the city where all the record of the world be keep and that it be he business to work upon the great history and to show what be the meaning of the father in everything that have happen and how each event come in its right place and do you get it out of book she ask for she be not learn nor wise and know but little though she always love to know the book be the record he say and there be many here that be never know to we in the old day for the angel love to look into these thing and they can tell we much for they see it and in the great book they have keep there be much put down that be never in the book we write for then we do not know we find out about the king and the state and try to understand what great purpose they be serve but even these we do not know for those purpose be too great for we not know the end from the beginning and the heart of man be too great for we we comprehend the evil sometimes but never fathom the good and how could we know the lesser thing which be work out god 's way for some of these even the angel do not know and it have happen to I that we lord himself have come in sometimes to tell I of one that none of we have discover oh say the little pilgrim with tear in she eye i should like to have be that one -- that be not know even to the angel but only to himself the historian smile it be my brother he say the pilgrim look at he with great wonder you brother and you do not know he and then he turn over the page and show she where the story be you know he say that we who live here be not of you time but have live and live here till the old life be far away and like a dream there be great tumult and fighting in we time and it be settle by the prince of the place that we town be to be abandon and all the people leave to the mercy of a enemy who have no mercy but every day as he ride out he see at one door a child a little fair boy who sit on the step and sing he little song like a bird this child be never afraid of anything -- when the horse prance past he and the trooper push he aside he look up into they face and smile and when he have anything a piece of bread or a apple or a plaything he share it with he playmate and he little face and he pretty voice and all he pleasant way make that corner bright he be like a flower grow there everybody smile that see he i have see such a child the little pilgrim say but we make no account of he say the historian the lord of the place come past he every day and always see he singing in the sun by he father 's door and it be a wonder then and it have be a wonder ever since why have resolve upon it that prince do not abandon the town which would have change all he fortune after much have be make clear to I since i begin to study but not this : till the lord himself come to I and tell I the prince look at the child till he love he and he reflect how many child there be like this that would be murder or starve to death and he could not give up the little singing boy to the sword so he remain and the town be save and he become a great king it be so secret that even the angel do not know it but without that child the history would not have be complete and be he here the little pilgrim say ah say the historian that be more strange still for that which save he be also to he harm he be not here he be elsewhere the little pilgrim 's face grow sad but then she remember what she have be tell but you know she say that he be come i know that we father will never forsake he and that everything that be be accomplish in he be well be it well to suffer be it well to live in that dark stormy country oh that they be all here and happy like you he shake he head a little and say -- it be a long time before i get here and as for suffer that matter little you get experience by it you be more accomplished and fit for greater work in the end it be not for nothing that we be permit to wander and sometimes one go to the edge of despair -- she look at he with such wonder eye that he answer she without a word yes he say i have be there and then it seem to she that there be something in he eye which she have not remark before not only the great content that be everywhere but a deeper light and the air of a judge who know both good and evil and could see both side and understand all both to love and to hate little sister he say you have never wander far it be not needful for such as you love teach you and you need no more but when we have to be train for a office like this to make the way of the lord clear through all the generation reason be that we should see everything and learn all that man be and can be these thing be too deep for we we stumble on and know not till after but now to I it be all clear she look at he again and again while he speak and it seem to she that she see in he such great knowledge and tenderness as make she glad and how he could understand the folly that man have do and fathom what real meaning be in they and disentangle all the thread he smile as she gaze at he and answer as if she have speak what be evil perish and what be good remains almost everywhere there be a little good we could not understand all if we have not see all and share all and the punishment too she say wonder more and more he smile so joyfully that it be like laughter pain be a great angel he say the reason we hate he in the old day be because he tend to death and decay but when it be towards life he lead we fear he no more the welcome thing of all in the land of darkness be when you see he first and know who he be for by this you be aware that you have find the way the little pilgrim do nothing but question with she anxious eye for this be such a wonder to she and she could not understand but he only sit muse with a smile over the thing he remember and at last he say -- if this be so interesting to you you shall read it all in another place in the room where we have lay up we own experience in order to serve for the history afterwards but we be still busy upon the work of the earth there be always something new to be discover and it be essential for the whole world that the chronicle should be full i be in great joy because it be but just now that we lord tell I about that child everything be imperfect without he but now it be clear you mean you brother and you be happy though you be not sure if he be happy the little pilgrim say it be not to be happy that we live say he and then we be all happy so soon as we have find the way she would have ask he more but that he be call to a consultation with some other of he kind and have to leave she wave he hand to she with a tender kindness which go to she heart she look after he with great respect scarcely know why but it seem to she that a man who have be in the land of darkness and make he way out of it must be more wonderful than any other she look round for a little upon the great library full of all the book that have ever be write and where people be do they work examine and read and make extract every one with look of so much interest that she almost envy they -- though it be a generous delight in see people so happy in they occupation and a desire to associate herself somehow in it rather than any grudging of they satisfaction that be in she mind she go about all the court of this palace alone and everywhere see the same work go on and everywhere meet the same kind look even when the greatest of all look up from he work and see she he would give she a friendly greet and a smile and nobody be too wise to lend a ear to the little visitor or to answer she question and this be how it be that she begin to talk to another who be seat at a great table with many more and who draw she to he by something that be in he look though she could not have tell what it be it be not that he be kinder than the rest for they be all kind she stand by he a little and see how he work and would take something from one book and something from another put they ready for use and it do not seem any trouble to do this work but only pleasure and the very pen in he hand be like a winged thing as if it love to write when he see she watch he he look up and show she the beautiful book out of which he be copy which be all illuminate with lovely picture this be one of the volume of the great history he say there be some thing in it which be need for another and it be a pleasure to work at it if you will come here you will be able to see the page while i write then the little pilgrim ask he some question about the picture and he answer she describe and explain they for they be in the middle of the history and she do not understand what it be when she say i ought not to trouble you for you be busy he laugh so kindly that she laugh too for pleasure and he say -- there be no trouble here when we be not allow to work as sometimes happen that make we not quite so happy but it be very seldom that it happen so be it for punishment she say and then he laugh out with a sound which make all the other look up smile and if they have not all look so tenderly at she as at a child who have make such a mistake as it be pretty for the child to make she would have fear she have say something wrong but she only laugh at herself too and blush a little know that she be not wise : and to put she at she ease again he turn the leaf and show she other picture and the story which go with they from which he be copy something and he say -- this be for another book to show how the grace of the father be beautiful in some home and family it be not the great history but connect with it and there be many who love that better than the story which be more great then the pilgrim look in he face and say -- what i want most be to know about you home here it be all home here he say and smile and then as he meet she wistful look he go on to tell she that he and he brother be not always there we have all we occupation he say and sometimes i be send to inquire into fact that have happen of which the record be not clear for we must omit nothing and sometimes we be tell to rest and take in new strength and sometimes -- but oh forgive I cry the little pilgrim you have some who be more dear to you than all the world in the old time and the other all look up again at the question and look at she with tender eye and say to the man whom she question -- speak he make a little pause before he speak and he look at one here and there and call to they -- patience brother and courage brother and then he say those whom we love best be nearly all with we but some have not yet come oh say the little pilgrim but how then do you bear it to be part so long -- so long then one of those to whom the first speaker have call out patience rise and come to she smile and he say -- i think every hour that perhaps she will come and the joy will be so great that thinking of that make the wait short : and nothing here be long for it never end and it will be so wonderful to hear she tell how the father have guide she that it will be a delight to we all and she will be able to explain many thing not only for we but for all and we love each other so that this separation be as nothing in comparison with what be to come it be beautiful to hear this but it be not what the little pilgrim expect for she think they would have tell she of the home to which they all return when they work be over and a life which be like the life of the old time but of this they say nothing only look at she with smile eye as at the curious question of a child and there be many other thing she would have ask but refrain when she look at they feel as if she do not yet understand when one of they break forth suddenly in a louder voice and say -- the little sister know only the little language and the beginning of day she have not learn the mystery and what love be and what life be and another cry it be sweet to hear it again and they all gather round she with tender look and begin to talk to each other and tell she as man will tell of the game of they childhood of thing that happen which be half-forgotten in the old time after this the little pilgrim go out again into the beautiful city feeling in she heart that everything be a mystery and that the day would never be long enough to learn all that have yet to be learn but know now that this too be the little language and pleased with the sweet thought of so much that be to come for one have whisper to she as she go out that the new tongue and every explanation as she be ready for it would come to she through one of those whom she love best which be the usage of that country and when the stranger have no one there that be very dear then it be a angel who teach the greater language and that be what happen often to the child who be bring up in that heavenly place when she reach the street again she be so pleased with this thought that it go out of she mind to ask she way to the great library where she be to read the story of the historian 's journey through the land of darkness indeed she forget that land altogether and think only of what be around she in the great city which be beyond everything that eye have see or that ear have hear or that it have enter into the imagination to conceive and now it seem to she that she be much more familiar with the look of the people and could distinguish between those who belong to the city and those who be visitor like herself and also could tell which they be who have enter into the mystery of the kingdom and which be like herself only acquaint with the beginning of day and it come to she mind she could not tell how that it be best not to ask question but to wait until the beloved one should come who would teach she the first word for in the mean time she do not feel at all impatient or disturb by she want of knowledge but laugh a little at herself to suppose that she could find out everything and go on look round she and say a word to every one she meet and enjoy the holiday look of all the stranger and the sense she have in she heart of holiday too she be walk on in this pleasant way when she hear a sound that be like silver trumpet and see the crowd turn towards a open space in which all the beautiful building be shaded with fine tree and flower be spring at the very edge of the pavement the stranger all hasten along to hear what it be and she with they and some also of the people of the place and as the little pilgrim find herself walk by a woman who be of these last she ask she what it be and the woman tell she it be a poet who have come to say to they what have be reveal to he and that the two with the silver trumpet be angel of the musician ' order whose office it be to proclaim everything that be new that the people should know and many of those who be at work in the palace come out and join the crowd and the painter who have show the little pilgrim he picture and many whose face she begin to be acquaint with the poet stand up upon a beautiful pedestal all sculpture in stone and with wreath of live flower hang upon it -- and when the crowd have gather in front of he he begin he poem he tell they that it be not about this land or anything that happen in it which they know as he do but that it be a story of the old time when man be walk in darkness and when no one know the true meaning even of what he himself do but have to go on as if blindly stumble and grope with they hand and oh brethren he say though all be more beautiful and joyful here where we know yet to remember the day when we know not and the way when all be uncertain and the end could not be distinguish from the beginning be sweet and dear and that which be do in the dim twilight should be celebrate in the day and we father himself love to hear of those who have not see loved and who learn without any teacher and follow the light though they do not understand and then he tell they the story of one who have live in the old time and in that air which seem to be make of sunshine and amid all those stately palace he describe to they the little earth which they have leave behind -- the sky that be cover with cloud and the way that be so rough and stony and the cruelty of the oppressor and the cry of those that be oppress and he show the sickness and the trouble and the sorrow and danger and how death stalk about and tear heart from heart and how sometimes the strongest would fail and the truest fall under the power of a lie and the tenderest forget to be kind and how evil thing lurk in every corner to beguile the dweller there and how the day be short and the night dark and life so little that by the time a man have learn something it be he hour to die what can a soul do that be bear there he cry for war be there and fight and perplexity and darkness and no man know if that which he do will be for good or evil or can tell which be the best way or know the end from the beginning and those he love the most be a mystery to he and they thought beyond he reach and cloud be between he and the father and he be deceive with false god and false teacher who make he to love a lie the people who be listen hold they breath and a shadow like a cloud fall on they and they remember and know that it be true but the next moment they heart rebel and one and another would have speak and the little pilgrim herself have almost cry out and make she plea for the dear earth which she love when he suddenly throw forth he voice again like a great song oh dear mother earth he cry oh little world and great forgive thy son for lovely thou art and dear and the sun of god shine upon thee and the sweet dew fall and there be we bear and love and die and be come hence to bless the father and the son for in no other world though they be so vast be it give to any to know the lord in the darkness and follow he grope and make way through sin and death and overcome the evil and conquer in he name at which there be a great sound of weep and of triumph and the little pilgrim could not contain herself but cry out too in joy as if for a deliverance and then the poet tell he tale and as he tell they of the man who be poor and sorrowful and alone and how he love and be not love again and trust and be betray and be tempt and draw into the darkness so that it seem as if he must perish but when hope be almost go turn again from the edge of despair and confront all he enemy and fight and conquer -- the people follow every word with great outcry of love and pity and wonder for each one as he listen remember he own career and that of he brethren in the old life and admire to think that all the evil be past and wonder that out of such tribulation and through so many danger all be safe and bless here and there be other that be not of they who listen some seat at the window of the palace and some standing in the great square -- people who be not like the other whose bearing be more majestic and who look upon the crowd all smile and weep with wonder and interest but have no knowledge of the cause and listen as it be to a tale that be tell the poet and he audience be as one and at every period of the story there be a deep breathing and pause and every one look at he neighbor and some grasp each other 's hand as they remember all that be in the past but the stranger listen and gaze and observe all as those who listen and be instruct in something beyond they knowledge the little pilgrim stand all this time not know where she be so intent be she upon the tale and as she listen it seem to she that all she own life be roll out before she and she remember the thing that have be and perceive how all have be shape and guide and tremble a little for the brother who be in danger yet know that all would be well the woman who have be at she side listen too with all she heart say to herself as she stand in the crowd he have leave nothing out the little day they be so short and the sky would change all in a moment and one 's heart with they how he bring it all back and she put up she hand to dry away a tear from she eye though she face all the time be shine with the recollection the little pilgrim be glad to be by the side of a woman after talk with so many man and she put out she hand and touch the cloak that this lady wear and which be white and of the most beautiful texture with gold thread weave in it or something that look like gold do you like she say to think of the old time the woman turn and look down upon she for she be tall and stately and immediately take the hand of the little pilgrim into hers and hold it without answer till the poet have end and come down from the place where he have be stand he come straight through the crowd to where this lady stand and say something to she you do well to tell I look at she with love in he eye -- not the tender sweetness of all those kind look around but the love that be for one the little pilgrim look at they with she heart beating and be very glad for they and happy in herself for she have not see this love before since she come into the city and it have trouble she to think that perhaps it do not exist any more i be glad the lady say and give he she other hand but here be a little sister who ask I something and i must answer she i think she have but newly come she have a face full of the morning the poet say it do the little pilgrim good to feel the touch of the warm soft hand and she be not afraid but lift she eye and speak to the lady and to the poet it be beautiful what you say to we sometimes in the old time we use to look up to the beautiful sky and wonder what there be above the cloud but we never think that up here in this great city you would be think of what we be do and make beautiful poem all about we we think that you would sing wonderful psalm and talk of thing high high above we the little sister do not know what the meaning of the earth be the poet say it be but a little speck but it be the center of all let she walk with we and we will go home and you will tell she ama for i love to hear you talk will you come with we the lady say and the little pilgrim 's heart leap up in she to think she be now go to see a home in this wonderful city and they go along hand in hand and though they be three together and many be come and go there be no difficulty for every one make way for they and there be a little murmur of pleasure as the poet pass and those who have hear he poem make obeisance to he and thank he and thank the father for he that he be able to show they so many beautiful thing and they walk along the street which be shine with color and see as they pass how the master painter have come to he work and be stand upon the balcony where the little pilgrim have be and bring out of the wall under he hand face which be full of life and which seem to spring forth as if they have be hide there let we wait a little and see he work the poet say and all round about the people stop on they way and there be a soft cry of pleasure and praise all through the beautiful street and the painter with whom the little pilgrim have talk before come and stand behind she as if he have be a old friend and call out to she at every new touch to mark how this and that be do she do not understand as he do but she see how beautiful it be and she be glad to have see the great painter as she have be glad to hear the great poet it seem to the little pilgrim as if everything happen well for she and that no one have ever be so bless before and to make it all more sweet this new friend this great and sweet lady always hold she hand and press it softly when something more lovely appear and even the picture face on the wall seem to beam upon she as they come out one by one like the star in the sky then the three go on again and pass by many more beautiful palace and great street lead away into the light till you could see no further and they meet with band of singer who sing so sweetly that the heart seem to leap out of the pilgrim 's breast to meet with they for above all thing this be what she have love most and out of one of the palace there come such glorious music that everything she have see and hear before seem as nothing in comparison and amid all these delight they go on and on but without weary till they come out of the street into lovely walk and alley and make they way to the bank of a great river which seem to sing too a soft melody of its own and here there be some fair house surround by garden and flower that grow everywhere and the door be all open and within everything be lovely and still and ready for rest if you be weary the little pilgrim be not weary but the lady place she upon a couch in the porch where the pillar and the roof be all form of interlace plant and flower and there they sit with she and talk and explain to she many thing they tell she that the earth though so small be the place in all the world to which the thought of those above be turn and not only of we who have live there but of all we brother in the other world for we be the race which the father have choose to be the example in every age there be one that be the scene of the struggle and the victory and it be for this reason that the chronicle be make and that we be all place here to gather the meaning of what have be do among man and i be one of those the lady say that go back to the dear earth and gather up the tale of what we little brethren be do i have not to succor like some other but only to see and bring the news and he make they into great poem as you have hear and sometimes the master painter will take one and make of it a picture and there be nothing that be so delightful to we as when we can bring back the history of beautiful thing but oh say the little pilgrim what can there be on earth so beautiful as the meanest thing that be here then they both smile upon she and say it be more beautiful than the most beautiful thing here to see how under the low sky and in the short day a soul will turn to we father and sometimes say ama when i be watch one will wander and stray and be lead into the dark till my heart be sick then come back and make I glad sometimes i cry out within myself to the father and say ' o my father it be enough ' and it will seem to I that it be not possible to stand by and see he destruction and then while you be gaze while you be cry he will recover and return and go on again and to the angel it be more wonderful than to we for they have never live there and all the other world be eager to hear what we can tell they for no one know except the father how the battle will turn or when it will all be accomplish and there be some who tremble for we little brethren for to look down and see how little light there be and how no one know what may happen to he next make they afraid who never be there the little pilgrim listen with a intent face clasp she hand and say -- but it never could be that we father should be overcome by evil be not that know in all the world then the lady turn and kiss she and the poet break forth in singing and say faith be more heavenly than heaven it be more beautiful than the angel it be the only voice that can answer to we father we praise he we glorify he we love he name but there be but one response to he through all the world and that be the cry of the little brother who see nothing and know nothing but believe that he will never fail at this the little pilgrim weep for she heart be touch but she say -- we be not so ignorant for we have we lord who be we brother and he teach we all that we require to know upon this the poet rise and lift up he hand and sing again a great song it be in the other language which the little pilgrim still do not understand but she could make out that it sound like a great proclamation that he be wise as he be good and call upon all to see that the lord have choose the only way : and the sound of the poet 's voice be like a great trumpet sound bold and sweet as if to tell this to those who be far away for you must know say the lady ama who all the time hold the pilgrim 's hand that it be permit to all to judge accord to the wisdom that have be give they and there be some who think that we dear lord might have find another way and that wait sometimes with tremble lest he should fail but not among we who have live on earth for we know and it be we work to show to all the world that he way never fail and how wonderful it be and beautiful above all that heart have conceive and thus we justify the way of god who be we father but in the other world there be many who will continue to fear until the history of the earth be all end and the chronicle be make complete and will that be long the little pilgrim cry feeling in she heart that she would like to go to all the world and tell they of we lord and of he love and how the thought of he make you strong and it trouble she a little to hear she friend speak of the low sky and the short day and the dimness of that dear country which she have leave behind in which there be so many still whom she love upon this ama shake she head and say that of that day no one know not even we lord but only the father and then she smile and answer the little pilgrim 's think when we go back she say it be not as when we live there for now we see all the danger of it and the mystery which we do not see before it be by the father 's dear love that we do not see what be around we and about we while we live there for then we heart would have faint and that make we wonder now that any one endure to the end you be a great deal wiser than i be say the little pilgrim but though we heart have faint how could we have be overcome for he be on we side at this neither of they make any reply at first but look at she and at length the poet say that she have bring many thought back to he mind and how he have himself be almost worst when one like she come to he and give strength to he soul for that he be on we side be the only thing she know he say and all that could be learn or discover be not worthy of name beside it and this i must tell when next i speak to the people and how we little sister bring it to my mind and then they pause from this discourse and the little pilgrim look round upon the beautiful house and the fair garden and she say -- you live here and do you come home at night -- but i do not mean at night i mean when you work be do and be they poet like you that dwell all about in these pleasant place and the -- she would have say the child but stop not know if perhaps it might be unkind to speak of the child when she see none there upon this the lady smile once more and say -- the door stand open always so that no one be shut out and the child come and go when they will they be child no longer and they have they appoint work like he and I and you be always among those you love the pilgrim say upon which they smile again and say we all love each other and the lady hold she hand in both of hers and caress it and softly laugh and say you know only the little language when you have be teach the other you will learn many beautiful thing she rest for some time after this and talk much with she new friend and then there come into the heart of the little pilgrim a longing to go to the place which be appoint for she and which be she home and to do the work which have be give she to do and when the lady see this she rise and say that she would accompany she a little upon she way but the poet bid she farewell and remain under the porch with the green branch shade he and the flower twine round the pillar and the open door of this beautiful house behind he when she look back upon he he wave he hand to she as if bidding she god-speed and the lady by she side look back too and wave she hand and the little pilgrim feel tear of happiness come to she eye for she have be wonder with a little disappointment to see that the people in the city except those who be stranger be chiefly alone and not like those in the old world where the husband and wife go together it console she to see again two who be one the lady press she hand in answer to she thought and bid she pause a moment and look back into the city as they pass the end of the great street out of which they come and then the pilgrim be more and more console for she see many who have before be alone now walk together hand in hand it be not as it be ama say for all of we have work to do which be need for the world and it be no longer needful that one should sit at home while the other go forth for we work be not for we life as of old or for ourselves but for the father who have give we so great a trust and little sister you must know that though we be not so great as the angel nor as many that come to visit we from the other world yet we be nearer to he for we be in he secret and it be ours to make it clear the little pilgrim 's heart be very full to hear this but she say -- i be never clever nor know much it be better for I to go away to my little border-land and help the stranger who do not know the way whatever be you work be the best the lady say but though you be so little you be in the father 's secret too for it be nature to you to know what the other can not be sure of that we must have the victory at the last : so that we have this between we the father and we and though all be he child we be of the kindred of god because of we lord who be we brother and then the lady ama kiss she and bid she when she return to the great city either for rest or for love or because the father send for she that she should come to the house by the river for we be friend for ever she say and so throw she white veil over she head and be go upon she mission whither the little pilgrim do not know and now she find herself at a distance from the great city which shine in the light with its beautiful tower and roof and all its monument softly fringe with tree and set in a heavenly firmament and the pilgrim thought of those word that describe this lovely place as a bride adorn for she husband and do not wonder at he who have say that she street be of gold and she gate of pearl because gold and pearl and precious jewel be as nothing to the glory and the beauty of she the little pilgrim be glad to have see these wonderful thing and she mind be like a cup run over with almost more than it could contain it seem to she that there never could be a time when she should want for wonder and interest and delight so long as she have this to think of yet she be not sorry to turn she back upon the beautiful city but go on she way singing in unutterable content and think over what the lady have say that we be in god 's secret more than all the great world above and even the angel because of know how it be that in darkness and doubt and without any open vision a man may still keep the right way the path lay along the bank of the river which flow beside she and make the air full of music and a soft air blow across the run stream and breathe in she face and refresh she and the bird sing in all the tree and as she pass through the village the people come out to meet she and ask of she if she have come from the city and what she have see there and everywhere she find friend and kind voice that give she greet but some would ask she why she still speak the little language though it be sweet to they ear and other when they hear it hasten to call from the house and the field some among they who know the other tongue but a little and who come and crowd round the little pilgrim and ask she many question both about the thing she have be see and about the old time and she perceive that the village folk be a simple folk not learn and wise like those she have leave and that though they live within sight of the great city and show every stranger the beautiful view of it and the glory of its tower yet few among they have travel there for they be so content with they field and they river and the shade of they tree and the bird singing and they simple life that they want no change though it please they to receive the little pilgrim and they bring she into they village rejoice and call every one to see she and they tell she that they have all be poor and labor hard in the old time and have never rest so that now it be the father 's good pleasure that they should enjoy great peace and consolation among the fresh-breathing field and on the riverside so that there be many who even now have little occupation except to think of the father 's goodness and to rest and they tell she how the lord himself would come among they and sit down under a tree and tell they one of he parable and make they all more happy than word could say and how sometimes he would send one out of the beautiful city with a poem or tale to say to they and band of lovely music more lovely than anything beside except the sound of the lord 's own voice and what be more wonderful the angel themselves come often and listen to we they say when we begin to talk and remind each other of the old time and how we suffer heat and cold and be bow down with labor and bend over the soil and how sometimes the harvest would fail we and sometimes we have not bread and sometimes would hush the child to sleep because there be nothing to give they and how we grow old and weary and still work on and on we be those who be old a number of they call out to she with a murmur sound of laughter one look over another 's shoulder and one woman say the angel say to we ` do you never think the father have forsake you and the lord forget you ' and all the rest answer as in a chorus there be moment that we think this but all the time we know that it could not be and the angel wonder at we say another all this they say crowd one before another every one anxious to say something and sometimes speak together but always in accord and then there be a sound of laughter and pleasure both at the strange thought that the lord could have forget they and at the wonder of the angel over they simple tale and immediately they begin to remind each other and say do you remember and they tell the little pilgrim a hundred tale of the hardship and trouble they have know all smile and radiant with pleasure and at every new account the other would applaud and rejoice feel the happiness all the more for the evil that be past and some of they lead she into they garden to show she they flower and to tell she how they have begin to study and learn how color be change and form perfect and the secret of the growth and of the germ of which they have be ignorant and other arrange themselves in choir and sing to she delightful song of the field and accompany she out upon she way singing and answering to each other the difference between the simple folk and the greatness of the other make the little pilgrim wonder and admire and she love they in she simplicity and turn back many a time to wave she hand to they and to listen to the lovely simple singing as it go further and further away it have a evening tone of rest and quietness and of protection and peace he leadeth I by the green pasture and beside the quiet water she say to herself and she heart swell with pleasure to think that it be those who have be so old and so weary and poor who have this rest to console they for all they sorrow and as she go along not only do she pass through many other village but meet many on the way who be travel towards the great city and would greet she sweetly as they pass and sometimes stop to say a pleasant word so that the little pilgrim be never lonely wherever she go but most of they begin to speak to she in the other language which be as beautiful and sweet as music but which she could not understand and they be surprise to find she ignorant of it not know that she be but a new-comer into these land and there be many thing that could not be tell but in that language for the earthly tongue have no word to express they the little pilgrim be a little sad not to understand what be say to she but cheer herself with the thought that it should be teach to she by one whom she love best the way by the riverside be very cheerful and bright with many people come and go and many village some of they with a bridge across the stream some withdraw among the field but all of they bright and full of life and with sound of music and voice and footstep : and the little pilgrim feel no weariness and move along as lightly as a child take great pleasure in everything she see and answer all the friendly greeting with all she heart yet glad to think that she be approach ever nearer to the country where it be ordain that she should dwell for a time and succor the stranger and receive those who be newly arrive and she console herself with the thought that there be no need of any language but that which she know as this go through she mind make she glad she suddenly become aware of one who be walk by she side a lady who be cover with a veil white and shine like that which ama have worn in the beautiful city it hang about this stranger 's head so that it be not easy to see she face but the sound of she voice be very sweet in the pilgrim 's ear yet startle she like the sound of something which she know well but could not remember and as there be few who be go that way she be glad and say let we walk together if that please you and the stranger say it be for that i have come which be a reply which make the little pilgrim wonder more and more though she be very glad and joyful to have this companion upon she way and then the lady begin to ask she many question not about the city or the great thing she have see but about herself and what the dear lord have give she to do i be little and weak and i can not do much the little pilgrim say it be nothing but pleasure it be to welcome those that be come and tell they sometimes they be astonished and do not know i be so myself i come in my sleep and understand nothing but now that i know it be sweet to tell they that they need not fear i be glad the lady say that you come in you sleep for sometimes the way be dark and hard and you be little and tender when you brother come you will be the first to see he and show he the way my brother be he come the little pilgrim cry and then she say with a wistful look but we be all brethren and you mean only one of those who be the child of we father you must forgive I that i do not know the higher speech but only what be natural for i have not yet be long here he whom i mean be call -- and here the lady say a name which be the true name of a brother bear whom the pilgrim love above all other she give a cry and then she say tremble i know you voice but i can not see you face and what you say make I think of many thing no one else have cover she face when she have speak to I i know you and yet i can not tell who you be the woman stand for a little without say a word and then very softly in a voice which only the heart hear she call the little pilgrim by she name mother cry the pilgrim with such a cry of joy that it echo all about in the sweet air and fling herself upon the veil lady and draw the veil from she face and see that it be she and with this sight there come a revelation which flood she soul with happiness for the face which have be old and feeble be old no longer but fair in the maturity of day and the figure that have be bent and weary be full of a tender majesty and the arm that clasp she about be warm and soft with love and life and all that have change they relation in the other day and make the mother in she weakness seem as a child and transfer all protection and strength to the daughter be go for ever and the little pilgrim beheld in a rapture one who be she sister and equal yet ever above she -- more near to she than any though all be so near -- one of whom she herself be a part yet another and who know all she thought and the way of they before they arise in she and to see she face as in the day of she prime and she eye so clear and wise and to feel once more that which be different from the love of all that which be still most sweet where all be sweet the love of one be like a crown to she in she happiness the little pilgrim could not think for joy nor say a word but hold this dear mother 's hand and look in she face and she heart soar away to the father in thanks and joy they sit down by the roadside under the shade of the tree -- while the river run softly by and everything be hush out of sympathy and kindness -- and question each other of all that have be and be to be and the little pilgrim tell all the little news of home and of the brother and sister and the child that have be bear and of those whose face be turn towards this better country and the mother smile and listen and would have hear all over and over although many thing she already know but why should i tell you for do not you watch over we and see all we do and be not you near we always the little pilgrim say how could that be say the mother for we be not like we lord to be everywhere we come and go where we be send but sometimes we know and sometimes see and always love and whenever we heart be sick for news it be but to go to he and he tell we everything and now my little one you be as we be and have see the lord and this have be give we to teach we child once more and show you the heavenly language that you may understand all both the little and the great then the pilgrim lift she head from she mother 's bosom and look in she face with eye full of longing you say ` we ' she say the mother do nothing but smile then lift she eye and look along the beautiful path of the river to where some one be come to join they and the little pilgrim cry out again in wonder and joy and presently find herself seat between they she father and she mother the two who have love she most in the other day they look more beautiful than the angel and all the great person whom she have see for still they be hers and she be theirs more than all the angel and all the bless could be and thus she learn that though the new may take the place of the old and many thing may blossom out of it like flower yet that the old be never do away and then they sit together tell of everything that have befall and all the little tender thing that be of no import and all the great change and noble way and the wonder of heaven above -- and the earth beneath for all be open to they both great and small and when they have satisfy they soul with these she father and mother begin to teach she the other language smile often at she falter tongue and tell she the same thing over and over till she learn it and she father call she he little foolish one as he have do in the old day and at last when they have kiss she and bless she and tell she how to come home to they when she be weary they give she as the father have permit they with joy and blessing she new name the little pilgrim be tire with happiness and all the wonder and pleasure and as she sit there in the silence lean upon those who be so dear to she the soft air grow sweeter and sweeter about she and the light fade softly into a dimness of tender indulgence and privilege for she because she be still little and weak and whether that heavenly suspense of all she faculty be sleep or not she know not but it be such as in all she life she have never know when she come back to herself it be by the sound of many voice call she and many people hasten past and beckon to she to join they come come they say little sister : there have be great trouble in the other life and many have arrive suddenly and be afraid come come and help they -- come and help they and she spring up from she soft seat and find that she be no longer by the riverside or within sight of the great city or in the arm of those she love but stand on one of the flowery path of she own border-land and see she fellow hasten towards the gate where there seem a great crowd and she be no longer weary but full of life and strength and it seem to she that she could take they up in she arm those tremble stranger and carry they straight to the father so strong be she and light and full of force and above all the gladness she have feel and all she pleasure in what she have see and more happy even than the meeting with those she love most be she happiness how as she go along as light as the breeze to receive the stranger she be so eager that she begin to sing a song of welcome as she hasten on oh welcome welcome she cry and as she sing she know it be one of the heavenly melody which she have hear in the great city and she hasten on she foot fly over the flowery way think how the great world be all watch and the angel look on and the whole universe wait till it should be prove to they that the dear lord the brother of we all have choose the perfect way and that over all evil and the sorrow he be the conqueror alone and the little pilgrim 's voice though it be so small echo away through the great firmament to where the other world be watch to see what should come and cheer the anxious face of some great lord and prince far more great than she who be of a nobler race than man for it be say among the star that when such a little sound could reach so far it be a token that the lord have choose aright and that he method must be the best and it breathe over the earth like some one say courage to those whose heart be fail and it drop down down into the great confusion and traffic of the land of darkness and startle many like the cry of a child call and call and never cease come and come and come end of project gutenberg 's a little pilgrim by margaret o -lrb- wilson -rrb- oliphant
