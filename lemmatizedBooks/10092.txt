by the light of a garish kerosene lamp upon the table : with one discourage lock of hair hanging over he nose and straw hat push so far back from he phrenological brow that its vast rim have the fine artistic effect of a huge saintly nimbus : mr bumstead sit gynmastically crosswise in a easy-chair over a arm of which he slender lower limb limply dangle and elaborately perform one of the grander work of bach upon a irritable accordion now wink with intense rapidity and go through the muscular motion of a excitable person resolutely pull out a obstinate and inexplicable drawer from somewhere about he knee he produce sustained and mournful note as of canine distress in the backyard anon with eye nearly close and the straw nimbus slide still further back he manipulation be that of a excessively weary gentleman slowly compress a large sponge thereby squeeze out certain choke snort guttural sound as of a class softly study the german language in another room and finally with a impatient start from the unexpected slumber into which the last shaky _ pianissimo _ have momentarily betray he he catch the untame instrument in mid-air just as it be treacherously get away from he frantically balance it there for a instant on all he clutch finger-tip and have it prisoner again for a renewal of the weird symphony seriously offend at the discovery that he could not drop asleep in he own room for a minute without the music stop and the accordion try to slip off the ritualistic organist be not at all soften in temper by almost simultaneously realize that the farther skirt of he long linen coat be stand out nearly straight from he person and apparently flutter in a heavy draught who be - been-ope ` nin ' - th ' - window he sternly ask what be - meaning - ` f-such-a-gale-at thistime - ` f-year do i intrude inquire a voice close at hand look very carefully along the still extend skirt of he coat towards exactly the point of the compass from which the voice seem to come mr bumstead at last awake to the conviction that the tension of he garment and its breezy agitation be cause by the tug of a human figure do i intrude repeat mr tracey clew drop the skirt as he speak have i presume too greatly in come to request the favor of a short private interview slip quickly into a more genteel but rather rigid position on he chair the ritualistic organist make a airy pass at he with the accordion any door where youwasborn sir there be mr bumstead people ever knock when th ' want t ' - come-in sir why i do knock at you door answer mr clew conciliatingly i knock and knock but you keep on playing and after i finally take the liberty to come in and pull you by the coat it be ten minute before you find it out in a attempt to look into the speaker 's inmost soul mr bumstead fall into a doze from which the crash of he accordion to the floor arouse he in time to behold a very curious proceeding on the part of mr clew that gentleman successively peer up the chimney through the window and under the furniture of the room and then stealthily take a seat near he rather languid observer mr bumstead you know I as a temporary boarder under the same roof with you other people know I merely as a dead-beat may i trust you with a secret a pair of blur and glassy eye look into he from under a huge straw hat and a husky question follow he : do y ' ever read wordsworth 's poem - ` f-th ' excursion sir not that i remember then sir exclaim the organist with spasmodic animation -- then be not in you hicsperience to know howssleepy-i am-jus ' - now you have a nephew say he subtle companion raise he voice and not appear to heed the last remark a ' ` numbrellum add mr bumstead feebly i say you have a nephew reiterate the other and that nephew disappear in a very mysterious manner now i be a literary man -- c would tell that by y' r-headerhair murmur the ritualistic organist leave y' r wife yet sir i say i be a literary man persist tracey clew sharply i be go to write a great american novel call ` the amateur detective ' found upon the story of this very edwin drood and have come to bumsteadville to get all the particulars i have pick up considerable from gospeler simpson john mclaughlin and even the woman from the mulberry street place who come after you the other morning but now i want to know something from you -- what have become of you nephew he put the question suddenly and with a kind of suppress leap at he whom he address immeasurable be he surprise at the perfectly calm answer -- i can not r ` member hicsactly sir can not remember -- can not remember what where-i-put ' t _ it _ yes th ' umbrella what on earth be you talk about exclaimed mr clew in a rage -- come wake up -- what have umbrella to do with this rousing himself to something like temporary consciousness mr bumstead slowly climb to he foot and with a wild kind of swoop come heavily down with both hand upon the shoulder of he questioner what now ask that startled personage you want t ' know ` bout th ' umbrella say bumstead with straw hat amazingly awry and linen coat a perfect map of crease yes -- you be crush I pant mr clew th ' umbrella cry mr bumstead suddenly withdraw he hand and sway before he visitor like a linen person on spring -- this be what there be ` bout ` t : _ where th ' umbrella be there be edwin also _ astounded by this bewildering confession and fearful that the uncle of mr drood would be back in he chair and asleep again if he give he a chance the excited inquisitor spring from he chair and slowly and carefully back the wildly glaring object of he solicitation until he shoulder and elbow be safely brace against the mantel-piece then like one inspire he grasp a bottle of soda water from the table and force the revive liquid down he stare patient 's throat as quickly tear off he straw hat newly moisten the damp sponge in it at a neighbor washstand and replace both on the ache head and finally place in one of he tremulous hand a few clove from a saucer on the mantel-shelf you be better now you can tell I more he say rest a moment from he violent exertion with the unsettled air of one come out of a complicated dream mr bumstead chew the clove musingly then after nod excessively with a hideous smile upon he countenance suddenly throw a arm about the neck of he restorer and weep loudly upon he bosom my fr ` en ' he wail in a damp voice lemme confess to you i be a mis ` able man my fr ` en ' perfectly mis ` able these clove -- these insidious tropical spice -- have be thebaneofmyexistence on chrishm 's night -- _ that _ chrishm 's night -- i toogtoomany wha ` scon ` q ` nce i put m ' nephew a ' m ' umbrella away somewhere a have neverb 'n able terremembersince still sustain he weight the author of the amateur detective at first seem nonplussed but quickly change he expression to one of abrupt intelligence i see now i begin to see he answer slowly and almost in a whisper on the night of that christmas dinner here you be in a clove-trance and make some secret disposition -lrb- which you have not since be able to remember -rrb- of you umbrella -- and nephew until very lately -- until now when you be nearly but _ not quite _ as much under the influence of clove again -- you have have a vague general idea that somebody else must have kill mr drood and steal you umbrella but now that you be partially in the same condition physiologically and psychologically as on the night of the disappearance you have once more a partial perception of what be the fact of the case be i right that be it sir you be a ph ` lo ` pher murmured mr bumstead try to brush from above he nose the pendent lock of hair which he take for a fly very well then continue tracey clew he extraordinary head of hair fairly bristle with electrical animation : you have only to get yourself into _ exactly the same _ clove-y condition as on the night of the double disappearance when you put you umbrella and nephew away somewhere and you 'll remember all about it again you have two distinct state of existence you see : a cloven one and a uncloven one and what you have do in one you be totally oblivious of in the other something like a occult wink tremble for a moment in the right eye of mr bumstead tha 's ver ' true say he thoughtfully i have be ` blivious m ` self frequently never c have r ` member whariow the idea i have suggest to you for the solution of this mystery go on mr clew be express by one of the greatest of english writer who in he very last work say ' -- in some case of drunkenness and in other of animal magnetism there be two state of consciousness which never clash but each of which pursue its separate course as though it be continuous instead of broken thus if i hide my watch when i be drunk i must be drunk again before i can remember where ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- i be norradrink 'n' man sir return mr bumstead draw coldly back from he and escape a fall into the fireplace by a dexterous surge into the nearest chair th ' lemon tea which i take for my cold or to pr ` vent the clove from disagree with I be norrintoxicate of course not assent he subtle counsellor but in this country at least chronic inebriation clove-eating and even opium-taking be strikingly alike in they aspect and the same rule may be safely apply to all my advice to you be what i have give cause a table to be spread in this room exactly as it be for that memorable christmas-dinner sit down to it exactly as then and at the same hour go through all the same process as nearly as you can remember and by the mere force of association you will enact all the final performance with you umbrella and you nephew mr bumstead 's arm be fold tightly across he manly breast and the fine head with the straw hat upon it tilted heavily towards he bosom i see ' t now say he softly bone han ` le 'n ferule i r ` member threshing be with it i can r ` memb ' r carry ` ng -- here mr bumstead burst into tear and make a frenzied dash at the lock of hair which he again mistake for a fly to sum up all conclude mr tracey clew shake he violently by the shoulder that he might remain awake long enough to hear it -- to sum up all i be satisfy from the familiar knowledge of this mystery i have already gain that the end will have something to do with exercise in the open air you 'll have to go outdoors for something important and now good night goornight sir retire softly to he own room under the same roof the author of the amateur detective smile at himself before the mirror with marked complacency you be a long-headed one my dead-beat friend he say archly and you great american novel be likely to be a respectable success there sound a crash upon a floor somewhere in the house and he hold he breath to listen it be the ritualistic organist go to bed -lrb- _ to be continue _ -rrb- -lrb- footnote 1 : the few remain chapter with which it be propose to conclude this adaptation of _ the mystery of edwin drood _ should not be construe as involve presumptuous attempt to divine that full solution of the latter which the pen of its lament author be not permit to reach no further correspondence with the tenor of the unfinished english story be intend than the adapter will endeavor to justify to he own conscience and that of he reader by at least one unmistakable foreshadow circumstance of the

of parisian beauty the burlesque german of the grand duchy of gerolstein have vanish before the grim and earnest countryman of grand and simple old king william it will be long before the french player find heart to burlesque anew the german soldiery it will be some time let we hope before the german player at the fourteenth street theater give way to the shameless antic of french opera-bouffe buffoon punchinello give a glad farewell -- with no thought of say _ au revoir _ -- to the french folly that have give the french theater so unenviable a reputation and he wave he pointed hat in joyful welcome to seebach and she german friend who have make the fourteenth street theater a temple of the classic drama like other place which can properly be call dramatic temple the theater now partake of the solemnity of a religious temple one go to see seebach not to laugh but to test one 's ability to suppress the desire to weep over the woe of margaret and to mourn with mary stuart fortify yourself o reader with a substantial dinner and much previous sleep and come with I for a night of german tragedy come to the fourteenth street theater not to look back regretfully at depart opera-bouffe but to seebach it be with such reckless pun as the foregoing that i endeavor to brace you spirit for the exhausting struggle with six hour of tragedy play in the most tragic and awful of modern language you be to hear _ faust _ in german no man who have accomplish this feat can wonder at the stolid bravery of the german infantry it be say that the new recruit be force to hear _ faust _ once a week during he first year of service this terrible discipline have the natural effect of give he that steadiness under fire at which the world marvel he will stand with he regiment for hour under the merciless fire of the mitrailleuse with no thought of flight what terror can shot or shell have for he who have be teach to listen unmoved to the dialogue of faust and mephistophele in the first thirty-two act of _ faust _ we find the theater full of german wear that grave and earnest expression of countenance wherewith the german take he legitimate tragedy sprinkle among the german be several american more grave and more in earnest than even they teutonic neighbor for they be strain they attention to detect a familiar german word -- such as mein herr or ach when once they have hear the expect syllable they smile a placid smile of contentment and remark one to another i can understand pretty nearly everything that be say -- with the exception of course of a occasional word we take we seat and wait for the entrance of seebach the curtain rise upon faust pursue he study in middle-age respectability and a dressing-gown to he after hour of soliloquy enter mephistophele we observe with surprise that those estimable gentleman col thoma w knox and hon erastus brook have be engage to play faust and mephistophele respectively to be sure the program inform we that these part be take by two newly import german actor but we prefer the evidence of we sens to the assertion of the program have knox and brook be copy in german if not they be now play in fourteenth street do not tell I that it be merely a accidental resemblance have not i play billiards with the gallant colonel and go to sleep when the honorable editor be speak in congress and shall i now be tell that i do not know they when i see they but this be irrelevant hour of dialogue succeed to the previous hour of soliloquy at interval of fifteen minute the curtain be drop to enable the actor to discuss mug of beer and the audience to discuss the actor during these interval we hear such remark as these : 1st german subjectively consider _ faust _ be a tragedy objectively we might regard it as a comedy to the subjective-objective view it be certainly a ballet pantomime ach he be many-sided we goethe here in this drama he have accomplish everything there be food for we laughter and we tear it excite we and calm we 1st american i should think it do calm we that be why the old fellow go to sleep and snore all through the last twelve act i think it be the heaviest and stupidest play that be ever put on the stage of course it be the greatest thing ever write but then i prefer daly 's _ gaslight _ myself 2nd german ah my friend how this sublime creation stir the inner depths of we spiritual nature ach himmel it be the poem of humanity let we go out for beer 2d american when be we go to see seebach usher she do not appear until the twenty-third act sir that will be on about three hour from now 2d american come tom let 's go and have supper i be get exhaust usher step this way sir mr grau have some refreshment at you service and they go in search of the cold ham and beer which the beneficent grau have kindly provide refresh by much beer and enliven by the cheery influence of the genial sandwich they return for a few more hour of soliloquy and dialogue time pass slowly but surely at last we reach a act in which seebach walk quietly across the stage the curtain instantly drop amid the sob of the excited audience 1st german lend I you handkerchief my friend that i may wipe away my tear i have a sausage wrap up in mine but what be sausage compare with art how divinely seebach walk to I she seem like a incarnation of pure reason a avatar of the spirit of transcendental philosophy come we will pledge she in beer 1st american what be they make all that row about -- just because seebach walk across the stage why she never say a word 2d american let 's go round to the hotel and take a quiet sleep till she come on again i have get my night-clothes with I always bring 'em when i go to see german tragedy then ensue other hour of dialogue intersperse with soliloquy of half a hour each intersperse also with perpetual drop of the curtain whereby the play be make to last some eight or ten hour longer than would otherwise be the case most of the german music that have be write during the last three century be play by the orchestra during these intermission but in course of time seebach give we the garden scene win we frantic admiration by she inimitable tenderness and grace and finally we reach that grandest scene ever write by dramatist that most pathetic poem ever conceive by poet -- the meeting of faust and margaret in prison at last we be more than repay for the dreary
