a native of the district of cleveland yorkshire but of he ancestry there be now very little satisfactory information to be obtain nichol in he topographer and genealogist suggest that jame cooke the celebrated mariner be probably of common origin with the stockton cooke he reason for the suggestion be that a branch of the family possess a crayon portrait of some relation which be suppose to resemble the great discoverer he make no explanation of the difference in spelling of the two name and admit that the sailor 's family be say to come from scotland dr george young certainly the most reliable authority on cook 's early year who publish a life in 1836 go to whitby as vicar about 1805 and claim to have obtain much information about he subject through intercourse with he relative friend and acquaintance include one or two survive school companion and appear to be satisfy that cook be of scotch extraction dr george johnston a very careful writer state in he natural history of the eastern border that in 1692 the father of jame thomson the author of the season be minister of ednam roxburghshire and a man name john cook be one of the elder of the kirk this john cook marry on the 19th January 1693 a woman name jean duncan by whom he have a son jame baptised 4th march 1694 and this child johnston positively assert be afterwards the father of the future captain cook the date of the marriage and baptism have be verify by the reverend john burleigh minister of ednam and they agree with the probable date of the birth of cook 's father for he die in 1778 at the age of eighty-five owe to the loss of the church record for some year after 1698 mr burleigh be unable to trace when this jame cook leave ednam to better himself but he would take with he a testificate of church membership which might possibly but not probably still exist attract perhaps by the number of scotch people who flock into the north of yorkshire to follow the alum trade then at its height jame cook settle down and marry and the first positive information to be obtain be that he and he wife grace -lrb- she maiden name have so far escape identification though she be know to have be a native of cleveland -rrb- reside for some time at morton in the parish of ormsby and here they eldest child john be bear in January 1727 dr young say that jame cook have a superstition that he mother 's farewell be prophetic of he marriage for she word be god send you grace birth-place shortly after the birth of john the cook leave morton for marton a village a few mile away and the similarity of the two name have cause some confusion at marton the father work for a mr mewburn living in a small cottage build of mud call in the district a clay biggin this cottage be pull down in 1786 when major rudd erect a mansion near the spot afterwards when the mansion be burn to the ground the site of the cottage be plant with tree and be popularly know as cook 's garth dr young be show the spot by a old shoemaker whose wife 's mother be present at captain cook 's birth and he say there be a willow-tree occupy the site but no vestige of the wall be leave mr bolckow the present owner of marton hall say : the cottage be find destroy when my uncle buy marton in 1854 but we come across the foundation of it when the grounds be lay out a granite vase have be erect on the spot the pump which besant say still exist and be make by cook 's father to supply he house with water be put there after cook 's time and have disappear in this humble clay biggin jame cook the circumnavigator be bear on 27th October 1728 and be register as baptise on 3rd November in the marton church record be enter as ye son of a day labourer he be one of several child most of whom die young john the eldest who live till he be twenty-three and margaret who marry a redcar fisherman name jame fleck be the only two that come to maturity the cook remain at marton for some year during which time they remove to another cottage and young jame receive some instruction from a mistress mary walker who teach he he letter and a little reading dr young and kippis call she the village schoolmistress but ord who be a descendant on he mother 's side say : she be the daughter of the wealthiest farmer in the neighborhood and wife of william walker a respectable yeoman of the first class reside at marton grange young jame a lad of less than eight year old work for mr walker : tend the stock take the horse to water and run errand for the family and in return for such service the good lady find he a intelligent active youth be please to teach he he alphabet and reading in 1736 cook 's father be appoint to the position of hind or bailiff by mr skottowe and remove with he family to airy holme farm near ayton accord to besant a hind be one who reside on a farm be pay a regular wage for carry on the work and handed over the proceeds to the landlord young jame now eight year of age be send to the school on the high green keep by a mr pullen where he be instruct in write and arithmetic as far as the first few rule -- read have apparently be acquire before he be say to have show a special aptitude for arithmetic and it be believe that owe to the good report of he progress mr skottowe pay for he schooling accord to dr young he schoolfellow give he the character of be fond of he own way and when any project be on foot for birds-nesting or other boyish amusement and discussion arise as to the method to be pursue he would propound he own plan and insist on they superiority should he view not meet with approval he would pertinaciously adhere to they even at the risk of be abandon by he companion staithe most authority say that cook be bind apprentice to mr saunderson a grocer and haberdasher of staithe at the age of thirteen but mr dodd saunderson 's daughter tell dr young that after leave school he remain on the farm help he father till 1745 when he be seventeen year old and then go to staithe to she father on a verbal agreement without indenture and would thus be free to leave or be discharge at any time the shop and house where he be engage be situate about three hundred yard from the present slipway and close to the sea in fact so close that in 1812 it be threaten by the water and be pull down by saunderson 's successor mr john smailey and the material as far as possible be use in erect the building in church street which be now point out as cook 's shop the late mr waddington of grosmont near whitby say he visit staithe in 1887 and find the original site cover by deep water he be inform by a old man who as a boy have assist in remove the stock from the old shop that not only be the stone use again in church street but also most of the woodwork include the present door with its iron knocker at which probably cook himself have knock many a time at staithe cook remain as saunderson 's assistant for about eighteen month and it may easily be imagine how this grow lad listen with all he ear to the tale of the old sailor recall brave deed and strange experience in storm and shine on that element which for so many year be to be he home and at length impel by some instinctive feeling that on it lay the path ready at he foot to lead he on to future distinction he vow to himself that he would not bind down he life to the petty round of a country storekeeper at length the opportunity come which be relate in a breezy and life-like manner by besant as follow after paint saunderson 's character in color of a rather disagreeable hue as one too fond of he grog for himself and he stick for he apprentice he say that cook steal a shill out of the till pack up he luggage in a single pocket-handkerchief run away across the moor to whitby find a ship on the point of sailing jump on board offer he service as cabin boy be at once accept show himself so smart and attentive that he completely win the heart of the sour-visaged mate and through he good grace be eventually bind apprentice to the owner of the ship and thus lay the foundation of he fortune this account do not explain how it be that the dishonest runaway apprentice it depict continue to retain the friendship and esteem of he master and mr dodd apprentice to the sea there undoubtedly be a difficulty about a shilling and dr young 's version gather from those who know cook personally and live in staithe and whitby at the time be more probable he say that cook have notice a south sea shilling and be strike by the unusual design -lrb- it be only coin in 1723 -rrb- change it for one of he own saunderson have also notice it and when he miss it enquire for it perhaps in somewhat unmeasured term but on the matter be explain be fully satisfied afterwards see that the boy be bent upon a sea life he obtain the father 's permission and take young jame to whitby himself where he introduce he to mr john walker a member of a shipping firm of repute to whom he be bind apprentice -lrb- not to the firm -rrb- and with whom he never lose touch till the end of he life the period of apprenticeship be on the authority of messr john and henry walker three year and not either seven or nine as be usually state and the difficulty about be apprentice to both saunderson and walker be of course set at rest by mr dodd 's explanation whitby be at the time a very important center of the coast trade and possess several shipbuilding yard of good reputation and it be in a whitby-built ship the freelove that cook make he first voyage she be a vessel of about 450 ton -lrb- some 80 ton larger than the celebrated bark endeavor -rrb- be employ in the coal trade up and down the east coast and no doubt cook pick up many a wrinkle of seamanship and many a lesson of the value of promptitude in the time of danger which would prove of service when he come to the day of independent command : for the north sea have from time immemorial be reckon a grand school from which to obtain true sailorman for the royal service as usual in those day cook stay in he employer 's house in the interval between he trip and he time ashore be longer during the winter month as the ship be generally lay up the house in grape street at present occupy by mr braithwaite be point out as the one where he live whilst with mr walker but this be incorrect for mr waddington ascertain from the rate book that mr walker 's mother be live there at that time and mr walker live in haggargate from 1734 to 1751 remove thence to the north side of bakehouse yard in that year and to grape street in 1752 after he mother 's death that be he do not reside in grape street till three year after cook 's apprenticeship be end when follow the usual custom he would have to fend for himself during these period of leisure between he voyage cook endeavor to improve he store of knowledge and it be believe he receive some instruction in elementary navigation he make great friend with mr walker 's housekeeper mary prowd from whom he obtain the concession of a table and a light in a quiet corner away from the other where he might read and write in peace that he work hard to improve himself be evident from the fact that mr walker push he on at every opportunity and give he as vary a experience of thing nautical as lay in he power after several voyage in the freelove -lrb- which be state by the yorkshire gazette to have be lose together with one hundred and fifty passenger and the winter 's supply of gingerbread for whitby off either the french or dutch coast one stormy christmas the date not give -rrb- cook be send to assist in rigging and fitting for sea a vessel call the three brother some 600 ton burden which be still in existence towards the close of last century when she be complete cook make two or three trip in she with coal and then she be employ for some month as a transport for troops from middleburg to dublin and liverpool she be pay off by the government at deptford in the spring of 1749 and then trade to norway during which time cook complete he apprenticeship that be in July 1749 cook tell the naturalist of the second south sea voyage mr forster that on one of he trip to norway the rigging of the ship be completely cover with bird that have be drive off the land by a heavy gale and amongst they be several hawk who make the best of they opportunity with the small bird offer command when he apprenticeship have expire he go before the mast for about three year in 1750 he be in the baltic trade on the marium own by mr john wilkinson of whitby and command by mr gaskin a relative of the walker the following year he be in a stockton ship and in 1752 he be appoint mate of messr walker 's new vessel the friendship on board of which he continue for three year and of which on the authority of mr samwell the surgeon of the discovery on the third voyage who pay a visit to whitby on he return and receive he information from the walker he would have be give the command have he remain longer in the mercantile marine this be rapid promotion for a youth with nothing to back he up but he own exertion and strict attention to duty and tend to prove that he have take full advantage of the opportunity that fall in he way and have even then display a power of acquire knowledge of he profession beyond the average about this time cook 's father seem to have give up he position at airy holme farm and turn he attention to build a house in ayton be still point out as he work but have apparently be partially rebuild for dr young speak of it as a stone house and it be now partly brick but the stone doorway still remain with the initial jgc for jame and grace cook and the date 1755 the old man have be represent as completely uneducated but this can not have be true colman in he random recollection write of a visit he pay to redcar about 1773 relate how a venerable old man be point out who : only two or three year previously have learn to read that he might gratify a parent 's pride and love by peruse he son 's first voyage round the world he be the father of captain cook if it be true that he be the son of a elder of the scottish church it be extremely improbable that he be entirely uneducated and the position he hold as hind to mr skottowe would necessitate at any rate some knowledge of keep farm account more convincing information still be to be find in the leed mercury of 27th October 1883 where mr george markham tweddell of stokesley write : i may mention that captain cook 's father be not the illiterate man he have be represent and i have lie on my study table as i write a deed bear he signature date 1755 and the father 's signature bear a resemblance to that of he distinguished son reading be invariably learn before write and as in 1755 the old man be sixty-one it be evident he do not wait till he be eighty to learn to read father 's grave he claim to have carve the inscription on the family tombstone in great ayton churchyard and after spend the last year of he life under the roof of he son-in-law jame fleck of redcar he die on 1st April 1778 aged eighty-four year he be bury in marske churchyard but there be nothing to mark he grave and its place have long be forget he death be register as that of a day labourer chapter 2 1755 to 1757 hm eagle notwithstanding the treaty of aix-la-chapelle 1748 trouble be constantly arise between the french and english in which the american colony of both nation take a conspicuous part and ultimately lead to open war the first shot be fire on 10th June 1755 although war be not formally declare till may 1756 in June 1755 the friendship be in the thame and it be say that to avoid the hot press which have be order cook first go into hide for some time and then decide to volunteer this be untrue for as have be show he have already make up he mind and have refuse messr walker 's offer of the command of one of they ship the acceptance of which would have save he from the press as master be exempt he now see he opportunity have come he know that experienced man be difficult to obtain that man of a certain amount of nautical knowledge and of good character could soon raise themselves above the rank of ordinary seaman and have doubtless in he mind many case of those who enter as seaman find they way to the quarterdeck and know he have only to ask the walker for letter of recommendation for they to be at he service he determine to take the important step and volunteer into the royal navy it must be remember that this act of leave employment which to most man of he position would have seem most satisfactory be not the act of hot-headed youth no step take in mere spirit of adventure but the calmly reason act of a man of twenty-seven year and some eight or nine year experience of both the rough and smooth side of maritime life several letter be write to mr walker one or two of which relate to a later period be see and copy by dr young but they fall into the hand of a niece who unfortunately not recognize they value destroy they shortly before she death which occur some year ago however it be certain that he write one about this time and evidently receive a favourable reply for he shortly afterwards write again acknowledge the service do he enter navy have make up he mind how to proceed cook go to a rendezvous at wapping and volunteer into hm eagle a fourth-rate 60-gun ship with a complement of 400 man and 56 marine at that time moor in portsmouth harbor on the muster roll preserve in the record office the follow entry occur : 161 from london rendezvous jame cook ab entry June 17th 1755 first appearance June 25th 1755 on the 24th July that be thirty-seven day after the date of entry into the navy he be rate as master 's mate a position he hold till 30th June 1757 when he quit hm eagle he appointment be facilitate by the difficulty experience in obtain man for the service as may be gather from captain hamar 's letter who write apply to the admiralty for permission to break up he london rendezvous as he say it have procure very few man and those only landsman again he complain of the quality of the man he have receive and say he be one hundred and forty short of he complement in another letter : i do not believe there be a worse man would ship in the navy yesterday i receive from the bristol twenty-five supernumerary belong to different ship but not one seaman among they : but on the contrary all very indifferent landsman these complaint be endorse by captain pallisser who succeed hamar on the eagle for he write that some of the crew be turn over from ship to ship so often that he be quite unable to make out they original one : they be such that none choose to own they of forty-four say to belong to the ramily she want only six the other day but she boatswain could find out only those amongst they that he think worth have in the face of these deficiency in quantity and quality of man and remember the good character he doubtless obtain from mr walker there can be no surprise that when cook sail out of a english port for the first time as a royal navy sailor he hold the rating of master 's mate it be usual to look upon he as a explorer and surveyor only but a little enquiry show that he play a active part in some of the most stir event of the next few year the record of he personal deed be want but he ship see service and from he character it be certain that when duty call jame cook would not be find want many of the man under whom he serve have leave behind name that will always be associate with the construction of the present british empire and with most of they he be in immediate personal contact and obtain in every case they respect in some they close personal friendship pallisser command on the 1st July the eagle be order to fit and provision for the leeward island but have receive 62 man and 53 marine the order be change to cruise between scilly and cape clear and she sail on the 4th August she be catch in a gale off the old head of kinsale and receive some damage and she main mast be report as spring so she return to plymouth for survey and repair think that the removal of the mast would be a good opportunity to scrape he ship which be very foul captain hamar have she lighten for that purpose but on examination the mast be find to be in good order and the admiralty be so annoyed at the absence of the ship from she cruise ground that they order captain pallisser to take over the command and prepare for sea without further loss of time this he do on the 1st October and sail from plymouth on the 7th and after cruise about in the channel and make a few small capture he return on the 22nd November remain till the 13th march and during this time cook have a short spell of sickness but it can hardly be call serious as he be only in hospital for ten day be back to he duty on the 17th February in April when off the isle of bass bring to and send on board the cutter a petty officer and five man with arm provision etc this extract from the log record cook 's first independent command the cutter be one of two hire vessel which have join the squadron the previous day under convoy and the armed party be probably put on board as a precaution against privateer who be at that time pretty busy on the french coast cook take she into plymouth sound and he and he five man go on board the st alban and in she rejoin he own ship on the 2nd may and then return to plymouth on the 4th June pallisser in report he arrival to the secretary of the admiralty say that he have : put ashore to the hospital 130 sick man most of which be extremely ill : bury in the last month twenty-two the surgeon and four man die yesterday and the surgeon 's two mate be extremely ill : have thirty-five man absent in prize and thirty-five short of complement so that we be now in a very weak condition this sickness and mortality be attribute to the absolute want of proper clothing many of the man have come on board with only what they stand in and some in rag so the captain ask for permission to issue a extra supply of slop a request that be immediately grant duc d'aquitaine after another short cruise the eagle return to plymouth with pallisser very ill with fever he obtain sick leave and captain proby be order to take command but be detain so long in the downs by contrary wind that pallisser who have hear a rumor of a french squadron have be see in the channel shake off he fever and resume the command of he ship which be almost ready for sea every part of the channel mention in the rumor be carefully search but no sign of the enemy be see and the author of the report a swede be detain in portsmouth for some month on the 19th November the eagle 's crew be increase to 420 man and she be keep cruise throughout the winter and on the 4th January 1757 she be catch in a heavy gale off the isle of wight where she have most of she sail blow out of she on 25th may she sail from plymouth sound in company with hm medway and a day or two afterwards they fall in with and chase a french east indiaman the duc d'aquitaine in rather heavy weather the medway be lead but when get close have to bring to in order to clear for action as otherwise she would be unable to open she lee port pallisser on the other hand be all ready and press on bring the chase to action after a hard set-to lasting about three-quarter of a hour the frenchman strike have lose 50 man kill and 30 wound whilst the eagle lose 10 kill and 80 wound and the list of damages to the ship report to the admiralty show that the action be sharp though short the medway be only able to afford assistance by firing a few rake shot and suffer no damage except have ten man wound by a accidental explosion of gunpowder the mast and sail of the prize be so much damage that she lose they all in the night one of the mast in fall sink the medway 's cutter it be find she have a complement of 493 man and be arm with 50 gun she have land she east indian cargo at lisbon and then proceed to cruise for fourteen day on the look-out for a english convoy sailing in charge of hm mermaid she have succeed in pick up one prize a english brig which be ransom for 200 pound this be cook 's first experience of a important naval action and pallisser be compliment by the lord of the admiralty for he gallant conduct the duc d'aquitaine be purchase for the navy and be enter under she own name as a third-rate 64 gun ship with a complement of 500 man the eagle return with she consort and she prize to plymouth and soon afterwards cook 's connection with she come to a end accord to dr kippi mr walker have interest the member for scarborough mr osbaldiston on the subject of cook 's promotion but the rule be that candidate for lieutenancy must have be employ on board a king 's ship for a period of not less than six year and a order have recently be issue that this regulation be to be strictly adhere to captain pallisser therefore write to mr osbaldiston that cook : have be too short a time in the service for a commission but that a master 's warrant might be give he by which he would be raise to a station that he be well qualify to discharge with ability and credit the result of this correspondence be show in the eagle 's muster roll for on 27th June jame cook attend he last muster and on the 30th he be discharge the succeed roll register d 30th June 1757 solebay prefmnt the mercury cook at this point all the writer on captain cook have be lead into error by follow the lead of dr kippi everyone -lrb- with the single exception of lord brougham who by a evident slip of the pen put he on board the mersey -rrb- write that he be appoint master of hm mercury and that he join the fleet of admiral saunder in the gulf of st lawrence at the time of the capture of quebec in that ship from the public record it have be ascertain that the mercury be not in the gulf of st lawrence with saunder but in the latter half of 1759 be send to new york thence to boston and be at spithead in April the following year the same source also show that not only be the circumnavigator never on board the mercury in any capacity but in all probability he never even see she he be also say to have be master 's mate on the pembroke and dr kippi have he appoint to three different ship on three consecutive day : the grampus but she sail before cook could join she the garland but she be find to have a master when cook join and lastly the mercury the explanation of this confusion as far as the mercury be concerned -lrb- the rest be imagination -rrb- be that there be a second jame cook in the service who be appoint master of the mercury under a warrant date 15th may 1759 and enter on he duty immediately he be with he ship at sheerness on 12th July at which time he namesake be before quebec on the return of the mercury from boston she master be return for some time as sick on shore and on 11th June 1760 be supersede by one john emerton soon after he be appoint third lieutenant of the gosport he commission bearing date 1st April 1760 that be before he leave the mercury he be with he new ship at the recapture of st john 's newfoundland in 1762 with john jervis afterwards lord st vincent as he captain in 1765 he be on the wolf on the jamaica station and be select by admiral burnaby to carry despatch to the governor of yucatan this duty he successfully carry out and in 1796 publish a pamphlet describe he adventure during the journey on he return to england he apply to the duke of newcastle for the command of a cutter and the letter be now in the british museum have be include in a collection in mistake for one write by he celebrated namesake there be a certain similarity in the writing but in the signature he write the christian name as ja whilst captain cook usually write jam the mercury cook be lieutenant of the speedwell in 1773 and have have some property leave he in jersey he receive leave of absence in August he never rise above lieutenant and disappear from the navy list after July 1800 a manuscript log keep by jame cook whilst master 's mate of the eagle be now in the possession of mr alexander turnbull of wellington new zealand chapter 3 1757 to 1759 hm pembroke cook join hm solebay on the 30th July 1757 at leith where she be then station but the date of he warrant have not be ascertain although the public record and trinity house have both be search for the purpose he stay be not long for after a cruise of a few day she return to leith and on 17th September cook be supersede by john nichol in fact he time on board be so short that he signature be not append to any of the roll in April 1757 mr bissett who be master of the eagle when cook be master 's mate and who therefore would have a better chance than any one else to measure he subordinate 's character and capability be appoint master of hm pembroke a new ship and superintend she fitting for sea on 26th October he find himself transfer to the stirl castle and it be only reasonable to suppose that have form a high opinion of cook 's work and know of he ambition to rise in the service he would give information of the opportunity and as far as he could push forward he friend 's interest at any rate the muster roll show that in less than six week from leave the solebay cook be establish on board the pembroke as master under a warrant bearing date 18th October 1757 and enter upon he duty on 27th October the twenty-ninth anniversary of he birth and from that date to he discharge into the northumberland he sign the usual document at the time of he join the ship be fitting and victual for sea at portsmouth and on 8th November she sail for the bay of biscay under the command of captain simcoe return to plymouth on 9th February 1758 louisberg the british government have decide on make a determine effort to wrest the colony of new france from the hand of the french and one of the few step be to attempt the capture of the port of louisburg at the entrance to the gulf of st lawrence a place which the enemy be say to have render almost impregnable at a expenditure of some million and a quarter pound they look upon it as second only to quebec in its importance to the safe keep of the colony in order to carry out this design a fleet be prepare under admiral boscawen -lrb- know to he man as old dreadnought and from a peculiar carriage of the head say to have be contract from a youthful habit of imitate one of he father 's old servant wry-necked-dick -rrb- to convey a small army under major-general amherst to the scene of action boscawen sail with he fleet one member of which be the pembroke for halifax where they arrive via madeira and the bermuda on 8th may have complete he arrangement boscawen leave halifax on 28th may with 17 sail of the royal navy and 127 transport pick up 2 more men-of-war and 8 transport just outside and a couple more of the latter a few hour later he have to leave behind at halifax with order to rejoin he as soon as they be fit several ship the pembroke be one as they crew be so weaken by scurvy during the voyage from england the pembroke have lose 29 man but be sufficiently recover to be able to sail with 3 transport 2 schooner and a cattle sloop on 7th June and arrive off louisburg on the 12th four day too late to take part in the landing which have be successfully carry out in the face of great difficulty cause by the roughness of the weather the rocky coast and the opposition of the enemy in fact jame wolfe who be a brigadier throughout the siege and on whose shoulder a very large portion of the work seem to have fall say : we landing be next to miraculous there be 3 officer and 49 man kill 5 officer and 59 man wound of the army 11 man kill and 4 officer and 29 man wound of the navy and 19 man wound of the transport service the weather be so bad that no store or artillery could be land for several day the first gun be get ashore on the 16th so cook be in plenty of time to take he share in the difficult task of landing supply a task so dangerous that the fleet lose one hundred boat in this duty alone as well as form the supply base for the army the fleet also provide 583 man to act as gunner and engineer ashore but none of these be from the pembroke the nature of the ground render the work of construct the approach and battery extremely difficult and it be not till 20th June that the first gun open fire wolfe form a battery on lighthouse point one side of the entrance to the harbor whilst the town be on the other side with a fortified island in between and the harbor hold a french fleet which at the time of the arrival of the british consist of nine men-of-war one escape on the very day of the landing and be shortly afterwards follow by two more one l'echo be capture by sir charle hardy and be take into the british navy whilst the other though chase for some distance make good its escape to l'orient with the first news of the siege previously to the come of the british two ship have be sink in the harbor 's mouth to render entrance therein difficult two more be add to these and then a fifth one ship be blow up by a british shell and set fire to two other that lay alongside she they also be destroy the fate of the other two be describe in the pembroke 's log keep by cook as follow : in the night 50 boat man would and arm would row would into the harbor under the command of the captain la foure -lrb- laforey -rrb- of the hunter and balfor -lrb- of the etna -rrb- in order to cut away the 2 man-of-war and tow they into the north-east harbor one of which they do viz : the ben fison -lrb- bienfaisant -rrb- of 64 gun the prudon -lrb- prudent -rrb- 74 gun be aground be set on fire at 11 be the firing cease on both side the boat concern in this attack which boscawen describe as a very brilliant affair well carry out be a barge and pinnace or cutter from all the ship except the northumberland which be too sickly command by a lieutenant mate or midshipman and dr grahame in he history of the united state of north america say : the renowned captain cook then serve as a petty officer on board of a british ship-of-war co-operate in this exploit and write a account of it to a friend in england that he have distinguish himself may be infer from he promotion to the rank of lieutenant in the royal navy which take place immediately after this statement that he be in the affair may be true but there be no evidence on the point and as he be a warrant and not petty officer and as he promotion do not take place for several year dr grahame 's story may well be doubt it be believe that cook do write to mr walker from louisburg but the letter be one of those so unfortunately destroy the loss on this occasion to the british be very slight there be only 7 kill and 9 wound the bienfaisant have be survey be receive into the navy and give to captain balfor whilst the command of l'echo be confer on captain laforey in consequence of this success and the threat of a immediate assault on the town the french commander m drucor decide to surrender on the follow day this success be highly esteem in england and admiral boscawen and general amherst receive the thanks of the house of parliament wolfe and hardy after the siege wolfe write to lord george sackville speaking in warm term of boscawen and he man and say : sir charle hardy too in particular and all the officer of the navy in general have give we they utmost assistance and with the greatest cheerfulness imaginable i have often be in pain for sir charle 's squadron at a anchor off the harbor 's mouth they rid out some very hard gale of wind rather than leave a opening for the french to escape but notwithstanding the utmost diligence on he side a frigate find means to get out and be go to europe charge de fanfaronade i have the satisfaction of put 2 or 3 hautvizier shell into she stern and to shatter he a little with some of you lordship 's 24 pound shot before he retreat and i much question whether he will hold out the voyage the pembroke form one of this squadron under sir charle hardy and after the capitulation of the town be despatch with nine other ship and a small body of troops under wolfe to harry the french settlement around gaspe bay as a preparation for the attack on quebec it be intend to make in the following year several settlement and magazine be destroy four gun and a pair of color be capture and then the squadron return to halifax for the winter admiral sir charle saunder be select to command the fleet that be to be employ in this new movement against the capital of new france a man of whom horace walpole write : the admiral be a pattern of the most sturdy bravery unite with the most unaffected modesty no man say less or deserve more simplicity in he manners generosity and good-nature adorn he genuine love of he country with durell 's squadron he leave spithead on 17th February 1759 with the intention of call at louisburg the appoint rendezvous for the expedition on he way to halifax but the season have be so severe that louisburg usually free from ice be find to be unapproachable so he go on arrive at halifax on 30th April admiral durell have be send out earlier from england and be now despatch from halifax with a squadron of which the pembroke be one to prevent if possible the entry into the river of the usual spring fleet from france with supplies and reinforcement for quebec and to keep the french from put up any fortification on the ile aux coudres thereby add to the difficulty of the fleet in ascend this dangerous portion of river the weather be bad and the trouble cause by fog and ice so great that durell find the fleet of 18 sail convoy by two frigate have escape he but one or two small store ship be capture which prove of service to the british afterwards on the way up the gulf captain simcoe of the pembroke die and the ship be give temporarily to lieutenant collin of durell 's ship and afterwards to captain wheelock who remain in she till after cook leave durell 's squadron arrive off the ile aux coudres on the 25th and on the 28th the pembroke land the troops she have on board as do ye rest of ye man of warr and they take possession of the island which be find to be desert by its inhabitant the troops that be on board durell 's ship be under the command of colonel carleton the quartermaster-general of the force and wolfe 's great friend whose service have only be obtain from the king with the greatest difficulty whilst await the arrival of saunder with the remainder of the expeditionary force every endeavor be make to gain knowledge of the difficulty of the river and cook 's log note how the boat be out sound ye channel of ye traverse and on the 11th June there be : return satisfied with be acquaint with ye channel the traverse here speak of be that channel run from a high black-looking cape know as cape torment across into the south channel pass between the east end of the ile d'orleans and ile madame it be still look upon as one of the worst piece of the river navigation the british have some chart of the river show the course take by the french vessel for in a note to the order issue by saunder on 15th may to the master of transport special attention be call to a plan or chart show the route which he excellency intend to make from louisburg harbor to the island of bic and this chart be most probably take from one capture by boscawen in 1755 and publish in September 1759 by t kitchen in the london magazine have the traverse show on a larger scale the sounding take at the time durell be wait would be to verify those show on this chart after a short delay in halifax saunder leave for louisburg to gather up the remainder of the force and store and on he arrival still find the port hamper by ice in fact major knox of the 43rd regiment relate that even so late as 1st June man be able to get ashore from they ship step from one piece of ice to another there be also further cause for dissatisfaction delay in the arrival of the ship with soldier and store some of the troops have be direct to other work without any intimation to wolfe whilst other be in a very bad state from scurvy and measle some have lose they entire equipment and it be with the greatest difficulty replace the supply of money be criminally small and yet it be pleasant to read on the authority of major knox that : i have the inexpressible pleasure to observe at louisburg that we whole armament naval and military be in high spirit and though by all account we shall have a numerous army and a variety of difficulty to cope with yet under such admiral and general among whom we have the happiness to behold the most cordial unanimity together with so respectable a fleet and a body of well-appointed regular troops we have every reason to hope for the greatest success order to transport before leave saunder issue he instruction as to the order of sailing he divide the transport into two division the starboard fly a red flag and the larboard a white one : he assign to each vessel its position and duty and point out to each master of a hire transport that if the order of he officer be not promptly and exactly carry out they would be fire on add with a touch of grim humor that the cost of the powder and shoot so expend would be carefully note and charge against the hire of the offend ship on the 6th June saunder be off newfoundland with 22 man-of-war and 119 transport and the cold wind blow off the snow-covered hill of that island be severely feel by the troops on the 18th when off the island of bic they be join by wolfe in the richmond and five day after pick up durell at the ile aux coudres here saunder transfer he flag to the stirl castle which he have select in england for the purpose owe to she handiness -lrb- cook 's friend mr bissett be still on board -rrb- and leave durell with eleven of the deepest draught to guard against any interference from a french fleet he proceed up the river with the remainder the work be hard constantly anchor and weigh to take every advantage of wind and tide and the progress be slow but at length the whole of the ship pass the traverse and on the 26th the fleet anchor off st laurent on the ile d'orleans and the troops be land on the follow day thus the much-dreaded passage up the st lawrence have be carry out and the fact that no loss of any kind have occur to either man-of-war or transport reflect the very greatest credit on all engage in the operation knox relate how the master of the transport he be on a brother of trinity house and thame pilot name killick refuse the service of a french prisoner as pilot and observe damme i 'll show they a englishman can go where a frenchman dar 'n' t show he nose take he ship up himself chaff the occupant of the mark boat as he pass and in the end declare that it be no worse than the thame the wonderful success of they passage be emphasise the afternoon after they arrival at st laurent when a heavy gale strike the fleet drive several ship into collision or ashore and cause considerable loss in anchor and cable as soon as possible the men-of-war boat be out render every assistance and all the vessel be secure but two which be too firmly fix to be tow off shore and these be soon afterwards burn by the enemy firework think to profit by the disorder which must necessarily have be cause by the storm the french make a determine attempt to destroy the fleet by means of eight fireship which be float down stream on the unsuspecting british fortunately they be ignite prematurely and the boat of the pembroke and other ship be again out employ in the hazardous task of tow these undesired visitor into such place as would permit they to burn themselves out without danger to the shipping six be quickly get into safety whilst the other two ground and burn out without cause further inconvenience captain knox describe the scene as a display of the grandest firework that can possibly be conceive the only result be to cause the retirement of a picket at the western end of the ile d'orleans and the officer in command who think he be about to be attack in force be to have be try by court-martial but be advise to throw himself on wolfe 's mercy be pardon for he error of judgment to guard against a repetition of such a attack a system of guard boat some moor across the river and some patrolling be establish entail considerable extra work on the sailor a examination of the position show admiral saunder that the safety of the fleet and therefore the interest of the army would be best consult if he proceed into the basin of quebec as to remain coop up in the south channel add to the danger if a further attempt should be make to fire the fleet he therefore point out to wolfe that the small battery establish by the french on point levus which threaten any ship enter into the basin should be take and the point occupy this be at once carry out by monckton 's brigade and a battery be establish which do serious damage to the town when too late the french send over three float battery to aid in repulse the english but they be drive back by one broadside from a frigate saunder move up for the purpose montcalm have entrench he army on the north bank of the st lawrence between the river charle and montmorencus and wolfe determine to seize on a piece of high ground to the east of the montmorencus to form a camp there and endeavor to force on a general action in pursuance of this design a body of about 3000 man be land successfully on 9th July under the protect fire of some of the fleet and a camp be form and the next few day provide employment for the boat of the pembroke and other ship in landing man store and artillery the bombardment of the town open on 12th July from the battery erect at point levus and a portion of the fleet and continue with little intermission till 13th September when fire be open on the town other ship in the basin and gun at the camp at montmorencus open on montcalm 's line at beauport on the 18th two men-of-war two armed sloop and two transport succeed in pass the town without loss but a third ship the diana run aground in try to avoid collision with a transport and be attack by the enemy 's boat but be bring off by the pembroke and richmond she be so seriously damage that she have to be send to boston for repair and then return to england on the 20th wolfe join the up-river squadron in a barge and in pass the town have he mast carry away by a shot from the sillery battery but no further damage be do he make a short reconnaissance which lead to nothing at the time but may have have a important influence in the choice of a landing-place afterwards attack on beauport on he return to he camp at montmorencus he decide to make a attack on the left of the french line from boat and from he camp over a ford which be available at low tide between the fall of montmorencus and the st lawrence this attack be to be support by the centurion moor in the north channel and by two armed cat which be to be run aground as near as possible to some small redoubt the first object of the attack here it be certain that wolfe and cook come into personal contact for on the latter fall the duty of take the necessary sounding for the position to be occupy by the cat and wolfe refer in a despatch to a conversation he have with cook upon the matter the attack take place on 31st July aid by the fire of the pembroke trent and richmond which be anchor clear over to the north shore before beauport a brisk firing on both side but the boat be throw into confusion by a reef -lrb- mark on the chart as visible at low water -rrb- and be some time before they could effect a landing then a heavy storm of rain come on render the ground which be steep very slippery the troops occupy one redoubt but be so dominate by the french musketry that they could get no further and wolfe deem it desirable to recall they and to stop the advance across the ford the two cat be burn to prevent they fall into the hand of the enemy and the loss of the english in kill wounded and missing be 443 those of the french be estimate at 200 cook say the repulse be solely owe to the heavy fire from the entrenchment which soon oblige we troops to retreat back to the boat and montmorency whilst wolfe in a general order throw the blame on the louisburg grenadier a pick body of man from several regiment whom he consider get out of hand he also in a despatch submit to saunder throw some amount of blame on the navy but to this the admiral strongly object and it be withdraw wolfe say : i see clearly wherein i have be deficient and think a little more or less blame to a man that must necessarily be ruin of little or no consequence it have be assert that cook lead the boat to the attack but as this be do by wolfe himself accord to he own letter and as saunder be also out with they both officer have narrow escape it seem more probable that cook would be on he own ship where as she be engage he service would be want for it be one of the master 's most important duty to work she under the captain 's order when in action a few day before this attack on beauport be make the french again pay the fleet the undesired attention of a large fire raft compose of several small vessel chained together and laden with all sort of combustible -- shell gun load to the muzzle tar barrel etc and again this be grapple by the boat and tow away to a place of safety and then wolfe send in a flag of truce the next morning say that if the performance be repeat he should cause the instrument of destruction to be tow alongside two ship in which he have canadian prisoner and there let it do its worst this somewhat cold-blooded threat be sufficient and the experiment be not repeat a narrow escape during the time the fleet be occupy the basin the master of the ship be constantly out make observation and sound partly for the necessity of the fleet and partly to throw dust in the eye of the french and on one occasion cook have a narrow escape from capture he man have to row for it to get away from the enemy and reach the isle of orlean land just in time for as cook the last man spring ashore from the bow a indian board over the stern the hospital picket turn out and the french retreat he friend mr bissett be not so fortunate be take prisoner on 7th July whilst sound in the north channel but he be either exchange or escape for he be only absent from he ship for a few day wolfe who be almost always ail have a attack of fever and the worry of the repulse at beauport render he incapable of duty for some day he therefore lay before he brigadier plan of future movement ask they opinion and advice these plan be not approve but it be suggest that a attempt should be make to land on the western side of the town and there bring the enemy to action and wolfe write : i have acquiesce in they proposal and we be prepare to put it into execution the up-river detachment have be strengthen by the addition of a few more vessel and murray with 1200 man have join in a unsuccessful attempt to get at the french supply fleet which have retreat to a place of safety he have outwit de bougainville who be detach to watch he and succeed in destroy a magazine contain clothing powder and other store and intercept letter which tell of the surrender of niagara and the retirement of bourlemaque upon the ile aux noix to which place amherst be prepare to follow when wolfe 's resolve be take to follow the advice of he brigadier saunder again strengthen the force above the town place the squadron under the command of admiral holme and on 3rd September he boat withdraw the artillery and troops from montmorencus to point levus and on the night of the 4th all the available boat and small craft be send up one of the last to pass be a small schooner arm with a few swivel and call by the sailor the terror of france she sail by in broad daylight draw the fire of every gun that could be bring to bear on she but be untouched and anchor close alongside the admiral 's ship give he a salute from the whole of she armament the troops which have be quietly march some distance up the south bank from point levus be take on board the ship the last detachment on the night of the 12th and admiral holme sail up the river as if to beat up the french communication but when night fall he return and the landing be successfully accomplish and be describe by saunder in he despatch as follow : the night of they landing admiral holme with the ship and troops be about three league above the intended landing-place general wolfe with about half he troops set off in the boat and drop down with the tide and be by that mean less liable to be discover by the sentinel post all along the coast the ship follow they about three-quarter of a hour afterwards and get to the landing-place just at the time that have be concerted to cover the landing and consider the darkness of the night and the rapidity of the current this be a very critical operation and very properly and successfully conduct in the meantime the ship in the basin some fifteen in number distract the attention of the french by a heavy cannonade on the beauport line and the boat make a feint as if a attack be contemplate buoy have be lay in such a way as to lead to the idea that the ship be go to moor as close in as possible as if to support a assault and every effort be make to draw attention away from the movement up above the plain of abraham lieutenant norman of the pembroke shortly describe the battle in he log : at 4 be general wolfe land just below cape diamond with the whole army at 8 the signal of boat man would and arm would to go to point levus weigh and drop hier up about 10 the enemy march would up and attack general wolfe the action last not 10 minute before the enemy give way and run in the greatest confusion and leave we a compleat victuary we army encamp on the plain a back of the town and make the necessary disposition for carry on ye siege admiral holme hoist he flag on board the lowestaff just off the landing place in this action fall general wolfe of the enemy general montcalm and he two seconds cook do not mention the death of wolfe but say the troops continue the pursuit to the very gate of the city afterward they begin to form the necessary disposition for carry on the siege cook be say by some writer to have pilot the troops to the landing-place and have even be set within hearing of the legendary recitation by wolfe of gray 's elegy but as he be out with the pembroke 's boat in the basin at the time holme start up the river and be probably on he ship with he hand full drive the bombardment and the recital of the elegy at such a time be probably a myth the tradition may be put down to imagination the boat be pilot to the landing by captain chad of hm vesuvius the town have surrender five day after the battle the movement make by saunder in the basin no doubt aid m de ramesay the governor in come to a decision general murray be leave with a garrison and the fleet sail for england send a detachment of the northumberland and six other to halifax with order that captain lord colville be to hoist the broad pennant as commander-in-chief of the north american station and as soon as the season open he be to return to the st lawrence to render support to any further movement make in canada appointment to hm northumberland before the fleet leave however cook 's connection with hm pembroke come to a end captain king who be with cook on he last voyage write to dr dougla that he do not know the exact date of cook 's appointment to the northumberland but he be certainly master of that ship in 1758 here king be in error for lieutenant jame norman of the pembroke have the follow entry in he log under date 23rd September 1759 : mr cook master supersede and send on board the northumberland per order of admiral saunder it have be say that lord colville make this appointment but of course he could not do so though he may perhaps have apply for cook 's service but it be far more probable that the appointment be make by saunder for the special purpose of have the survey of the st lawrence thoroughly well carry out chapter 4 1759 to 1762 hm northumberland on the way down the river from quebec the fleet appear to have find the passage very difficult the danger of the channel be aggravate by the strength of the current and bad weather the captain vesuvius and royal william be aground for some time but be ultimately get off again without much damage and the terrible which be drift and in great danger be only bring up by means of a anchor construct for the occasion by lash one of the quarter-deck gun to two small anchor when she large anchor be haul up they be find to be break and so great be the loss of these article that lord colville be oblige to press the admiralty for a fresh supply to be send out immediately as he find it impossible to replace those lose in the traverse either at boston or any other place in america relief of quebec colville 's squadron arrive in halifax on 27th October cook 's thirty-first birthday and as soon as the winter be over and the ship be clean and fit for sea as well as the limited appliance would permit it leave for the st lawrence sailing on 22nd April 1760 but be so retard by frozen fog sea of compacted ice and contrary wind that it do not arrive off the ile de bic before 16th may here they be meet by a sloop with the news that quebec be in urgent need of help general murray hearing of the approach of general de levis with a french force have leave the shelter of the fort and notwithstanding he be greatly outnumber have offer battle in the open he have at first choose a strong position but hearing from spy that the french be busy clean they arm after be catch in a heavy storm the night before he advance upon they and owe to the sudden attack and the superiority of he artillery at first gain a considerable advantage but afterwards the weight of number tell and the british be force to retire to the town with sadly reduce number and quebec be again besiege on receipt of this news colville push on with he squadron and the arrival of the vanguard and diamond on the 17th follow by the northumberland and the remainder on the next day cause the french to retire during the next four month the fleet pass a uneventful time in the canadian water the flagship be moor in the basin and then on the 12th September they receive the acceptable news that montreal and the rest of the province of new france have surrender to general amherst and on 10th October the squadron again return to halifax to winter quarter on 19th January 1761 lord colville record in he journal that he have direct the storekeeper to pay the master of the northumberland fifty pound in consideration of he indefatigable industry in make himself master of the pilotage of the river st lawrence this be the first official recognition that have be find of the fact that cook have go beyond the ordinary duty incumbent on every master in he majesty 's service namely : to observe all coast shoal and rock take careful note of the same there be no record in any of the official document that cook be specially engage in survey the river but it be very evident from this entry that he must have do the work during the four month that he ship be moor in the basin of quebec that be to say he promotion to the northumberland be previous to and not a consequence of he survey of the river and that it be on account of he fitness for the work and not because it have be do as be constantly assert that he have be select the north american pilot admiral saunder have issue order the previous year that the general instruction of the admiralty as to take observation sounding and bearing be to be carefully carry out and the information obtain be as opportunity offer to be forward to he so that all exist chart may be correct and improve this information in the ordinary course would be hand to mr bissett the master of the flagship for comparison and compilation and he know cook 's fitness for the work may have ask for he assistance and thus introduce he to the notice of saunder note for he quick eye for merit who see he aptitude select he for the completion of the task saunder after he return to england write to the secretary of the admiralty on 22nd April 1760 say that he have ready for publication a draught of the river st lawrence with its harbor bay and island and ask for they lordship ' direction thereon with they lordship ' approval it be publish and may be find at the end of the north american pilot london 1775 together with other map some of which be cook 's work at the commencement of the book be a letter from cook to the compiler of the volume congratulating he on the collection and refer to the fact that some of the chart contain he work but he do not lay claim to any special one on saunder ' chart there be a long note which conclude : the distance between isle coudre and isle of orlean the pillar rock and shoal in the south channel be accurately determine by triangle the other part of this chart be take from the best french draught of this river it be doubtful if this triangulation could have be carry out by cook during he passage up and then down the river the only time he have in 1759 but if it be it argue much greater knowledge of nautical surveying than he be generally suppose to have have at the time during the winter that the northumberland stay in halifax harbor cook employ he spare time in improve he knowledge of all subject that be likely to be of service to he in he profession he read euclid for the first time and enter upon a study of higher mathematics especially devote himself to astronomy king in he sketch of cook 's life say on the authority of the man himself that these study be carry on without any other assistance than what a few book and he own industry afford he at the opening of the season lord colville disperse he squadron to those station where they service appear most necessary and remain with he ship at halifax as it be consider inadvisable to leave such a important naval post open to attack from the french or the spaniard he have be advise by despatch date 26th December 1761 that war have be declare with the latter nation during this period of wait the word nothing remarkable be in constant use in captain adam 's -lrb- the second captain of the northumberland -rrb- journal cook utilise this time to make a thorough survey of halifax harbor the note of which be now in the united service museum whitehall at length the period of inaction be end captain charle dougla hm syren who be cruise off cape race receive information that a squadron of four french ship of the line have some 1500 pick troops on board have make a descent on newfoundland and have capture st john 's the capital which have be most shamefully neglect and its garrison reduce to 63 man the grammont 22-gun sloop be unfortunately in harbor at the time and be also take dougla at once press two english merchant vessel into the service and put a petty officer in command of one the william and he master in the other the bonetta despatch they to cruise in search of captain grave the reappoint governor of newfoundland who be daily expect from england the bonetta soon fall in with the antelope grave 's ship and she immediately join dougla and then proceed to strengthen the isle of boy as far as time would allow then go to placentia a place of as much importance as st john 's and more capable of defense they set about make preparation to beat off any attack leave a garrison of 99 man and as many marine as could be spare grave then despatch dougla with the remainder of the syren 's marine to take possession of ferryland and send the ship herself off with letter to lord colville but the william have miss the antelope make she way to halifax with the news of what have occur recapture of st john 's colville at once send word to general amherst commander-in-chief in america ask he to forward any troops he could spare and start accompany by the gosport and a armed colonial vessel the king george 20 gun to cruise off the newfoundland coast in order to prevent the arrival of french reinforcement or supplies he meet grave at placentium on 14th August and land all the marine he could and then continue he cruise amherst collect every available man from new york halifax and louisberg and put they under the command of he brother colonel william amherst order he to use every despatch and join lord colville without delay this the colonel succeed in do on 12th September off cape spear and the next day they land at torbay some three league north of st john 's they drive in the french outpost and take possession of a small harbor name quidus vidi which have be block at the entrance by the french clearing away the obstruction they land they store and some artillery and advance on st john 's compel its surrender on the 17th notwithstanding that as captain grave report the french have put st john 's in a better state of defense than ever we have it in on the 16th a strong gale blow the english ship some distance off the coast and be follow by a thick fog during which the french squadron manage to tow out of the harbor but be in such a hurry to get away that they do not stop to pick up they boat and immediately make sail be so far out of reach in the morning that though some of they be see by the british it be not realize that they could be the french escape from a squadron inferior in strength lord colville write to the admiralty say : at six next morning it be calm with a great swell we see from the masthead but could not bring they down no lower than halfway to topmast shroud four sail bearing south-south-east distance 7 league we lose sight about seven though very clear and sometime after a small breeze spring up from the south-west quarter i stand towards torbay in order to cover the shallop that might be go from thence to kitty vitty in the afternoon i receive a note from colonel amherst acquaint I that the french fleet get out last night thus after be block up in st john 's harbor for three week by a squadron of equal number but smaller ship with fewer gun and man m de ternay make he escape in the night by a shameful flight i beg leave to observe that not a man in the squadron imagine the four sail when we see they be the enemy and the pilot be of opinion that they must have have the wind much stronger than with we to overcome the easterly swell in the harbor 's mouth i send the king george as far as trepassy to bring I intelligence if the enemy should steer towards placentium and i direct captain dougla of the syren to get the transport move from torbay a very unsafe road to the bay of bull as soon as information be receive in england that a expedition have be send from france the admiralty despatch a squadron under captain pallisser in pursuit and as it arrive in st john 's only four day after m de ternay leave they must have be very close to a meeting cook meet cook whilst the movement lead up to the recapture of st john 's be be carry on communication between colville and amherst be keep up by the boat of the fleet under the charge of the third lieutenant of hm gosport mr jame cook formerly master of hm mercury who perform this duty to the complete satisfaction of lord colville as signify in he despatch to the admiralty it be certain therefore that the two namesake must have come face to face here and most probably previously in halifax harbor enter st john 's harbor on 19th September the flagship remain till 7th October during which time cook be very busily employ in assist to place the island in a better state of defense in a despatch of lord colville 's dated spithead 25th October 1762 he say : i have mention in another letter that the fortification on the island of carbonera be entirely destroy by the enemy colonel amherst send thither mr desbarre a engineer who survey the island and draw a plan for fortify it with new work : when these be finish the enterprise 's six gun will be ready to mount on they but i believe nothing will be undertake this year as the season be so far advance and no kind of material on the spot for build barracks or shed for cover the man should any be send there mr cook master of the northumberland accompany mr desbarre he have make a draught of harbor grace and the bay of carbonera both of which be in a great measure command by the island which lie off a point of land between they hitherto we have have a very imperfect knowledge of these place but mr cook who be particularly careful in sound they have discover that ship of any size may lie in safety both in harbor grace and the bay of carbonera mr desbarre 's design for the fortification of carbonera draw by john chamberlain dated 7th April 1763 be to be find in the british museum he be afterwards governor of cape breton on the return of the northumberland to spithead where she arrive on 24th October she master jame cook be discharge the muster roll merely note supersede on 11th

in london there be a story that he be godfather to he wife and at she baptism vow to marry she but as at that time 1741 cook be assist he father on airy holme farm the tale be too absurd but have for all that be repeatedly publish after they marriage mr and mr cook live for a time in shadwell and then remove to mile end old town where cook purchase a house which be they home till after he death

again be confer on captain -lrb- afterwards admiral lord -rrb- grave he have early recognize the fact that it be necessary to have a thorough survey of the coast of he territory and therefore make a application to the board of trade to have the one commence as far back as 1714 by captain taverner but only carry on in a desultory fashion put in hand and complete as quickly as possible this application result in a representation from the board to he majesty dated 29th march 1763 to be find in the shelbourne manuscript ask that a allowance should be make for the purpose grave have see during the previous year the work do by cook at harbor grace and carbonera and have evidently make up he mind that he have find the man for he purpose in which opinion he would be back up by colville and further support by the favourable knowledge that the admiralty have of he work the representation be immediately act on for in the record office be a hurry note from grave to mr stephen secretary to the admiralty probably write on the 5th April in which he ask : what final answer he shall give to mr cook late master of the northumberland who be very willing to go out to survey the harbor and coast of labradore a draughtsman be also mention and one be recommend who be on the bellona and be willing to go out ranking as schoolmaster he do join cook after a time on 6th April grave again write to stephen tell he he have instruct cook to get ready to start as soon as the board give he order and that he be to have ten shilling per diem whilst employ on that service he also say that cook have be to the tower to try to secure a draughtsman and towards the end of the letter apply for the instrument necessary to carry on the operation grave be hurriedly call away to he ship the antelope as the spirit of discontent then very rife in the navy be develop itself in a very threatening manner during he absence however on he arrival on board by judicious reform which he see be carry out and by quietly replace some few of the most dangerous of the malcontent he be very shortly able to report himself ready for sea with a complete and fairly contented crew on 15th April he write to stephen ask if there be any change of resolution take about mr cook the master and a assistant for he and whether they be to go out with I on the 18th he write again say that when in london he have be inform that he be to receive order to purchase two small vessel of about 60 ton each when he arrive in newfoundland one of which he be to send with mr cook upon the survey of the coast and harbor but he be afraid the order have be forget and he again make suggestion as to instrument etc require for the work cook have at the same time make application in proper form for the article he would require and be inform that some would be supply to he from the government store and for the remainder he be to purchase they and transmit the bill to they lordship cook 's sailing order on 19th April cook receive he order as follow : sir my lord commissioner of the admiralty have direct captain grave of he majesty 's ship the antelope at portsmouth to receive you on board and carry you to newfoundland in order to you take a survey of part of the coast and harbor of that island i be command by they lordship to acquaint you therewith : that you must repair immediately on board the say ship she be under sailing order that you be to follow such order as you shall receive from captain grave relative to the say service and that you will be allow ten shilling a day during the time you be employ therein i be etc etc phillip stephen mr jame cook -- town mr william test tower to be pay 6 shilling per day on 8th may grave acknowledge the receipt of the order he have ask for authorise he to purchase two small vessel and announce that mr cook have join the ship but that the assistant mr test have not be hear of he therefore propose that he should endeavor to obtain someone else to fill the vacancy mr stephen reply that a difficulty have arise with the board of ordnance with regard to mr test 's pay they be not incline to continue it during he absence as they would have to put some one else in he place and since hear this as the admiralty have hear nothing further from mr test captain grave be authorise to fill the vacancy at a suitable allowance and he at once secure the service of mr edward smart who sail from plymouth in hm spy and join cook in newfoundland in this letter grave also say that he intend to start cook on the survey of st pierre and miquelon as they have to be hand over to the french under treaty whilst he should make some stay upon the coast in order to afford proper time for survey before they have to be surrender the possession of these island carry with it certain fishing and cure rights confer by the treaty of utrecht and confirm by that of pari and the possession of the island and rights have be a continual cause of irritation to the fisherman of both nation till lately but now the difference have be satisfactorily settle it be say that the earl of bute be the cause of the inclusion of the clause concern these island in the treaty and that he receive the sum of 300000 pound for permit it to stand it be specially stipulate that the island be not to be fortify and the number of the garrison be to be strictly limit to a number sufficient for police duty alone but from the very commencement of the peace it be one continual struggle to evade the term by one side and to enforce they by the other without come to a actual rupture judicious procrastination accord to he express intention captain grave on arrive at st john 's despatched captain charle dougla in the tweed to superintend the removal of the british settler from the two island and cook accompany he with order to press on the survey as rapidly as possible in order that it might be complete before the arrival of the french unfortunately m d'anjac who be charge with the duty of receive the island on behalf of the french king arrive on the same day as the tweed off the island captain dougla refuse to permit the french to land until the island have be formally hand over by he superior officer and by a little judicious procrastination in communicate with captain grave and persistent energy on the part of cook in conduct the survey sufficient time be gain to complete it grave write to the admiralty on 20th October 1763 : meanwhile the survey go on with all possible application on the part of mr cook at length monsieur d'anjac 's patience be quite exhaust i receive a letter from he on the 30th of June of which i enclose a copy together with my answer return the same day this conveyance bring I a letter from captain dougla express he uneasiness on the part of monsieur d'anjac and press to receive he final instruction and at the same time give I the satisfaction to learn st peter 's be completely survey miquelon begin upon and advance so as to expect it would be finish before the french could be put in possession : so that any interruption from they be no longer to be apprehend in a paper amongst the shelbourne manuscript say to be a extract from a journal of cook 's there be a short description of these island and it convey the impression that the writer look upon they as absolutely worthless as either naval or military station but for all that captain grave 's successor pallisser be keep continually on the alert to defeat the effort of the french to strengthen they position the king 's surveyor after the official surrender of these island cook be engage in survey different place which the admiralty have specially mark out and be bear on the book of either the antelope or tweed as might be convenient he be to be find on the latter ship enter for victuals only as mr jame cook engineer and retinue as the date in the two ship often run over each other it be somewhat difficult to place he but he be certainly in the neighborhood of st john 's for some two month and on 5th November he be discharge from the antelope into the tweed together with mr smart for the passage to england where he remain till the spring of the following year on 4th January the admiralty authorise the payment up to the end of the previous year of the allowance of 10 shilling and 6 shilling per day respectively to mr cook and mr smart this allowance of 10 shilling per day be the same as that make to the commander of a squadron so from a financial point of view cook 's position must be consider one of importance it be apparently superior to that of a master survey under the direction of the governor for in a report that captain pallisser when governor of newfoundland give of a interview between the french ambassador and himself in london in 1767 on the subject of the fishery he say he produce cook 's chart and decide the question of the rights of france to the use of belle isle for fishing purpose against the ambassador by its means and he speak of cook officially as the king 's surveyor pallisser be appoint to succeed grave as governor in 1764 and at once set aside the schooner grenville which grave have use as a despatch boat for the sole use of the survey party she have be man from the ship on the station but pallisser write to the admiralty on the subject and the navy board be instruct to establish she with a proper person to take command of she and a complement of man sufficient to navigate she to england when the survey season be over in order that she might be refit and send out early in the spring instead of be lay up in st john 's and wait for store from england whereby a great deal of time be lose the establishment be to consist of ten man ie a master a master 's mate one master 's servant and seven man the master and mate be to receive the pay of a sixth rate and the former be to be charge with the provision and store which shall be supply to the schooner from time to time and to pass regular account for the same on 2nd may stephen write to pallisser that cook be appoint master of the grenville and as soon as the season be over he be to be order to portsmouth and on arrival to transmit he chart and draught to the admiralty on receipt of this letter pallisser write to cook and this communication together with autograph copy of letter write by cook have reference to the grenville a receipt for she husband 's pay sign by mr cook and some other papers of interest relate to he voyage be now in the hand of mr alexander turnbull of wellington new zealand it would appear that it be at this time that the friendship between pallisser and cook really commence for previously there can have be no opportunity for the former to have know anything of cook 's personality a captain of a man-of-war saw nothing of a master 's mate and know nothing of he except whether he do he duty or not and that only through the master 's report in this particular case as soon as he attention be call to he by outside influence cook be withdraw from he knowledge and when they again come in contact have already make he mark have they be on the very friendly term that kippi suggest it be unlikely that he would have make so many incorrect statement as to cook 's early career in the navy on 23rd April cook receive he order and be tell at the same time that as he have express a doubt about be able to get suitable man in portsmouth he would be provide with conduct money and free carriage of chest and bedding for those he could raise in london and they should be transfer to portsmouth in the trent mr william parker be appoint master 's mate and the whole crew leave portsmouth on 7th may in hm lark arrive in st john 's on the 14th June they take possession of they ship on the same day and the first entry in the grenville 's log run as follow : June 14th 1764 st john 's newfoundland the first and middle part moderate and hazy weather the later foggy at 1 pm he majesty 's ship the lark anchor here from england on board of which come the master and the company of this schooner go on board and take possession of she read over to the crew the master 's warrant article of war and abstract of the late act of parliament accident to hand after get the gun and store on board and fitting the ship for she new duty they leave st john 's on 4th July for the north a base line be lay out at noddy 's harbor and the latitude of cape norman be find to be 51 degree 39 minute north sounding be take every mile on 3rd August cook leave the ship in the cutter to continue he work but have meet with a nasty accident he have to return on the 6th it seem he have a large powder horn in he hand when by some mean not state the powder ignite and the horn be blow up and burst in he hand which shatter it in a terrible manner and one of the people which be hard by suffer greatly by the same accident the grenville leave at once for noddy 's harbor where there be a french ship which have a doctor on board arrive there at eleven o'clock be able to secure some sort of medical assistance though probably in the eye of a modern medical man of a very rough nature at that time surgery especially on board ship be very heroic a glass of spirit the only anodyne and boiling pitch the most reliable styptic in reference to this accident the lord of the admiralty write to lord halifax quote a letter they have receive from captain pallisser date 14th November 1764 : mr cook the surveyor have return the accident to he be not so bad as it be represent nor have it interrupt he survey so much as he -lrb- captain pallisser -rrb- expect he continue on the coast as long as the season would permit and have execute he survey in a manner which he have no doubt will be satisfactory to they lordship i have order he to proceed to woolwich to refit he vessel for the next season and to lay before the board draught of he survey with all he remark and observation that may be useful to trade and navigation in those part pallisser do not see cook till some time after the accident when the worst be over and it be quite in keep with cook 's character to minimize he suffering and to insist on the work be keep go as far as possible the surgeon mr samwell relate that after the murder at owhyee they be enable to identify he hand by the scar which he describe as divide the thumb from the finger the whole length of the metacarpal bone whilst cook be lay up with he hand and mr parker be engage with the survey some of the man be employ brewing and either the brew be stronger than usual or the officer 's eye be off they they indulge too freely for on 20th August it be note that three man be confine to the deck for drunkenness and mutinous conduct and the next day the ringleader be punish by be make to run the gantelope early in September be then in the bay of st genevieve cook go ashore for six day and run roughly the course of several small river note the chief landmark and then on they way back to st john 's off point ferrol they small boat be dash to piece on a ledge of rock and its occupant be save with great difficulty by the cutter which by great good fortune happen to be near at the time they return to england for the winter and cross the bank a series of sounding be make and the nature of the bottom carefully note when cook arrive at woolwich he point out to they lordship that the completion of he chart would entail he be absent from he ship and he would be unable to supervise everything that have to be do on board he therefore suggest that she should be send to deptford yard this be at once agree to and cook be able to devote he whole time to he chart he own work have to be supplement by the observation make by six men-of-war station in newfoundland water as they commanding officer have receive special instruction to take ample sounding and careful observation and to make chart which be to be send to captain pallisser who be inform that he would be hold responsible if these order be not carry out in they entirety it be very certain that a order so emphatically enforce on he notice would not be permit to remain a dead letter grenville 's rig change whilst at deptford the rig of the grenville be alter from schooner to brig as cook think that she sailing quality would be improve by the change and she also receive a thorough overhaul in the previous year she armament have be supply from the flagship and of course have to be return so now she be establish with 6 swivel gun 12 musquet and powder and shot of she own and she crew be augmented to twenty include a midshipman and a carpenter 's mate pay as on board a sixth rate isaac smith mr cook 's cousin afterwards admiral who live with she at clapham be the midshipman on 25th march 1765 the grenville again leave for newfoundland arrive at st lawrence harbor on 2nd June to recommence she work on 14th July whilst moor in a bay by great garnish we pick up two man who have be lose in the wood for near a month they come from barin intend to go to st lawrence harbor and be almost perish for want of subsistence go into long harbor 23rd July the grenville run on a rock and remain so fast that she have to be unloaded before she could be float off the next day when she be find to have suffer considerable damage to she forefoot from the log of the grenville it appear that the survey be not carry out continuously and this may be account for by the fact that the governor be be call upon to settle dispute with the french fisherman who be only too apt to place the broadest construction on the treaty rights accord to they it be very possible that cook during this year render assistance to captain debbieg and bassett engineer who be engage in survey important point and harbor with a view to fortification and pallisser have be instruct to give they every help there be no positive record that cook do assist but he ship be several time engage near where they be at work and it seem very reasonable to suppose that he work with they especially as such work might be very important to both party cook return to spithead on 30th November and from thence to deptford for the winter and in February obtain permission from the admiralty to publish the chart he have complete captain pallisser who make the application say he be of opinion that they would be of great encouragement to new adventurer on the fishery upon those coast eclipse of the sun he again leave deptford on 20th April 1766 and arrive at bon bon bay 1st June to survey the south-west and south coast at the burgeo island near cape ray which be reach on 24th July cook be able to take a observation of a eclipse of the sun occur on 5th August on he return to england at the end of the year he hand the result of he observation to dr bevis a prominent fellow of the royal society who communicate they to that body on 30th April 1767 and the account be to be find in the philosophical transaction of that year dr bevi describe cook as a good mathematician and very expert at he business and say he be supply with very good instrument that there be three observer with good telescope who all agree as to the moment of beginning and end that he have show cook 's result to mr george mitchell who have calculate therefrom the difference of longitude between the burgeo island and oxford where another good observation have be take cook make no reference to the eclipse in the log of the grenville but it appear that he be peculiarly lucky in the weather for the five day precede be describe as foggy and the four or five succeed be rain with squall this observation be a most fortunate one for cook as it bring he to the favourable notice of the royal society a body of eminent man outside he own profession which be able soon after to advance he interest and in course of time to admit he into its own rank as a ornament of which it be still proud on 4th November the grenville leave st john 's for winter quarter at deptford and the log end on 24th November dungeness light north-east by east 2 mile mr parker he assistant be promote to a lieutenancy and mr michael lane who be mention for the post by captain grave in 1763 and who be now schoolmaster on the guernsey be appoint in he place on 5th April 1767 the grenville have complete she refit warped out of dock and be at anchor wait for the tide to turn in order to drop down to woolwich when the three sister a sunderland collier thoma boyd master fall athwart she hawse and carry away she bowsprit cap and jibboom which have to be replace the story be that this accident happen to the endeavor and that mr cook who be naturally very indignant send for the offend master of the collier to give he a sound rating for run foul of one of he majesty 's ship but when he find himself face to face with a old schoolfellow of the ayton day he take he down into he cabin treat he to the best he have on board and spend a good time with he talk over the old day when they be boy together from cook 's character the story may well be true except it have be apply to the wrong ship when the repair be execute the grenville sail for newfoundland arrive off cape race on 9th may and cook at once set to work on the survey of the west coast he land in September at the mouth of the humber and make a rapid examination of that river discover several lake and get a good general idea of that part of the island he return to st john 's for the last time on 14th October have practically complete the survey of the general run of the coast and add very considerably to the knowledge of some of the interior part of the island in 1762 a map be publish compile from the very latest information and on it be the note : the inland part of this island be entirely unknown cook be say to have discover valuable seam of coal but there be no note of anything of the kind amongst he record the grenville ashore he sail for england on 23rd October and anchor off the nore in very heavy weather on 11th November it be soon find that the anchor would not hold and at length one part and the ship trail into shallow water striking hard after a while she again strike heavily and lay down on she larboard bilge as there seem no prospect of the gale moderate everything be make as snug as time would allow and put he crew into the boat cook make for sheerness the weather at length improve so obtain assistance he return and find that fortunately he ship have sustain very little damage and the next day he successfully float she and get she up to deptford yard on the follow Sunday and then cook be able to set to work on he chart on 3rd February pallisser write to mr stephen ask he to obtain permission from the lord to publish and at once obtain the necessary authority some of these chart have be publish in 1766 and now the complete series appear with sailing direction for the south and east coast of the island admiral sir wjl wharton the late hydrographer to the admiralty say : the chart he make during these year in the schooner grenville be admirable the best proof of they excellence be that they be not yet wholly supersede by the more detailed survey of modern time like all first survey of a practically unknown shore and especially when that shore abound in rock and shoal and be much indented with bay and creek they be imperfect in the sense of have many omission but when the amount of the ground cover and the impediment of fog and bad weather on that coast be consider and that cook have at the most only one assistant they accuracy be truly astonishing on the publication of he chart cook 's connection with newfoundland be conclude and on 12th April 1768 mr lane be appoint to act as master of the brig grenville and surveyor of the coast of newfoundland and labrador in the absence of mr cook who be to be employ elsewhere mr lane be to be pay a allowance of five shilling per day over and above he pay as master of a sixth rate cook and he be pay they allowance up to 31st December 1767 and on 17th June the navy board be order to complete cook 's allowance up to 12th April from the wording of mr lane 's appointment it would appear that the surveyor 's position be to be leave open for cook if it be think desirable for he to resume it chapter 6 1768 preparation for first voyage till a few year ago writer on the subject be content to draw they information as to the first voyage of cook to the south sea from the so-called history of dr hawkesworth this gentleman who pose as a stylist -lrb- boswell call he a studious imitator of dr johnson -rrb- be introduce by dr charle burney to lord sandwich for the express purpose of write a account of the expedition and be supply with all the record in the possession of the admiralty relate to it he have access to the journal of sir joseph bank the note of dr solander and other who accompany cook and more than all he have the opportunity of personal communication with the leader of the party notwithstanding these advantage he interpolate so much of he own speculation conclusion and dissertation as to render he voluminous work not only extremely unreliable but often extremely ridiculous traveller to the south sea record that the account of thing and place describe as see by cook be remarkably correct but that the inference draw be wrong they do not realize that the statement of fact be cook 's whilst the deduction and ornamentation be hawkesworth 's and be strongly resent by cook boswell relate that he tell johnson that he have meet captain cook at dinner at sir john pringle 's -lrb- then president of the royal society -rrb- and give he a account of a conversation they have together johnson : be much pleased with the conscientious accuracy of that celebrated circumnavigator who set I right as to many of the exaggerated account give by dr hawkesworth of he voyage cook 's opinion on the subject may be see from he determination to prepare he journal for the press himself in the future within the last few year the journal of the endeavor have be publish under the able supervision of the late admiral sir wjl wharton and the journal of sir joseph bank which be miss for a long time have be recover and publish by sir joseph hooker and these two book may be prefer with safety over all other that have be write on the subject memorial to the king it have be calculate that a transit of venus would occur in 1769 observation of which would be of great importance to astronomical science and several of the european nation notably russium be intend to establish point of observation the royal society decide that as england have hitherto take a lead in astronomy she should not now fall behind and appoint a committee to report on the place where it would be desirable to take observation the method to be pursue and the person best fit to carry out the work this committee advise that two observer should be send to hudson 's bay two to the south pacific and if sweden do not send there two to the north cape they also advise that the government should be ask to supply a ship to convey the party to some island to be decide on in the south sea and several gentleman be suggest as observer mr maskelyne president of the society especially recommend mr dalrymple as a proper person to send to the south sea have a particular turn for discovery and be a able navigator and well skilled in observation mr maskelyne estimate the voyage would take about two year and that a sum of ten shilling and six penny per day would be a reasonable allowance for expense together with a gratuity the amount of which be to be settle hereafter a memorial on the subject be prepare and forward to the king setting forth that as a transit of venus over the sun 's disc be expect to occur and that other nation be intend to take observation thereof in the interest of navigation it would be desirable that as the british nation have be justly celebrate for its knowledge of astronomy and a englishman mr jeremiah horrox have be the first person who calculate the passage of the planet over the sun in 1639 the government should support the royal society in its attempt to take a proper position in the matter by a grant of money and a ship to take a party to the south sea four thousand pound be the sum name and on 24th march the president be able to inform the council that the king have be please to order that it should be place in he hand clear of fee for the purpose of defray the expense of the expedition in the end after pay all account there be a considerable balance leave which the king place at the disposal of the society and a portion of it be expend on the bust of he majesty by nollekin now in its possession the gentleman whose name have be suggest as observer be ask to appear before the council if they be willing to accept the position and mr dalrymple write in reply to say there be only one part of the world where he would go to take observation that be the south sea and he would only go if he have the management of the ship intend for the service mr maskelyne tell the council he have recommend mr dalrymple to the admiralty for the command of the ship the use of which have be grant but have be inform that such a appointment would be entirely repugnant to the regulation of the navy it be say that sir edward hawke have in he mind the disastrous result of give halley the command of a king 's ship in 1698 when a serious mutiny occur positively refuse to sign such a commission say that he would rather cut off he right hand than permit any one but a king 's officer to command one of the ship of he majesty 's navy dalrymple originally a clerk in the east indium company 's service have spend some year trade amongst the island of the malay archipelago and china return to england and publish a couple of pamphlet on the east indy and in 1767 a book on the discovery in the south pacific ocean which bring he to the notice of the royal society he be afterwards for a time hydrographer to the east indium company and be then appoint the first hydrographer to the admiralty he be dismiss from this position for exceed he power and soon afterwards die he appear to have be a clever man but of a extremely overbearing disposition and a very high opinion of himself in write to dr hawkesworth on one occasion he say : i never write on any subject i do not thoroughly understand what make the remark more interesting be that he be quite in the wrong on the subject under discussion he appear never to have forgive cook for have be successful in obtain the command of the expedition to observe the transit of venus and for completely upset he pet theory of a large continent in the southern ocean purchase of the endeavor the navy board have be order by the admiralty to propose a proper vessel to convey the observer to the south sea first suggest the tryal sloop and then the rose but both be find unsuitable they be order to purchase one on 29th march the board write to stephen that they have buy : a cat-built bark in burthen 368 tun and of the age of three year and nine month for convey such person as shall be think proper to the southward at the same time instruction be seek as to fitting and arm she for the service and as to the name under with she be to be register on the list of the navy a cat-built ship be describe in the encyclopaedia as one with round bluff bow a wide deep waist and taper towards the stern the name be derive from the norwegian kati a ship the cat-built bark the now immortal endeavor be build by messr fishburn of whitby and own by mr william milner of that port dr young say that she original name be the earl of pembroke but sir evan macgregor write to mr waddington in 1888 that she be purchase under the name of the endeavor and be enter as a barque the warrant entry book from board of trade prove that dr young be right as the follow entry will show : deptford march 23rd 1768 two cat call the valentine and the earl of pembroke to be survey and report which be the properest to be purchase deptford march 28th 1768 ship earl of pembroke to be receive deptford April 7th 1768 ship purchase to be sheathe fill and fit for a voyage to the southward to be call the endeavor bark from the record of the survey office list of hm navy 1771 to 1776 it have be ascertain that she price be 2800 pound and the cost of fitting she for the voyage be 2294 pound the reason she be name officially either the bark endeavor or endeavor bark be that there be another endeavor in the navy station at that time at the nore kippi say that pallisser be entrust with the selection of the ship and that he call on cook for assistance in the matter and the fact that a whitby-built ship be choose of a kind in which cook have have considerable experience add to the probability of he statement dalrymple enter a claim in letter to dr hawkesworth to have choose the endeavor for the voyage but as she be not order to be survey with a view to purchase till 23rd march when it be well-known the admiralty have refuse to allow he the command of the expedition there be little force in he claim copper sheathing admiral wharton assume that as cook express himself averse from have explore ship sheathe in copper owe to the difficulty of make repair in case of accident far from proper facility and from the frequent mention of heel and boot-topping in the journal of the endeavor it be most probable that she be sheathe in wood this assumption be correct for there be no mention of copper sheathing in the surveyor 's book nor at the time of she be repair at the endeavor river nor at batavium when it be impossible that any account of she damaged bottom could be give without the mention of copper if any such sheathing have be use the naval chronicle say the first ship of the royal navy to be sheathe with copper be the alarm frigate in 1758 and

and between three and four dozen of we poultry which be worst of all be drown the ship be find to be very leaky in she upper work and the sail in the store get very wet bank note that they catch two bird in the rigging that have evidently be blow off the coast of spain on 13th September they anchor in funchal road and during the night the bend of the hawser of the stream anchor slip would owe to the carelessness of the person who make it fast the anchor be haul up into a boat in the morning and carry further out but unfortunately in heave it into the water a master 's mate name weir get entangled in the buoy rope be carry overboard and drown before any assistance could be render whilst shift she berth to a more convenient spot the endeavor be fire on by one of the fort owe to some misunderstanding but satisfactory apology and explanation be make and it be think so little of that neither cook nor bank mention it in they journal this incident be probably the origin of the story tell by forster in he journal of the second voyage he say : captain cook in the endeavor batter the loo fort at madeira in conjunction with a english frigate thus resent a affront which have be offer to the british flag when the endeavor arrive at funchal the only british man-of-war there be hm rise which sail the following day with she convoy and neither she captain 's journal nor he ship 's log make any reference whatever to a dispute with the portuguese no other british man-of-war come into the port whilst the endeavor be there and afterwards at rio cook expressly inform the viceroy that he have be well receive by the portuguese at madeira fresh water meat vegetable and wine be take on board wine fruit and water be good and cheap but the meat and poultry obtain as a favor be dear two man a marine and a sailor receive twelve lash for refuse to eat they allowance of fresh meat this appear to be harsh treatment but it must be remember that the lash be at that time almost the only recognize method of punishment in the navy however trivial the offence might be and cook know from experience how important it be to prevent the scurvy from get foothold on board and he already have determine to fight by every means in he power this dread scourge almost he most dangerous foe he do conquer it even on this first voyage and consider he means in a most marvellous manner he would have claim the victory have it not be for a untoward event which will be tell hereafter lead he to postpone he claim till he could give further proof it be important to notice how on every possible occasion he obtain wherever he could some change of diet and fresh water eden before the fall whilst they be at funchal bank spend five day with the english consul and he describe the place as very pretty but the people as primitive idle and uninformed all they instrument of the rudest make and he think that the appliance use in the manufacture of wine must have be similar to those use by noah although it be not impossible that he might have use better if he remember the method he have see before the flood one of the governor leave it on record that so averse from change be the people he think it most fortunate the island be not eden before the fall as in that case the inhabitant could never have be induce to wear clothes he explore as much of the island as he could but say he could never get more than three mile away from the town as he time be so much break up the governor visit they on one of the day he say be so waste but relate with evident glee how he take he revenge there be a electrical machine on board and he excellency be most curious on the subject it be send for and explain to he and bank go on they give he as many shock as he care for perhaps more a visit be pay to a convent where the nun hear they be distinguish scientist ply they with all sort of question and for the half-hour the visit last they tongue be go all the time at a uncommonly nimble rate at a monastery they visit they be well receive and the monk regret they be then unprepared invite they to come the next day and though it would be Friday they would have roast turkey for dinner on 19th September at midnight they weigh sighted teneriffe on the 23rd and the day follow they first fly fish find its way into mr green 's cabin on the 28th they try steak for dinner cut from a young shark which bank and solander report as very good but the crew refuse to taste they cape de verde be see on the 30th and about a fortnight afterwards the line be cross in 29 degree 24 minute west longitude and the follow day the event be celebrated lieutenant hick have cross before so a list be give to he of all on board include the dog and cat and all be muster on deck those who have already cross be separate from the other any one who wish could purchase immunity for four day ' allowance of wine but the other have to pay the penalty of duck bank compound for himself and party and cook also seem to have get off but the other be haul up to the end of the main-yard on a boatswain 's chair and then at the sound of the whistle drop into the sea a operation repeat three time cook say the ceremony be perform to about twenty or thirty to the no small diversion of the rest whilst near the equator great inconvenience be feel from the damp heat everything be mouldy or rusty and several of the crew be on the sick-list with a sort of bilious complaint but it fortunately do not grow into a serious matter reception at rio they strike sounding on 6th November and on heave the lead again find a difference of less than a foot in three or four hour land be sight near cape frio brazil in latitude 21 degree 16 minute south on the 8th and they come across a boat man by eleven black who be engage in catch and salt fish bank purchase some fish and be surprise to find they prefer to be pay in english rather than spanish coin on the 13th they arrive off rio de janeiro where they be very ungraciously receive by the viceroy they be not permit to land except under a guard some of the man who have be send ashore on duty be imprison mr hick who have go to report they arrival and ask for the service of a pilot be detain for a time and it be only with difficulty and at a exorbitant rate that they obtain fresh food and water consequently little be see of the place except from the ship and cook take all possible observation from thence and make a sketch map of the harbor to which he add all the information he be able to pick up from the pilot write to the royal society he say he be quite unable to understand the true reason of he treatment and contrast it with that receive by a spanish ship which come in whilst he be there this spanish ship willingly undertake to carry to europe and forward to the admiralty copy of the correspondence that pass between cook and the viceroy which cook describe as a paper war between I and he excellency wherein i have no other advantage than the rack he invention to find reason for treat we in the manner he do for he never would relax the least from any one point to every remonstrance the viceroy plead he instruction and the custom of the port he seem to have be quite unable to grasp the object of the expedition and cook say he idea of the transit of venus be the north star pass through the south pole he own word the crew be accuse of smuggling and it be repeatedly assert that the endeavor be not a king 's ship parkinson one of mr bank 's staff say that frequently some of they let themselves down from the cabin window at midnight into a boat and drive with the tide till they be out of hearing of the guard boat establish over they row ashore and make short excursion into the country though not so far as we could have wish to have do bank speak of the supplies obtain at rio say the beef be cheap but very lean and dry the bread taste as if make with sawdust and justify its name of farinha de pao -lrb- wooden meal -rrb- the fruit except the orange be very indifferent and he take particular exception to the banana which he have not taste before it be not at all to he like the water also be very bad and the crew prefer what they have bring with they though it be very stale m de bougainville report that when he visit rio he be at first receive in a very friendly manner by this same viceroy but after a time the treatment be alter and he have to put up with even greater insolence than cook the second death when the store have be receive on board the anchor be weigh in order to take up a more favourable position for make a start but unfortunately shortly after the ship get underway a man name peter flower fall from the main-shroud into the sea and be drown before assistance could be render : the second death since leave england the next day the wind be contrary but every one be so anxious to turn they back on the place that cook order out the boat to tow but they be immediately bring up by a shot from the fort of santa cruz a remonstrance be send ashore and receive the lame excuse that the permit for leave have be sign but have be delay on its way and the officer in command could not allow the vessel to leave till it be receive another attempt to get away be soon after make but the anchor foul a rock and there be again delay at length on the 7th December they be able to make a start discharge they pilot and bid farewell to the guard boat which have so constantly keep watch over they they be inform that a englishman name foster a officer in the portuguese service who have be of great use to they be imprison for he kind attention on 9th December they meet with bad weather and lose they foretop-gallant mast but the rough handling they get be credit with improve the sailing quality of the ship as it take some of the stiffness out of she upperwork a meteor be note on the 23rd like a small bright cloud emit flame travel rapidly westward and disappear slowly with two sharp explosion the same day a eclipse of the sun be observe christmas day for which the man have be save up they allowance of grog pass in the usual manner that be in considerable over-indulgence bank speculate as to what might have happen if they have have bad weather whilst cook dismiss the occurrence very shortly : the people none of the soberest on the 27th they cross the mouth of the river plate the water be very discolor and a good many land insect be find in it on 2nd January 1769 they see some of the shoal of red lobster like those mention by dampier and cowley but they be not find in such quantity as those navigator report on the 11th the shore of tierra del fuego be sight and on work in closer the country be find to be less desolate in appearance than they have expect from anson 's description arrive off the entrance of the strait of le maire between staten island and the mainland they be drive back by the tide and a strong adverse wind and try to shelter under cape diego they be carry past and only after three and a half day ' hard work be they able to get through the strait cook have leave sailing direction for this passage which be follow to the present day bank and solander be ashore for a short time on staten island and return delighted with the addition of some hundred new plant for they collection cook with a eye to the welfare of he crew remark : they return on board bring with they several plant and flower etc most of they unknown in europe and in that consist they whole value cook and green make a series of observation the first ever make so far south in america and fix the position of cape diego at 66 degree west 54 degree 39 south wharton place it at 65 degree eight minute west 54 degree 40 minute south on the 15th they anchor in the bay of success for wood and water and meet with some of the inhabitant with whom by means of gift of bead and other trifle they establish friendly relation and three of they be persuade to go on board the ship though by no mean a small race of man they be find to be nothing like the giant report by the early navigator in this part of the world they have in they possession button glass canvas brown cloth etc show conclusively they have previously some communication with european they clothing consist chiefly of skin roughly cure and a plentiful covering of paint and dirt the only personal property on which they appear to set any store be they bow and arrow which be carefully make and always in good order they food appear to consist of seal and shell-fish they house merely shelter of bough cover with grass and leave build to windward of a small fire a snowstorm on 16th January bank solander buchan green monkhouse two seaman and bank 's two color servant try to get up the hill to see something of the surrounding country but they find they progress hamper by the dwarf vegetation to add to they discomfort a heavy snowstorm come on several of the party experience that desire to sleep which be produce by cold and be warn by solander of the danger of give way to it yet he be almost the first one to give in and be with great difficulty keep awake buchan most unfortunately have a fit so a large fire be make at the first convenient spot but a sailor and the two color man lag behind during the night the sailor be hear shout and be bring in to the fire but in the morning the two color man be find freeze to death cook attribute they death to overindulgence in spirit the supply for the party be leave in they charge not intend to remain away the night supplies run short so a vulture be shoot and carefully divide amongst they each man cooking he own which amount to about three mouthful at length the weather clear up and a start back be make and after three hour they strike the beach only to find they have never be any great distance away but have be describe a circle and come back almost to the place whence they have start bank note the vegetation as more exuberant than he expect the dominant color of the flower white and he collect wild celery and scurvy grass in large quantity which be mix with the food on board ship as long as it could be preserve in a wholesome condition whilst at the bay of success the gun be lower into the hold so as to allow more room on deck for work the ship in the bad weather they expect to encounter when round the horn the balance of the globe on 27th January cape horn be pass but owe to fog and contrary wind they do not approach very closely so they be unable to fix its exact position but the description they be able to give of its appearance -lrb- there be a sketch of it by mr pickersgill master 's mate in the record office -rrb- and twenty-four observation take in the immediate neighborhood settle any doubt they may have have and cook put it at 55 degree 53 minute south 68 degree 13 minute west and wharton give the correct position as 55 degree 58 minute south 67 degree 16 minute west three day after they reach they furthest south accord to cook 60 degree 4 minute south 74 degree 10 west and the course be then alter to west by north the continuous and careful observation of the state of the sea and the absence of current during the follow month cause cook to come to the conclusion that the vast southern continent so long suppose to exist somewhere in that part of the globe and by some people esteem necessary to preserve its balance be non-existent bank express he pleasure in have upset this theory and observe : until we know how the globe be fix in its position we need not be anxious about its balance the week follow the change of the course to the north be uneventful only mark by a occasional success of the naturalist in obtain a fresh specimen some of which be experiment on by the cook a albatross skin soak all night in salt water be stew serve with savoury sauce and be prefer to salt pork a cuttle-fish of large size freshly kill by the bird and too much damage for classification be make into soup of which bank say : only this i know that of it be make one of the best soup i ever eat the water obtain at tierra del fuego turn out very good : a great boon as one of they great trouble and a source of great anxiety to cook be the bad quality of the water so often obtain towards the end of march a change be notice in the kind of bird fly round the ship some be recognize as one that be know to stay near land and consequently a sharp look-out be keep on the night of the 24th a tree-trunk be report but when morning come nothing further be see it have since be ascertain they be then a little to the north of pitcairn island afterwards the home of the mutineer of the bounty but cook do not feel himself at liberty to make any deviation from he course to look for what he be not sure to find although he think he be not far from those island discover by quiro in 1606 on 26th march one of the marine commit suicide by drown it seem he have misappropriate a piece of sealskin and he fellow-soldiers indignant that such a thing should have be do by one of the cloth make he life uncomfortable and threaten that he should be report for theft this be the fifth death since leave england and none by disease the 4th April at 1030 be bank 's servant peter briscoe sighted land and the course of the ship be alter to give they a chance of inspect it it be find to be one of those peculiar circular reef surround a lagoon call atoll which exist in some quantity in the pacific there be no anchorage so they make no attempt to land but be able to see it be inhabit some twenty-four person be count through the glass and be describe as copper-coloured with black hair they follow the ship as if prepare to oppose a landing the reef be cover with tree amongst which the coconut palm be conspicuous cook give it the name of lagoon island it be now know as vahitahus and be one of the low archipelago be now in walli 's track island be sight almost every day and almost all appear inhabit but owe to the want of safe anchorage no communication could be hold with the native on 10th April osnaburg island be pass and next day king george land be sight but the wind fail and they do not get close in till the 12th when canoe come out to the ship bring branch of tree which be hand up the side with sign direct they should be place conspicuously in the rigging as a token of friendship offer and accept when this have be do the native produce a good supply of trade in the shape of vegetable and fruit amongst the last bank enumerate bread-fruit banana coconut and apple -lrb- a species of hog plum -rrb- these be very acceptable and beneficial to the crew after such a lapse of time without vegetable food except the wild plant gather in tierra del fuego at tahitus at 7 be on the 13th they anchor in the bay describe by walli know as matavaus in thirteen fathom and cook say of he route from cape horn i endeavor to make a direct course and in part succeed chapter 8 1769 society island prodigious expert thief hardly have the anchor reach the bottom before they be surround by canoe whose occupant be anxious to sell the supplies of fruit raw and cook fish and a pig they have bring the price ask for the pig be a hatchet and as these be scarce it be not purchase when all be make safe a party go ashore and be well receive by the native but those who have previously be there with walli report that those who be at that time say to be chief be keep in the background the next day however two man evidently of rank come on board and be invite into the cabin go through a ceremony describe by bank : each single out he friend one take the captain and the other choose myself each take off a part of he clothes and dress he friend with what he take off in return for this we present they with a hatchet and some bead they be then invite by they new friend to go ashore on landing they be escort to a building and introduce to a old man they have not see before and he present cook with a cock and bank with a hen and each with a piece of native cloth bank give in return for he share he large lace silk neckcloth and a linen handkerchief after this they be permit to stroll about and receive many token of amity in the shape of green bough and be then entertain at a banquet the principal dish be fish and bread-fruit whilst at dinner solander have he pocket pick of a opera glass and monkhouse lose he snuff-box as soon as this be make known lycurgus as they have name one of they friend drive off the people strike they and throw anything he could lay he hand to at they he offer piece of cloth as compensation and when these be refuse extend he offer to everything he possess he be at last make to understand that all that be want be the return of the steal article and after a time the snuff-box and the case of the glass be return and by and by the glass itself during the whole of the stay at the island they have the greatest difficulty with the native for steal a accomplishment at which cook say they be prodigious expert on the whole they first visit ashore be satisfactory and be think to augur well for the observation of the transit a site be select for a camp on the eastern point of the bay to which the name of point venus be give the longitude accord to cook 149 degree 31 minute west and to wharton 149 degree 29 minute west line be trace for the boundary and bank 's largest tent be pitch and a guard mount and then the other go for a walk of inspection they pass through some wood that mr hick have be prevent from explore the day before and bank have the luck to bring down three duck with one shoot a deed think likely to impress the native with respect for the white man 's weapon on they road back to camp they be alarm by a musket shot and hurry on find that one of the sentry have be push down and he musket steal so the midshipman in command have order a shot to be fire at the thief who be kill but the musket be not recover all the native run away but one whom cook call awhaa and whom the master mr molineaux who have be out with walli recognize as be a man of some authority through awhaa a attempt be make to arrange matter but the native be very shy when the english land the next day however the two chief who have first make friend to whom the name of lycurgus and hercule have be give again come on board bring present of pig and bread-fruit they conclude as hercule 's present be the larger he be the richer and therefore the more important chief to lessen the chance of disagreement in trading and to keep some control of price cook order that only one person should conduct the purchasing for the ship and as bank have show aptitude in deal with the native he be appoint the native be to be treat with every imaginable humanity on the 16th mr buchan the artist have another epileptic fit which be unfortunately fatal and he be bury at sea in order to run no risk of offend against any of the custom or superstition of the native cook in refer to he death say : he will be greatly miss in the course of this voyage in the afternoon the ship be bring into such a position as to command the site of the propose camp and as there be to be a eclipse of one of jupiter 's satellite cook and green stay ashore to get a observation but the weather be unpropitious cook sketch the camp be now get into order the north and south side be protect by a bank 4 foot 6 inch high on the inside have a ditch 10 foot wide and 6 foot deep on the outside the west side face the bay have a 4 foot bank crown by a palisade with no ditch and the east side on the bank of the river be protect by a double row of water cask the armament consist of two carriage gun on the weakest or east side and six swivel gun two on each of the other side the garrison be forty-five man include civilian and cook consider it be practically impregnable in the manuscript department of the british museum be a pen and ink sketch and plan of the fort draw by cook which agree much better with the description than the engraving of parkinson 's draw publish in the history of the voyage the native be disturb by these preparation some even leave the bay but when no dreadful result occur they take courage and return the fort complete the instrument be land and put into the require position to be prepare for they work and the follow morning the quadrant which have not be remove from the case in which it be pack in london be find to be miss although a sentry have be station within five yard of it the whole night enquiry be make and it be elicit that the thief have be see make off with it bank he native friend and one or two of the english at once start closely follow by cook and a party of marine after a long chase the quadrant be recover but some of the smaller part be miss after a time these also be return in the case of a horse-pistol which have be steal from bank and soon after the pistol be recover and they be able to return to camp on they arrival they find cook 's friend dootahah -lrb- hercule -rrb- have be detain as a hostage so he be at once release to the great delight of the native who have be much alarm to see the armed party go into the wood in order to show he gratitude for he release dootahah send a present of two hog to cook for which he refuse to take any return but afterwards second thought prove best and he send a man to ask for a axe and a shirt and to say he be go away and would not be back for ten day as the supplies of vegetable and fruit in the market have be decrease in quantity it be think better to refuse the present in hope he would apply for it in person and arrangement could then be make for a regular market but he send some one else again and so word be return that cook and bank would bring it to he the follow day for fear this promise should be forget dootahah again send he man and cook and bank start off in the pinnace on they arrival they be receive by a large crowd which be keep in order by a man in a immense turban arm with a long white stick which he apply to the people with great judgment and relish the party be conduct to a large tree and very graciously receive by dootahah who immediately ask for he axe which be give he together with a shirt and a piece of broadcloth make into a boat-cloak he put on the cloak and give the shirt to the man with the stick and refreshment be serve they be afterwards entertain with dancing and wrestling and then dootahah accompany they back to the ship take he supplies for dinner and when it become know he be on board trading be resume a day or two after bank receive a urgent message from he friend taburaus -lrb- lycurgus -rrb- say he be very ill he complain of have be poison by one of the sailor it seem he have notice the sailor chew and have ask for a quid have bite off a piece and swallow it bank prescribed large draught of coconut milk with happy result surf ride fly be a terrible pest they get into everything and eat off the artist 's color almost as fast as they be lay on tar and molasses be try as a trap for they but the native steal it and use it as ointment for sore the surf-riding strike the visitor with admiration swim out with a piece of board they would mount it and come in on the crest of the wave and bank say he do not believe that any european could have live amongst the breaker as they do he especially admire the manner they time the wave and dive beneath on they way out from shore a blacksmith 's forge have be set up and in spare time the smith would fashion old iron into axis or repair old axis for the native and it be notice that some of these old axis be not of english make and it appear unlikely they be obtain from the dolphin at length it be ascertain that since walli 's visit in that vessel two ship have anchor off the east coast and it be conclude from the description give by the native of the flag that they be spanish but on the arrival of the endeavor at batavium they be able to identify they as the french ship command by m de bougainville whose crew be suffer very severely from scurvy at the time pay a visit to dootahah to see if a supply of fresh meat which be run very short could be obtain they be receive in a very friendly manner but be delay till it be too late to return to the ship by daylight they remain all night and as a consequence nearly every one find they have lose some property cook 's stocking be steal from under he pillow where he have place they for safety perhaps as consolation for they loss they be entertain during the night to a concert three drum and four flute the latter have four hole into one of which the performer blow with he nostril be the orchestra and cook 's criticism be hardly complimentary : the music and singing be so much of a piece that i be very glad when it be over they wait till noon the next day in hope of meat and the return of the steal article but in vain though dootahah promise he would bring all to the ship -- a promise we have no reason to expect he would fulfil the transit of venus the important day of the observation be now approach and everything be in readiness in order to diminish the risk of disappointment through local atmospheric disturbance cook send a party to eimeo -lrb- york island -rrb- and a second one to the south-east of otaheite as far to the east of point venus as possible the first party consist of lieutenant gore bank spore and monkhouse and the second of lieutenant hick clerke pickersgill and saunder mr green provide the necessary instrument at fort venus everything be in good work order the astronomical clock be set up in the large tent be place in a strong frame make for the purpose at greenwich and be then plant in the ground as firmly as possible and fenced round to prevent accidental disturbance twelve foot away the observatory be place comprise the telescope on they stand the quadrant securely fix on the top of a cask of wet sand firmly set in the ground and the journeyman clock the telescope use by cook and green be two reflect one make by mr j short the 3rd of June prove as favourable to we purpose as we could wish not a cloud to be see the whole day and the air be perfectly clear so that we have every advantage we could desire in observe the whole passage of the planet venus over the sun 's disk we very distinctly see the atmosphere or dusky shade round the body of the planet which very much disturb the time of contact particularly the two internal one dr solander observe as well as mr green and myself and we differ would from one another in observe the time of contact much more than could be expect mr green 's telescope and mine be of the same magnifying power but that of the doctor be greater than ours it be nearly calm the whole day and the thermometer expose to the sun about the middle of the day rise to a degree of heat we have not before meet with in the report publish in the philosophical transaction he also refer to the heat : every wished-for favourable circumstance attend the whole of the day without one single impediment except the heat which be intolerable the thermometer which hang by the clock and be expose to the sun as we be be one time as high as 119 degree this report be accompany by diagram illustrate the different contact and the effect of the penumbra which cook believe be better see by solander than by himself or green it be estimate at about seven-eighths of the diameter of the planet and be visible to cook throughout the whole transit the time take by green be : the first external contact : 9 hour 25 minute 42 seconds be the first internal contact : 9 hour 44 minute 4 seconds be the second internal contact : 3 hour 14 minute 8 seconds pm the second external contact : 3 hour 22 minute 10 seconds pm the other two party be equally successful and at time bank be able to employ himself in trading with the native with whom he soon get on friendly term in fact he have to decline further purchase as he have as much as they could take away with they he be also successful in he botanical enquiry obtain several plant he have not see in otaheite whilst the observation be be take some of the crew break into the store and steal a quantity of the large nail that be use as a medium of trade with the islander one man be find with seven in he possession and after careful enquiry be sentence to two dozen lash which seem to have be the severest sentence mete out by cook during the voyage the sentence be carry out and though it be well know that more than one be implicate he refuse to name any one else but suffer in silence a dog dinner the king 's birthday be on 5th June cook entertain several of the chief at dinner and the health of kilnargo be toast so many time by some of they that the result be disastrous one of the present receive from a chief be a dog which they be inform be good to eat after some discussion it be hand to a native name tupium who have make himself very useful and afterwards accompany they on the voyage and he have smother it with he hand and draw it wrap it in leaf and baked it in a native oven with some hesitation it be taste and meet with general approval cook say : therefore we resolve for the future never to despise dog flesh and in another place he say they put dog 's flesh next only to english lamb these dog be breed for eating and live entirely on vegetable food the main object of they stay at otaheite have be attain step be take for further prosecution of the voyage the ship be careen she bottom scrape and find free from worm but the boat have suffer particularly the long-boat which have to have a new bottom she have be varnish only the other boat paint with white lead have not suffer so much the store be overhaul and the ship be fit for sea whilst these preparation be be make cook and bank make a circuit of the island in the pinnace to examine the coast several good anchorage be find with from sixteen to twenty-four fathom and good holding ground the south-east portion be almost cut off from the mainland by a narrow marshy isthmus about two mile wide over which the native drag they canoe with little difficulty on the south coast one of the large burying-place be see by far the most extensive one on the island it be describe as : a long square of stonework build pyramidically its base be 267 foot by 87 foot at the top it be 250 foot by 8 foot it be build in the same manner as we do step lead up to a sun-dial or fountain erect in the middle of a square where there be a flite of step on each side in this building there be 11 of such step each step be about 4 foot in height and the breadth 4 foot 7 inch but they decrease both in height and breadth from the bottom to the top on the middle of the top stand the image of a bird carve in wood near it lay the broken one of a fish carve in stone there be no hollow or cavity in the inside the whole be fill up with stone the outside be face partly with hew stone and partly with other and these be place in such a manner as to look very agreeable to the eye some of the hew stone be 4 foot 7 inch by 2 foot 4 inch and 15 inch thick and have be square and polish with some sort of a edge tool on the east side be enclose with a stone wall a piece of ground in form of a square 360 foot by 354 in this be grow several cypress tree and plantain round about this morie be several smaller one all go to decay and on the beach between they and the sea lay scatter up and down a great quantity of human bone not far from the great morie be 2 or 3 pretty large altar where lay the scull bone of some hog and dog this monument stand on the south side of opooreanoo upon a low point of land about 100 yard from the sea it appear to have be build many year and be in a state of decay as most of they mory be they be quite unable to gain information as to the history of these remains nor of the religious belief of the islander though they appear to have some vague notion of a future life a excursion inland when the party return to point venus they find the refit nearly complete but the anchor stock all have to be renew owe to the ravages of the sea worm so bank and monkhouse make a excursion up the river on which the camp be situate in about nine mile the precipitous bank have completely close they in and further advance be block by a cliff at least 100 foot high over which the river fall the native with they say they have never be further so the expedition return charle darwin in 1835 make a attempt to ascend the same river and though he penetrate some distance further he describe the country as extremely difficult he see several place where two or three determine man could easily hold at bay many time they own number garden have be lay out during they stay and european seed be plant which be very fairly successful except some bring out by cook in carefully seal bottle none of which turn out well some of the sailor be either entice away or attempt to desert so cook seize one or two of the chief as hostage and the runaway be quickly return some of the native be anxious to go away with they and bank persuade cook to let he take tupium a man suppose to be of priestly rank who have prove himself very useful on several occasion and he be allow to take with he a boy as servant cook record on leave that during the three month ' stay they have be on very good term with the native and the few misunderstanding that do occur rise either from the difficulty of explain matter to each other or else from the inveterate habit of theft on the part of the native -- iron in any shape be simply irresistible on 13th July the endeavor sail for huaheine anchoring inside the reef on the north-west on the 17th bank solander monkhouse and tupium at once accompany cook ashore where a ceremony presume to be a sort of treaty of peace be go through and then they be permit to go where they like on this ceremonial cook say : it further appear would that the thing which tupia give away be for the god of this people as they give we a hog and some coconut for we god and thus they have certainly draw we in to commit sacrilege for the hog have already receive sentence of death and be to be dissect tomorrow a careful pilot a market be organise by monkhouse and as soon as the native understand that the stay of the ship would be very short they manage to produce a fairly good supply of fruit and vegetable the people be find to be rather lighter complexioned and certainly not so addict to thieve as the otaheitan as a memorial of the visit cook give the chief a plate with the inscription he britannick majesty 's ship endeavor lieutenant cook commander 16th July 1769 huaheine he also add some medal or counter of the english coin strike in 1761 and other present and the recipient promise he would never part with they from this place they go on to ulietea -lrb- raiatea -rrb- landing on the 21st and after another ceremonial the english jack be hoist and possession take of the whole group in the name of king george tupia prove himself a excellent pilot with great knowledge of the locality and have send down a diver at huaheine to ascertain the exact draught of the ship he be very careful she never go into less than five fathom of water he have evidently have great experience in navigate these sea in canoe boat of whose construction and sailing quality cook speak in the highest term bank at this time remark we have now see 17 island in these sea and have land on five of the most important the language manners and custom agree most exactly detain by adverse wind off ataha and find the water come badly into the fore sail-room and powder-room cook put into the west side to repair and take in ballast as the ship be get too light to carry sail on a wind he take the opportunity to survey to the north with bank and solander put into one place they be well receive and entertain with music and dancing and cook 's verdict be that neither they musick or dancing be at all calculate to please a european a sort of farce be also act but they could make nothing of it except that it show that these people have a notion of dramatic performance during the whole stay in the society group they have be very well off for fresh food consequently they sea store have be little call on jarvi in he history of the hawaiian or sandwich island say that with cook a silence in regard to the maritime effort of he predecessor be observable throughout he journal and as a proof that he trade on the knowledge of other he remark that at otaheite he make enquiry if there be any island to the north and afterwards evince no surprise when he discover they now cook in he journal constantly show that he compare he knowledge with that of other and often regret he have not further record to consult as for he enquiry he would have be grossly neglect he duty have he not make they for it be only a commonsense method of procedure which evidently mr jarvi could not understand the result of these enquiry can be see in the british museum in the shape of a map draw by cook from information give by tupium on it be some sentence in the otaheitan language chapter 9 1769 to 1770 new zealand leave the society island on 9th August they be off ohetiroa -lrb- rurutu -rrb- in the central group on the 14th but the native be unfriendly and they do not land a canoe come out to meet the pinnace which have be send to obtain information the occupant on be present with gift try to steal the lot and be fire over but by some mischance one of the native be slightly wound in the head whereupon they hurriedly retreat and further attempt at communication be abandon from this place the course be lay to the south to strike the much-talked-of southern continent the weather rapidly get colder and the pig and fowl begin to sicken and die on 26th August they celebrate the anniversary of leave england by cut a cheshire cheese and tap a cask of porter which prove excellent on the 28th a unfortunate death occur the boatswain 's mate john reading be give some rum by he chief and it be suppose drunk it off at once for he be shortly afterwards find to be very drunk and be take to he berth but next morning be past recovery on 2nd September in latitude 40 degree 22 minute south the weather be very bad and have not the least visible sign of land cook again turn northwards in order to get better weather and then to push west the continuous swell convinced he there be no large body of land to the south for many league towards the end of September frequent sign be note of be near land float seaweed wood the difference in the bird etc so a gallon of rum be offer to the first to sight land and on 7th October the north island of new zealand never before approach from the east by european be see by a boy name nichola young the servant of mr perry surgeon 's mate the boy 's name be omit from the early muster sheet of the ship but appear on 18th April 1769 enter as ab in the place of peter flower drown cook name the point see the south-west point of poverty bay young nick 's head tasman have discover the west coast in 1642 and have give it the name of staten land but he never set foot on shore he be drive away by the native who kill four of he man and name the place massacre -lrb- now golden -rrb- bay he sail along the north-west coast give the headland the name they still bear dalrymple hold that this land discover by tasman be the west coast of the looked-for terra australi incognita and he theory be now shattered land in new zealand near the coast a bay be discover into which the ship sail and let go she anchor near the mouth of a small river not far from where the town of guisborne now stand plenty of smoke be see show the country be inhabit and the pinnace and yawl be man and arm and cook land on the east side of the river some native be see on the other side and to try to open communication the yawl pull by four boy enter the river whilst cook follow up the native who have retreat towards some hut about 300 yard away some maori think the boy would be a easy prey try to steal on the yawl but the coxswain of the pinnace observe they call the boat back one of the maori raise he spear to throw and the coxswain fire over he head cause a moment 's pause of surprise but see nothing further he again prepare to throw he spear so the coxswain shoot he and he friend retreat at once leave the body behind cook at once order a return to the ship as it be now get dark the next morning see some man near the same place cook again land with bank solander and a armed party and solander go forward to the brink of the river to try and speak with the native but be receive with a threatening wave of spear and a war dance cook retire to the boat and land the marine again advance with green monkhouse and tupium the latter speak to the native and to the great delight of the party find he could make himself understand after a little parley a unarmed native swam across the river and be then follow by twenty or thirty more with they arm present be give but they seem dissatisfied and want arm at last one steal green 's hanger and they all become very aggressive and insolent whilst more be see to be prepare to cross so cook think the position be get too serious order the one who have take the hanger and who be apparently the leader to be shoot whereon the rest beat a hasty retreat the next day the boat try to find another landing-place but the surf be too heavy and when two canoe be see come in from the sea cook determine to intercept they and try to come to friendly term however they would not stop when call on and on a musket be fire over they the occupant seize they weapon and fiercely attack the nearest boat its crew be compel to fire in self-defence and cook say two native be kill bank give the number as four and the maorus account agree with he three jump overboard to swim ashore but be pick up by the boat and take on board ship they be at first very depressed but soon recover they spirit on find themselves well treated and after eat and drink enormously entertain the crew with song and dance cook deeply regret this incident and candidly confess that he be not justified in try to seize the canoe but have once commit himself he be oblige for he own safety to go to the bitter end bank say the day be the most disagreeable my life have yet see black be the mark for it and heaven send that such may never return to embitter future reflection the next day a party land to cut wood and be accompany by the three captive whom they try to persuade to join they friend the suggestion be decline as they profess to be afraid of be eat and after a time go and hide in some bush cook notice several party of armed native advance in a threatening manner retire he woodcutter across the river about 150 to 200 maori gather on the opposite bank tupium be put forward to parley and some present be show and at length one man come over who receive a present from each of the british and then rejoin he friend cook then return to the ship take with he the three youth who still seem afraid of they own countryman they be again land the next morning as the ship be about to sail and though they still profess to be frighten be soon see walk away in friendly converse with some who have come to meet they native account mr polack a new zealand resident give a account in he new zealand which he gather from the child of native who be present at the landing of cook the tribe then live in the neighborhood be recent arrival they leader be te ratu -- the first man kill by the english the native be anxious to avenge he but be afraid of the thunderbolt which kill at a long distance some indeed go so far as to say they feel ill if a englishman look at they the idea of revenge be only end on the vessel leave mr polack 's chief witness be the son of a man who be wound by a ball in the shoulder but survive he wound till within a year or two of 1836 the time the information be obtain before the ship leave a sort of peace be patch up by means of present and the dead body which have be leave where they fall apparently as a protest be remove cook describe the country as a narrow slip of low sand back by well-wooded hill rise in the interior into high mountain on which patch of snow could be see that it be fairly populated be evident from the smoke rise through the tree more especially in the valley lead into poverty bay as he name it because they be unable to get anything but a small quantity of wood at hawke 's bay whilst trading be go on a large war canoe come up and the occupant receive some present cook notice a man wear a cloak of some black skin and offer a piece of red cloth for it the owner take it off but would not part with it till he receive the cloth and then he boat be push off from the ship and cook lose both he cloak and he cloth soon after a determine attempt be make to steal tupium 's boy tayeto who be hand some thing down to a canoe the maori have to be fire on and in the consequent confusion the boy jump into the water and swam to the ship the point off which this occur be name cape kidnapper as there be no appearance of a harbor cook alter he course to the north at cape turnagain 40 degree 34 minute south to see if he could not do better in the other direction all the canoe see along this coast be well make far in advance of anything they have see before and the grotesque carve and ornamental work be admirably execute the dress warn be usually two cloak-shaped garment one warn round the shoulder the other round the loin and be make of a substance like hemp some be very fine bank have purchase something like they at rio de janeiro for which he give thirty-six shilling think it cheap but these be as fine if not finer in texture dog which be use as food and rat be the only quadruped see whilst bank and solander be collect they discover a large natural arch which the former describe as the most magnificent surprise he have ever meet with it be sketch by parkinson and be engrave in the history cook also make a pen-and-ink sketch of it which be in the british museum cook 's wash steal on 31st October they round east cape and follow the coast which trend more to the west they see a great number of village and patch of cultivation some of the last look as if freshly plough the whole aspect of the country be change for the better but the inhabitant do not seem more peaceably inclined five canoe come out to the ship fully armed and apparently bent on mischief cook be very busy and do not want they on board so to keep they off order a musket to be fire over they but as it only cause they to stop for a moment a round shot be send over they and they hurriedly turn tail the place be give the name cape runaway white island be name but it must have be quiescent as there be no note of its be a volcano as they sail along the coast they meet with canoe from which fish lobster and mussel be purchase and trading seem well establish when one gentleman take a fancy to cook 's sheet which be trail overboard -lrb- they be in the wash -rrb- and refuse to give they up musket be fire over they and they flee and cook lose he sheet from near white island mount edgecombe be see name after the sergeant of marine it be a high round mountain and form a conspicuous landmark on both side of the north island during this day they have notice several small village perch on difficult eminence and surround by palisade which tupia declare be mory or place of worship but say cook : i rather think they be place of retreat or stronghold where they defend themselves against the attack of a enemy as some of they seem would not ill design would for that purpose british soldier have since discover that a maorus pah be not ill design for that purpose cook most unfortunately miss the harbor of tauranga the only safe port on the east coast between auckland and wellington for ship of any size native account in what be now know as cook 's bay they manage to induce the native to trade and purchase crayfish over which parkinson wax enthusiastic and mackerell as good as ever be eat the latter in such large quantity that they be able to salt a considerable number thus save they sea store after a observation of a transit of mercury in which they be not very successful -lrb- wharton think they be take by surprise the transit occur somewhat earlier than expect green say : unfortunately for the seaman they look-out be on the wrong side of the sun the end be likewise as grossly mistaken -rrb- they return to the ship and find that there have be a difficulty with the native who have assume a very threatening manner and one attempt to run off with a piece of calico which be at that time a subject of barter mr gore seize a musket and fire kill he man colonel mundy in we antipode say he see a man name taniwha in 1848 who remember cook 's visit and imitate he walk with the peculiar manner he have of wave he right hand and also tell of the kindly way cook have with the child taniwha tell mundy that after the man be shoot the maori land consult over the body and decide that as the corpse commence the quarrel by the theft of the calico he death should not be revenge but that he should be bury in the cloth which he have pay for with he life colonel wynyard take down the same story from taniwha 's lip in 1852 when he be suppose to be about ninety-three and say : he faculty be little impaired and he great age perceptible more from a stoop and gray hair than any other infirmity cook express very strong disapproval of mr gore 's conduct next day cook and bank explore a river that enter near where they be anchor the east side of which be very barren but the west be much better no sign of cultivation show on either wild fowl be plentiful and oyster as good as ever come from colchester and of about the same size say bank be take on board in large quantity : lay down under the boom and employ the ship 's company very well who i sincerely believe do nothing but eat they from the time they come on board till night by which time a large part be expend but this give we no kind of uneasiness since we well know that not the boat only but the ship might be load in one tide almost as they be dry at half ebb cook think the inhabitant live on fish and shell-fish with fern root for bread for very large heap of shell be find but no sign of cultivation a fortified village be visit the inhabitant good-naturedly conduct they all over and show whatever they express a wish to see it be build on a high promontory whose side be in some place quite inaccessible in other very difficult except where it face the narrow edge of the hill here it be defend by a double ditch and bank with two row of picket the inner row be on the bank leave standing-room for the defender the inner ditch be 24 foot from bottom to top of the bank a stage about 30 foot high 40 foot long and 6 foot wide be erect inside the fence with a second a few pace from it place at right angle from these the garrison be able to throw they spear and stone on to the head of they enemy the whole village be surround by a strong picket fence run close to the edge of the hill the entire surface of the top of the hill be cut up into small square each surround by its own fence and communicate by narrow lane with little gateway so that if the outer defence be force each square could be defend in turn cook say : i look upon it to be a very strong and well choose post and where a small number of resolute man might defend themselves a long time against a vast superior force arm in the manner as these people be he notice with quick eye the great fail in these native fortress that be the want of storage for water in these maorus village it be remark that sanitary arrangement be provide such as say beckmann in he history of invention do not exist in the palace of the king of spain at that time large quantity of iron sand be note here but the use be quite unknown to the native who be indifferent to the iron tool or spike which have hitherto be such a valuable medium of exchange elsewhere a large supply of wild celery and a fresh boat-load of oyster be put on board a tree be mark with the name of the ship the date and one or two other particulars the flag be hoist salute and possession take of the country and the ship sail again on she journey at the thame run closely along the coast they haul round cape colville into the entrance of a straight bay or river and anchor for the night and in the morning they stand on along the east side canoe come off and from the behavior of the occupant some of whom come on board at the first invitation it be judge that favourable account have be hear of the ship after run about 5 league the water shoal to about 6 fathom and the ship anchor and boat be send out to sound no great increase of depth be find the pinnace and long-boat go up a river about 9 mile away and on account of a fancied resemblance name it the thame they land at a village near the mouth be well receive but desire to take advantage of the flood-tide which run as strong as it do in the river thame below bridge they make no stay they go up about 14 mile and then find little alteration in the appearance of the country land to inspect some large tree of a kind they have previously notice one be carefully measure and be find to be 19 foot 6 inch girth at 6 foot from the ground and by means of cook 's quadrant 89 foot to the lowest branch it be perfectly straight and tapered very slightly and some be see that be even larger this be the black pine to the maori matous and to the naturalist podocarpus on the way down the river they friend of the morning come out and traffick would with we in the most friendly manner imaginable until they have dispose of the few trifle they have when the boat get outside they have to anchor as a strong tide and breeze be against they and they do not reach the ship till next morning when the breeze have increase to a gale and topgallant yard have to be strike when the wind drop what be leave be against they and the endeavor would only go with the tide so cook take a run ashore to the west side of the bay but see nothing of interest and conclude it be but sparsely inhabit whilst he be away native go off to trade and behave remarkably well with the exception of one man who be catch make off with the half-hour glass so mr hick have he trice up and he be give a dozen lash when it be explain to he friend why this be do they express they approval and on he release a old man give he another thrash the weather now become very unsettled and they be not able to keep as near the coast as they desire but on 26th November some cultivate spot be see and several canoe come off some of the native ventur would on board to two who appear to be chief i give present after these be go out of the ship the other become so troublesome that in order to get rid of they we be at the expense of two or three musquet ball and one 4 pound shott but as no harm be intend they none they receive unless they happen to overheat themselves in pull ashore a stampede to the west side of cape brett be a deep bay which be see but not name and here the town of russell be now establish say to possess one of the finest harbor in the world into which vessel of any draught can enter in all weather and at any state of the tide the native be find difficult to deal with and would cheat whenever they have a opportunity the ship leave its anchorage but be after a time drive back again and cook with a party take the opportunity to land they be follow up by the maori and be soon surround by about two hundred of they some of whom try to seize the boat but be drive off try to break in on the party several charge of small shot which do no serious damage be fire into they and then the ship fire a 4 pounder over they which cause a stampede and during the rest of the stay there be no further trouble but cook have to punish three of he own man for steal potato from one of the plantation he invariably try to hold the balance fairly between he man and the native the country be describe as very similar to that see before but the number of inhabitant be greater and though apparently not under the same chief they be on good term with each other and inclined to be civil to they visitor a good deal of the ground be under cultivation produce good sweet-potato a few tree of the paper-mulberry be see from which the native make a cloth in a similar manner to the otaheitan but the quantity be so small that it be only use for ornament tupium who have be instruct to gain as much information about the people as he could be inform that some of they ancestor once go off in large canoe and discover a country to the north-west after a passage of about a month only a small number return these report they have be to a place where the people eat hog use the same word for the animal as the otaheitan tupium ask if they have any in new zealand and the reply be no he ask if they ancestor bring any back again the answer be no whereon he tell they they story must be a lie for they ancestor could never have be such fool as to come back without some the land say to have be discover may have be new caledonium one of the man who have be wound at the first come of the ship be see by bank a ball have go through he arm and graze he chest he do not seem to have any pain and the wound though expose to the air be perfectly healthy and he be greatly pleased to receive a musket ball like the one which have wound he when leave the bay they nearly ground be set by the current towards a small island but the boat tow they clear very soon after they strike on a unseen rock which be name whale rock but almost immediately get clear with no perceptible damage into twenty fathom blow off the land progress be now very slow owe either to want of or adverse wind on 10th December they discover two bay separate by a low neck of land knuckle point one bay be name doubtless bay and the other sandy bay the country be describe as nothing but irregular white sandhill and cook conclude from its appearance that the island be here very narrow and expose to the open sea on the west this he soon prove to be correct foster in he account of the second voyage say that when the endeavor be pass doubtless bay m de surville be anchor under the land in the saint jean baptiste and see cook 's ship though himself unseen in the account of de surville 's voyage publish by the academie francaise it be state that new zealand be not sight till 12th December 1769 and owe to bad weather no anchorage be gain till 17th no mention whatever be make of the endeavor be sight and m l'abbe rochon the editor think it most probable that neither navigator know anything of the movement of the other de surville mention have lose anchor in a place he call double bay during a storm about 22nd December and it may possibly have be the one cook encounter on the 28th off the north end of the island they be blow out of sight of land on the 13th the main topsail be split and next day both fore and mizzen topsail be lose but they manage to bring up under shelter of a small island off knuckle point on the 15th the latitude be find to be 34 degree 6 minute south with land visible to the south-west and a large swell be come from the west so cook conclude this be the most northerly point of the island and name it north cape after beat about for some day against westerly wind they run up north return southwards 23rd December and the follow day sighted land to the south-east which prove to be tasman 's three king here bank provide the christmas dinner shooting several solan goose which be make into a pie and be eat with great approbation and in the evening all hand be as drunk as we forefather use to be upon like occasion on the 27th when about thirty league west of north cape and about the same latitude as the bay of island no land in sight the wind rise so that they have to bring to under the mainsail but moderate a little the next day so that they could run in towards the land again it freshen up and blow a perfect hurricane accompany by heavy rain and a prodidgeous high sea which cause the ship to go greatly to leeward on the 30th cape marium van dieman be see about six league off the land extend east and south on the last day of the year they position be give as 34 degree 42 minute south cape marium van dieman north-east by north about 5 league cook say : i can not help think but what it will appear a little strange that at this season of the year we should be three week in get fifty league for so long be it since we pass would cape brett but it will hardly be credit that in the midst of summer and in the latitude of 35 degree south such a gale of wind as we have have could have happen which for its strength and continuance be such as i hardly be ever in before fortunately at this time we be a good distance from land otherwise it would have prove fatal to we vegetable sheep on 2nd January 1770 cook fix the position of cape marium van dieman give it as 34 degree 30 minute south 187 degree 18 minute west of greenwich admiral wharton remark that this be extraordinarily correct see that the ship be never close to the cape and the observation be all take in very bad weather the latitude be exact and the longitude only three mile out he miss see kaipara harbor one of the few good one on the west coast and describe the land as have a most desolate and inhospitable appearance nothing but sandhill with hardly a sign of vegetation on they and say : if we be once clear of it i be determine not to come so near again if i can avoid it unless we have a very favourable wind indeed on the 11th a high mountain its summit cover with snow be see and name mount egmont wharton give its height as 8300 foot and describe it as a magnificent conical mountain surround on three side by the sea bank note on the side of the hill many white lump in company which bear much resemblance to flock of sheep these be a peculiar plant raoulium mammillari -lrb- hooker -rrb- know in new zealand as vegetable sheep fire be see the first sign of inhabitant on the west coast on the 14th thinking he be in the entrance of a large bay cook run in under the southern coast and finding it break into promising-looking bay determine to run into one and careen the ship as she be very foul it be now call ship cove in queen charlotte 's sound here they be at once visit by canoe whose fully armed occupant commence acquaintance by heave a few stone against the ship tupium open a conversation and a few venture on board but do not make a long stay cook then land to look for water and soon find a excellent supply and as to wood the land be here a entire forest whilst he be away the crew get out the net and catch about 300 pound of fish some native also come off with fish and though it be not good cook order it to be buy in order to open up trade with they however they soon find these people be incline to be quarrelsome and threatening and as the ship be in a awkward position be already heave down for clean a charge of small shot be fire at the worst offender which quickly teach they to behave better in future they have long suspect the native be addict to cannibalism and now they prove it as they purchase the bone of a forearm of a man from which the flesh have be recently pick and be give to understand that a few day before a strange canoe have arrive and its occupant have be kill and eat they only eat they enemy but hold all stranger to be such the place where the ship be careen be accord to wharton about 70 mile from massacre bay where tasman 's man be kill and cook endeavor to find out if there be any tradition of visit from ship to the neighborhood but could gain no information the native become friendly as time go on and bring good fish which they sell for nail cloth paper -lrb- a great favorite at first but when they find it would not stand water worthless -rrb- and cook say : in this traffic they never once attempt to defraud we of any one thing but deal as fair as people could do the surrounding country be too thickly timbered for they to see much but one day be out in a boat try to find the end of the inlet cook take the opportunity of climb a thickly timbered hill and from there see far away to the eastward that the sea which wash both west and eastern coast be unite and that one part of new zealand at any rate be a island and he have thus solve one of the problem he have give he in england they also see that much of they immediate neighborhood be not mainland as they have think but consist of a number of small island a more sensible people the population of the district be estimate at only some three or four hundred and appear to subsist on fish and fern root they be evidently poorer than those see previously and they canoe be describe as mean and almost without ornament they soon understand the value of iron and readily take spike nail when trading and greatly prefer kersey and broadcloth to the otaheite cloth which show would they to be a more sensible people than many of they neighbor say cook a old man who have previously pay several visit complain that one of the ship boat have fire on and wound two maori one of whom be since dead on enquiry cook find that the master and five petty officer fishing beyond the usual limit be approach by two canoe in what they think be a threatening manner and have fire to keep they off a second native assure cook no death have occur and enquiry fail to discover one but cook very severely condemn the action of he man as totally unjustifiable the ship have by this time be bring into fairly good trim be clean freshly caulk and tar and break ironwork all repair so preparation be make to push through the strait but before leave two post be set up one near the watering place and the other on the island motuara on which the name of the ship and the date of the visit have be cut and possession be take of this land the king 's health be drunk and the empty bottle present to the old man who have complain about the shooting and who be greatly delighted with he present he also be give some silver threepenny piece date 1763 and spike nail mark with the broad arrow on get out into the strait a very strong current nearly drive they on to a small island the anchor would not hold and only a change in the current probably cause by the tide save they the southern point of the north island be name cape pallisser in honor of my worthy friend captain pallisser and the north point of the south island be call cape campbell after captain john campbell fr who have be one of cook 's strongest supporter as observer for the royal society when through the strait cook be turn south but find some of he people be not quite satisfied as to the part they have pass be a island he take a northerly course till cape turnagain be recognize when he at once go about for the south bank say : at this time there be two party on board one who wish that the land in sight might and the other that it might not prove to be a continent i myself have always be most firm in the former wish though sorry i be to say that my party be so small that there be none heartily of it than myself and one poor midshipman the rest begin to sigh for roast beef the east coast be follow down to bank peninsula which be at first thought might be a island and be mark by dot line as doubtful in cook 's chart when gore think he have see land to the east and cook though convinced it be a mistake run out to make sure on return the wind prove contrary and they progress be very slow but they several time succeed in run close in to the land and from what they could see conclude it be very barren with high range in the interior and with very few evidence of inhabitant a favourable breeze spring up from the north they try to make the most of it and by that mean carry away the main topgallant mast and fore topmast steering-sail boom but these be soon replace by other a high bluff be name after admiral saunder and near be several bay wherein there appear would to be anchorage and shelter from south-west westerly and north-west wind one of these be now otago harbor the port of dunedin the trap on 26th February it blow hard from west-south-west so they stand southward they lose the fore-sail and then the wind moderate only to come on with increase fury about daylight when they main topsail go the storm continue for forty-eight hour and half that time they lay to head south after be lose for seven day the land be again sight near cape saunder and at night a large fire be see on shore on 6th march be satisfy that he have pass the south point of the island cook alter he course to the west and nearly run on some partially submerge rock a few mile to the south-east of stewart island to which he give the suggestive name of the trap they be again blow off but pick up the land again at the western end of foveaux strait again they have to run off return to near dusky bay which he wish to enter as he think it look a likely harbor but the difficulty of get out again and consequent waste of time prevent he off cape foulwind -- suggestive name -- they be again blow out to sea but soon recover they position and cook describe the land : no country upon earth can appear with a more rugged and barren aspect than this do from the sea for as far inland as the eye can reach nothing be to be see but the summit of these rocky mountain which seem to lay so near one another as not to admit any vally between they on the 24th they round the north point of the south island and on the 27th cook write : as we have now circumnavigate the whole of this country it be time for I to think of quit it he have thus carry out to the fullest extent the instruction to determine the situation and nature of the land see by tasman in 1642 and have do it in the most conclusive manner possible -- by sail round it -- and thus upset mr dalrymple 's favorite theory that it form part of a continent in admiralty bay which he enter to refit for the homeward voyage the sail be find to require a thorough overhaul for as bank say they : be ill-provided from the first and be now worn and damage by the rough work they have go through particularly on the new zealand coast and they give no little trouble to get into order again the two point form the bay be appropriately name after the secretary of the admiralty stephen and jackson the opinion be express that european fruit grain etc would grow well in new zealand and a agricultural population would be successful timber of excellent quality be plentiful and it be believe that new zealand flax promise to be of considerable commercial value fish be find in great quantity the lobster and oyster be specially remarkable for quality and quantity no quadruped except dog and rat be see and bird do not seem very plentiful the mineral in cook 's opinion do not appear of much value but he admit that he be not a authority on the subject bank note the southern islander appear to be a inferior race to those of the north the latter probably more closely ally to the otaheitan type many of they custom be similar and they language practically identical tupium have no difficulty in make himself understand it would seem that even at this time found a colony in the southern hemisphere have be under discussion for cook say that if a settlement be decide on in new zealand he would recommend the estuary of the thame and the bay of island as most suitable for the purpose speaking of he chart of new zealand cook point out frankly the place where he think he may have fall into error and give he reason for so think and the opinion of other be worth record a dull sailor admiral wharton say : never have a coast be as well lay down by a first explorer and it must have require unceasing vigilance and continual observation in fair weather and foul to arrive at such a satisfactory conclusion and with such a dull sailor as the endeavor be the six and a half month occupy in the work -lrb- 2400 mile of coast -rrb- must be count as a short interval in which to do it m crozet second to m marion du fresne in command of the french expedition that be out in the following year say : as soon as i obtain information of the voyage of cook i carefully compare the chart i have prepare of that part of the coast of new zealand along which we have coast with that prepare by captain cook and he officer i find it of a exactitude and of a thoroughness of detail which astonish I beyond all power of expression i doubt whether we own coast of france have be delineate with more precision i think therefore that i can not do better than to lay down we track of new zealand on the chart prepare by the celebrated english navigator chapter 10 1770 australium the next thing to be do be to decide the course to be take towards england cook would have like to have return by the horn and thus settle the existence or non-existence of a large body of land in the south pacific but the time of year and the condition of he ship suggest that would be to court disaster the same reason hold good against a direct course to the cape of good hope with the add disadvantage of there be no probability of any fresh discovery as that part of the ocean have be frequently traverse it be therefore resolve to return by way of the east indy by the follow route upon leave this coast to the westward until we fall in with the east coast of new holland and then to follow the direction of that coast to the northward or what other direction it might take we until we arrive at its northern extremity and if it should be find impracticable then to endeavor to fall in with the land or island discover by quiro this extract from cook 's journal show that he make no claim to the discovery of australium and settle the stupid story that he connection with the discovery of the east coast be a accident it be a course lay down after thorough consideration of the best chart very poor at best in he possession botany bay the good ship endeavor get under way on 31st march 1770 with a favourable wind and clear sky head a little north of west on the 16th a change in the bird denote the neighborhood of land and after a touch of contrary wind on 19th April 1770 lieutenant hick sight land extend from north-east to west distant five or six league this be the looked-for east coast of new holland and the ship be at the entrance of bass strait but on he chart cook show by a dot line that he feel uncertain whether van dieman 's land be join to new holland or no the low hill which be first see be name point hick after its discoverer and its position be give as 38 degree 0 minute south 211 degree 7 minute west three waterspout be see a short distance from the ship and be remarkable as be the first one mention in the log the course be alter to the north and the country be describe as rather low not very hilly cover with green wood and the shore of white sand cape howe be name the follow day and the position fix as 37 degree 28 minute south 210 degree 3 minute west which wharton say be almost exact the country now appear to be improve in character and smoke prove the existence of inhabitant but none be visible till cape dromedary and bateman 's bay be pass when some be see on the shore but too far away for observation cook wish to land at jervi bay but the wind be against he and he could not afford time to beat in a attempt be unsuccessfully make at a place that have be identify a little north of five island near illawarra but the surf be too heavy at daylight on Sunday 29th April a bay be discover and the master be send in to sound the entrance the ship follow closely and soon the endeavor anchor for the first time in australian water about two mile within the entrance of sting ray now botany bay -lrb- for note see below -rrb- the time when the name of the bay be change have be much dispute but it be probable it be do some time after leave the place it be call sting ray on account of the big haul of that fish make soon after they arrival and the name stand in all the log bank refer to it under that name in a general description of the country write when leave cape york cook be however decisive for under date 6th may he say : the great quantity of plant mr bank and dr solander find in this place occasion my give it the name of botany bay on come to a anchor cook bank and tupium go on shore and canon bennett a second cousin of mr cook 's and one who know she personally relate that the family legend be that on reach the shore cook order the midshipman to jump out isaac and isaac smith -lrb- afterwards admiral -rrb- also a cousin of mr cook 's be the first englishman to set he foot on the soil of new south wale the few native who be near run away except two who come forward to oppose any landing a musket be fire over they and they retire to where they have leave they spear and then one throw a stone at the boat and as they be too far away for any serious damage to be do cook fire a charge of small shot at he he then run off to a small hut near pick up a wooden shield and return to take up he position alongside he comrade and they throw a couple of spear receive a second discharge of small shot in return which cause they to retire slowly as bank suspicious of some gummy substance on the point of the spear suggest poison they be not follow up the hut find near the landing-place be construct of stick cover with piece of bark somewhat similar to those see in tierra del fuego some child find carefully cover up be leave undisturbed but forty or fifty spear be take and payment in the shape of bead cloth nail etc be leave but still untouched on visit the camp the next morning the canoe from which the native be see fishing be describe by cook as the worst he ever see be merely sheet of bark tie with withy at the end and keep open in the middle by a stick considerable difficulty be experience in obtain water and whilst the crew be procure it cook make a survey of the harbor he describe the country as lightly timber with a sandy soil grow a plentiful crop of coarse grass of which a quantity be cut for the sheep the soil be intersperse with rock and swamp but at the head of the bay appear richer a few native be see who run away when observe and though one or two spear be throw no damage be do to any one large heap of oyster mussel and cockle shell be find amongst they say cook be some of the largest oyster shell i ever see a account say to have be obtain from the black publish in a work on australian discovery -lrb- anonymous sydney -rrb- agree as far as it go with those of cook and bank and it be almost unnecessary to say the ship be at first take for a large bird sutherland 's death whilst here a seaman name forbe -lrb- forby in the muster roll -rrb- sutherland die of consumption from which he have suffer throughout the voyage be bury on shore and the point name point sutherland in he memory the anonymous pamphlet refer to above say that cook do not give the cause of sutherland 's death and that he have be fatally wound by the black whilst try to secure a metal plate he have find affix to a tree recording that the dutch have previously be on the spot the pamphlet go on to say that cook suppress these fact in order to have the credit of be the first discoverer but that the plate have be secure by some one and deposit in the british museum unfortunately cook do give the cause of sutherland 's death and the plate be not in the british museum nor have it ever be hear of there before leave a inscription be cut on a tree near the watering place give the ship 's name and date the english color be display on shore every day during they stay but they could not establish any friendly intercourse with the black a plate have since be attach to the rock about fifteen foot above high water and as near as possible to the suppose place of landing after leave botany bay the coast be follow up to the north and cook note a entrance which he think might prove a safe anchorage to which he give the name of port jackson after mr george jackson one of the secretary to the admiralty within this entrance be now the city of sydney and it be to this place that captain phillip remove he headquarters when he have discover the unsuitability of botany bay for settlement broken bay name from the number of small island therein be pass and the voyage be render very slow by the light northerly wind and pass cape hawke he find the set of the current have place he twelve mile in advance when reckon by the log of he real position give by observation almost the only thing to be see beyond the outline of the coast be the constantly recur smoke one point receive the name of smoky cape on account of the great quantity see in its vicinity cook of course be unaware that these smoke be probably many of they signal from one party of black to another of the arrival of something strange on the coast that these smoke be use by the black as a means of communication be a well recognize fact and the news they can convey by this mean be perfectly astonishing to a white man the country appear to increase in height with : a agreeable variety of hill ridge and valley and large plain all clothe with wood which to all appearance be the same as i have before mention as we could discover no visible difference in the soil after escape a reef off point danger they discover a bay which cook call morton bay after the earl of morton pr now wrongly spell as moreton bay here from the color of the water they suppose a river empty into the sea the surmise be correct for they be at the mouth of the brisbane river at the same time some curiously-shaped hill be give the name of the glasshouse from they resemblance to the building in which glass be manufacture and the resemblance be most striking after round breaksea spit cook find himself in a large bay and conjecture from the bird and the direction of they flight that there be fresh water to the south-west and rightly for here the mary river enter hervey 's bay on 23rd may they land for the second time and cook say this be visibly worse than the last place that be botany bay they manage to shoot a bustard of 171\/2 pound and bank say it be as large as a good turkey and far the best we have eat since we leave england it be so much appreciate that its name be confer on bustard head and bustard bay this bird be know in australium as the plain turkey oyster of good quality be also obtain and bank make the personal acquaintance of the green tree ant and the australian mosquito neither of which be appreciate cape capricorn on 24th may a moderately high white barren-looking point be pass which be find by observation to be directly under the tropic be name cape capricorn and soon after the mouth of the fitzroy be cross with the remark from cook that from general appearance he believe there be a river in the immediate vicinity sounding become very irregular he run out between the keppel island on one of which native be see cape townshend be name after charle townshend one of the lord of the admiralty when the endeavor leave england and not the chancellor of the exchequer as state by wharton round the point into shoalwater bay they have to haul sharp up to the west to get within the northumberland island and the water be find to be so shallow that they anchor and sound from the boat gradually work nearer in as cook be anxious to clean the ship 's bottom which be very foul and he desire to take advantage of the full moon in these dangerous water they land to take some observation and look for water the observation be unsatisfactory for the compass be unreliable a fault attribute to the ironstone in the neighborhood of which sign be very evident and water be not to be find the country be report on as follow : no sign of fertility be to be see upon the land the soil of the upland be mostly a hard reddish clay pass cape hillsborough they enter whitsunday passage describe by cook as one continue safe harbor besides a number of small bay and cove on each side where ship might lay as it be in a basin the land on both side be green and pleasant-looking but on account of the moonlight cook could not waste any time in landing enter cleveland bay the compass be again very much disturb the cause be find to be magnetical now magnetic island lie just off the present port of townsville black be see near rockingham bay through the glass they be say to be very dark and destitute of clothing but no communication with they be possible on the rock on 10th June after leave a small bay north of cape grafton where they have search in vain for a watering place the watch have just turn in the lead have be cast and give seventeen fathom when the unfortunate ship bring all hand on deck with a crash on a sunken rock sounding take all round show she to be on the very edge of a coral reef make but little water a attempt be make to warp she off but unsuccessfully step be then take to lighten she decayed store oil jar stave cask ballast and she six quarter-deck gun be throw overboard some forty to fifty ton but with no effect the tide now rise the leak increase rapidly two pump be keep constantly at work think thing could only go from bad to worse cook determine to heave she off at all hazard and every one who could be spare from the pump be send to the capstan or windlass and at length after a stay of twenty-three hour on the rock she be hove into deep water now however it be a case of all hand to the pump and for a time it seem as if they be slowly gain on the in-rushing water but suddenly there be a increase report in the well cast a shadow of gloom over all but not for a instant stay the steady beat of the pump shortly it be discover that a fresh hand have be send to the well and have sound from a different mark than he predecessor accounting for the sixteen to eighteen inch difference in the depth of water report this discovery act like a charm : each one redouble he exertion and by morning they have gain considerably on the leak so sail be make and they slowly crawl in towards the land midshipman monkhouse have be on a ship which be leak at the rate of forty-eight inch per hour and have see the operation call fother so successfully perform on she that without further repair she have sail from virginium to london this be bring to cook 's ear he give monkhouse the charge of carry out a similar experiment a stud sail be take on which oakum and wool be lightly sewn and smother with dirt it be then lower over the bow and drag by rope over the place where the worst of the leak be situate and there secure with the result accord to bank that in a quarter of a hour after it be in position they be able to pump the ship clear and cook say one pump be sufficient to keep she free of the conduct of the crew cook say : in justice to the ship 's company i must say that no man ever behave better than they have do on this occasion animated by the behavior of every gentleman on board every man seem would to have a just sense of the danger we be in and exert himself to the very utmost bank add he testimony : every man exert he utmost for the preservation of the ship the officer during the whole time never give a order that do not show they to be perfectly compose and unmoved by the circumstance however dreadful they might appear a point off which the reef be situate be give the suggestive name of cape tribulation and some small island near hope island because as cook say he hope at the time of they greatest danger they might be able to reach they what a prospect to hope for no possibility of ever see a friendly sail and but little probability of ever be able to reach a civilised port the endeavor river a boat send off to search for some spot where temporary repair could be execute soon return and report a small river have be find which appear suitable this be the endeavor river and into it the ship be safely take and deep water be find close to the bank a stage be rig and most of the store and ballast be take on shore a hospital be erect for the sick which amount at this time to some eight or nine afflict with different disorder but none very dangerously ill green and tupium be show symptom of scurvy but the remainder appear to have be free from it as soon as the ship be sufficiently lighten she be warped a little further up the river and at the top of the tide she bow be haul well into the bank so that when the tide fall they be able to examine the leak the damage be find to be very serious the rock have cut through four plank into the timber and three other plank have be badly injure the manner in which the ship have be injure be hardy credible scarce a splinter be to be see but the whole be cut away as if do with a blunt-edged tool a piece of the rock be find wedge in the hole and have greatly assist in arrest the influx of water the sheathing and false keel be very badly damage but it be believe that she be not much injured aft as she make but little water when once the main wound be dry at what be believe to be the exact spot at which the endeavor be beach a monument have be erect by the inhabitant of cooktown a seaport now at the mouth of the river there be no danger from the native the crew be allow as much liberty as possible and a good supply of fish a few pigeon and a small quantity of vegetable in the shape of yam top cabbage palm and wild plantain have a very beneficial effect on they health the longitude be calculate from a observation of the emersion of jupiter 's first satelite as 214 degree 42 minute 30 seconds west which wharton remark on as be a excellent observation the true longitude be 214 degree 45 minute west incendiarism by black on 4th July the good ship be afloat again so well repair that only about a inch of water per hour be take in easily keep under by the pump she be lay over on a sandbank on the opposite side of the river and more carefully examine the sheathing be find to be very badly damage the carpenter in whom cook have every confidence report that with the means at he disposal he could not make a satisfactory job but he think they might push on to some place where greater facility could be obtain she be therefore take alongside the stage the store and ballast replace everything get ready for the prosecution of the voyage and the master send off in the pinnace to look for a passage to the north-east but be unsuccessful he be again send out but again report badly the shoal appear to get worse the further he go he however bring back with he three turtle weigh about 800 pound which be most welcome as the crew have now be some month without fresh meat a second trip to where these be catch result in get three or four more and a large supply of shell-fish they have make several attempt to get on good term with the few native they have see and on one occasion two or three who be fishing have a long and animated conversation with tupium in which neither party could understand the other though one or two be persuade to visit the camp shortly before the last of the store be take in cook and bank receive friendly overture from a small party and ten of they visit the ship they be offer various gift but seem to set little value on anything except the turtle they make sign they want they and when they find these sign ignore attempt to carry off two and when they aim be frustrated go ashore to where some of the crew be at work one of they take a light stick from under the pitch kettle and make a wide circuit round the place fire the grass as he run fortunately there be not many thing leave ashore and the powder have just be safely get on board so the most serious damage appear to have be the premature roasting of a young pig they then go off to where other of the crew be wash and dry the fishing net and another attempt be make to burn the grass but a charge of small shot cause a retreat and on they way they set fire to the undergrowth to cover they repulse bank be greatly impressed with the manner in which the grass and undergrowth burnt and declare he would never pitch tent again without first burn the grass for some distance round gore bank and three man make a few day ' excursion up the river but with the exception of a kangaroo be shoot by gore the first ever kill by a european they meet with nothing worth note on 18th July cook bank and solander go up a hill some six or eight mile along the coast to see if they could form any idea of the general run of the coast and the surround reef and cook say : in whatever direction we look it -lrb- the sea -rrb- be cover with shoal as far as the eye could see before leave the river bank give some note as to the country and put it down as in every respect the most barren country we have yet see the animal be not numerous he give kangaroo wolf -lrb- the dingo or native dog -rrb- bat -lrb- fly fox -rrb- wild cat -lrb- dasyurus -rrb- and opossum amongst the bird several kind of duck shag pelican crow and flock pigeon all with the exception of the last difficult to shoot of the crow he say : a crow in england though in general sufficiently wary be i must say a fool to a new holland crow none of the beast or bird seem to have come amiss to the pot all that be necessary be the meat should not be salt that alone be sufficient to make it a delicacy he quote the description give by a sailor of a animal he see : it be as black as the devil and have wing indeed i take it for the devil or i might have catch it for it crawl away very slowly through the grass after some little trouble bank discover this to have be a large bat -lrb- fly fox -rrb- of the insect life see he be particularly strike by the white ant and they nest and form a very respectful opinion of the mosquito cook 's opinion agree fairly well with that of bank but on the whole he think the east coast be not so barren and desolate as dampier have describe the west coast and add : we be to consider that we see this country in the pure state of nature the industry of man have have nothing to do with any part of it and yet we find all such thing as nature have bestow upon it in a flourishing state in this extensive country it can never be doubt but what most sort of grain fruit root etc of every kind would flourish here be they once bring hither plant and cultivate by the hand of industry and here be provender for more cattle at all season of the year than ever can be bring into the country this be a fair example of the observation and deduction to be find scatter through cook 's journal and a improvement on the would-be scientific and classical rubbish put into he mouth by he editor a masthead watch at last on 4th August they get away from the endeavor river only to find themselves surround by difficulty cook or one of the other officer be continually at the masthead on the look-out and at length by keep very close in shore they manage to creep past cape flattery and think the worst be over but a landing at point lookout show a very unsatisfactory prospect in hope of get a better view cook go out to lizard island and from there could see far away to the east the white breaker on the great barrier reef this island on which the only live thing to be see be lizard they find from the large pile of shell and remain of fire be visit periodically by the black a remarkable voyage for they miserable canoe have only three month ' supplies at short allowance leave cook after a consultation with he officer make out through a opening in the barrier reef that he have see from lizard island and observe : have be entangled among island and shoal more or less ever since the 26th may in which time we have sail 360 league by the lead without ever have a leadsman out of the chain when the ship be under sail a circumstance that perhaps never happen to any ship before and yet it be here absolutely necessary but they satisfaction in get outside be diminish when it be find that the increase working of the ship 's timber necessitate the continual use of one pump cook be afraid that be force outside the barrier reef he would be unable to put to the proof the opinion he have form that new guinea and new holland be not join he do not know till after he return to england that the point have already be settle in 1606 by loui vaez de torre and he readily yield the honor of the discovery in the introduction to he second voyage the log of torre 's voyage be lose for many year and be find at manilla when that place be take by admiral cornish in 1762 cook have with he a copy of de brye 's voyage publish in 1756 which contain three chart that he find to be tolerably good with regard to new guinea and he evidently form the opinion that both the spaniard and the dutch have circumnavigate that island i always understand before i have a sight of these map that it be unknown whether or no new holland and new guinea be one continued land and so it be say in the very history of voyage these map be bind up in however we have now put this wholly out of dispute but as i believe it be know before but not publickly i claim no other merit than the clearing up of a doubtful point with this question of new guinea and new holland in view he again make to the west sight the barrier again on 15th August and on the follow morning the wind have change in the night the breaker be hear very distinctly the lead give no bottom at 140 fathom but at daybreak the reef be not a mile away and they find themselves in a dead calm rapidly drift with the current towards the breaker the yawl and long-boat be get out the pinnace be under repair and the sweep be use from the gun-room port by six o'clock she be head north again but : not above 80 or 100 yard from the breaker the same sea that wash the side of the ship rise in a breaker prodigiously high the very next time it do rise so that between we and destruction be only a dismal valley the breadth of one wave and even now no ground could be feel with 120 fathom a perilous position the carpenter have by this time fasten a temporary streak on the pinnace and it be send off to assist in tow cook have almost give up hope but he say : in this truly terrible situation not one man cease to do he utmost and that with as much calmness as if no danger have be near admiral wharton draw special attention to the fact that in the very height of the danger green charle clerke and forwood the gunner be engage in take a lunar for the longitude green note : these observation be very good the limb of the sun and moon very distinct and a good horizon we be about 100 yard from the reef where we expect the ship to strike every minute it be calm no sounding and the swell heave we right on when thing seem perfectly hopeless a small breath of air so small that at any other time in a calm we should not have observe it come and every advantage be take the distance from the reef be slightly increase but then again it fall calm a small opening of the reef be see and a attempt be make to push through but the ebb tide be find to be gush out like a mill stream advantage be take of this and they succeed in get about a quarter of a mile away but the current be so narrow they soon lose it a second opening be see and the tide have change they be carry rapidly through providential channel and safely anchor in nineteen fathom of water cook say : it be but a few day ago that i rejoice at have get without the reef but that joy be nothing when compare to what i now feel at be safe at a anchor within it have arrive at a place of safety cook resolve to remain till he have he boat in thorough repair and have make a complete study of he difficulty from the masthead it appear as if the shoal and reef offer less obstruction than he have previously towards the north and he hope by keep as close to the shore as possible to be able to solve the problem of the passage between new guinea and new holland at this place boat that have be out fishing bring back a sort of cockle some require two man to lift they and contain as much as twenty pound of good wholesome meat take possession proceeding slowly through a network of reef shoal and island the boat always sound ahead he have the satisfaction of pass the strait between cape york and new guinea leave torre 's track considerably to the north on get clear of the strait they land for the last time in australian water and hoist the english flag : take possession of the whole eastern coast from the above latitude -lrb- 38 degree 0 minute south -rrb- down to this place by the name of new wale we fire three volley of small arm which be answer would by the like number from the ship admiral wharton say that in the king 's and the admiralty 's copy of cook 's journal the name be give as new south wale and in a letter write to mr john walker of whitby dated 13th September 1771 cook say : the east coast of new holland or what i call new south wale after a narrow escape of run on a reef near booby island from which they be only save by let go the anchor with all sail set they leave the difficulty of the new holland coast behind and sight new guinea on 29th August \*\*\* footnote : sting ray bay the great number of new plant etc we gentleman botanist have collect in this place occasion would my give in -lrb- sic -rrb- the name of botanist bay extract from the only page know to exist of the journal of the first voyage write by cook and dated 6th may 1770 it be July 1911 purchase by mr ft sabin for 451 pound chapter 11 1770 to 1771 new guinea to england the water on the new guinea coast be very shallow and keep they far out in run westward but on 3rd September they get a little nearer in so cook decide to attempt a landing and then to leave as he consider it be only waste valuable time to go over ground that have already be explore by the dutch bank say the crew be rather sickly they : be pretty far go with the longing for home which the physician have go so far as to esteem a disease under the name of nostalgia indeed i can find hardly anybody in the ship clear of its effect but the captain dr solander and myself and we three have ample constant employment for we mind which i believe to be the best if not the only remedy for it they be also on short allowance of food which would necessarily have a depressing effect and when they learn that cook would return to civilisation where fresh supplies could be obtain there be a marked improvement in the general health call in at the island of savu some supplies be obtain and the country be describe as very lovely although there have be no rain for seven month the contrast with the monotonous and barren-looking country of new holland be very marked at batavium accord to strict order from the admiralty cook on 30th September collect all log and journal that have be keep on board the ship and enjoin every one that they be on no account to divulge where they have be on they arrival at batavium off java head the main topsail be split in a squall and cook remark that all he sail be now in such a condition that they will hardly stand the least puff of wind no observation have be possible since leave savu and the strong western current have throw out they dead reckoning cause they to run past the strait of sunda but pick themselves up on 1st October they get into the strait and after a wearisome beat up arrive in batavium on the 10th and hick be send on shore to announce they arrival and offer a apology for fail to salute the dutch flag in a proper manner -- the reason be that they have only three gun available the ship be thoroughly survey and on the carpenter 's report cook apply to the governor for a convenient place in which to heave down and repair and for permission to purchase such store as might be necessary every assistance be promise and on cook 's find a difficulty in get any private person to cash the bill he would have to draw for he expense the governor order the officer in charge of the port to supply whatever amount might be necessary during a heavy thunderstorm on the 12th a dutch east indiaman about two cable away from the endeavor have mainmast split all to shiver the endeavor be also strike : and in all probability we should have share the same fate as the dutchman have it not be for the electric chain which we have but just before get up this carry the lightning or electrical matter over the side clear of the ship on 25th October cook reopen communication with the admiralty forwarding to mr stephen by the dutch east indiaman kronenberg captain f kelgar a packet contain a copy of he journal -lrb- sell to mr john corner in 1890 -rrb- chart of the south sea new zealand and the east coast of australium he also write a letter give a outline of he voyage up to date and conclude : in this journal i have with undisguised truth and without gloss insert the whole transaction of the voyage and make such remark and have give such description of thing as i thought be necessary in the best manner i be capable of although the discovery make in the voyage be not great yet i flatter myself they be such as may merit the attention of they lordship and altho ' i have fail in discover the so much talk of southern continent -lrb- which perhaps do not exist -rrb- and which i myself have much at heart yet i be confident that no part of the failure of such discovery can be lay to my charge have we be so fortunate not to have run ashore much more would have be do in the latter part of the voyage than what be but as it be i presume this voyage will be find as compleat as any before make to the south sea on the same account praise he crew the plan i have draw of the place i have be at be make with all the care and accuracy that time and circumstance would admit of thus far i be certain that the latitude and longitude of few part of the world be better settle than these in this i be very much assist by mr green who let slip no one opportunity for make observation for settle the longitude during the whole course of the voyage and the many valuable discovery make by mr bank and dr solander in natural history and other thing useful to the learn world can not fail of contribute very much to the success of the voyage in justice to the officer and the whole of the crew i must say they have go through the fatigue and danger of the whole voyage with that cheerfulness and alertness that will always do honor to the british seaman and i have the satisfaction to say that i have not lose one man by sickness during the whole voyage i hope that the repair want to the ship will not be so great as to detain we any length of time you may be assure that i shall make no unnecessary delay either here or at any other place but shall make the best of my way home bank too note that there be no sick on board and contrast the rosy healthy appearance of the crew with the pallid face of the european of batavium but on 26th October a series of disastrous entry commence in the journal set up the ship 's tent for the reception of the ship 's company several of they begin to be take ill owe as i suppose to the extream hot weather batavium have a ill-omened reputation and it have be estimate that from 1735 to 1755 no less than 1000000 death take place chiefly from malarial fever and dysentery and cook have soon cause to regret that the dutch have undertake the repair of the ship leave he man to look on he know well the evil effect of want of occupation in such a climate though he could not guess what it be to cost he up to this time he have only seven death to record since leave plymouth three from drown two frozen -lrb- mr bank 's servant -rrb- one consumption and one alcoholic poisoning : probably a record never equal in the history of navigation on 5th November mr monkhouse the surgeon die and cook bank and solander be very ill the two last go up into the hill but cook would not leave he ship meanwhile the repair go on the ship be find to be worse than have be expect two plank and a half have be rasp by the rock to the thickness of one eighth of a inch for a distance of six foot : and here the worm have make they way quite into the timber so that it be a matter of surprise to every one who see she bottom how we have keep she above water and yet in this condition we have sail some hundred of league in as dangerous a navigation as in any part of the world happy in be ignorant of the continual danger we be in by the 14th she bottom be thoroughly repair and cook speak highly of the dutch workman : i do not believe there be a marine yard in the world where work be do with more alertness than here or where there be better convenience for heave ship down both in point of safety and despatch the water a perquisite of the commodore of the dutch east indian fleet be very unsatisfactory and be find to keep very badly at sea although its keep property have be loudly vaunted by the commodore cook be present at he appointment : one of the grandest sight batavium afford that may be too and yet it do not recompense we for we trouble i think that the whole be but ill conduct and the fleet appear to be very badly mann would a seaman who have run from a dutch ship enter on the endeavor be claim by the dutch on the grounds that he be a dane from elsinore cook promise he should be give up if he prove not to be a british subject and enquiry by mr hick result in a report to the governor that he be a irishman so the matter drop he name be jame marra and he will be again meet with as gunner 's mate on the resolution death of tupium before leave batavium there have be seven death include mr reynold artist and tupium and he boy servant and cook give the number of sick as forty or more hope the sea breeze might have a beneficial effect preparation be hurry forward and they manage to leave the day after christmas day be duly salute by the garrison with fourteen gun and the earl of elgin with thirteen gun and three cheer all of which we return would call at prince 's island in the strait of sunda where some of the batavian water be replace by better the sailor be allow to purchase whatever they fancy in hope of diminish the dysentery which be rampant every precaution that could be think of be try but in vain mr bank lose messr sporing and parkinson and on 29th January mr green die he have be long ill but cook say he would not take proper care of himself to judge from he own journal he must have be rather a difficult man to get on with but he service as observer be invaluable and he at all time and season be devote to he special duty : indeed at time he appear to have think that every other work should give way to he it be a somewhat suggestive fact that bank hardly make any reference to mr green throughout he journal on 27th February the terrible list of loss be close by the death of three of the crew make in all thirty death since they arrival at batavium it be afterwards discover that the season in batavium have be unusually unhealthy and several ship that have call in there have to report heavy loss cook say : thus we find that ship which have be little more than twelve month from england have suffer would as much or more by sickness than we have do who have be out near three time as long yet they suffering will hardly if at all be mention or know in england when on the other hand those of the endeavor because she voyage be uncommon will very probably be mention in every news paper and what be not unlikely with additional hardship we never experience for such be the disposition of man in general in these voyage that they be seldom content with the hardship and danger which will naturally occur but they must add other which hardly ever have existence but in they imagination by magnify the most trifling accident and circumstance to the greatest hardship and unsurmountable danger without the immediate interposition of providence as if the whole merit of the voyage consist in the real danger and hardship they undergo or that the real one do not happen often enough to give the mind sufficient anxiety thus posterity be teach to look upon these voyage as hazardous to the highest degree at the cape on 6th march land be sight at daylight about two league away near cape natal and on the 15th the cape of good hope be see the first thing to be do be to provide shelter ashore for he sick of whom he land twenty-eight and during the stay the remainder of the crew be give every possible opportunity of be on land as cook recognize the value of a entire change of life in shake off the remnant of sickness he lose three more of he man here and hear from a dutch ship just in from europe that war be threaten between england and spain he hurry up he preparation for departure and get all he man on board though some be still very ill in addition he manage to enter some half-dozen man for the voyage home in writing of the cape cook draw attention to the fact : that a stranger be at once strike with surprise and disappointment for no country we have see this voyage afford so barren a prospect as this and not only so in appearance but in reality then further on he say : notwithstanding the many disadvantage this country labor under such be the industry economy and good management of the dutch that not only the necessary but all the luxury of life be raise here in great abundance and be sell as cheap if not cheaper than in any part of europe some few article except on the other hand he complain of the exorbitant charge make by the dutch east indium company for naval store as at batavium they be sell at a certain fixed price from which there be no deviation call in at st helena they find hmss portland and swallow with a convoy in the road and receive some few much-needed store from they together with the information that all danger of war between spain and england be over they all sail in company on 5th may but after a few day cook explain to captain elliott of the portland who have come on board the endeavor that he ship sail and rigging be naturally not in very good order after he lengthy voyage and therefore he should probably be unable to keep up with the other ship he request the portland to take charge of letter chart and journal for the admiralty these papers only arrive in england three day in advance of the endeavor for some day the good bark keep within easy reach of the fleet and be able to obtain extra medical advice for mr hick who be suffer from consumption when he leave england but have hold out well till stricken with the batavian fever when he gradually sink and die on 25th may mr charle clerke be appoint third lieutenant in place of mr gore promote since leave the cape they have also lose they master mr molineaux of whose intelligence cook speak very highly but deplore he want of steadiness the true cause of he early death mr pickersgill be appoint to the vacancy anchor in the downs on the 21st June they be still in sight of some of the convoy but during the night they have they main topgallant sail split and the topmast spring in a heavy squall in fact they gear be in such a bad state that something give way daily on 7th July they speak a brig from london three day out from scilly and learn that no account of they proceedings have yet be make public and that wager be be lay that the endeavor be lose on 10th July nichola young who have sight new zealand sight the land 's end and the lizard be see the next day on Saturday 13th July 1771 at 3 o'clock in the pm anchor would in the downs and soon after i land in order to repair to london before leave cook write to mr stephen inform he of he arrival and announce that he be come up to the admiralty to lay before they lordship a full account of the whole voyage and that the ship be to await further order he hope that the appointment that he have make will meet with approval and request that he chart plan and drawing may be lay before the authority on 2nd August stephen write to he at mile end say he have receive the papers send from batavium those by the portland and those from the downs and that they have be lay before they lordship he go on : i have the pleasure to acquaint you that they lordship extremely well approve of the whole of you proceedings and that they have great satisfaction in the account you have give they of the good behavior of you officer and man and of the cheerfulness and alertness with which they go through the fatigue and danger of they late voyage he also notify at the same time that the appointment make have all be confirm cook himself be appoint commander of the scorpion on 29th August but owe to other arrangement be make do not put in a appearance on he new ship isaac smith and isaac manly be appoint respectively master 's mate and midshipman take part in the second voyage be too young for further promotion the newspaper of course blossom out into paragraph on the subject of the voyage more or less correct and bingley 's journal on 23rd July state : in consequence of this discovery more ship will be destine in search of this new terrestrial acquisition evidently it be quickly decide that cook 's rest be to be short on 27th the same journal say : he majesty 's ship the endeavor which be lately arrive in the river from the east indy lose by the unhealthiness of the climate 70 of she hand tho ' they be pick man and have be several time in the indy however those who survive will have make they fortune by traffic have bring home some of the richest goods make in the east which they be suffer to dispose of without the inspection of the custom house officer this we correspondent say be allow they by the government as a reward for they hard and dangerous service during a voyage of three year the amount of the richest goods make in the east obtain from new zealand australium and otaheite would be but a poor reward for three year ' strenuous service and cook here find he premonition as to he loss be exaggerate only too true it be worthy of note that the number of punishment throughout the voyage be remarkably small those enter in the ship 's log be twenty-one and the heaviest sentence two dozen lash for theft in one case that of mathew cox ab for disobedience and mutinous conduct the culprit proceed civilly against cook on arrival in england and the admiralty solicitor be instruct to defend the case be probably allow to drop as no result can be find last of the endeavor the good ship which have so bravely bear she part be not give much rest but after be pay off at woolwich be despatch under lieutenant jame gordon to the falkland island on 16th October and return with perishable and unserviceable store in 1772 and 1773 she again make voyage to the same destination the last one to bring away the garrison and store as those island be to be hand over to spain she be pay off at woolwich in September 1774 and shortly afterwards be sell out of the navy for the sum of 645 pound she be then believe to have be employ as a collier in the north sea mr gibb of the firm of gibb and canning of newport rhode island one day point out to the english consul the remains of a old vessel fall into decay and inform he that it be captain cook 's ship the endeavor he story be that the french government be anxious to compete with england in the whale fishery offer a bounty to the ship in that trade sailing under the french flag a mr hayden purchase the old ship from a dunkirk firm and re-christen she la liberte load she with oil and consign she under french color to gibb and canning at newport she be chase by a english ship but escape and after lay alongside a wharf for some month receive a cargo but run aground in try to leave the harbor she be find in such a bad condition that she be allow to remain to drop to piece enquiry into this story give satisfactory result and a box make from she timber be present to j fennimore cooper the american author with letter authenticate as far as possible the vessel from which the wood have be take miss cooper mention this box in she preface to she father 's red rover and several other relic of the old ship be still to be find in the neighborhood of newport chapter 12 1771 preparation for second voyage after report himself to the admiralty on he arrival in england cook proceed to he home at mile end old town where he be for some time employ in complete he chart and journal and on 14th August the annual register announce he be introduce to he majesty at st jame 's when he : present he journal of he voyage with some curious map and chart of different place that he have draw during the voyage he be present with a captain 's commission he also find time to write two long and instructive letter to he old master and good friend mr john walker of whitby which be to be find in dr young 's work they give a rapid glance at the different place visit with a few pithy remark as to they people and production mention the please reception he have from the king and he allude to the probability of be despatch on a second voyage with two ship edgeworth in he memoirs state that about this time cook be a frequent visitor at denham place the home of mr loui way fr but as that gentleman die in this year and edgeworth also refer to event of a later date as occur at the same time it be more probable that these visit be pay after the second voyage to mr benjamin way also fr and a director of the south sea company in another place edgeworth infer that bank solander and cook be member of a club which meet at slaughter 's coffee house in 1765 of course this be a error for cook be then engage in newfoundland and unknown to the royal society whose member compose the club speak of in fact cook though a frequent guest in after time be never a member of the royal society club fanny burney -lrb- madame d'arblay -rrb- say that in September she father dr charle burney spend a few day at hinchinbroke lord sandwich 's place in order to meet cook bank and solander and it be evident that the second voyage have be resolve on for dr burney 's son jame be introduce to cook by lord sandwich with a view to go on the expedition shortly after this sandwich meet dr burney at lord oxford 's houghton and ask he if he could recommend any one capable of write the history of the voyage of the endeavor he give dr hawkesworth 's name and be request to introduce he to lord sandwich on he return to town the object of the second voyage be to use cook 's own word : to put a end to all diversity of opinion about a matter so curious and important be he majesty 's principal motive in direct this voyage to be undertake the history of which be now submit to the public ie the existence of another continent in the south the discussion on the subject have be resume with renew vigor after the return of the endeavor and dalrymple lead one party who hold that cook have not set the matter at rest as he have leave far too much space untraversed whitby ship again the two ship that be to be employ be probably select in the thame by cook himself and like the good ship endeavor be build by fishburn of whitby and purchase from captain w hammond of hull the reasoning which guide cook in he selection be thus lay down by he in he introduction to the account of the second voyage : the success of such undertaking as make discovery in distant part of the world will principally depend on the preparation be well adapt to what ought to be the first consideration namely the preservation of the adventurer and ship and this will chiefly depend on the kind the size and the property of the ship choose for the service these primary consideration will not admit of any other that may interfere with the necessary property of the ship therefore in chus the ship should any of the most advantageous property be want and the necessary room in they be in any degree diminish for less important purpose such a step would be lay a foundation for render the undertaking abortive in the first instance the ship must not be of great draught but of sufficient capacity to carry a proper quantity of provision and store for the crew and of such construction that she will bear to take the ground and of such a size that she can be conveniently lay on shore if necessary for repair any damages or defect and these quality be to be find in north country build ship such as be build for the coal trade and in none other the larger of the two choose be 462 ton purchase for 4151 pound and receive into the royal navy under the name of the drake she be fit as a sloop at deptford at a cost of 6568 pound -lrb- this sum probably cover both the original alteration which prove unsatisfactory and those make immediately before sailing -rrb- and at the time of she purchase be about fourteen month old the second ship be of 336 ton also fit at deptford as a sloop be eighteen month old at time of purchase cost 2103 pound and be receive under the name of raleigh the complement of the raleigh be eighty but two additional carpenter ' mate be add to each ship later on cook be also instruct not to bear as be then usual any servant on the book but to enter ab instead and each officer who be entitle to a servant be to be pay a allowance by bill equal to the wages of the number of servant respectively allow they on 25th December the name of the two ship be change the drake become the resolution and the raleigh the adventure the lieutenant appoint to the resolution be robert pallisser cooper charle clerke and richard pickersgill and mr tobia furneaux commander and joseph shank first lieutenant of the adventure of these officer cook write : i have all the reason in the world to be perfectly satisfy with the choice of the officer the second and third lieutenant the lieutenant of marine two of the warrant officer and several of the petty officer have be with I during the former voyage the other be man of known ability and all of they on every occasion show they zeal for the service in which they be employ during the whole voyage alteration to the resolution two day after receive he order cook hoist he pendant and superintend the alteration that be to be make for the accommodation of mr bank and he party of scientist these comprise dr solander zoffanus the portrait painter dr lynd of edinburgh to secure whose service parliament have make a special grant of 4000 pound -lrb- though what discovery they expect he to make i could not understand say cook -rrb- and nine other draughtsman and servant at least three more than have be think necessary when the vessel be purchase these alteration be : to raise she upper work about a foot to lay a spar deck upon she from the quarter-deck to the forecastle -lrb- she have at this time a low waist -rrb- and to build a round house or coach for my accommodation so that the great cabin might be appropriate to the use of mr bank alone the comptroller of the navy captain pallisser be strongly oppose to these alteration as likely to be detrimental to the ship 's sailing quality and though he opinion be overborne they in the end prove to be correct when he have see the alteration fairly on the way cook apply for three week ' leave of absence on the plea that he have some business to transact in yorkshire as well as to see a aged father and he application be at once grant he therefore go to ayton where for the first time for seventeen year he be again amongst he own people from ayton he go on to whitby and be meet some mile out from that town by many of the lead man of the place from the walker he receive the heartiest of welcome and it be related that the old housekeeper mary prowd have be carefully instruct that a commander in he majesty 's navy be a very different person from one of she master 's apprentice and must be receive with all the mark of respect due to he rank she promise obedience but alas when the time come she memory flee and open wide she arm she exclaim : o honey jame how glad i be to see thee a welcome probably more dear to cook than any other could have be and a proof of the affectionate regard he could inspire in February he be back in london and dr burney say in he memoirs : i have the honor of receive the illustrious captain cook to dine with I in queen 's square -lrb- bloomsbury -rrb- previously to he second voyage round the world observe upon a table bougainville 's voyage autor du monde he turn it over and make some curious remark on the illiberal conduct of that circumnavigator towards himself when they meet and cross each other which make I desirous to know in examine the chart of m de bougainville the several track of the two navigator and exactly where they have cross or approach each other captain cook instantly take a pencil from he pocket book and say he would trace the route which he do in so clear and scientific a manner that i would not take fifty pound for my book the pencil mark have be fix by skim milk will always be visible this volume be now in the british museum and the pencil mark on the chart be as distinct as on the day they be make the alteration to the ship be complete early in February and on the 6th she be haul out of dock and rig ballast and store commence cook say : every department seem to vie with the other in equipe these two ship every standing rule and order in the navy be dispense with every alteration every necessary and useful article be grant as soon as ask for supplies increase in another passage he again refer to the anxiety of the navy board to see that the quality of the store be everything that could be wish and the quantity be increase from one to two and a half year ' supply on the 22nd April the two sloop be at longreach to take in they gun and gunner ' store twelve carriage gun and twelve swivel musketoon for the resolution and ten carriage gun and ten swivel for the adventure these should have be take on board at galleon 's reach but the resolution be draw too much water -- seventeen foot when here cook show that he think she be rather over-weighted with she new upper work and might prove crank but : as the gentleman 's apartment be full of heavy baggage and the sloop a good deal lumber aloft with heavy and some useless article which we might soon get rid of or get into the hold after we have consume some of we provision i still entertain hope that she would bear all she additional work and suspend give any other opinion until a full trial have be make of she foresee what would be the consequence in case she do not answer in the manner she be now fit on 29th April mr bank give a entertainment on board to lord sandwich the french ambassador and other distinguished personage and cook note that the first name have be on board several time a laudable tho ' rare thing in a first lord of the admiralty cook obtain a few day ' leave to make he final arrangement and the resolution be order to the downs under the first lieutenant whilst the adventure proceed to plymouth both vessel sailing from longreach on 10th may the resolution contend against adverse wind make a very slow trip down to the nore be four day on the journey and mr cooper report to cook that she be very crank the latter at once write to the admiralty that he consider it unsafe to proceed any further with she in that condition and propose that she poop should be cut down she mast shorten and she gun exchange to four-pounder the navy board however decide that she should be restore to she original state as far as it be possible to do so she be therefore order to sheerness and she captain be instruct to join he ship and see the alteration be properly carry out before leave london cook who have hear it be say that he be not satisfy with the vessel choose for the voyage write to mr stephen on the subject give he opinion that the crankness of the resolution be owe to the additional work that have be build upon she in order to make large accommodation for the several gentleman passenger intend to embark in she he add that the propose alteration of the navy board would render she as fit to perform the voyage as any ship whatever and refer to the report that he do not approve of the type of ship he say from the knowledge and experience i have have of these sort of vessel i shall always be of opinion that only such be proper to be send on discovery to very distant part on the 21st he again write stephen that the alteration be make satisfactory progress and that a man have be in the yard who have know the ship before she purchase and he have with some warmth assert that at that time she be not only a stiff ship but have as many good quality as any ship ever build in whitby in reply to a rumor that the man be afraid to sail in she he point out that she be moor alongside a wharf and the man could go ashore whenever they please yet he have not lose a single man bank withdraw mr bank do not approve of the reduction in he accommodation necessitate by these alteration and try to get a 40-gun ship in place of the resolution and he and he friend succeed in raise a very acrimonious discussion on the subject but the admiralty stand firm and the alteration go on under the superintendence of cook on 24th may bank and solander go to inspect she and on they return to town bank write to the admiralty that he should not go the voyage as the ship be neither roomy nor convenient enough for my purpose nor no way proper for the voyage cook who say the preparation have cost bank about five thousand pound do not think that the reason give by bank be the only one he have for not take part in the voyage and then continue they baggage etc be get out of the sloop and send to london after which no more complaint be hear of want of room etc lieutenant clerke who be very friendly with bank write to he on 31st may : indeed i be sorry i be not to have the honor of attend you the other boutthey be go to stow the major part of the cable in the hold to make room for the people now i ask gilbert -lrb- the master -rrb- if such be the present case what the devil should we have do if we have all go ` oh by god that be impossible ' be he answer marra -lrb- the gunner 's mate -rrb- in a journal of the voyage publish by newberry 1775 say the success of the voyage be due to they have shake off : the train of gentleman who with they attendant occupy the chief accommodation of the ship and whose presence would have render it out of the power of the most determined officer to have carry such a princely retinue through the icy region which they be to pass without murmur or perhaps mutiny some of the newspaper try to make political matter out of the affair and one at any rate roundly declare that the true reason of bank 's withdrawal be on account of a remonstrance from the spanish ambassador against any further exploration of the south sea the withdrawal of bank make no difference to he friendship with cook and in the future he be always ready to afford he support whenever it could be of any service either to he friend or family john reinhold forster as soon as it be know that mr bank have withdraw mr john reinhold forster a german of some scientific reputation apply for the position of naturalist for the voyage and through the interest of lord sandwich be successful he be to receive the 4000 pound grant by parliament for dr lynd and be to pay all expense except ship 's allowance of food and provide all necessary instrument he be accompany by he son as assistant a youth of about twenty year who afterwards attain some note by he writings and translation messr wale and bayley be appoint astronomer by the board of longitude with instruction to take and compare observation at every possible opportunity and to take under they special charge the timepiece which be be carry on the two ship for the purpose of test they accuracy and capability in assist in ascertain the longitude two of these instrument make by arnold be place in mr bayley 's charge on the adventure and two one by arnold and the other by kendal on harrison 's principle under the care of mr wale on the resolution great precaution be take to prevent any accident or tamper with these instrument they be keep in box have three lock the key be hold one by the captain one by the first lieutenant and the third by the astronomer so they could not even be wind up except in the presence of all three william hodge a painter of repute be appoint as artist and he picture be to become the property of the admiralty the celebrated dr joseph priestley at that time minister at mill hill chapel leed have be invite by mr bank to accompany he as astronomer and he congregation have undertake to guarantee he position on he return but the board of longitude take objection to he religious view and so he application be withdraw chapter 13 1772 to 1774 second voyage say goodbye to he family on 21st June cook accompany by mr wale leave london for sheerness and the next day drop down to the nore the resolution be now draw only fifteen foot ten inch of water instead of seventeen a very satisfactory improvement she be give a good trial on a wind and be find to answer exceed well on 3rd July they arrive at plymouth have be board the day before by lord sandwich and captain pallisser who be on a tour of inspection and cook have the pleasure of give they a satisfactory account of he ship : i have not one fault to allege on arrival at plymouth cook find that order have be give to the store that he be to be supply with whatever he think necessary but the only thing require be larger copper for the distil apparatus the one they have on board have prove far too small the officer and crew be pay up to 28th may and the petty officer and man also receive two month ' advance to enable they to provide necessaries and extra for the voyage cook remark : the payment of six month ' wages to the officer and crew of these two sloop be nearly all they have due be a indulgence never before grant to any of he majesty 's ship cook now receive he final order which he have assist to draw up -- in fact nothing be insert that i do not fully comprehend and approve of he be to call at madeira for a supply of wine to sail for the cape of good hope and there refresh he man then to look for cape circumcision place by m bouvet in 54 degree south 11 degree 20 minute east to determine if it form part of a continent and if so to explore it follow the coast and endeavor to get as near to the south pole as he could without endanger he ship or crew should cape circumcision prove to be a island or should he be unable to find it he be to proceed as far south as he think there be a probability of meeting with land and then steer east circumnavigate the world in as high a latitude as he could in case of meeting with land he be to explore as far as time would permit when the season render it unsafe to remain in high latitudes he be to retire to the north to refit and recruit and at a proper season to return to the south in any unforeseen circumstance he be to use he own discretion and if the resolution should be lose he be to prosecute he voyage in the adventure a copy of these order be give to captain furneaux and in case of separation the follow rendezvous be name : madeira port praya in the island of st iago the cape of good hope and new zealand forster save ship the forster evidently be far from pleasant travel companion and at one time or another seem to have quarrel with every one on board the ship at the very first the father be dissatisfy with the accommodation allot to he and offer mr cooper 100 pound to turn out of he cabin when this offer be decline he try to force mr gilbert the master to give up he threaten if he refuse he should be report to the king and turn out of the navy this threat appear to have be a favorite one and soon become a by-word with the seaman who accord to mr wale would use it to each other on every possible occasion but accord to he own account mr forster be able to save the expedition from a very great disaster on 12th July he say he come on deck and notice the ship be adrift from she mooring neither the officer of the watch nor the look-out have see it till he call attention and then after a scene of the greatest confusion the ship be fortunately bring up within a few foot of the rock on the other hand the master 's log admit the resolution get adrift but before mr forster reach the deck the fact have be report to the captain all hand turn up the jib and forestay sail set and the ship quietly drop down into the sound and anchor never have be in the slightest danger the only other one to notice the affair be midshipman willi who simply state drop from the buoy and anchor in the sound have receive the private signal of the east indium company 's navy and letter of introduction from the prince of orange to all the principal officer of the dutch east indium company instruct they to afford every assistance that might be require cook hoist the signal to the adventure to weigh anchor at 5 be on 13th July and with a north-west breeze the two ship sail for madeira when well out in the channel the resolution 's crew be muster and it be find that owe to a mistake of the clerk there be one man more than the complement so john coghlan be enter on the supernumerary list for wages and victuals on the 23rd they be able to relieve a small french boat from ferrol to corunna which have be blow far off she course and have be short of water for a fortnight the day follow they fall in with three spanish men-o ' - war cook say : the sternmost hoisted english color and fire a gun to leeward and soon after hoist he own proper color and speak with the adventure it appear she enquire who they be and where they be go and finally wish they a good voyage this account do not satisfy mr forster who wax eloquent and describe the event as a scene so humiliating to the master of the sea he must have form a strange opinion of cook if he think for a moment he be one to put up silently with anything humiliating to the british flag marra in he journal point out that the build and rig of the ship be unusual for men-o ' - war and that when the spaniard find they have stop king 's ship they make a proper apology and very politely take leave wish they a good voyage the first loss at madeira where they arrive on 29th July they be kindly receive by mr loughnan a merchant of funchal who entertain some of the party at he house throughout the stay obtain permission for the forster to explore the island and procure for the ship the store that be require here cook with he eye on the scurvy purchase as many onion as he think would keep good and order they to be serve out regularly to the crew as long as they last a further stock of fresh food in the shape of fowl pig goat and fruit -- chiefly orange and banana -- be lay in at port praya where they have call for water on the 19th the first death occur one of the carpenter 's mate henry smook be at work on one of the scuttle and fall overboard be see under the stern every effort be make to save he but it be too late cook say he be a good steady man whose loss be often feel during the voyage on 27th August cook learn that the adventure have also have she loss two midshipman lambrecht and kemp have die of fever bring on captain furneaux believe by bathing and drinking too much water under the hot sun of port praya at this time the resolution have a clean bill of health but for fear lest the heavy rain to which they be continually subject might cause sickness the ship be constantly fumigate wash down and thoroughly dry by means of stove as advise by captain pallisser and campbell with satisfactory result on near the cape a sharp but unavailing look-out be keep for a bank which have be report and on 30th October they arrive in table bay the run from home be consider to have be good as they have in great measure escape the calm they have be tell to expect at that season of the year and the current though very strong have only cause a difference between the longitude obtain by observation and that by dead reckoning of three-quarter of a degree so cook conclude that those north of the equator in the one direction be balance by those to the south in the contrary one on landing they be receive by the governor baron plattenberg who tell cook he have receive order from holland that the two sloop be to have every assistance that the place afford he also say that two french ship command by m de kerguelen have discover land in 48 degree south near the meridian of mauritius but after sail along the coast for about forty mile he have be blow off by a heavy gale in which he have lose both boat and man two other french ship have also call in march which be on they way to explore the south pacific under m marion wale and bayley get they instrument ashore in order to make observation for the purpose of correct the watch machine that make by kendal be find to be work well and give the longitude within one minute of time when compare with that fix by messr mason and dixon in 1761 the first lieutenant of the adventure mr shank who have be ill almost from the day of leave england apply for leave to return home as he feel unfit to proceed and mr arthur kemp be make first lieutenant he place be take by mr jame burney mr sparrman a former pupil of linnaeus be engage by mr forster as a assistant and make he appearance on the roll as servant the crew be well look after as much time grant on shore as possible and fresh meat fresh vegetable and fresh baked bread be serve out daily in ample quantity so that when the ship sail to the southward they be all in as good a condition as when they leave england cook find time to write a letter of farewell to mr walker as it be : customary for man to take leave of they friend before they go out of the world for i can hardly think myself in it so long as i be deprive of have any connection with the civilised part of it and this will soon be my case for two year at least he at the end speak of he ship both well provide and well mann would and of the resolution he say : i can assure you i never set foot in a finer ship the first ice on 22nd November they sail for the south and soon begin to feel the colder climate the warm jacket and trousers provide by the admiralty be serve out extra cuff to protect the hand be sew on and warmly-lined canvas cape be make from the 29th till 6th December they be involve in such a heavy gale that the ship be unable to carry any sail and a large quantity of the live stock buy at the cape perish from the effect of wet and cold a scuttle which have be insecurely fasten be burst open by the sea and a considerable quantity of water be take on board but beyond necessitate some work at the pump and render thing unpleasantly damp for a time no damage be do it however give mr forster a opportunity for a account of the terrible danger they be in and most wonderful to relate to speak well of the conduct of the crew the ship be carry so far to the east by the gale that cook give up the idea of search for cape circumcision for the present on the 10th the first ice be encounter in latitude 50 degree 40 minute south and a little higher they be stop by a large field to which they could see no end either to the east west or south this field be follow along to the south-east for some day but no opening be find so be in constant danger from detach piece cook reluctantly give order to change the course to the northward about the middle of December sign of scurvy begin to show and extra precaution be at once take fresh wort be serve out regularly to all hand and the worst case receive considerable benefit from the treatment although rob of lemon and orange -lrb- a sort of jelly make from the fruit -rrb- have have no effect furneaux report at this time that he have cure two very bad case with the rob ship part when they have get thoroughly clear of all sign of ice cook once again turn south and by 26th December have work down as far as 50 degree 31 minute south 26 degree 57 minute east where though surround by large mass of float ice they steer to the west leave the main ice field to the north of they gradually work down to 60 degree south in the longitude give for cape circumcision and be some ninety-five league further south with no sign of land cook conclude that m bouvet must have be deceive by the ice -lrb- bouvet island be discover by the german deep sea discovery ship valdivium on 25th November 1898 the position be fix as 54 degree 264 minute south 3 degree 242 minute south and not 54 degree south 11 degree 20 east as give to cook which will account for he want of success in he search for it -rrb- here mr wale be enable to get a sight of the moon for the second time since leave the cape of good hope and take several observation fix the position of the ship with tolerable accuracy change the course to east-south-east very foggy weather be encounter accompany by great cold which coat the rig with ice render it very pretty to the eye but difficult and unpleasant to work cook say that though this suggest very intense cold to the mind in reality the thermometer be rather higher than it have be and the sea be far less encumber with ice take large block of ice on board it be find that when the sea water be drain off they provide perfectly fresh water on melting thus remove a great weight from cook 's shoulder and he determine on venture further to the southward on 17th January 1773 they cross the antarctic circle in longitude 39 degree 35 minute east and at noon they latitude by observation be 66 degree 36 minute 30 seconds south the sea be free from ice however in the evening they find themselves completely block by a enormous field extend as far as the eye could reach from the south-east round to the west and as the summer be nearly over cook decide it be unwise to attempt anything further southward and order a retreat to the north again make for the land claim to have be discover by the french he spend some day search for it but nothing be see except some float weed and a few bird that be suppose never to get far away from land on 8th February a brisk gale spring up accompany by very hazy weather thicken into fog and the two vessel separate the resolution cruise about firing gun and burn flare but no response be hear and when the weather clear up the adventure be not to be see poor mr forster be dreadfully scare when he realize the two ship have part company he say that none of the crew ever look around the ocean without express concern on see we ship alone on this vast and unexplored expanse he seem to have be thoroughly unhappy for he describe the whole voyage from the cape to new zealand as a series of hardship such as have never before be experience by mortal man cook conjectured rightly as it prove that be a little to the south of tasman 's track furneaux would make for the rendezvous he have be give at new zealand and therefore feel himself free to push on to the south-east as he judge that if any large body of land be in the vicinity it must lie in that direction for the swell come from the south-west preclude the possibility of any mass of land be in that quarter on 17th February a display of the aurora australi be report to cook who speak of it as something quite new to he although bank note a display during the voyage of the endeavor between timor and batavium the present one be describe as have a spiral motion the direction not strongly define and at time strong flash of light a second display be see on the 25th but not so marked on this day too some of the ship 's boat engage in water from a small iceberg have a narrow escape from destruction as the berg turn completely over whilst they be at work the weather become very unsettled the resolution be oblige to make to the north and on 8th march the finest day they have experience since leave the cape they be able to fix they position by observation as 59 degree 44 minute south 121 degree 9 minute east the thermometer register 40 degree of course this pleasant break be follow by a heavy gale with a tremendously heavy sea and the ship run before it for new zealand cook 's wish be to touch at van diemen 's land so as to satisfy himself as to its form a part of new holland but the wind keep obstinately between west and north have shift after the gale and he think it would occupy a longer time than he could spare so he bear up for the south island it be soon find that a few degree of latitude make a great difference in the temperature which we feel with a agreeable satisfaction on 25th march at 10 be new zealand be sight and cook steer in to the land with the intention of put in to the first port that appear suitable but as the weather become very hazy he think it safer to stand off again he have pick up the land at a point which he have only see from a distance on he previous visit and now see it under so many disadvantageous circumstance that the less i say about it the fewer mistake i shall make dusky bay the follow day they get safely into dusky bay finding forty-four fathom at the entrance and a sandy bottom in about a couple of league they find a good anchorage in fifty fathom a hawser 's length or so from the shore this be find to be rather inconvenient but another one be soon find by lieutenant pickersgill and receive in consequence the name pickersgill harbor here the observatory forge and tent be set up spruce beer be brew to which molasses and some of they inspissate malt juice be add fish catch and in fact everything possible for the comfort of the crew for a short time be do they have be a hundred and seventeen day at sea have sail 3600 league without a sight of land and have arrive with only one man sick with the scurvy occasion chiefly by a bad habit of body and a complication of other disorder one day pass a island whilst out survey cook be call by a maorus and land to meet he the native be accompany by two woman and after a attempt at conversation present cook with a piece of native cloth ask as far as could be understand for a boat-cloak in return one be make for he out of red baize and give so much satisfaction that he present cook with he pattou a sort of short flat club make of stone he visit the ship and take great interest in all that be go on particularly with the saw pit after watch the man some time he intimate he desire to try he hand in the pit but find the work not quite so easy as it look and soon require very little persuasion to relinquish he task cook speak very favourably of dusky bay a good anchorage plenty of good water game fish and easy to enter the timber he describe as the best he have see in new zealand with the exception of that at the thame there be but little edible herbage but he try to remedy this by plant a quantity of european seed and he also leave in a place where he hope they might be undisturbed a pair of goose whilst here cook be for a time confine to he cabin by what he describe as a slight cold but mr forster say be a severe attack of rheumatism after several unsuccessful attempt owe to contrary wind they leave dusky bay on 11th may and on the 17th when near cape stephen fall in with six water-spout one of which come within fifty yard of the ship and cook regret he have not fire a gun at it as he have hear that course recommend he say he have one ready but be so busy note the phenomenon that he do not think of it in time on the other hand forster say that one be order to be get ready but we people be as usual very desultory about it the danger be pass before we could try the experiment furneaux report on 18th may they arrive in queen charlotte 's sound finding as cook have expect the adventure there before they furneaux immediately report himself to he command officer and say they have be there for six week after they have lose sight of the resolution on 8th February they hear a gun and bear up for it firing every half-hour but hear no reply they then cruise about for three day as near the spot as the weather would permit and then follow tasman 's track as cook have surmise make for new zealand sighting van dieman 's land on 9th march near tasman 's south cape he send a boat ashore at the first opportunity and a few trace of native be see but the weather be so threatening that the boat have to return to the ship they then put in to adventure bay and stay five day take in wood and water they have be reduce to a quart per day of the last for some time a few desert hut and occasional smoke be see but no other sign of the inhabitant they then continue up the coast till it trend away to the west form furneaux think a deep bay pass the island which now bear furneaux 's name bad weather come on and he judge it wise to make for he rendezvous firmly convinced that van dieman 's land be join to new holland on 30th march they sight the south island and be greatly retard in they run up the coast by the heavy swell from the north on they arrival in queen charlotte 's sound they find the pole erect on motuara with the name of the endeavor and date on it and several of the inhabitant come forward to trade and enquire after cook and tupium on 11th may they experience the shock of a earthquake but no damage be do finding that several of the adventure 's crew be very sick cook immediately send out boat for a supply of scurvy grass and : give order that it should be boil with wheat and portable broth every morning for breakfast and with pea and broth for dinner know from experience that these vegetable thus dress be extremely beneficial in remove all manner of scorbutic complaint furneaux have prepare to winter in queen charlotte 's sound but cook think it too soon to settle down to rest and decide to push on he be half inclined to go over to van diemen 's land and settle the question of its be a part of new holland but furneaux appear convinced and the wind be contrary so he decide on proceed eastward and the adventure be order to refit as rapidly as possible a boat send out for timber on 3rd June be chase by a large canoe fill with man but cook think no harm be intend on a second occasion some native be on the ship when a large canoe come up and those on board request cook to fire on it say its occupant be enemy this cook decline to do and instead invite they to come on board a invitation that be accept after a brief ceremonial and the newcomer behave themselves quite properly but soon cook have to get rid of they all for he find he man be sell they clothing which they would shortly require for thing of no value either as curiosity or otherwise the newcomer go off to motuara and cook follow they up he have some little conversation with they but do not remember have see any of they at he previous visit and think none of they recognize he they have they cooking utensil with they and he conclude they intend to settle down at any rate for a time garden have be start by furneaux on he arrival and cook try to interest the maori in they he show they the potato carrot and parsnip which they seem to understand and appreciate and they promise to look after they he remark that the intercourse between the maori and the whites do not tend to improve the moral of the former whom he have hitherto look upon as superior in that respect to the other south sea islander he have come across the watch machine on 7th June the two ship put to sea and on the 8th some accident happen to arnold 's timepiece on board the resolution and they be unable to wind it up so far it have be work very well but not quite so accurately as kendal 's on the return of the ship to england arnold be inform that either by carelessness or wilfully mr wale have cause this difficulty wale attribute this rumor to the forster to whom he write on the subject and it be very evident from they reply that though they do not admit have circulate the report they be not ignorant that arnold have be so inform there do not appear to be any ground for the accusation but it do appear very probable it originate with the forster throughout the rest of June they experience very rough weather and it be not till 18th July that they reach 133 degree west have see no sign of land on they way cook therefore turn northwards so as to cross the space between he track north and return south in 1769 this course would practically settle one view about the suppose southern continent for it have be lay down by some of the theorist that it must be in the middle latitudes of the south pacific new zealand have be say to be the western side of this continent -lrb- already disprove by cook in he previous voyage -rrb- and what forster call the pretended discovery near america the eastern side the propose course would take the ship through the center of the part of the ocean in dispute on 29th July cook send a boat to the adventure as he have hear she crew be very sickly and find that about twenty of she man be down with scurvy and the cook have die of the disease order be give that the utmost precaution be to be take and wort carrot marmalade and rob of lemon be to be freely serve out on the resolution at the same time three man be on the sick list only one of whom have scurvy but some of the other be show symptom so similar precaution be take with good result dangerous water cook be so anxious about the adventure 's crew that he would not look for pitcairn island discover by carteret although he believe he be in its neighborhood on 1st August -lrb- he be about fifteen league to the west -rrb- but a day or so after be able to have furneaux on board to dinner who report a great improvement he have some cider on board which he have serve out with gratifying result two island be sight on the 11th which cook name resolution and doubtful island he believe they to have be discover by de bougainville the follow morning at daylight they find themselves almost on the top of what cook call a half drown island or rather large coral shoal of about 20 league in circuit in the lagoon which it surround they see a large canoe under sail the island be name after furneaux as they be now in such a dangerous neighborhood cook order that at night the cutter with a officer and seven man should keep in advance of the ship until they arrive in sight of maitea -lrb- osnaburg island -rrb- on 15th July when be in water he know its service be discontinue he steer for the south side of otaheite in order to get fresh vegetable as soon as possible and on the 16th at daybreak they find themselves about two mile from the reef the wind drop and the set of the current be take they on to the reef so the boat be order out to tow but get near a opening through which the tide be rush with great force they be unable to keep the ship off the anchor be let go and the adventure finding hold ground be bring up but the resolution be not so fortunate and be carry on to the reef and strike two or three time fortunately without do any serious damage a land breeze spring up and the tide slacken enable they to get in safely with the loss of three anchor a cable and a couple of hawser the bower anchor be recover by mr gilbert the next day cook say that though he think they have a remarkably narrow escape the native who see they do not seem to appreciate that they have be in any danger they remain at this anchorage for a week and obtain plenty of coconut and banana but though they see hog they be unable to purchase any as the people declare they all belong to they chief so hear he be in the neighborhood cook land to call on he and at once recognize he as tearee whom he have see in 1769 the chief also remember he and enquire after several of the endeavor people he try to get cook to make a longer stay promising supplies of fresh meat as a inducement but as such promise have so often be break before cook reply he should leave the next day whilst here one of the marine who have be ail more or less all the voyage and have become dropsical die and the one man who be suffer from scurvy still remain on the sick list on the other hand the adventure 's crew have greatly improve in health with the change to fresh vegetable one of the native be find to have pick up coconut from which the sailor have drunk the milk and have carefully seal up the hole resell they and do not seem disconcerted when he trick be find out before the ship reach they anchorage at matavaus bay they be crowd with native many of whom cook recognize and almost all of whom know he otoo the king at once recognize cook and enquire after bank solander and other of the endeavor yet forster gravely assert that he never see they at the former visit the old fort on point venus be reoccupy tent pitch and the observatory set up and the camp be place under the command of lieutenant edgecombe of the marine spaniard hang the king give a theatrical entertainment in honor of they arrival at which he sister be the only female performer it have some reference to the come of the ship but they be not able to follow the thread of the story cook could see that otoo be nervous and uncomfortable and feel dissatisfied with he reception so determine to cut short he stay no one could understand the reason of the unsatisfactory feeling but forster suggest that it be owe to the advice of a spanish deserter who have leave he ship about march 1773 this vessel be command by don juan de langara y huarto and be from callao she voyage have not be publish but the native give forster to understand that four of she sailor have be hang on she arrival cook refer to the presence of a white man who when he think he have be observe disappear and be not see again young forster make a attempt to explore the interior but find the climb more difficult than he expect soon return in the garden which have be plant at the endeavor 's visit pumpkin seem to be the only thing which have do well and for these the native do not care which be not to be wonder at say cook further enquiry as to the religious ceremony be make but nothing very definite be ascertain it appear that on very rare occasion special criminal select by the high priest be sacrifice at the mori cook also form the opinion that the standard of morality amongst the woman be much higher than have previously be admit sail with a favourable wind on 1st September for huaheine the adventure run ashore go through the reef but with the assistance of the resolution 's boat she be soon tow off without serious damage forster as usual try to cause trouble by declare that cook would not send assistance till the resolution be safely anchor and thus add to the danger of he consort as the boat be in the water before the accident occur in order to render immediate assistance if require mr forster 's story be too thin on arrival cook be inform he old friend oree be come to see he so he go ashore to meet he the boat be haul up close to the chief 's house and then five young plantain tree as emblem of peace be carry on board one by one the first three be each accompany by a young pig with he ear ornament with coconut fiber the fourth be accompany by a dog and the fifth by the bag which cook have give oree in 1769 contain the pewter plate with the inscription relate to the endeavor 's visit and the bead and imitation coin on the advice of he guide cook decorate three of the plantain with nail medal bead etc and he furneaux and forster land with they in they hand they be request to sit down and the tree be take from they and place before oree the first for god the second for the king and the third for friendship the chief then come forward and greet cook in a most affectionate manner the tear trickle down he cheek further present be then exchange and the ceremony be over sparrman 's misadventure here they be able to purchase a plentiful supply of everything pig fowl and fruit and cook say if he have be able to stay longer he might have buy as much more as everything seem abundant the only disagreeable thing that happen be to mr sparrman who out by himself botanise be set upon and strip of everything but he trousers -- besant substitute spectacles for trousers he make he way towards the boat and be befriend by a native who give he some cloth to put over he shoulder and escort he to the other when oree hear of the affair he place himself in cook 's hand and do he best to find out the culprit and after a time sparrman 's hanger and the greater part of he thing be recover it seem probable that some native law have be unwittingly break and sparrman 's treatment be mean as a punishment for every one else have be particularly well treat before leave cook add to oree 's treasure a copper plate on which be inscribe anchor here he britannic majesty 's ship resolution and adventure September 1773 some medal be also give he and he be request to show they to any visitor that come at ulietea they be receive at a heava or dramatic performance one portion of which illustrate robbery by two man and cook say it be act in such a masterly manner as sufficiently display the genius of the people in this vice fruit and vegetable be rather scarce mr pickersgill be despatch with a boat from each ship to a island cook call o'taha where they be say to be plentiful and he be able to purchase as much as they have means to pay for at a very reasonable rate but during negotiation the bag contain the trade be steal pickersgill at once seize everything of value he could lay he hand on signify at the same time that all should be return when the bag and its contents be produce in the evening a chief who have be friendly all day go off and soon after come back with the bag and about half its contents eventually all be recover and the boat leave with good load in a perfectly friendly manner when the boat go from ulietea the crew of the two vessel be again entertain but during the night all the native disappear to the surprise and annoyance of cook who think something serious have happen to offend they it turn out that see the boat do not return the native think it be a case of desertion and be afraid they might be hold responsible bagpipe appreciate leave here the course be to the south of west so as to clear the track of other explorer and then to call at middleburg and amsterdam each night the ship lay to in order that they might not overlook any unknown island and on 23rd September harvey 's island be sight and name on 1st October middleburg be reach but no good anchorage be find they go on to amsterdam before they get clear away however two canoe come out and the coast open up in a more promising manner they run in again and find ground in twenty-five fathom plenty of the native quite unarmed come off to the ship some amongst whom be a chief name tioony be invite on board the trader be so anxious to do business that those who could not get near enough to hand they goods into the boat pitch they over the head of they friend some of the party accompany tioony to he house which be delightfully situate and be entertain with refreshment in the shape of coconut banana and a few shaddock call by forster pumplemose and music and in return the ship 's bagpipe play to the great enjoyment of the native turnbull who visit the pacific during the year 1800 to 1804 say that these instrument be remembered and in otaheite be specially ask for the musical contribution of the native commence with a song by three girl who sing rather nicely and be duly reward with present whereon all the woman begin singing in a manner which cook describe as both musical and harmonious a short walk disclose plantation well lay out and keep but as eatables seem scarce a departure be make the next day for amsterdam the wave break high upon the rock as they follow the coast off the southern point of amsterdam several canoe come out and they occupant come aboard without hesitation present cava root as a peace-offering the ship anchor in eighteen fathom and be soon crowd with visitor nothing but cloth be offer for sale so cook find the sailor be parting with clothing they would soon be want issue a order that no curiosity be to be purchase with the result that next morning hog fowl coconut and banana be forthcoming cook forster and some of the other go ashore and find a chief attago who have attach himself to cook very useful in they trading mr hodge paint a picture of this landing but as mr forster very justly point out the attire of the native be far too classical it be notice that many of the native have lose the top joint of the little finger of one and in some case of both hand this be understand to be a mark of mourning for the loss of parent the fowl here be remarkably good and the sailor purchase some for the purpose of cock-fighting but they prove much more successful in the pot the island be describe as well cultivate not a inch of ground be waste in road or fence forster report have see a large casuarina tree load with crow but they prove to be that pest of the fruit grower -- fly fox he also state that the resolution anchor in the same spot as tasman when he discover the island the native prove as adept at thieve as the majority of the south sea islander one man who have steal some book from the master 's cabin get off in he canoe and be chase take to the water and diving under he pursuer ' boat unshipp the rudder and get clear away mr wale in go ashore take off he shoe and stocking to save they from the wet when they be at once snatch up by a native who run off with they over the coral rock leave poor wale in what cook call a unpleasant but laughable position unable to follow over the sharp stone however attago soon afterwards recover they the language be closely ally to that use in the society group many word be identical and cook conclude they have some form of religious worship as he note enclosed piece of ground in which one or two particular man be accustom to repeat speech apparently of a set nature new zealand once more on 7th October sailing for new zealand they be delay by contrary wind and do not sight the neighborhood of table cape till the 21st they stand in to tolago and poverty bay with the intention of present any chief who come off with pig fowl and garden seed in hope of make a commencement in stock the island but none be see till cape kidnapper be reach when two make they appearance and be duly give two boar and two sow and four hen and two cock first obtain a promise that they should not be kill to these be add a supply of seed such as pea bean cabbage turnip etc stand on through a series of heavy squall in one of which the resolution lose she fore topgallant mast they run into a violent gale which last for a week and after a slight moderation come on with increase fury and the two vessel part company on 3rd November the resolution reach she old anchorage in ship cove queen charlotte 's sound but the adventure be see no more during the voyage forster be much upset by the stormy weather the dreadful energy of the language of the sailor the absence of they consort which double every danger the shortness of the table supplies and he own dislike to a further trip to southern latitudes hope the adventure might yet come in cook push on with he refit and thoroughly overhaul he store about 4000 pound weight of ship 's bread be find unfit for food and another 3000 pound nearly as bad they be very fortunate therefore in get a plentiful supply of scurvy grass and wild celery and a small quantity of vegetable from the garden they have previously lay out any doubt that may have be feel about the cannibalism of the new zealander be set at rest by some of the officer who surprise a party engage in a feast a human head be purchase from the feaster and take on board and a piece of the flesh be offer to a maori it be greedily devour a south sea islander odidie be intensely horrified and refuse to touch the knife with which it have be cut nor would he be in any way friendly with the eater cook firmly believe that only enemy kill in battle be eat and do not think the custom arise from any shortness of food enclose in a bottle which be bury under a marked tree in the garden a memorandum give the date of he arrival and departure the direction he intend to steer and other information he think might be useful to furneaux cook sail on 25th November and as they pass through the strait gun be continually fire and a sharp lookout keep for sign of the adventure but nothing be see and as no other rendezvous have be appoint cook give up all hope of she rejoin he the resolution when clear bear up for the south-east but have the course at the first be north of east the two ship might possibly have meet for the adventure be then on she way from tolago bay and arrive in ship cove four day after the departure of she consort cook say he crew be in good spirit and in no way deject or think the danger we have yet to go through be in the least increase by be alone they be quite ready to go wherever i might think proper to lead they even mr forster have to admit at a little later date that : notwithstanding the constant peril to which we course expose we in this unexplored ocean we ship 's company be far from be so uneasy as might have be expect armor of ice on 6th December at 830 be they reckon they be at the antipode to we friend in london consequently as far remove from they as possible here a swell come from the south-west show there be no great body of land in that direction except at a considerable distance the first ice be see on 12th December in 62 degree 10 minute south and on the 15th in 66 degree south they be oblige to edge away north as they be surround by large quantity of loose ice and it be very foggy work up to between 64 and 65 degree they again head east still hamper by ice and fog but in a few day the weather improve a little and they recover the antarctic circle and reach 67 degree 31 minute south on the 23rd the highest south latitude hitherto attain the rigging be so coated with ice that it be difficult to work the ship and cook alter he course to the north-east marra say under 18th December : icicle frequently hang to the nose of the man more than a inch longthe man case in frozen snow as if clothe in armor where the run rigging have be so enlarged by frozen sleet as hardly to be grasp by the largest handyet under all these hardship the man cheerful over they grog and not a man sick but of old scar cook say that some of the man suffer from fever bring on by the unavoidable exposure to cold and wet but it be slight and happily yield to the simplest remedy the ship be so surround by mass of ice as to cause some apprehension but by take advantage of every breath of air the danger be avert christmas day be pass in constant watchfulness we be fortunate in have continual daylight and clear weather for have it be foggy as on some of the precede day nothing less than a miracle could have save we from be dash to piece on 7th January 1774 five very successful observation give the mean longitude as 123 degree 21 minute west the watch give it 123 degree 44 minute and the dead reckoning as 123 degree 39 minute cook signify he keen appreciation of the watch machine and say : i must here take notice that we longitude can never be erroneous while we have so good a guide as mr kendal 's watch obedient and alert a further attempt to the south be make and on 30th January the high latitude of 71 degree 10 minute south be reach in longitude 106 degree 54 minute west further progress be stop by a large and solid field of ice this record be not beat till 1823 by weddell and until recent year very few of the attempt on antarctic discovery have prove as successful satisfied that there be no continent exist within the arctic circle except so far south as to be practically inaccessible on account of ice he acknowledge he do not regret he find it impossible to go further and think that in the unexplored part of the south pacific there be room for many large island and also that discovery already make have be imperfectly lay down on the chart he decide that it be he duty as he have a well-found ship and a healthy crew to remain in these water and add what he could to the knowledge of geography he therefore plan to find the land discover by juan fernandez in 38 degree south and if unsuccessful to proceed to easter island and fix its position as it be very uncertain then to proceed to otaheite where he have a faint hope he might hear of the adventure and proceed further west settle the position of tierra austral del espiritu santo of de quiros afterwards to turn south-east and reach cape horn in November he would have the best part of the summer for exploration in the south atlantic he say : great as this design appear to be i however think it possible to be execute and when i come to communicate it to the officer i have the satisfaction to find they all heartily concur in it i should not do these gentleman justice if i do not take some opportunity to declare that they always show the utmost readiness to carry into execution in the most effectual manner every measure i think proper to take under such circumstance it be hardly necessary to say that the seaman be always obedient and alert and on this occasion they be so far from wish the voyage at a end that they rejoice at the prospect of its be prolonged another year and of soon enjoy the benefit of a milder climate mr forster do not agree with this account for he say : the long continuance in these cold climate begin now to hang heavily on we crew especially as it banish all hope of return home this year which have hitherto support they spirit at first a painful despondence owe to the dreary prospect of another year 's cruise to the south seem paint in every countenance till by degree they resign themselves to they fate with a kind of sullen indifference it must be own however that nothing could be more deject than the entire ignorance of we future destination which without any apparent reason be constantly keep a secret to every person in the ship it be evident that cook and he officer do not think it necessary to consult mr forster as to the movement of the ship or what be more probable he be in one of he irritable mood and must say something nasty about someone the decision to turn northwards be take none too soon for on 6th February a furious storm come on play havoc with the sail and run rigging and though it abate somewhat next morning it blow very strong till the 12th and would have be highly dangerous if it have catch they amongst the ice on the 17th cook judge he have cross he outward track of 1769 and on the 20th he note the thermometer rise to 66 degree the only real summer day they have experience since leave new zealand have arrive at the position lay down for the land suppose to have be see by juan fernandez he cruise about but find no sign so on the 25th stand away for easter island cook be now take seriously ill and be confine to he bed for several day by what he call the bilious cholic during which time mr patten the surgeon be to I not only a skilful physician but a affectionate nurse he recover very slowly and the want of fresh food tell against he when it come to the question of gather strength the only fresh meat on board be a dog belong to mr forster which be duly sacrifice and make into soup : thus i receive nourishment and strength from food which would have make most people in europe sick marra 's journal say under 23rd February : this day the captain be take ill to the grief of all the ship 's company 28th February : the captain this day much better which each might read in the countenance of the other from the highest officer to the meanest boy on board the ship 4th march : the captain perfectly recover from he illness to the great joy of the ship 's company easter island at 8 be on 11th march easter island be sight from the masthead and shortly after noon some of the gigantic statue mention in roggewin 's voyage be clearly distinguish through the glass the position of the ship at noon have be fix as 27 degree 3 minute south 109 degree 46 minute west standing on and off till next morning fair anchorage be find in thirty-six fathom but it prove too near the edge of a bank and they be drive off it in the night one or two canoe come out to meet they as they be work back from which plantain be purchase and cook proceed ashore where he be immediately surround by native indeed some even swim out to meet he many of they possess european hat jacket handkerchief etc which they be say to have obtain from the spaniard in 1770 they language be very similar to that of otaheite and odidie be able to understand they fairly well there be no tree exceed ten foot in height and the land be describe as extremely parched and dreary though a few plantation be see some remarkable piece of stonework be notice enclose small area of ground in some of which be the statue already mention these be not look upon by the native as object of worship although they do not like the pavement by which they be surround be walk over or the statue be closely examine mr forster regard the enclosure as burial grounds and the statue -lrb- portion of some of they be at the british museum -rrb- as monument to chief the water supply be find very bad though gonzale be say to have find good spring and the fresh food for sale but scanty the stay be cut short and on 16th march sail be make for the marquesa discover by mendana in 1595 the next day accord to marra the fresh provision obtain be serve out to the crew at the captain 's expense : namely two pound of potato a man and a bunch of banana to each mess and this without reduce they ordinary allowance a act of generosity which produce its effect it preserve the crew in health and encourage they to undergo cheerfully the hardship that must unavoidably happen in the course of so long a voyage market spoil the marquesa be reach on 7th April and after a narrow escape from run on the rock satisfactory anchorage be obtain and they be visit by some of the native from whom breadfruit and fish be purchase the next day further trading be do nail be the chief medium of exchange but the native be incline to be smart in they dealings and on several occasion obtain payment without delivery cook here suffer from a relapse but be able to get about and after warn the officer on watch to keep a smart look-out or something of importance would be steal take he seat in a boat to go in search of a better anchorage he be then inform that a stanchion have be steal from the gangway and the thief have get away to he canoe on the other side of the ship he order a shot to be fire over the canoe but no one be to be hurt and he would pull round and secure the thief the order be apparently misunderstand for the thief be kill and the rest of the native hurry ashore soon after trade recommence and the lesson appear forget for a attempt be make to steal the kedge anchor by which the ship be be warped nearer the shore cook land and the trading go on as if nothing out of the common have occur and some pig -lrb- so small that it require forty or fifty to provide one meal for the crew -rrb- and fruit be purchase but in the afternoon when the boat go in for water all the native have disappear this cook attribute to he not be with they for the next morning when he land trading be resume a short trip be make in the boat along the coast and when they return it be find the market be close it seem one of the young gentleman have give a small handful of red feather he have obtain at tonga for a small pig and now nothing else would be accept so they sail for otaheite on the 11th cook be very much annoyed at the ill success in obtain fresh provision for though none of the crew be ill he think they stand in need of a change of food he describe the inhabitant as the finest race he have see in the south sea almost as fair as european and they language very similar to that of otaheite they arm consist of club spear and sling the two former very neatly make and with the latter they throw stone a considerable distance but without accuracy mr forster manage to secure a quantity of small bird with very beautiful plumage on the 17th April they sight the george island discover by byron -lrb- native name tiookea -rrb- but after send the master to report on the lagoon cook decide it be too dangerous to enter and mr cooper go off with two boat to see if it be possible to trade he obtain a few dog and coconut but the attitude of the native be so uncertain he would not land and return to the ship one of the sailor exchange a plantain for a dog so it be conclude the fruit be unknown on the 19th four more island be discover and name pallisser island and on round one a strong swell rolling in from the south be encounter a sure sign that we be clear of these low island on the 21st land a little to the east of point venus be sight and next morning they anchor in matavaus bay be immediately visit by the native who seem greatly pleased to see they again the old camp be reoccupy the observatory set up for mr wale and cook have again the pleasure to record he have no one on the sick list the king otoo come to visit the camp bring as he present a dozen pig and some fruit and then with some of he friend go on board ship to dinner and to receive the return present it be then find that the red feather be greatly value a very fortunate thing as article of trade be run short cook after the disappointment in secure supplies at the last visit intend to make a very short stay but the place now appear to be very thrive house and canoe be be build in all direction and there be every sign of prosperity so he decide to remain and refit on 25th April they have a thunderstorm lasting three hour such as no one on board have experience before the otaheitan fleet go to visit otoo on the next day cook be surprise to see a large number of fully-manned canoe range along the coast and a large body of armed man on the land near they on landing he be surround by people and seize by two chief one of whom want to carry he off to see the king and the other to see the fleet and between the two i be like to be pull to piece the crowd make way with cry of tiya no tootee he be gradually draw towards the fleet but refuse to go on board and after a time be allow to return to he own boat when he find he companion have be subject to similar treatment they put out from shore in order to have a good look at the fleet and count one hundred and sixty large double canoe all well equip and fully man the chief be swathe in vast quantity of cloth so that to the englishman it seem almost a miracle they be able to move the vessel be decorate with flag and streamer and make a very fine appearance these be the first line and in addition there be one hundred and seventy smaller double canoe each have a small house or castle on it which be think to be transport and store ship as the larger one as far as could be see carry no supplies on board the number of man on board be estimate to be no less than 7500 and it be ascertain this armada be intend for the subjugation of eimeo which have lately rebel against otaheite cook be inform otoo be wait at the camp for he but on go there he find he have not be there and on look for he again in the afternoon he be still invisible the fleet have also go away and then it be discover that some of cook 's clothes have be steal from the wash and the king and admiral be both in dread of he anger however cook send word he should take no step to recover the steal article and thing resume a friendly aspect the admiral towha send cook a present of two large pig and some fruit give order to the bearer that they be to receive nothing in exchange he soon after pay a visit to the ship and as it be he first he examine everything with great curiosity and appear greatly impressed with what he see one of the native have be catch make off with a small water cask cook determine he should be punish and make a ceremonial affair of it the culprit be first send on board and put in iron the native and the crew muster and then the thief be take on shore and trice up cook then make a short speech in which he point out that when he man be catch steal from the native they be always punish but the native be always steal from the ship and crew and get away unpunished he therefore order the man to be give two dozen lash these be duly administer and towha make a speech in which he be understand to admit the justice of cook 's action the marine be then put through they drill and fire a few volley with ball and the proceedings terminate but cook declare he do not know whether the native be pleased or frighten by the ceremony the king 's brother then take some of the officer out to see a part of they fleet at exercise and they be just in time to see the conclusion and the landing of the man cook say the canoe be handle very smartly and five minute after put ashore you could not tell anything of the kind have be go forward the sea store be again overhaul and although the greatest care have be take with the packing large quantity of the bread be find to be uneatable render the purchase of fresh food at every opportunity of the greatest importance a state visit be pay on board by otoo 's father and some other member of the royal family who present cook with : a complete mourning dress a curiosity we most value in return i give he whatever he desire which be not a little and have distribute red feather to all the other conduct they ashore in my boat musket steal on 7th may the king express a wish to see cook so the latter go ashore but find he majesty and many of he lead man have disappear and the sergeant of marine report that one of he man have have he musket steal whilst on duty cook give order that if the musket be return nothing further be to be say and return to he ship suspicion be attract to six canoe laden with fruit and baggage so cook give chase in he own boat one of the canoe then make for the ship and the occupant woman whom he recognize inform he they be take some thing to the resolution and that the king be at point venus cook go to the camp to find this be only a story to put he off and he once again give chase order another boat to follow a few shot be fire over the canoe and five out of the six surrender the one he have speak with get away he be now tell that the gun have be steal by a native of tiarabou and therefore otoo be unable to get it back so after a little discussion he decide to put up with the loss and send word to the king that he would say no more about it in the evening however the musket and some article that have not be miss be return and the man who bring they be duly reward cook say it be remarkable how many have be actively engage in they recovery one man in particular describe most vividly how he have follow up attack and kill the thief of the musket but at the same time every one be well aware that this hero have never be away from he own house throughout the day a state call be make on otoo and with the usual exchange of present the old footing be re-establish on the return from this visit a stop be make at the dockyard for such they deserve to be call and the canoe in construction be inspect two of they be the largest the englishman have yet see the king soon after return the visit and request that the big gun should be fire but cook think it be very doubtful if the experience be enjoy a display of firework in the evening be much more to the native taste refer to the numerous robbery that have be commit cook say he find it far the best to deal mildly with the delinquent and the regulation he make be as a rule well keep by the native he be now better pleased with he reception and conclude that the island be in a more prosperous condition than at he last visit when the ship be ready to resume she voyage several young native volunteer to accompany she and mr forster be most anxious to take one as a servant but as cook could see no prospect of return they to they home he would not permit one to go marra desert when the anchor be weigh on 14th may marra the gunner 's mate whose journal have be quote quietly slip into the water and endeavor to reach a canoe which be hang about to pick he up but he be see and take on board again in he note he express he regret that the scientific world thus lose the chance of have the experience of a prolonged residence amongst these people place before it at the time of leave there be great talk of the expedition against eimeo and cook would have like to have watch the proceedings but he soon see that nothing would be do whilst he remain in the vicinity on they arrival at huaheine on the 15th the ship be immediately board by cook 's old friend oree with the usual present and he and he friend be invite to dine on board he be ask what he would like for the return present and name axis and nail which be give he with the request that he would distribute they amongst he people this he at once do to the apparent satisfaction of all the thieving propensity of the native be still as bad as ever a shoot party be rob of its stock of trade goods and the day after three officer be seize and strip so cook take a armed party ashore capture two of the lead chief and a large house and say he should keep they till the thing steal be return this have the desire effect and everything be soon bring back on 23rd may they sail for ulietea and on they arrival the next day be well receive though it be evident provision be rather scarce they be inform here that two ship have arrive at huaheine one command by bank and the other by furneaux and they informant describe both captain so well that it be some time before cook venture to reject the tale as too improbable it be possible that there be some foundation for the story that ship have be see for it afterwards become know that m st denni have be in the south pacific about this time with two vessel notwithstanding press invitation from the native to stay cook sail for lord howe 's island discover by walli reach it on the 6th June but as it seem uninhabited it offer no inducement for any stay on the 16th a chain of sand-bank and islet surround a lagoon into which no practicable entrance could be see be name palmerston 's island and on the 20th a landing be effect on savage island but as the native be very threatening and the country enable they to approach closely without expose themselves the party retire to the boat a few spear be throw and marra say that one would have strike cook have he not see it come and stoop in time to avoid it and then aim with he gun load with small shot at the thrower but it miss fire a short time afterwards he again try it aim in the air and it be discharge forster attribute the constant misfire to the bad quality of the flint supply by the government and say that english flint have a very unsatisfactory reputation on the continent more thieve the course be now set for rotterdam where they arrive on 26th June and be fairly well receive by the native who bring supplies of fruit before the anchorage have be reach but they soon begin to play the old game of try to annex anything that take they fancy one seize the lead which be in use whilst a second try to cut the line with a stone and be only persuade to desist by a charge of small shot fire at he leg a small party of sailor go ashore for water and a quantity be obtain but again the native become too press in they attention the doctor 's musket be steal then mr clerke 's then some other thing and a cooper 's adze and cook though at first inclined to take no notice feel compel to seize two canoe and himself wound a man who have render himself conspicuous by he disorderly conduct with a charge of small shot and it be at first rumor he be kill this cook would not believe as he have be very careful not to fire at a vital spot after a time the musket and some of the other thing be give up so the canoe be return to they owner and the adze be demand instead of the adze however the report corpse be bring on board and prove on examination by the doctor to be very little the worse for he experience have a slight wound on the thigh and a second one on the wrist he be soon on he foot and the adze be then produce the next day the people be very civil and the crew be able to water without interruption on 16th July they sight aurora island discover by bougainville but it come on to blow hard so they do not attempt to anchor the native come down fully arm as if to oppose a landing and the ship pass on to whitsunday island off malicolo good anchorage be find and the native come on board and be so pleased with they reception they return next day in greater number and whilst cook be in he cabin with some who appear to be chief a great noise arise on deck a boat keeper have decline to allow a native to get into he boat and the islander be fitting a arrow to he bow as cook come on deck with the intention of shoot the sailor cook shout at he and he at once divert he aim to the captain but the latter be too quick and pepper he with small shot spoil he aim he be not much hurt and proceed to fit another arrow to he bow when cook give he the second barrel and induce he to retire some of the other also discharge a few arrow so a musket be fire over they without any effect a four-pound gun be try and the effect be truly marvellous the native in the rigging and on deck throw themselves into the water whilst those in the cabin jump from the port and the ship be leave in peace cook be not favourably impress by these islander and describe they as in general the most ugly ill-proportioned people i ever see forster however think they be very intelligent they be judge to be a different race from the society or friendly islander and speak a different language poisonous fish after leave many of those on board be very ill for a week or ten day from have eat of a fish which forster call a red sea bream and cook believe to be the same as those which poison de quiros 's people and in he account say that : the fish have eat of poisonous plant all part of the flesh become empoison the ship appear like the hospital of a city which have the plague there be none who could stand on they foot owe to the care of the surgeon however all be recover the next land see be a small group of island name shepherd 's island in honor of my worthy friend the plumian professor of astronomy at cambridge and mr forster complain that cook 's rashness and reliance on good fortune become the principal road to fame by be crown with great and undeserved success this be very out of place at the time for cook be exercise the very greatest precaution as he fully recognize the danger by which they be surround he always stand off and on during the night and only proceed through unknown water by day several of these islet be of a peculiar formation and one high columnar rock be name the monument forster give its height as 140 yard the other account be satisfy with foot many of the group be inhabit but no favourable opportunity for landing occur on 1st August a fire break out on board and forster write : confusion and horror appear in all we face at the bare mention of it and it be some time before proper measure be take to stop its progress for in these moment of danger few be able to collect they faculty and act with cool deliberation after about half a page of this on fire in general he observe : providentially the fire of this day be very trifling and extinguish in a few moment then a few day after a marine who have fall overboard be smartly pick up and be well look after by he comrade be soon show no ill effect of he accident thus give mr forster a opportunity to write of it as a example of the result of a esprit du corps to which sailor at present be utter stranger a utterly unwarranted sneer at erromango on 4th August cook go in with the boat and the native try to induce they to come on shore but something rouse suspicion after he and one man have get into the water so make sign that he would come back later he step back the native then rush the boat try to drag they onto the beach and succeed in steal two oar at the same time wound several of the boat ' crew amongst they mr gilbert the master with a shower of stone spear and arrow cook attempt to give one of the chief a charge of small shot but he gun miss fire and he be oblige very reluctantly to order the marine to fire with the result that several of the native be wound under the circumstance it be not consider worth while remain so the ship leave for tanna some twelve league to the south a bright light have be notice in that direction the night before which prove to have be cause by a volcanic eruption a good anchorage be find at tanna and the ship warped close in several native come on board to trade soon develop the usual propensity to carry off anything that take they fancy -- on this occasion the anchor buoy be the special attraction musket be fire over they head to no purpose so a four-pounder be discharge which for a time have a good result but soon they be as bad as ever so two or three musquetoon be fire close to they and though none be hurt the crew be able to get they dinner in peace hot spring a old man call by cook paowang appear to be incline to be friendly so cook land with a strong party to look for water under he guidance and meet with some of the elder exchange present with they the next day the ship be warped in and three boat go ashore but the native be very threatening and after some futile attempt to put thing on a peaceable foot a signal be give to the ship and several gun be fire when all the native run away except paowang who be suitably reward for he confidence after a time permission be obtain to get wood water and ballast and whilst try to lift a stone out of a pool below high-water mark one of the crew scald he hand badly the pool prove to be one of a series of spring run down a spur of the volcano into the sea several be test with the thermometer and as much as 202 degree fahrenheit be attain forster find a number of crack on the ridge from which sulphurous vapor and smoke issue and one of the crew who have be suffer severely from rheumatism receive great temporary benefit from bathing in one of the spring many good plantation of yam sugar-cane and plantain be see but they could purchase very little as they article of trade be not appreciate the native do not understand the use of iron and do not require cloth as they go almost entirely naked though no direct sign of cannibalism have be find cook be convince that the practice be not unknown after leave tanna the western coast of the different island be follow up till de bougainville 's passage be reach when the course be set for espiritu santo in pass malicolo canoe put off for the ship but the wind be favourable cook would not delay and give forster the opportunity to remark that the main object of the voyage ie the obtain a knowledge of the natural history of the island be make subservient to the production of a new track on the chart of the southern hemisphere cardinal moran 's geography on 25th August they enter the bay which cook believe to be that discover by de quiros and name by he the bay of st philip and st iago in the tierra austral del espiritu santo now know as the new hebride in this conclusion cook have the support of dalrymple and modern geographer but forster for some reason which be not quite clear feel compel to differ cardinal moran the catholic archbishop of sydney also believe cook to have be mistake for in he history of the catholic church in australium he place de quiros 's discovery in port curti queensland where he claim that the first catholic service ever celebrate in australium be hold he put aside the fact that the latitude of port curti 24 degree south do not agree with that give by de quiros 15 degree 20 minute south by say that the position of newly discover place be in those day often purposely conceal lest other navigator might appropriate to themselves and they respective country the result of the discovery he quote detail give in de quiros 's petition to the king of spain and say : all these detail fit in admirably with port curti on the queensland coast now de quiros say the country he discover be thickly inhabit by a people who be arm with bow and arrow possess vessel of earthenware live in house of wood roof with palm leaf be amply supply with orange lime pear almond larger than those of spain hog fowl goat capon etc that in the bay where he anchor there be no sandy barren ground no mangrove no ant no mosquito and that he anchorage lay between two considerable river how these detail fit in with port curti may be evident to he eminence but be not apparent to less distinguished mortal the district of port curti when discover be very thinly populated and show no sign of ever have be otherwise bow and arrow and earthenware vessel be absolutely unknown throughout australium house do not exist except in the form of temporary shelter of branch leave and bark the fruit and animal mention be unknown and sandy barren country with mangrove ant and mosquito do exist in considerable quantity the anchorage have de quiro ever be there might have be between two river the boyne and calliope -lrb- both of small size -rrb- but cardinal moran to make this detail fit in admirably have recourse to the bold measure of move the mouth of the burnett river from wide bay to port curti -- some 21\/2 degree to the north of its real position on the other hand cook 's description of the new hebride fit in with much greater accuracy the latitude be find to be 15 degree 5 minute south and mr cooper who go ashore with the boat report that he land near a fine stream of fresh water probably one of those mention by de quiros and if we be not deceive we see the other the country be describe by cook thus : a uncommonly luxuriant vegetation be everywhere to be see the side of the hill be chequer with plantation and every valley water by a stream of all the production of nature this country be adorn with the coconut tree be the most conspicuous a few canoe venture near enough to have some present throw to they but here the intercourse end for cook feel that notwithstanding the invite appearance of the place he have no time to spare from the great object of the expedition namely the exploration of the southern ocean and as the wind be favourable sail for new zealand for a refit chapter 14 1774 to 1775 second voyage conclude on 4th September midshipman colnett sight a large island which be name new caledonium the point first see be call cape colnett a opening in the surround reef have be find by the boat the resolution work up to a anchorage and be quickly surround by canoe whose occupant be totally unarmed at first they be shy of come near but at length one canoe be persuade to receive some small present and in return give some fish which stink intolerably but for all that it be receive in hope more satisfactory trading might result to some who come on board dinner be offer but they would touch nothing but yam they appear to know nothing of dog goat or hog but greatly appreciate both red cloth and nail cook land and be well receive and water be point out but it be too inconvenient of access the land near a village be well cultivate and irrigate the product be chiefly yam plantain and coconut the latter be not bear much fruit on 6th September mr wale secure a moderately satisfactory observation of a eclipse of the sun and be able to fix they position as 20 degree 17 minute 39 seconds south 164 degree 41 minute 21 seconds east on the same day the ship 's butcher monk a man much esteem in the ship fall down the forehatch and die the following day from the injury receive whilst some of the crew be engage in water a small party go up the hill to view the surrounding country but as all the native they meet turn back to follow they cook remark at last we train be numerous they be able to see right across the island and estimate the width to be not more than ten league on return it be find the clerk have purchase a fish something like a sun-fish and as the artist be engage in draw and describe it the cook take the liver and roe for supper in the cabin with the result that cook and the forster be nearly poison and be only cure by the most careful attention of the surgeon when the native see the fish the next morning they immediately signify it be unfit to eat but cook say nothing of the kind have be intimate when it be purchase norfolk island the native be describe as robust and well make and not in the least addict to pilfer which be more than can be say of any other nation in this sea the only tame animal they have be large fowl with very bright plumage the country be say to consist of rocky hill and the tree identical with those see in new south wale leave a sow and boar behind in hope of they be allow to breed and mark a tree with the name of the ship and the date they leave for the isle of pine where they arrive on the 19th here they be in very dangerous water and cook say the safety of the ship be owe to the splendid way in which the watch be keep and the brisk manner in which she be handle by the crew forster note innumerable columnar form of a considerable height which we distinguish by the help of we glass he put they very proudly down as of basaltic formation and afford considerable amusement to cook when he be able to prove they be only tree of the pine family in fact some be afterwards cut down on botany island and use for spar they be unable to effect a landing on the isle of pine owe to the rocky nature of the shore but by some unknown means mr hodge paint a view of the interior of the island publish under that title in cook 's voyage norfolk island be discover on 10th October and a landing be effect but no sign of inhabitant be see though a welcome supply of fish bird and cabbage palm be obtain the vegetation bear a resemblance to that of new zealand on 17th October mount egmont be sight and anchor in queen charlotte 's sound a immediate search be make for a bottle contain letter which have be leave for the adventure it be not to be find nor be there anything to show by whom it have be take but the next day they see where a observatory have be set up and tree cut down with axis and so come to the conclusion they consort have be there the native who be at first very shy but when they recognize cook go jump and skip about like madman inform they that the adventure come in soon after they have leave and remain two or three week a story also be tell that a ship have be lose on the north side of the strait shortly before cook arrive and some of the people have have they clothes steal by the native fire on they but when they ammunition be exhaust be all kill this story evidently a distorted account of what happen to some of the adventure 's crew be disbelieve by cook who think there have be some misunderstanding cook from fresh observation find that he have place the south island on he chart some 40 minute too far to the east and have make the distance between queen charlotte 's sound and cape pallisser 10 minute nearer to each other than they should have be in this connection he speak in the highest term of the desire of mr wale to have everything as accurate as possible on 11th November the resolution leave the sound at daybreak to cross the south pacific between latitudes 54 and 55 degree and the course convinced cook there be no possibility of there be any large piece of land in that portion of the ocean he therefore stand for the western entrance of magellan 's strait sight cape descada on 17th December follow the coast round to christmas sound which they reach on the 20th the country pass be describe as the most desolate and barren i ever see at christmas sound they be more fortunate for wood water wild celery and a large number of goose provide they with a welcome banquet for christmas day they be visit by some of the native describe as a little ugly half-starved beardless race i see not a tall person amongst they the scent of dirt and train oil they carry with they be enough to spoil the appetite of any european consequently none be invite to join the festivity they have european knife cloth handkerchief etc show they have be in communication with white man and forster note they have canoe which could not have be make in the neighborhood for there be no timber of sufficient size cape horn correct cape horn be pass on 29th December and cook make he longitude 68 degree 13 minute west a little too far to the westward it should be 67 degree 16 minute west this be absolutely correct accord to wharton on 1st January 1775 they land on a small island off staten island and then put in to a fine sheltered harbor on the main island which consequently be name new year harbor the weather prove unfavourable for survey but enough be ascertain to convince they that the tierra del fuego and staten island coast be not so dangerous to navigation as they have be represent on 3rd January they leave to look for dalrymple 's gulf of sebastian which cook thought be non-existent and on the 6th they reach the position give on the chart but could find no sign of any land bear up to the north georgium island be see on the 14th and be find to be entirely cover with snow create surprise as it be now the height of summer the ship run in between georgium and willi island and possession be formally take of the group though cook do not think that any one would ever be benefit by the discovery work as far south as 60 degree he turn to the east be tire of these high southern latitudes where nothing be to be find but ice and thick fog and a long hollow swell come from the westward convinced he that he be correct in he assumption that the gulf of sebastian and a large body of land do not exist on the 30th two large island be see and then three rocky islet to the north the largest be name freezeland peak after the sailor who sight it s freesland and behind these be a elevated coast which receive the name of southern thule as be the most southerly land then discover the position of the ship be give as 59 degree 13 minute 30 seconds south 27 degree 45 minute west during the early part of February they run down east between 58 and 59 degree south frequently have to throw the ship up into the wind to shake the snow out of she sail for the weather be very bad after another unsuccessful attempt to find cape circumcision the ship 's head be turn towards the cape of good hope on 23rd February and cook have the satisfaction of feeling he have solve the problem of the non-existence of any southern continent except in close proximity to the pole he firmly believe from he observation of the icefield that such a continent in the far south do exist but he assert that further exploration in that direction would be of little service to navigation and would be hardly worth the cost and danger that must be incur on 16th march two dutch ship be see steer to the west and a boat be send off to the nearest which prove to be the bownkirke polder from bengal they be offer any supplies the dutchman have notwithstanding the latter be rather short owe to he be some time out from port some english sailor on board tell of the adventure have be at the cape of good hope some twelve month previously and that she have report the massacre of a boat 's crew in new zealand at the same time three more sail come up one a english ship do not intend to call at the cape so cook forward by she a letter to the admiralty and receive some provision and most valuable gift a packet of old newspaper on the 22nd the resolution anchor in table bay salute the dutch flag with thirteen gun and the next morning cook wait on the governor who do everything he could to assist he and render he stay agreeable three on the sick list cook be greatly pleased to be able to report three man only on the sick list and the remainder be grant as much leave as the refit of the ship would permit the rigging of course have suffer severely and have to be replace at a exorbitant cost from the government store but cook call attention to the state of the mast which he consider after sail some 20000 league bear testimony to the care and ability of he officer and man and also to the high quality of he ship m de crozet put in on he way to pondicherry and be impress with cook 's courtesy and qualification as a explorer he be able to give the first information of m de surville 's voyage and that he have clear away a mistake cook have make in assume that the new caledonium reef extend to the great barrier reef on the east of australium forster say that cook pointedly avoid have any intercourse with any of the spaniard who be there but give no reason for it he also buy a quantity of wild animal and bird many of which die before reach england and he roundly but unjustly accuse the crew of have kill they touch at st helena where kendal 's watch be find to differ by about two mile from the observation of mason and dixon at the cape and those of maskelyne at st helena he proceed to ascension where he obtain a good supply of fresh turtle and then to fernando de noronho fix the position as 3 degree 50 minute south 32 degree 34 minute west and cross the line on 11th June calling in at the azore land be sight near plymouth on the 29th and next day they anchor at spithead and cook wale hodge and the two forster immediately start for london have be away from england three year and eighteen day during this time they have lose four man three from accident and one from disease -- a record unprecedented in the annals of british naval history the war with the american colony be naturally occupy the attention of the public but the newspaper find space to publish more or less authentic information as to they arrival and proceedings on the voyage one paper gravely say that : captain cooke will be appoint admiral of the blue and command a fleet which be prepare to go out in the spring as a reward for the discovery he have make in he last voyage in the south sea on 9th August cook be summon to st jame 's palace and have a long audience with the king present several chart and map and submit several drawing some of which be order to be engrave for the private museum in return the king present he with he commission as post-captain and he appointment to hm ken the commission sign by sandwich penton and pallisser bear date 9th August furneaux be make captain he sail for america in October and be present at the attack on new orlean in 1777 he die at the age of forty-six some four year later kempe cooper and clerke be promote to commander and isaac smith lieutenant mr wale be appoint mathematical master at christ 's hospital and charle lamb mention he as have be a severe man but : a perpetual fund of humor a constant glee about he heighten by a inveterate provincialism of north country dialect absolutely take away the sting from he severity mr forster be receive by the king at kew and be afterwards present to the queen to whom he give some of the bird buy at the cape he also attract attention from another quarter for lloyd 's evening post report that on 6th August he house at paddington be break open and rob of effect of considerable value again the morning post 23rd August report : Monday night as mr john reynold forster be return from chelsea in a post chaise he be attack by three highwayman near bloody bridge who rob he of three guinea and a watch set with diamond greenwich hospital act on advice from the admiralty cook on 12th August apply for the position of one of the captain of greenwich hospital vacant through the death of captain clement stipulate that if occasion arise in which he service would be of use elsewhere he might be permit to resign this application be immediately grant and he appointment be date on the same day as he application the salary be 200 pound per year with a residence and certain small allowance such as fire and light and one shilling and twopence per day table money it be apparent from he letter that though he may have take over some of the duty -lrb- but that be improbable owe to he time be fully occupy prepare he journal for the press and then make arrangement for he final voyage -rrb- he never enter upon residence but remain at mile end he however find time to write two letter to mr walker of whitby in the first of which he speak rather despondingly of be confine within the limit of greenwich hospital which be far too small for a active mind like mine and in the second he give a rapid sketch of the voyage which by its clear conciseness prove the worthlessness of mr forster 's sneer repeat by later writer that the public account of the voyage owe more to the editing of canon dougla than to the writing of cook soon after cook 's arrival in london furneaux hand he he journal of the proceedings of the adventure from the time of they separation off the coast of new zealand they be blow off the land near table cape in the beginning of November 1773 again sight it near cape pallisser only to be blow off again they sail and rig suffer severely they put into tolago bay for temporary repair and water and leave again on the 13th but have to put back till the 16th and even then the weather be so bad that they do not reach queen charlotte 's sound till the 30th when the bottle leave by cook be at once find tell they be six day too late they push on as rapidly as possible with the refit and then be further delay by find a large quantity of the bread require rebaking but they be ready to sail by 17th December mr rowe be send out with a boat to get a supply of vegetable and the ship be to have sail the follow day but the boat do not return burney be then send off with a party of marine in search and after a time discover the miss man have be all kill and some of they eat by the maori portion of the body be find and identify -- rowe 's hand by a old scar thoma hill 's hand have be tattoo in otaheite captain furneaux 's servant 's hand and midshipman woodhouse 's shoe be find and a portion of the boat the native who have these remains be fire on but burney could take no further step for he estimate there be fifteen hundred of the native near the place furneaux believe that the attack be unpremeditated as the maori have be quite friendly and both he and cook have be at the place during they previous visit he conclude that some sudden quarrel have arise and the boat 's crew have be incautious massacre on he next voyage cook obtain a account of the affair from the native when they say that the crew be at dinner and some of the maoris attempt to steal some bread and fish whilst one try to get something from the boat which have be leave in charge of the captain 's black servant the thief be give a thrashing and a quarrel arise during which two musket be discharge and two native be shoot the maori then close in and kill all the sailor immediately the yorkshire gazette of 4th June 1887 state that it be report that a midshipman escape the massacre and after many wanderings reach england in 1777 if this improbable story be true he must have be mr woodhouse whose shoe be find for he be the only midshipman in the boat on 23rd December the adventure sail but owe to contrary wind do not get away from the coast for some day she stand south-east till 56 degree south be reach and then the cold be extreme and the sea high she course be set for the horn reach as high as 61 degree south with a favourable wind store be run short so after a unsuccessful search for cape circumcision she sail for table bay and have refit again leave on 16th April for england and drop she anchor at spithead on 14th July 1774 mr forster state that this second voyage of cook cost 25000 pound but do not give the source of he information chapter 15 1775 to 1776 england after he return cook be busily engage prepare he journal and chart for publication which have be sanction by the admiralty and be considerably annoyed and delay by the conduct of mr forster who immediately on he return complain that the 4000 pound grant he to cover the whole of he expense have prove totally inadequate he claim that lord sandwich have promise verbally that he be to have the exclusive duty of write the history of the voyage be to receive the whole of the profit thereof and to be provide with permanent employment for the remainder of he life this promise be totally deny by lord sandwich and it certainly do not appear to have be a reasonable one to make on behalf of the admiralty after a protracted discussion it be agree that cook should write the account of the voyage and the country visit whilst forster be to write a second volume contain he observation as a scientist the admiralty be to pay the expense of engrave the chart picture etc and on completion of the work the plate be to be equally divide between cook and forster cook be to proceed with he part at once and submit it to forster for revision and forster be to draw up a plan of the method he intend to pursue and forward it to lord sandwich for approval cook proceed to carry out he share and furnished forster with a large amount of manuscript but the latter proved obstinately insistent in have he own way in everything with the result that after submit two scheme to lord sandwich both extremely unsatisfactory he be forbid to write at all and it be decide that cook should complete the whole work and it should be revise by the reverend john douglas canon of windsor afterwards bishop of carlisle forster 's yarn notwithstanding the prohibition against forster a book be publish under he son 's name and the latter claim that he start on the voyage with the intention of write take copious note and except that he utilise those take by he father the work be entirely he own he forget however to say that a quantity of cook 's manuscript have be in he father 's hand and do not explain how so much of he book correspond with curious exactitude with that of cook -lrb- in many case word for word -rrb- and how when the papers of cook fail to provide he with further fact he be oblige to rely on would-be philosophical dissertation which it be to be hope be not obtain from he father 's notebook young forster say that the appointment be first of all give to he father in a spirit of pique on the part of lord sandwich and then the order forbid he to write be make because the father have refuse to give miss ray lord sandwich 's mistress who have admire they when on board the ship some bird bring home from the cape of good hope as a present to the queen in the end the forster forestall cook 's book by about six week and as this be after cook have leave england on he last voyage mr wale undertake the defense of the absent against the sneer and insinuation that be plentifully give out all round the forster infer that cook be unreliable because he suppress mention of the bombardment of the loo fort at madeira a event which never happen and because he place valparaiso -lrb- where he have never be -rrb- in the position give on the admiralty chart supply to he which prove to be some 10 degree out the master who have refuse to give up he cabin be of course never forgive and as for mr wale who have observe the transit of venus at hudson 's bay in 1769 for the royal society he poor man have neither knowledge nor experience in astronomical science the crew of the two ship also carefully select man though they be some of whom have be the previous voyage be morally and physically bad and utterly incapable of perform they duty in a proper and seamanlike manner a little allowance must be make for the two author for the father suffer severely from rheumatism the son be of a scorbutic tendency and both be unaccustomed to sea life and doubtless the hardship inseparable from such a voyage press heavily upon they a second journal be publish by f newbery about the same time and cook hearing of it send anderson the gunner to find out the author with little difficulty he be find to be marra the gunner 's mate who try to desert at otaheite and the publication be stay till after the authorise version be out a volume of cook 's letter to dr dougla relate to the preparation of he journal for the press be preserve at the british museum and it show how cook to the very last endeavor to serve mr forster 's interest and to smooth matter over so that they could work together the last one dr dougla receive before cook 's departure be date from mile end 23rd June 1776 the day before he join he ship at the nore dear sir it be now settle that i be to publish without mr forster and i have take my measure accordingly when captain campbell have look over the manuscript it will be put into the hand of mr strahan and mr stuart to be print and i shall hope for the continuation of you assistance in correct the press i know not how to recompense you for the trouble you have have and will have in the work i can only beg you will accept of as many copy after it be publish as will serve yourself and friend and i have give direction for you to be furnish with they when you have do with the introduction please send it to mr strahan or bring it with you when you come to town for there need be no hurry about it tomorrow morning i set out to join my ship at the nore and with she proceed to plymouth where my stay will be but short permit I to assure you that i shall always have a due sense of the favor you have do I and that i be with great esteem and regard dear sir you oblige and very humble servant jame cook notwithstanding the forster ' endeavor to discount its success by forestall the publication by some week cook 's work be well receive by the public and mr cook to whom the whole of the profit be give reap considerable benefit from its sale fellow of royal society on 29th February 1776 captain jame cook be unanimously elect a fellow of the royal society and he certificate of election be sign by no less than twenty-six of the fellow he be formally admit on 17th march on which date a paper write by he on the means he have use for the prevention and cure of scurvy be read that he value he success in deal with this disease which at that time even in voyage of very moderate length be the most terrible danger to be encounter be plainly set forth in he journal of the voyage he say : but whatever may be the public judgment about other matter it be with real satisfaction and without claim any merit but that of attention to my duty that i can conclude this account with a observation which fact enable I to make that we have discover the possibility of preserve health amongst a numerous ship 's company for such a length of time in such variety of climate and amidst such continue hardship and fatigue will make this voyage remarkable in opinion of every benevolent person when the dispute about a southern continent shall have cease to engage the attention and to divide the judgment of philosopher during he early day at sea it be no unusual thing for a man-of-war to be short-handed through scurvy after a cruise of a few week and in a voyage across the atlantic as many as twenty per cent of the crew be know to have perish to give some of he own experience in the navy : on 4th June 1756 hm eagle arrive in plymouth sound after cruise for two month in the channel and off the french coast and captain pallisser report landing 130 sick bury at sea 22 and since he arrival in port he surgeon and 4 man have die and both he surgeon 's mate be very ill this out of a complement of 400 boscawen sailing from halifax for louisberg in 1758 leave several ship behind on account of scurvy one be the pembroke of which cook be master she have lose 29 man cross the atlantic but she be able to rejoin before the other as they be in a worse plight wolfe report to lord george sackville that some of the regiment employ at louisburg have 300 or 400 man eat up with scurvy of the northumberland when at halifax lord colville write that frozen -lrb- fresh -rrb- beef from boston keep he man healthy when in port but the scurvy never fail to pull we down in great number upon we go to sea in spring have have such experience cook appear to have make up he mind to fight the dreadful scourge from the very first and though the popular idea be that he only turn he mind to it during the second voyage it be very evident that on the endeavor he fight it successfully and it be most probable would have lay claim to victory have it not be for the serious loss incur through the malarial fever and its usual companion dysentery contract at batavium in proof of this reference may be make to the report of mr perry surgeon 's mate and after mr monkhouse 's death surgeon on board he state they round the horn with the crew as free from scurvy as on we sailing from plymouth ie after five month he report for the whole of the voyage five case of scurvy three in port at new holland and two while on the coast of new zealand not a man more suffer any inconvenience from this distemper he be one of the five case but at the same time it must not be understand that no other develop symptom of scurvy only they be so closely watch and at once subject to such treatment that the disease be not able to gain the upper hand cook write to the secretary to the admiralty immediately after he arrival at batavium say i have not lose one man from sickness he mean here as elsewhere in he journal sickness to be take as scurvy and at that time he have lose only seven man : two of mr bank 's servant from exposure three man drown mr buchan a fit probably apoplectic and one man alcoholic poisoning he arrive at home with a total loss of forty-one include tupium and he boy thirty-two of these death be from fever and dysentery and 2 mr hick and sutherland from consumption treatment of scurvy the chief anti-scorbutic use on the endeavor accord to mr perry 's report be : sour kraut mustard vinegar wheat -lrb- whole -rrb- inspissated orange and lemon juice saloup portable soup sugar molasses vegetable -lrb- at all time when they could possibly be get -rrb- be some in constant other in occasional use saloup be a decoction make from the orchi masculum root a common meadow plant or else from sassafras and be at one time sell in the street as a drink before the introduction of tea and coffee in the united service museum there be a cake of the portable soup which be on board the endeavor in appearance like a square of whitish glue which in effect it be say sir john pringle president of the royal society mr perry continue : cold bathing be encourage and enforce by example the allowance of salt beef and pork be abridged from nearly the beginning of the voyage and the usual custom of the sailor mix the salt beef fat with the flour be strictly forbid salt butter and cheese be stop on leave england and throughout the voyage raisin be issue in place of the salt suet in addition to the malt wild celery be collect in tierra del fuego and every morning breakfast be make from this herb ground wheat and portable soup of the personal cleanliness of the crew which cook look upon as of the first importance marra say -lrb- when write of the resolution 's voyage -rrb- he be very particular : never suffer any to appear dirty before he in so much that when other commander come on board they could not help declare they think every day Sunday on board of captain cook he inspect the man at least once a week and see they have change they clothing and be dry the bedding be dry and air when occasion offer and the whole ship be stove-dried special attention be pay to the well into which a iron pot contain a fire be lower fresh water be obtain when possible for cook remark nothing contribute more to the health of seaman than have plenty of water he be provide with a condenser but it be too small and unsatisfactory and he look upon it as a useful invention but only calculate to provide enough to preserve life without health he attribute the loss on the adventure to furneaux 's desire to save he man labor and neglect to avail himself of every opportunity of obtain fresh water cook throughout the voyage be never short of water furneaux be on two or three occasion dr mcbride advise the use of fresh wort make from malt as a anti-scorbutic and the endeavor be order to give it a thorough trial fresh ground malt be treat with boiling water and allow to stand then the liquid be boil with dry fruit or biscuit into a panada and the patient have one or two meal with a quart or more of the liquid per diem this treatment be favourably report on but at the same time so many other precaution be take that it be not possible to say which be the most successful bank who be threaten try the wort but think it affect he throat substitute a weak punch of lemon juice and brandy which have satisfactory result after a time the malt though dry and sweet have lose much strength so as strong a wort be make as possible and ground wheat boil with it for breakfast a very pleasant mess which the people be very fond of and cook have great reason to think that the people receive much benefit from it sour kraute cook set great store on the sour kraute and say : the man at first would not eat it until i put it in practice -- a method i never once know to fail with seaman -- and this be to have some of it dress every day for the cabin table and permit all the officer without exception to make use of it and leave it to the option of the man to take as much as they please or none at all but this practice be not continue above a week before i find necessary to put every one on board to a allowance for such be the temper and disposition of seaman in general that whatever you give they out of the common way although it be ever so much for they good it will not go down and you will hear nothing but murmuring against the man that first invent it but the moment they see they superior set a value upon it it become the finest stuff in the world and the inventor be a honest fellow a pound of this be serve to each man twice a week at sea or oftener if think necessary portable soup at the rate of a ounce per man be boil with the pea thrice a week and when vegetable could be obtain it be boil with they and wheat or oatmeal for breakfast and with pea and vegetable for dinner and be the means of make the people eat a greater quantity of vegetable than they would otherwise have do the rob of lemon and orange be a doubtful quantity for though cook have no great confidence in its efficacy furneaux report very favourably on its use but it be expensive of vinegar cook be of opinion that it be of little service and preferred smoking the ship with wood-fire to wash with vinegar which have be strongly advise he substitute sugar for oil as he esteem it a very good anti-scorbutic whereas oil -lrb- such as the navy be usually supply with -rrb- i be of opinion have the contrary effect cook say that the introduction of the most salutary article would prove unsuccessful unless accompany by strict regulation so the crew be divide into three watch except on some extraordinary occasion in order that they might not be so expose to the weather and have a better chance to get into dry clothes if they happen to get wet hammock bedding clothes and ship be keep as clean and dry as possible and when the ship could not be cure with fire once or twice a week she be smoke with gunpowder mix with vinegar or water : to cleanliness as well in the ship as amongst the people too great attention can not be pay : the least neglect occasion a putrid and disagreeable smell below which nothing but fire will remove he finish he paper read before the royal society as follow : we come to few place where either the art of man or the bounty of nature have not provide some sort of refreshment or other either in the animal or vegetable way it be my first care to

send to england and one invalid cook wish afterwards that he have send one or two more but he have at the time hope of they complete recovery on 31st October they be unable to communicate with the

discovery arrive have leave plymouth on 1st August she sight land above twenty-five league north of table bay but have be blow off the coast in the storm it may be note here that the french spanish and united state government issue instruction to they naval officer that captain cook and he ship be to be treat with every respect and as belong to a neutral and ally power a honor to cook and also to the nation who confer it on he when she consort arrive cook be almost ready for sea so the refit of the discovery be push on as quickly as possible but some delay arise in the delivery of bread order cook say he believe the baker would not put it in hand till they see the discovery safely at anchor however on 30th November clerke be hand he instruction and the two captain go on board they respective ship to find they fully supply for a voyage which be expect to last at least two year live stock have be purchase at the cape and one journalist say that on leave the resolution remind he of noah 's ark they do not get clear of the coast till 3rd December owing to light wind and then on the 6th a sudden heavy squall cost the resolution she mizzen topmast not a very serious loss for they have a spare stick and the broken one have often complain but burney say that owe to the weather it take they three day to complete the repair the cold rough weather also have a bad effect on the live stock several of they perish dense fog on 12th December the island discover by marion du fresne and crozet in 1772 be sight and as they be unnamed in the map date 1775 give by crozet to cook he call they prince edward 's island and a small group further to the east be name marion and crozet island then sail south through fog so dense that burney say they be often for hour together unable to see twice the length of the ship and though it be the height of summer the cold be so intense that the warm clothing have to be resort to they sight kerguelen 's land on 24th December the chevalier de borda have give cook 48 degree 26 minute south 64 degree 57 minute east of pari as the position of rendezvous island this cook take to be a isolate rock they only just weather in the fog to which he give the name of bligh 's cap for he say : i know nothing that can rendezvous at it but fowl of the air for it be certainly inaccessible to every other animal cook unaware that kerguelen have pay two visit to the place find some difficulty in recognize the place describe the country be very desolate the coarse grass hardly worth cut for the animal no wood but a good supply of water be obtain and here the christmas day be spend on the 27th as the 25th and 26th have be full of hard work a bottle be find by one of the crew contain a parchment record of the visit of the french in 1772 on the back cook note the name of he ship and the year of they visit and add a silver twopenny piece of 1772 replace it in the bottle which be seal with lead and hide in a pile of stone in such a position that it could not escape the notice of any one visit the spot run along the coast to the south-east they encounter very blowy weather and find the land even more desolate than that at christmas harbor they leave on the 31st for new zealand anderson the surgeon on whom cook rely for he note on natural history say : perhaps no place hitherto discover in either hemisphere under the same parallel of latitude afford so scanty a field for the naturalist as this barren spot the whole catalogue of plant include lichen do not exceed sixteen or eighteen a southerly buster the first part of January 1777 be foggy and cook say they run above 300 league in the dark on the 19th a squall carry away the fore topmast and main topgallant mast and it take the whole day to replace the first but they have nothing suitable for the top gallant mast on 26th January they put into adventure bay van dieman 's land and obtain a spar cook speak of the timber as be good but too heavy a few native be see but do not create a favourable impression still cook land a couple of pig in hope to establish the breed a hope doom to be unsatisfied the marquis de beauvoir relate that in 1866 he see in adventure bay a tree on which be cut with a knife : cook 26th jan 1777 and he be inform it have be cut by the man himself they seem to have see nothing to raise a doubt about furneaux 's conclusion that van dieman 's land form a part of australium so no attempt be make to settle the question and they sail for new zealand on the 30th meeting with a perfect storm from the south the thermometer rise : almost in a instant from about 70 degree to near 90 degree but fall again when the wind commence in fact the change be so rapid that there be some on board who do not notice it these storm be of frequent occurrence and be locally know as southerly buster on 10th February rock point near cape farewell be sight and on the 12th they anchor near they old berth in queen charlotte 's sound and a camp be immediately establish here they be visit by a few of the native some of whom remember cook and be recognize by he at first they think he have come to avenge the adventure 's loss but after a time be persuade to put aside they distrust and they flock down to the shore every available piece of ground be quickly occupy by they hut cook describe how one party work the ground be select the man tear up the grass and plant and erect the hut whilst the woman look after the canoe property and provision and collect firewood and he keep the child and some of the oldest of the party out of mischief by scramble the contents of he pocket amongst they at the same time he notice that however busy the man might be they take care to be within easy reach of they weapon and he on he side have a strong party of marine on duty and any party work at a distance from the ship be always arm and under the command of a officer experience in deal with the native cook be please to notice he man be not incline to associate with the maori and he always try to discourage familiarity between he crew and the native of the island he visit it be worthy of remark that two of the resolution be on the sick list whilst the discovery have a clean bill of health one of they constant visitor be a man cook call kahoura who be point out as have be the leader at the massacre of the adventure 's man and it be a matter of surprise to the native that have he in he power cook do not kill he but after the fullest possible enquiry cook believe it be best to let matter rest as the attack have evidently arise out of a sudden quarrel and be totally unpremeditated burney think the maori feel a certain contempt for the english either because they be too generous in they dealings or else because the murder be unavenged the garden that have be make at the last visit have in some respects prosper in particular the potato from the cape have improve in quality but as they have be appreciate by the native there be few to be get burney on the other hand declare that nothing could be hear of the pig and fowl that have be leave omaus be anxious to take a new zealander away with he and soon find one to volunteer it be explain that he must make up he mind that he would not be able to return and as he seem satisfied he and a boy be take when they be seasick they deeply and loudly lament leave they home but on recovery they soon become as firmly attach to we as if they have be bear amongst we the weekly paper sailing on 25th February they cross the tropic on 27th march some 9 degree further west than cook wish to have do and have see nothing of importance it be interesting to note that burney say each ship publish a weekly paper and on signal be make a boat be send to exchange when possible he say cook be a constant reader but not a contributor it be to be regret that no copy exist of this probably the first oceanic weekly on 29th march a small island cook call manganouium be discover in 21 degree 57 minute south 201 degree 53 minute east -lrb- burney give 21 degree 54 minute south 202 degree 6 minute east -rrb- but the landing-place be too dangerous on account of the surf a native come on board who be able to converse with omaus and say they have plenty of plantain and taro but neither yam hog nor dog he unfortunately fall over a goat which he take to be a large bird and be so frightened he have to be put ashore the next day another island be see and as they be very short of fodder for the animal gore be send to see if trade could be open up with the inhabitant in this he be fairly successful and obtain a quantity of plantain stem which be find to be a satisfactory substitute for grass but the trading be not brisk for the people wish to receive dog in return and it be evident that though they have none they know what they be they be afraid of the horse and cattle and take the sheep and goat for some kind of large bird a party go ashore and be treat fairly well but when they wish to return to they boat all sort of difficulty be raise and cook credit omai with they safe return for it seem he give judiciously boastful reply to the many question that be ask he and at the psychological moment explode a handful of powder with the result that opposition to they departure be withdraw burney say omaus be most useful on a landing party as he be a good sportsman and cook and be never idle after this experience cook would not run further risk so make for a small uninhabited island where some vegetable be obtain and branch of tree which cut into short length be eagerly eat by the cattle and cook say : it might be say without impropriety that we feed we cattle on billet wood payment for what have be take be leave in a desert village on 6th April they reach hervey 's island and be somewhat surprised to be visit by several canoe as on cook 's previous visit no sign of inhabitant have be notice omaus gather from one or two native who come on board to sell a few fish that the resolution and adventure have be see in 1776 when pass the island king be send to look for a landing-place but see that the woman be quietly bring down arm to they menfolk on the beach he think it better to return to the ship and sail be make for the friendly island the discovery be send on about a league ahead as she be better able to claw off a lee shore than mine at this time cook be get rather short of water so he set the still to work and obtain from 13 to 16 gallon of fresh water between 6 be and 4 pm there have lately be make some improvement as they be pleased to call it to this machine which in my opinion be much for the worse fall in with repeat thunderstorm in which they catch more water in a hour than by the still in a month i lay it a side as a thing attend with more trouble than profit at one of the palmerston group they find amongst other thing drift over the reef some plank one of which be very thick with trunnell hole in it and a piece of moulding from some ship 's upper work paint yellow with nail hole show sign of iron rust : probably the remains of some wreck european ship at comango where they anchor on 28th April cook note : it be remarkable that during the whole day the indian would hardly part with any one thing to anybody but I captain clerke do not get above one or two hog a supply of water be obtain and wood be cut but most of the tree be what cook call manchineel the sap from which produce blister on the man 's skin and burney say some of they be blind for a fortnight have rub they face with they juice-stained hand one of the carpenter have a bad fall and break he leg but for the rest say burney they be in good health thank god no appearance of scurvy flogging no good cook again complain of the theft commit so continually and say that no punishment they could devise be effectual for flog make no more impression than it would have do upon the mainmast the chief would advise he to kill those catch but as he would not proceed to such a length the culprit generally escape unpunished here the discovery lose she best bower anchor the cable have be chafe by the coral and part when weigh burney describe how by pour oil on the water they be able to see and recover it from a depth of seventeen fathom landing on happus they be very well receive and obtain plentiful supplies of fresh food which be most opportune a entertainment of boxing wrestling and combat with club make from green coconut bough be hold in they honor and cook say that they be carry on with the greatest good-humour in the presence of some three thousand spectator though some woman as well as man have receive blow they must feel some time after when this be over the chief feenough present cook with supplies that require four boat to take to the ship it far exceed any present i have ever before receive from a indian prince the donor be invite on board to receive he return present which prove so satisfactory that on he return to the shore he forward still more in addition to he first gift and be amuse by a drill of the marine and a display of firework which though some be spoil be the cause of astonishment and pleasure to the wonder native during one of he walk on shore cook see a woman just complete a surgical operation on a child 's eye she be remove a film grow over the eyeball and the instrument use be describe as slender wooden probe he be not able to say if the operation be successful the chief feenough go off to a island about two day ' sail away in order to obtain some of the feather cap which be hold in high estimation and cook promise to wait for he return but find the fresh supplies be run short he sail along the south of the reef and put in to a bay in lefooga on the way the discovery run on a shoal but manage to back off without damage although he be not short of water cook go ashore to inspect some well which he have be inform contain water of a very superior quality but he find it very bad and say : this will not be the only time i shall have to remark that these people do not know what good water be near these well be a large artificial mound about forty foot high and fifty foot diameter on the top on which large tree be grow at the foot be a hew block of coral four foot broad two and a half foot thick and fourteen foot high but the native present say that there be only one half of it above ground it be suppose to have be erect to the memory of a great chief but how many year ago it be impossible to guess king polaho whilst anchor here a large sailing canoe arrive have on board a chief who be treat by the native with the utmost respect and the visitor be give to understand that tattafee polaho be the king of all the island he be invite on board and bring with he as a present : two good fat hog though not so fat as himself for he be the most corporate plump fellow we have meet with i find he to be a sedate sensible man he view the ship and the several new object with uncommon attention and ask several pertinent question in return cook be invite ashore and when they be seat the native who have be trade submit the article they have receive for polaho 's inspection who enquire what each one have sell and seem pleased with the bargain make everything be return to its owner except a red glass bowl to which the king have take a great fancy accord to mr basil thomson who be for some year in the pacific island a red glass bowl be give by the king of tonga to the notorious mr shirley baker as a relic of captain cook but be unfortunately break in new zealand it be most probably the one in question before leave polaho present cook with one of the red feather cap make from the tail feather of the bird the sandwich islander call iiwus -lrb- vestiarium coicinea -rrb- which be evidently consider of extreme value at the same time he give cook clerke and omaus some of the red feather of paraquet which though much in demand be not to be purchase on 29th may they sail for tongatabu but the wind fail they nearly run ashore on the 31st on a low sandy island on which the sea be break very heavily fortunately all hand have just be engage in put the ship about so that the necessary movement be not only execute with judgment but with alertness and this alone save the ship cook confess that he be tire of beat about in these dangerous water and feel relieved to get back to he old anchorage off annamooka feenough here rejoin the ship and he behavior before polaho be sufficient evidence as to the high position hold by the latter for he make a deep reverence to he and afterwards would not eat or drink in he presence but leave the cabin as soon as dinner be announce a entertainment on 6th June they sail for tongatabu again accompany by some sailing canoe which could all easily outdistance the two ship a good anchorage be find and cook 's old friend otago and toobough be soon on board to greet they as it be propose to make a short stay the cattle be land the observatory set up and the sail-makers set to work to overhaul the sail for much-required repair cook speak very highly of the orderly behavior of the native many of whom have never see a white man before hear much of a important chief name mariwaggee cook persuade the king to escort a party to he residence which be find to be pleasantly situate on a inlet where most of the chief reside surround by neatly fence plantation but they be inform that mariwaggee have go to see the ship this be find to be untrue but the next day he appear accompany by a large number of both sex and cook at once land with some present for he only to find he be accompany by another chief to whom something have to be give as well fortunately the two be easily satisfied and the present be divide between they mariwaggee be find to be the father of feenough and the father-in-law of the king he give a grand entertainment of singing and dancing in honor of the stranger which commence about eleven in the morning and last till between three and four in the afternoon and wind up with a presentation of a large number of yam each pair of the root be tie to a stick about six foot long and decorate with fish cook say it be hard to say which be the most valuable the yam for food or the stick for firewood but as for the fish it might serve to please the sight but be very offensive to the smell as some of it have be keep two or three day for this occasion more singing and dancing then take place and then the english give a display of firework which astonish and highly entertain the native be afraid that some of he live stock might be steal cook try to interest some of the chief in they by present the king with a bull and cow and some goat to feenough a horse and mare and to mariwaggee a ram and two ewe some one however be not satisfied and a kid and two turkey cock be steal and as theft have be frequent and very daring include a attempt to steal one of the anchor of the discovery which would have be successful have not one of the fluke of the anchor get fix in one of the chain plate cook determine to put he foot down he seize three canoe and hearing feenough and some other chief be in a house together he place a guard over they and inform they they would be detain till the steal goods be return they take the matter coolly and say that everything should be return some of the thing be produce cook invite he prisoner on board ship to dine and when they come back the kid and a turkey be bring so the prisoner and canoe be release at one time a small hostile demonstration be make by the native but the landing of a few marine and a order from the king put a end to it smart workman the following day cook be invite on shore and find some native busy erect two set of pole one on each side of the place set apart for the guest each set consist of four place in a square about two foot apart secure from spread by cross piece and carry up to a height of about thirty foot the intervene space be fill with yam on the top of one structure be two baked pig and on the other alive one with a second tie by its leg about half way up cook be particularly strike by the way the man raise these two tower and say if he have order he sailor to do such a thing they would have want carpenter and tool and at least a hundredweight of nail and would have take as many day as it do these people hour when the erection be complete pile of bread-fruit and yam be heap on either side and a turtle and some excellent fish be add and then the whole be present to cook a party of officer from both ship go off to a island without leave and return two day after without they musket ammunition and other article which have be steal they persuade omaus to make a private complaint to the king which result in the chief leave the neighborhood they disappearance annoy cook and when the affair be explain to he he severely reprimand omaus for speak on the matter without order this put omaus on he mettle and he manage to persuade feenough to return and inform the king that no serious consequence should ensue matter be then easily smooth over most of the steal goods include the miss turkey be return and the king say he ought not to have be hold responsible for if he have know that any one wish to see the island he would have send a chief who would have ensure they safety a eclipse of the sun be to occur on 5th July and cook decide to remain so as to secure observation and meanwhile employ himself in explore the neighborhood and study the custom of the native on one occasion think to see a interesting ceremony he accompany polaho who be go to do state mourning for a son who have be dead some time the result be disappointing and the chief impression leave with cook seem to have be that over they clothing of native cloth those present wear old and ragged mat those of the king be the raggedest and might have serve he great-grandfather on some such like occasion July 5th prove dark and cloudy with heavy shower of rain and the observation be unsatisfactory especially as the cloud come up thickly in the middle of the eclipse and the sun be see no more for the rest of the day this failure be not of great importance for the longitude have already be satisfactorily ascertain by several very good lunar observation so as soon as the eclipse be over everything be send on board the ship include the sheep which have be present to mariwaggee no one have take any notice of they since they be land and cook feel sure they would be kill by the dog as soon as the ship leave a native ceremony as the wind prove contrary and it be understand that the king 's son be to be initiate into the estate of manhood eating with he father for the first time cook determine to remain a few day longer a party of the officer go over to the island of moa where the ceremony be to be hold and find the king in a very dirty enclosure drinking kava and as the method of prepare this beverage be uninviting to european they go for a walk till about ten o'clock find large number of people assemble in a open space near a large building they rejoin the king take off they hat and untie they hair that we might appear the more decent in the eye of the native the proceedings consist of march of man laden with yam tie on to stick of considerable speech-making and various performance of which the signification could not be understand and then the prince make he appearance he seat himself with a few of he friend on the ground and some woman wind a long piece of cloth round they and after some more speech-making and mysterious pantomime with stick represent yam the proceedings end for the day as there be sign that so many white onlooker be not altogether acceptable to the native some of the party return to the ship but cook resolve to see it out and join the king at supper and the latter enjoy some brandy and water so much that cook say he go to bed quite grogish after breakfast cook pay a visit to the prince and present he be enough english cloth to make a suit receive native cloth in return after dinner the people muster for the remains of the ceremony and cook determine to join the principal party so he seat himself with it and would not understand when request to leave he be then request to bare he shoulder as a mark of respect and immediately do so and be then no further molest a somewhat similar performance be go through as the day before but the significance of which could not be ascertain and then suddenly all the people turn they back on king and prince who cook be afterwards inform have have piece of roast yam give they to eat a exhibition of boxing and wrestling be then give and after a speech or two the proceedings terminate cook be inform that in about three month a much greater affair would take place at which ten man would be sacrifice on 10th July the ship sail through a very difficult passage arrive off middleburg on the 12th where they be visit by they old friend taoofa the country appear flourishing and they obtain some turnip raise from seed sown at cook 's last visit a exhibition of boxing be give and be to have be repeat the follow night but unfortunately some of the native fall upon a sailor and strip he of he clothes cook thereupon seize two canoe and a pig demand that the culprit should be give up a man who have the shirt and trousers be bring and so the canoe be return and the pig pay for and next day the thief be liberate the remainder of the sailor 's clothes be afterwards find but so much tear as to be worthless they leave the friendly island on the 17th after a stay of more than two month during which time they have be live almost entirely on food they have purchase from the native with whom they have be on fairly good term the 29th bring they into a very heavy squall which cost the resolution a couple of staysail and she consort a main topmast and main topgallant yard spring the head of she main-mast so badly that the rigging of a jury-mast be attend with some danger but it be at length accomplish a spare jibboom be furnish for the purpose by the resolution otaheite be reach on 12th August and amongst the first visitor on board be omaus 's brother-in-law and other who know he before he go away they treat he as if he be a englishman and a stranger but when he take he brother-in-law to he cabin and give he some of the valuable red feather a change come over they all and they express the greatest interest in he cook say omaus would take no advice but permit himself to be make the dupe of every design knave of these red feather cook say they be of such value that not more than might be get from a tomtit would purchase a hog of 40 or 50 pound weight nail and bead be not look at although they have previously be very acceptable spanish ship two ship from lima be find to have visit the island twice since cook 's last call and the first time the spaniard build a house with material they have with they they leave four man in charge and be away for about ten month at the second visit they commodore die and be bury near the house which be leave at they departure and the native build a shade over it to protect it from the weather it consist of two room furnish with table bed bench and a few other trifle and the timber be find

rex anni 1767 69 73 74 et 78 at the end of they first visit the spaniard take away four native to lima one die one remain at lima and the other two return with the ship but cook think they be not improve by they experience and have not add to they respectability in the eye of they countryman in view of the cold climate to be face in the near future cook be desirous to save he stock of spirit and muster the crew of the resolution in order to explain the position he point out that the supply of coconut be abundant and the benefit of the spirit would be appreciate amongst the cold wind and ice of the north but leave the decision to they he be gratify to find the crew be willing to accept he suggestion and order clerke to put the matter before the crew of the discovery when it be again well receive a order be accordingly issue to stop : serve grog except on Saturday night when they have full allowance to drink to they female friend in england lest amongst the pretty girl of otaheite they should be wholly forget during a state visit pay by the chief of the district at which omaus attend dress in a strange medley of all he be possess of cook be inform that the spaniard lay claim to the country and have give instruction that cook be not to be allow to land if he return however the chief execute a formal surrender of he province to cook and present be exchange the whole ceremony end with a display of firework which both pleased and astonish the native some of the civilian report that they have discover a roman catholic chapel in they walk but on inspection it prove to be what cook at once suspect the grave of a chief decorate with different color cloth and mat and a piece of scarlet broadcloth which have be give by the spaniard red feather on the 23rd August the two ship arrive in matavaus bay where they be well receive by otoo who be gratify by a present of a fine linen suit a hat with a gold band some tool a feather helmet from the friendly island and what he seem to value most a large bunch of the celebrated red feather in return he send on board the ship enough food to have last both crew for a week if it have only be possible to keep it good for that length of time the royal family dine on board the resolution and after dinner cook and omaus call on oparee take with they a peacock and peahen send to the island by lord bessborough a turkey cock and hen a gander and three goose a drake and four duck to make a start in stock the island a gander be see which the native say have be leave by walli ten year previously several goat and a bull leave by the spaniard be also see so cook land three cow as company for the last the horse and sheep be also land and cook remark that get rid of all these animal lighten he : of a very heavy burden the trouble and vexation that attend the bring these animal thus far be hardly to be conceive but the satisfaction i feel in have be so fortunate as to fulfil he majesty 's design in send such useful animal to two worthy nation sufficiently recompense I for the many anxious hour i have on they account whilst here the two ship be thoroughly overhaul and everywhere put into as good a state of repair as the appliance available would permit the store be find to be in a better state than have be expect and very little of the bread be damage garden be lay out and plant with potato melon pineapple etc but cook be not very sanguine of they success for he have see how a vine plant by the spaniard have be spitefully trample down as the native tasting the grape before they be ripe have conclude it be poisonous it be carefully prune into proper shape again and omaus be instruct to set forth its merit and how it should be cultivate towards the end of the month a man report that the two spanish ship have return and show a piece of cloth he say he have obtain from they so cook not know if england and spain be on friendly term prepare for the worst and the two ship make ready for defense if necessary lieutenant williamson be despatch in a boat for news but could see no ship nor sign of any have be on the coast since the english leave they last port of call a human sacrifice at they last visit a expedition be be prepare against the revolted island of eimeo but it do not seem to have be very successful in its object for there be still disturbance go on between the two nation and on 30th August news come that the otaheitan have be drive up into the hill a grand meeting be hold to discuss matter and great effort be make to enlist the service of cook but he would not assist in any way as he do not understand the cause of the quarrel and he have always find the inhabitant of eimeo friendly towards he have hear that a chief name towha have kill a man as a sacrifice to they god cook obtain permission to witness the remain ceremony as he think it offer a opportunity to learn something of the religion of this people he therefore start with dr anderson mr webber and the chief potatow in a boat accompany by omaus in a canoe for the scene of action on they arrival the sailor be instruct to remain in the boat and the gentleman be request to remove they hat as soon as they reach the moraus where the ceremonial be to take place when they get there the body of the victim be see in a small canoe in front of the moraus and just in the wash of the sea in charge of four priest and they attendant the king and he party some twenty or thirty pace away and the rest of the spectator a little further still two priest come forward to otoo one place a young plantain tree in front of he and the other touch he foot with a bunch of red feather and then rejoin the other who immediately go off to a smaller moraus near and seat themselves face the sea one commence recite a long prayer occasionally send one of he attendant to place a young plantain on the body whilst this recitation be go on a attendant stand near hold two small bundle seemingly of cloth in one as we afterwards find be the royal maro and the other if i may be allow the expression be the ark of the eatua -lrb- god -rrb- this prayer be end the priest return to the beach and more prayer be say the plantain be move one by one from the body and place in front of the priest then the body wrap in leaf be put on the beach with the foot to the sea and the priest gather round some sit some stand the prayer still go on the leaf be then strip off the body and it be turn sideways on to the sea and one priest standing at the foot repeat another long prayer in which he be occasionally join by the other each priest at this time hold in he hand a bunch of the red feather some hair be now pull from the head of the corpse and a eye take out wrap in leaf and present to otoo who do not touch they but send they back with a bunch of feather soon after send a second bunch he have ask cook to put in he pocket for he when start at this time a king-fisher make a noise in some tree near and otoo remark that be the eatua evidently look on it as a good omen the body be now move away to the foot of one of the small morai the two bundle of cloth be place on the moraus at its head and the tuft of feather at its foot the priest surround the body and the people gather in closer more speech be make and a second lock of hair pluck from the head and place on the moraus then the red feather be place on the cloth bundle which be carry over to the great moraus and lay against a pile of stone to which the body be also bring and the attendant proceed to dig a grave whilst the priest continue they recitation the body be then bury and a dog towha have send over -lrb- a very poor one say cook -rrb- be partially cook and present to the priest who call on eatua to come and see what be prepare for he at the same time put it on a small altar on which be the remains of two dog and three pig which smell so intolerably that the white man be compel to move further away than they wish this end the ceremony for the day the king 's maro next morning they all return to the moraus a pig be sacrifice and place on the same altar and about eight o'clock the priest otoo and a great number of people assemble the two bundle be still in the same place as on the previous night but two drum be now stand in front of they between which otoo and cook seat themselves the priest place a plantain tree in front of the king resume they pray each have he bunch of feather in he hand they then move off to a place between the moraus and the king and place the feather bunch by bunch on the bundle the prayer still go on four pig be then produce one immediately kill and the other put in a sty for future use the bundle contain the king 's maro be now untied and spread carefully on the ground before the priest the maro be about five yard long by fifteen inch broad compose of red and yellow feather chiefly yellow at one end be a border of eight piece about the size and shape of horse-shoe fringe with black pigeon 's feather the other end be fork the end be of unequal length the feather be arrange in two row and have a very good effect they be fasten on a piece of native cloth and then sew to the english pendant which walli left fly when he sail from matavai bay after the priest have repeat another prayer the emblem of royalty be carefully fold up and replace on the moraus and then one end of what cook call the ark of the eatua be open but the visitor be not permit to see what it contain the entrails of the pig be then pray over and one of the priest stir they gently with a stick evidently try to draw a favourable omen from they movement they be then throw on the fire the partly-cooked pig be deposit on the altar and when the bunch of feather that have be use have be place in the ark the ceremony be over the meaning of all this could not be discover but it be find that when a victim be want a chief pick he out and send he servant to kill he this be do without any warn to the man who be to suffer usually by a blow with a stone on the head and it appear that at the subsequent ceremony the presence of the king be absolutely indispensable chief of a enemy 's tribe who be kill in battle be bury with some state in the morai the common man at the foot on the way back to the ship cook call on towha who have supply the victim he be anxious to ascertain cook 's opinion of the affair and be not pleased to learn that cook think such a proceeding be more likely to offend the deity than to please he he then enquire if the english ever practice such ceremony and be very angry when he be inform that if the greatest chief in england kill one of he man he would be hang and cook say they leave he with as great a contempt for we custom as we could possibly have for theirs the servant evidently listen to omai with great interest and a different opinion on the subject than that of they master they go to inspect the body of a chief who have be embalm they be not allow to examine it very closely but it be so well do that they be unable to perceive the slightest unpleasant smell though the man have be dead some month all chief who die a natural death be preserve in this manner and from time to time be expose to public view the interval between the exposure gradually extend till at length they be hardly ever see the method of preservation be not ascertain and be probably a secret of the priest equestrian exercise cook and clerke astonish the native by ride the horse that have be bring out they progress through the country be always watch with great interest and cook think that this use of the animal impress the people more than anything else do by the whites omaus try he power on several occasion but as he be always throw before he get securely into the saddle he effort only produce entertainment for the spectator it be curious to note that forty year afterwards the people have so thoroughly lose even the tradition of such use of the horse that mr elli relate how when one be land for the use of pomare the native assist to get it ashore but when once land they run away and hide in fear of the man-carrying pig about this time cook suffer from a bad attack of rheumatism in the leg and be successfully treat by otoo 's mother three sister and eight other woman the process he undergo call romy consist of squeeze and knead from head to foot more especially about the part affect cook say he be glad to escape from they ministration after about a quarter of a hour but he feel relief and after submit to four operation of the kind he be completely cure otoo be very desirous to send a present of a canoe to king george and cook be very willing to take it but when he find it be a large double canoe he be oblige to decline from want of space as the desire to send it be quite spontaneous on otoo 's part and as the canoe be a very fine specimen of native work the refusal be give with great regret in a journal publish by newbery the anonymous writer say that two officer fight a duel whilst the ship be at otaheite he do not give the cause but say three shot be exchange result in one hat be spoil and then the antagonist shake hand and be better friend afterwards the story be not confirm by any of the other journal on 29th September after give otoo a short run out to sea and back the two ship sail for the north side of eimeo arrive the next day and be greet by a chief maheine who be bald-headed of this defect he seem much ashamed and always appear with he head cover with a sort of turban cook think perhaps this shame rise from the fact that native catch steal on the ship be often punish by have they head shave and add that one or two of the gentleman whose head be not overburdened with hair lay under violent suspicion of be tito -lrb- thief -rrb- one of the few remain goat be steal but after threat of serious reprisal be give up together with the thief who be eventually discharge with a caution but on a second one disappear and not be find after careful search cook feel that he must make a example or nothing would be safe so he order one or two house and canoe to be destroy and send word to maheine that he would not leave a canoe on the island if the goat be not return the goat be recover and the next day the people be as friendly as if nothing have occur cook be particularly annoy for he have send a present of red feather to otoo and request he to send in return a couple of goat to eimeo omaus settle on 11th October the ship sail for huaheine and when they arrive cook be so ill he have to be land from the ship but he make no mention of it in he journal he think this island would be more suitable for omaus than otaheite and as omaus be agreeable a piece of ground be obtain from the chief and a small house erect and a garden lay out and plant the interest of the different chief of the neighborhood be seek on omaus 's behalf and as it be see that some of the native be incline to take advantage of he good nature cook let it be understand that if should he return and find omaus in a satisfactory condition some one would feel the weight of he displeasure then the most serious thing that can be bring against cook 's treatment of the native occur in extenuation it must be remember that he admit that he be incline to be hot-tempered though it do not last he have be constantly irritated by repeated loss and he be at the time really seriously ill and also when all be over he sincerely regret he have take such strong measure mr bayley 's sextant be steal from the observatory : cook at once demand from the chief that it should be return but they pay no attention the thief however be point out seize and take on board ship the sextant be recover but cook say find the thief to be a hardened scoundrel i punish he with greater severity than i have ever do any one before and then dismiss he he be say to have have he head shave and he ear cut off but gilbert -lrb- midshipman on the discovery -rrb- say this be not do till he have be rearrest for damaging omaus 's garden try to set fire to the house and threaten to kill omaus as soon as the ship leave cook have intend to remove he from the island but be in iron he steal the key from a sleep guard and make he escape omaus find that many of the article which be practically useless to he would be appreciate on the ship so he very wisely change they for hatchet and other useful article a notice of the visit with the name of the ship be cut on the end of omaus 's house and after firing a salute of five gun the ship sail on 2nd November omaus accompany they for a short way and mr king say that when he part from cook he completely break down and cry all the way ashore cook speak well of he say he seldom have to find fault with he that he have many good quality but like the rest of he race he lack power of observation application and perseverance desertion on the 3rd they be off ulietea and as they be able to run in close to the shore a staging be erect and the ballast port be open so as to give the rat which have become very troublesome a chance of go ashore one of the marine also take the opportunity to desert take he musket with he but after a little trouble be arrest and have previously bear a very good character he be let off with a short imprisonment a second desertion occur from the discovery mr mouat midshipman and a seaman get away cook say the affair give he more trouble than both man be worth but he insist on get they back to prevent other follow they example and to save the son of a brother officer from be lose to the world they be find to have go off in a canoe to another island and cook order clerke to detain the chief he son daughter and son-in-law on the discovery where they have go to dine and to inform they they would be keep as hostage till the runaway be return three day afterwards the deserter be bring back and the hostage be at once release it be afterwards find out that there have be a plot to seize cook in retaliation when he go for he usual bath in the evening but as it happen he be so much worried that he put it off and so escape burney note that cook could not swim before leave they receive a message from omaus say he be all right but ask for another goat as one of he be dead clerke be able to oblige he with two kid one of each sex chapter 17 1777 to 1779 third voyage continue in case of separation clerke be order to cruise for five day near where he consort have be last see and then to steer for new albion -lrb- so-called by sir franci drake

good look-out for he companion then he be to sail on 1st April to 56 degree north and again cruise about fifteen league from the coast till 10th may when he be to proceed north and endeavor to find a passage to the atlantic accord to the admiralty instruction already in he hand if unsuccessful he be to winter in some suitable port of kamtschatka leave word with the commandant of st peter and st paul harbor where he be to be find and to be at the last-named place not later than 10th may of the following year then if he have no news of the resolution he be to follow out the admiralty instruction to the best of he ability the two ship leave for bolabolum on 7th December to get a anchor leave by de bougainville in order to make hatchet for exchange as the demand have be so great they stock be run short they have no difficulty in purchase it and it be good enough for they purpose though not so heavy as they expect they cross the line on the 23rd in longitude 203 degree 15 minute east without have see land since leave bolabolum two day after they pick up a low island and manage to get some turtle and also a rather unsatisfactory observation of a eclipse of the sun the cloud interfere with the view of the commencement they position have be settle by other observation so the ill-luck be unimportant about three hundred turtle be obtain average from 90 to 100 pound each and as much fish as they could consume during they stay be catch coconut yam and melon be plant and the island receive the name of christmas island sandwich island leave on 2nd January they do not sight land till the sandwich island be reach in latitude 21 degree 12 minute 30 seconds north at the second one see call atouus by the native they be quickly surround by canoe the occupant very like the otaheitan in appearance and language be arm with stone which they throw overboard as soon as they find they be not likely to be want and though none could be persuade to come on board the ship they freely part with fish for anything they could get in exchange as the ship sail on more canoe come out bring further supplies and cook rejoice at arrive at a land of plenty for he stock of turtle be just finish and he be anxious to save he sea store at length some be tempt on board and be greatly astonish at what they see but they wonder do not last long and steal soon break out as usual when they come to a anchor cook land and find a favourable place for water so a party be set to work the next day and find no difficulty in get assistance from the islander whilst at the same time a brisk trade be carry on in pig and potato cook say : no people could trade with more honesty than these people never once attempt to cheat we either ashore or alongside the ship they seem to have drop they thieving very quickly at night a nasty sea get up and as cook do not like the position of he ship he weigh to run a little further out but the wind suddenly drop round to the east he have to set all sail to clear the shore for a day or two no very satisfactory anchorage could be find and the weather be rather unsettle so make one of the chief a present of a english sow and boar and a male and two female goat the ship bear away to the northwards accord to baron von humboldt these island be discover by a spaniard gaetano sailing from manilla to acapulco in 1542 and it be one of the few discovery make by the spaniard during this passage for they be strictly forbid to deviate from the track lay down on they chart the name la mesa -lrb- the table -rrb- down on the chart cook have with he describe the island say burney but the longitude be several degree out it be undoubtedly a fact that european have be at the island previously to cook 's visit for at least two piece of iron be find one be a portion of a broad-sword and the other a piece of hoop-iron new albion on 7th march new albion be sight at a distance of ten or twelve league and the position of the ship at noon be 44 degree 33 minute north 236 degree 30 minute east cook 's order be to make the coast about 45 degree north so they may be say to have be carry out with fair exactness cook say that on the chart he have a large entrance or strait be represent and in the account of martin d'aguilar 's voyage in 1603 mention be make of a large river near where he strike the coast but he do not see any sign of either proceed up the coast the progress be very slow as the weather be very stormy on 22nd march they pass the position of the strait of juan de fuch but again no sign of its existence be see on the 29th the style of the coast change and high snowy mountain with well-wooded valley run down to the sea come into view and at length hope bay open out here they come in contact with the first native they have see who put off in they canoe to the ship show sign neither of fear nor distrust at first they appear mild and inoffensive and would trade anything they have with they but when they get use to the ship it turn out that they be adept at thieve no piece of iron brass or copper be safe fish-hook be cut from the line and boat be strip of they fitting they sell bladder of oil for the lamp and it be find that they be often partly fill with water but this be wink at in order to get on a thoroughly friendly footing this be a favourable opportunity to put the two vessel in order and to give the crew a spell of rest ashore a good anchorage be seek out and the observatory set up on 4th April whilst wood and water be be get in the native who have give no trouble beyond they stealing be observe to be arm and precaution be take but the indian explain that they preparation be make against some of they own countryman who be on they way to fight they after a time some canoe make they appearance and on a deputation go out to meet they a discussion take place and some sort of a agreement be make between the two party but the newcomer be not allow to approach the ship nor to join in the trade the stay here be longer than be intend for the resolution 's fore and mizzen mast be find to be very defective and she rigging have get into a very bad state the fore-mast be repair and the mizzen replace with a new stick and when a great deal of work have be do this prove faulty and a second one have to be cut new standing rigging be fit to the main-mast and a set make from the best of the old for the fore-mast when the heaviest part of this work be complete cook visit the country about king george 's sound and be courteously receive at a village by the native to most of whom he be know here he find the woman employ make dress out of bark in much the same way as that employ by the new zealander send some sailor to cut grass for the sheep and goat he have leave the native make a claim which be at once satisfied but when the man be order to go on cut fresh claimant spring up till cook say he think each blade of grass have a separate owner when at last the native find that they

and no pretension to good look burney say that it be only after much cleaning that they skin be find to be like we people in england cook say they be docile courteous and good-natured but liable to fit of passion i have often see a man rave and scold for more than half a hour without any one take the least notice of it nor could any one of we tell who it be he be abuse burney describe they language as harsh and when in a warm discussion apparently insufficient and then they have to eke it out with such nod and jump as remind one of punch and the devil they clothing be chiefly make of skin and a kind of cloth make from fiber or wool and hair or a mixture of both in these clothes and a coarse mat and straw hat they would sit in they canoe in the heaviest rain as unconcernedly as if they be in perfect shelter they house of log and board make by splitting large tree be some as much as 150 foot long by 20 to 30 foot wide and 7 or 8 foot high they be divide into two compartment each apparently the property of one family the roof be of loose plank which they move about so as to let the light fall where it be wanted cook judge these be only summer residence and that they have better house inland the furniture consist of a few box some wooden vessel for they food and a few mat bag they cooking be fairly good but excessively dirty and they person and house filthy as hog ' sty they often have two wooden figure in they house resemble human figure of which they speak mysteriously but as they could have be purchase in every case for a small quantity of old iron or brass

human head the stone cutting-part be a large tongue and they be decorate with human hair the defensive armor be a double cloak of hide usually moose serviceable against arrow or spear but they be greatly surprise to see a bullet fire through a cloak fold four time the only vegetable obtain be a few nettle and wild garlic but burney say that at the back of the village be a plantation of cherry tree gooseberry and currant raspberry and strawberry but unluckily for we none of they in season on 20th April a man who have be allow to go into cook 's cabin make off with he watch and get away from the ship fortunately he canoe be see alongside the discovery and notice be give a search be make and the watch find in a box unharmed such a loss would have be serious two old-fashioned silver table-spoon suppose to be spanish and a pewter wash-basin be purchase from the indian resolution leak on 26th April a start be make and before leave a indian who have specially attach himself to cook

happy as a prince by a gift of a new broadsword with a brass hilt the next day when well clear of the land a perfect hurricane arise and the ship lay to head to the south-east the resolution spring a leak and the water could be see and hear rush in but after some little anxiety one pump be find to be sufficient to keep the upper hand the gale last two day but on the second they be able to get a observation which give the position of the ship as 50 degree 1 minute north 229 degree 26 minute east about opposite to where the strait of de fonte be mark on he chart they be now able to run along the coast and see and name the most salient point but time be too valuable to make any halt by the way the land appear to be of considerable height the hill cover with snow but near the sea well wooded mount st elia be sight 4th may at a distance of forty league and on the 6th they arrive in the bay in which behring have anchor so he name be give to it on the chart here the land trend away to the west the wind be westerly and light and consequently they progress be very slow landing on a island to try to get a view of the other side from the top of a hill it be find so steep and thickly wood he have to give up the attempt he therefore leave a bottle contain some coin give he by he friend dr kaye and name the island after he here they find currant and strawberry plant but the season be too early for fruit near cape hinchinbroke gore go off to a island to shoot but see two large canoe contain about twenty indian he think it wiser to return to the ship he be follow up but none of the native would come on board and after a time intimate they would return next day retire two man in small canoe do return during the night but find that every one on board be not asleep beat a hurry retreat the next day the ship get into a better position and more indian turn up with whom they have little difficulty in enter into trading relation but as they desire piece of iron about ten inch long by three wide and it be rather a scarce article on board very little chiefly skin be purchase at first only one man come on board and as he see only two or three people on the discovery he go to the resolution and bring over some of he friend who rush the deck with they knife draw however the crew quickly run up with they cutlass ready so the native retire remark that the white man 's knife be longer than theirs at the resolution they break every glass scuttle they could reach with they paddle say burney cook point out that they must have be quite ignorant of the use of firearm and conclude by say : however after all these trick we have the good fortune to leave they as ignorant as we find they for they neither hear nor see a musket fire unless at bird the leak on the resolution be attend to and in place the oakum caulking be find to have disappear completely one writer say it be cause by rat and that the ship be save by rubbish have choke up the leak two set of tooth bad weather detain they cook have a opportunity of study the inhabitant he have with he a description of the esquimaux by crantz and find these man to be very similar in appearance dress and appliance

be a possible communication with hudson 's bay a good supply of very fine salmon be obtain from native in the neighborhood and cook form the opinion that a pay fur trade might be open up as the skin offer be of considerable value work slowly up the coast they pass through the island off quelpart on the 18th when the discovery signal to speak a boat be send and return with a small box curiously tie up with neatly-made twine it have be deliver on board by a indian who first attract attention by display a pair of old plush breeches and a black cloth waistcoat and when he come on board take off he cap and bow like a european the box be find to contain a paper write in russian but unfortunately the only thing that could be understand be the two date 1776 and 1778 it be suppose to have be

waterproof whilst in this neighborhood they receive a second letter in russian but have no one on board who could translate it be return with some present to the bearer who retire bow he thanks after some detention from fog and adverse wind they get away once more and push slowly northwards on 3rd August mr anderson the surgeon who have be ill for some month die and cook have name a island sight soon after he death anderson 's island to perpetuate the memory of the decease for whom i have a very great regard appoint mr law to the resolution and mr samwell to the discovery as surgeon on 9th August cape prince of wale 65 degree 46 minute north 191 degree 45 minute east be sight and they believe it to be the most westerly point of north america they land on what from heydinger 's chart be the eastern end of the island of alaska but it afterwards be find to be the eastern extremity of asia this chart say burney be find not only to be incorrect but almost unintelligible the country be very desolate neither tree nor shrub to be see and the inhabitant seem afraid of they visitor though not absolutely unfriendly they be taller and stouter than those on the american side and they clothing very superior the ship fall in with the ice blink on the 17th in 70 degree 33 minute north 197 degree 41 minute east rather earlier than have be expect and soon afterwards with the ice itself in the shape of a large field extend as far as the eye could reach from west to east here they get a supply of fresh meat in the shape of sea-horse of which animal they kill a good many the flesh be fishy and indifferent eating but cook say anything be preferable to salt meat they still slowly but steadily push north along the american shore but be hamper by fog and ice they cross over to the west side with no better fortune for on the 26th they find themselves embay in the field with large quantity of heavy loose ice along the edge have sight cape north on 29th August cook decide the season be too far advance and that it would be better to proceed to winter quarter and accordingly run down the asiatic coast in search of wood and water of which he stand in need but be disappointed and make over to the other side be fortunate to find a considerable quantity of driftwood which serve he purpose before leave the strait cook remark : in justice to behring 's memory i must say he delineate this coast very well and fix the latitude and longitude of the point better than could be expect from the method he have to go by salmon pie anchor in norton sound cook send away the boat to explore and set to work to determine between the correctness of the chart draw by stocklin and he own observation and after a series of no less than seventy-seven set of observation he be able to show that stocklin be wrong it be at this place that he decide to winter in the sandwich island as a port in kamtschatka would oblige he crew to remain idle for nearly six month before further exploration to the north could be undertake the course be now set for samgoonoodha harbor but they do not arrive there till 3rd October have meet with very heavy weather in which the resolution again begin to leak badly on 8th September a indian bring a singular present in the form of a pie make like a loaf contain some highly seasoned salmon accompany by a letter in russian in return corporal ledyard of the marine a intelligent man be send with a few bottle of rum wine and porter to obtain further information and with order if he meet with any russian he be to make they understand that we be english friend and ally on the 10th ledyard return bring three russian sailor but as there be no interpreter there be difficulty in understand anything thoroughly one of the newcomer be understand to say he have be out with behring but cook think he be too young they appear to have great respect for that officer and ledyard say he have see a sloop which he understand be he ship they stay on the resolution all night and promise to return with a chart of the island that lay between that place and kamtschatka it be understand that there be several settlement in the immediate neighborhood employ altogether about four hundred russian letter to london on the 14th cook and webber be at a indian village a short distance from the ship when they see a canoe arrive contain three man and accompany by some twenty or thirty single canoe a tent be rig up for one of the first three a russian name ismyloff -lrb- ismailoff -rrb- the chief trader of the district whilst the other make shelter of they canoe and grass and so all be independent of the indian ismailoff invite cook to join he at he meal which consist of dry salmon and berry and some sort of conversation be carry on by means of sign and figure ismailoff prove to be well acquaint with the geography of the district and point out several error in the modern map he say he have be with lieutenant lindo 's expedition as far north as tchukotskous no and see clerke 's island but when he could or would not say what else they have do during the two year the expedition be out cook begin to have doubt he also say the russian have several time try to gain a footing on the american shore but the indian have drive they off with the loss of two or three of they leader he also speak of a sledge expedition in 1773 to three island opposite the kolyma river which cook think might be the one mention by muller he relate that he have sail in 1771 from a russian settlement call bolscheretskus in the kurile island to japan but the ship be order away because they be christian so they go to canton and sail on a french ship to france and from thence he go to petersburg and be then send out again he be quite clear as to he date and put they on paper but as he be perfectly ignorant of any french not even the name of the commonest article though he have be such a long time amongst french people cook be again incline to be sceptical he stay all night dine with clerke and return again on the 19th with chart which he permit to be copy and some manuscript one chart show the asiatic coast as far as 41 degree north with the kurile island and kamtschatka and the second the more interesting to the english show the discovery make by the russian to the east of kamtschatka exclusive of the voyage of behring and tcherikoff cook find the longitude in place be very different from those on the russian map and be afraid the mistake might be carry through but the latitudes be fairly correct as far as he could ascertain the instrument use for the survey have be the theodolite before leave ismailoff give cook letter for the governor of kamtschatka and the commandant of petropaulowsk and cook finding he be tolerably well verse in astronomy give he a hadley 's octant and though it be the first one he have see he soon make himself acquaint with its use a letter to the english admiralty be also entrust to he to be forward via petersburg as opportunity might offer this letter and a chart of the northern coast be deliver in london the following year on 26th October the two ship get away and in case of separation clerke be give he rendezvous first the sandwich island and second petropaulowsk in the middle of may on 28th the discovery meet with a nasty accident during a gale the fore and main tack carry away kill one man and seriously injure the boatswain and two other on 25th November the island be sight and the customary order as to the officer appoint to trade with the native be issue and no curiosity be to be purchase before the ship have receive satisfactory supplies they first call in at mowee where the native soon come out and appear friendly and trade with less suspicion than any of the south sea islander they have meet with before have procure a quantity of sugar-cane cook order it to be use in brewing as he find a strong decoction of the juice produce a wholesome and palatable beer and would enable he to save the spirit for the colder climate however the crew would have none of it so cook and he officer make use of it whenever cane be procurable and give himself : no trouble either to oblige or persuade they to drink it know there be no danger of scurvy so long as we have plenty of other vegetable but that i might not be disappoint in my view i give order that no grog should be serve in either ship he then go on to say : every innovation whatever tho ' ever so much to they advantage be sure to meet with the highest disapprobation from seaman portable soup and sour kraut be at first both condemn by they as stuff not fit for human being to eat few man have introduce into they ship more novelty in the way of victuals and drink than i have do indeed few man have have the same opportunity or be drive to the same necessity it have however in a great measure be owe to such little innovation that i have always keep my people generally speak free from that dreadful distemper the scurvy this extract show how bitterly cook feel the stupid ingratitude of he man for the constant care he take of they and be one of the very few passage in he journal in which he speak in they disfavor this curiously be erase by some unknown hand king assert it must have be do by gore as he be certain it be not by either cook or clerke who take command after cook 's death faulty sail in try to weather the south-east end of mowee in heavy weather the leach rope of the main topsail and two topgallant sail give way and the sail be blow to piece cook say neither the cordage canvas nor indeed hardly any other store use in the navy be equal in quality to those in general use in the merchant service and he relate how such failure have constantly result in infinite trouble vexation and loss he illustrate he complaint by the fact that rig block and sail that be purchase with he ship although they have be fourteen month in use wear longer than any of the thing of the same kind put on board new from the king 's store on 24th December they succeed in get to windward of the island but the signal to the discovery to tack have be omit she stand on and it be some day before she rejoin company January 1779 be usher in with heavy rain but clear away before noon they be able to approach to about five mile from the shore where they lay to and trade with the native the next three day be spend work slowly down the coast and keep a good look-out for they consort occasionally stop to do a little trading with the islander some of whom come as much as fifteen mile out to they the chief article of commerce be salt which be of very good quality on the 5th January the southern point of owhyhee be round and they lay off a large village where they be quickly surround by canoe laden with hog and woman : the latter be not hold up as pattern of all the virtue vegetable seem to be scarce and cook conclude that either the land could not produce they or the crop have be destroy by volcanic action very recent trace of which be to be see Wednesday 6th January 1779 the next morning the people visit we again bring with they the same article as before be near the shore i send mr bligh the master in a boat to sound the coast with order to land and look for fresh water on he return he report that at two cable length from the shore he have no sounding with a 160 fathom of line that when he land he find no fresh water but rain water lie in hole in the rock and that brackish with the spray of the sea and that the surface of the country be wholly compose of large slag and ash here and there partly cover with plant between 10 and 11 o'clock we see the discovery come round the south point of the island and at 1 pm she join we when captain clerke come on board and inform I that he have cruise four or five day where we be separate and then plye round the last part of the island but meeting with unfavourable wind be carry some distance from the coast he have one of the islander on board all the time it be he own choice nor do not leave they the first opportunity that offer this be the last entry make by cook in the journal he be prepare for publication and be a fair sample of the manner in which the entire journal be write and certainly do not justify the sneer that have be utter about bad grammar and spell the double negative notwithstanding in handwriting spelling and grammar he can compare well with he press either in the navy or civil life and many of the example of bad spelling give have be abbreviation common in the navy which he critic do not understand karakakoa bay on 17th January they anchor in karakakoa bay where large number of canoe laden with provision for sale come out cook estimate that at one time there be no less than a thousand round the ship they occupant entirely unarmed they soon prove to be adept at thieve one man steal the rudder of a boat so cook order a shot or two to be fire over the escape thief but as it be not intend that any of the shot should take effect the indian seem rather more surprised than frightened and the man get away the lid of the resolution 's copper be steal and the discovery have she rigging much cut about for the sake of the iron the deck be so crowd with the native that burney say it keep a quarter of the crew hard at work to make room for the working of the ship a insecure position the last entry make by cook in he ship 's journal and probably the last word he ever write run as follow : Sunday 17 fine pleasant weather and variable faint breeze of wind in the evening mr bligh return and report that he have find a bay in which be good anchorage and fresh water tolerable easy to come at into this bay i resolve to go to refit the ship and take in water as the night approach the indian retire to the shore a good -lrb- many -rrb- however desire to sleep on board curiosity be not they only motive at least not with some of they for the next morning several thing be miss which determine I not to entertain so many another night at 11 be anchor in the bay which be call by the native -lrb- a blank fill in by another hand karakakoa -rrb- in 13 fathom of water over a sandy bottom and a quarter of a mile from the north-east shore in this situation the south point of the bay bear south 1\/4 west and the north point west 1\/4 south moor with the stream anchor to the northward unbent the sail and strike yard and topmast the ship very much crowd with indian and surround by a multitude of canoe i have nowhere in this sea see such a number of people assemble at one place besides those in the canoe all the shore of the bay be cover with people and hundred be swim about the ship like shoal of fish we should have find it difficult to have keep they in order have not a chief or servant of terreeoboo 's name parea now and then -lrb- show -rrb- he authority by turn or rather drive they all out of the ship among we numerous visitor be a man name touahah who we soon find belong to the church he introduce himself with much ceremony in the course of which he present I with a small pig two coconut and a piece of red cloth which he wrap round I in this manner all or most of the chief introduce themselves but this man go further he bring with he a large hog and a quantity of fruit and root all of which he include in the present in the afternoon i go ashore to view the place accompany by touahah parea mr king and other as soon as we land touahah take I by the hand and conduct I to a large moraus the other gentleman with parea and four or five more of the native follow mr king describe this moraus as be about forty yard long by twenty broad and about fourteen foot high the top flat well paved and surround by a wooden railing a old building stand in the center from which a stone wall run to the fence divide the top into two part on the landward side be five pole upward of twenty foot high support a irregular kind of scaffold and on the sea-side half be two small house with a covered communication between on they arrival cook be present with two ugly image wrap with red cloth and a sort of hymn be sing then they be march to the scaffolding where be a table on which lay fruit and vegetable surmount by a very much decompose pig and in a semicircle round one end of this table be twelve image place cook near the scaffolding koah as king and other call touahah take up the pig and hold it towards he make a long speech then drop the offensive porker he make sign that the two be to climb on to the uncertain scaffolding this be do a procession come forward bear a live hog and a piece of red cloth this last article be hand up to koah who proceed to wrap it round cook who be cling to he elevated but not very safe position the pig be then offer to cook and a long address chant the two principal performer then descend and return to the table koah snap he finger at the figure and make what appear to be sarcastic remark till he come to the center one when he prostrate himself and kiss it request cook to do the same the party then proceed to the other part of the moraus and cook be seat between two image with he arm stretch out one uphold by koah the other by king a cook pig and other food be then present with much ceremony the meat cut up and kava prepare whilst koah 's assistant chew some coconut wrap it in cloth and then rub it over cook 's face head shoulder and arm koah and parea then pull piece of the pig and put they into the mouth of the two officer king say that parea be a particularly cleanly person so he do not so much mind this feeding but cook remember how koah have handle the putrid hog be unable to swallow a mouthful and he reluctance as may be suppose be not diminish when the old man accord to he own mode of civility have chew it for he cook then put a end to further proceedings by distribute some present to the attendant and return to the ship though the meaning of this ceremony could only be a matter of conjecture it be very evident that it be intend as a mark of high respect to the person of captain cook the title of orono give to he and often quote as evidence that he have permit himself to be look upon as a god by the native be also give to one if not more of they own chief and burney say that the mark of honor confer on he be exactly the same as those confer on any one of they own superior chieftain the grotesque description give by some of the missionary writer of the whole population crawl after he on hand and knee as a mark of adoration be utterly untrue for mr king who be ashore almost the whole time of the ship 's stay and be continually with cook distinctly say : the crowd which have collect on the shore retire at we approach and not a person be to be see except a few lie prostrate on the ground near the hut of the adjoining village none of those who be on the voyage and have leave any record behind they suggest that cook be treat in any respect otherwise than as a great chief and a man a small potato field be place under tabu near the moraus for the purpose of the observatory and a camp under the command of king be establish there this camp be daily supply with meat and vegetable even more than could be consume and several canoe-load be send off to the ship after enquiry it be find that the whole expense of this food be bear by koah and no return whatever be demand a royal visit a tabu be place on the whole of the bay on the 24th and trading come to a complete standstill the reason give be the come of the king terreeoboo he arrive the next day and commerce at once revive he pay a private visit with he wife and child to the resolution remain on board some time and prove to be the same chief they have see at the island of mowee the next day he accompany by several important chief all dress in rich feather cloak and arm with long spear and dagger pay a state visit koah be also present in a canoe with other priest and two large basket-work idol whose distorted face be adorn with pearl-shell eye and dog 's tooth he be attend by two other canoe one fill with pig and vegetable and these paddle round the ship the priest singing in most solemn fashion and return to the shore cook follow king turn out the guard and salute terreeoboo and then conduct he to the tent where after seat himself for a few moment he take off he helmet and cloak and place they on cook at the same time order five or six more of great value to be place at he foot hog bread-fruit etc be then bring in cook and terreeoboo exchange name as a peculiar mark of friendship and the ceremony end by the presentation of the two boat-load of provision by a deputation of the priest one of those present be a nephew of the king call by the english maiha-maiha afterwards know to the world as kamehameha i as many of the chief as the resolution 's pinnace would hold be take off with the king to the ship and the latter be duly invest with a white linen shirt and cook 's own sword during the whole of this performance no canoe except those actually engage be to be see in the bay and all the native remain lie on the ground or in they house clerke who have be too ill to share in these ceremony land for the first time on the 28th and though quite unexpected he receive a very handsome present of food and terreeoboo pay the discovery a state call take with he present similar to those give to cook in the afternoon he pay a second -lrb- private -rrb- call in a small canoe with three paddle one of which he wield himself on this occasion there be no prostration but if any native meet he chief he simply get out of the way unless some service be require of he the ship be run very short of firewood and as there be none grow less than a mile and a half off the sea mr king be order to try and purchase the fence surround the top of the moraus he hesitate as he think that : even the bare mention of it might be consider by they -lrb- the priest -rrb- as a piece of shocking impiety in this however i find myself mistaken not the smallest surprise be express at the application and the wood be readily give even without stipulate for anything in return he see the sailor be carry away the figure as well and speak to koah on the subject who raise no objection except with regard to the center one which be at once return burney say that two launch-load for each ship be obtain a seasonable supply as we have be four month since we wood on 31st January whatman one of the gunner 's crew and greatly attach to cook die and be bury in the moraus besant think that this have some influence on the mind of the native and may have contribute to cook 's death but as it be do by terreeoboo 's special request it be difficult to see how the idea can be justify a large present enquiry be several time make as to the date of the departure of the ship and hint be give that supplies be run short but at the same time they be inform that if they return the next bread-fruit season they want should be again supply when the news go forth that they would leave in two day terreeoboo issue a proclamation for food to be bring in so that he might make a large present on they departure and on the appoint day cook and king be invite to terreeoboo 's residence where they find all that have be give in exchange to the native be lay out on the ground and a short distance away a large quantity of vegetable of all kind and a herd of pig which be hand over on a return present be make king say that the gift far exceed everything of the kind we have see the camp ashore be then break up and a great effort be make to persuade cook to permit mr king to remain as he have succeed in make himself a great favorite with all a house that have be use by the sailmaker be accidentally set on fire burney say by native look for a knife lose by one of the sailor but besant who place the fire at a later period say it be do intentionally in revenge for the sailor have entice some of the woman there and infer that gilbert be he authority but in the extract he publish from gilbert 's manuscript there be nothing of the kind and no one refer to any other fire till after cook 's death chapter 18 1779 to 1780 third voyage conclude on 4th February the ship unmoored and sail from the bay steering to the north in hope of find a better anchorage the wind be very light and the progress be so slow that it give terreeoboo a opportunity of send off a further present of food soon after a gale spring up and the canoe which have accompany they beat a hasty retreat leave a good many mostly woman on board the ship about midnight the fore and main topsail be split but towards morning the wind die away and they be able to bend fresh sail a second gale come on again at night put they under double-reefed topsail with topgallant yard send down and at daybreak the fore-mast be find to be so badly spring that it be absolutely necessary it should be unstepped for immediate repair after considerable hesitation for he fully recognize that the place must be almost denude of surplus provision cook decide to return to karakakoa bay as no other convenient place be know and the ship again anchor there on the 11th start immediately to unstep and get the mast ashore when it be find to be rotten at the heel as well as spring wood that have be cut at eimeo for anchor stock be use for fish the head and the work proceed rapidly : the priest make the camp tabu so that there should be no interference with the workman when the ship arrive in the bay hardly a canoe be to be see and none come out to the ship this contrast with they first reception be the cause of some surprise and in view of what happen afterwards of some suspicion but mr king who have more intercourse with the native than any of the other officer be thoroughly satisfied that they neither mean nor apprehend any change of conduct burney say that terreeoboo and some of the chief visit they on the 12th and ask many question about they return and do not seem well satisfy with the answer receive trouble commence everything go smoothly till the afternoon of the 13th when the officer in charge of the water party complain to king that the conduct of some of the native be suspicious and some of the chief be drive away man he have engage to help in roll the cask to the boat king send a marine with side arm to help to restore order but shortly after be inform the native be arm with stone and get very noisy so he go down himself with a marine arm with he musket and succeed in set matter right just at this time cook come ashore and king report what have occur receive order to fire with ball if he receive any insolence or stone be throw soon afterwards shot be hear from the discovery and a canoe be see make for the shore closely pursue by one of the ship 's boat cook king and a marine run to intercept they but be too late as the occupant of the canoe land before they could reach the spot burney say the disturbance commence by a native steal a pair of carpenter 's tong jump overboard with they and place they in a canoe which at once paddle off the thief be catch flog and put in iron till the tong be return from the shore the same tong be again steal in the afternoon and the thief get away with they pursue by edgar the master in the ship 's cutter and join by the resolution 's pinnace the thief reach shore first put the tong the lid of a harness cask and a chisel in a second canoe which go out and hand they over to edgar edgar see cook and king run along the shore think it right to detain the second canoe which unfortunately belong to parea who at the time of the theft be in clerke 's cabin and promise to obtain the tong have immediately leave for the shore he try to regain possession of he canoe but be knock down by a sailor and then some of the native who before this have be quietly look on begin to throw stone and so roughly handle the sailor in the pinnace that be unarmed they beat a retreat swimming to some rock out of reach of the missile edgar and vancouver remain ashore and fare badly till parea who have recover from he blow and apparently forget it order he countryman to stay they hand and manage to save the pinnace from be break up he want the boat to go back to the ship but as the oar have be take away this be impossible he then start to find they and as soon as he back be turn the throw begin again edgar wish to go to the camp to find cook but some of the native advise he to follow they and they would take he to parea he soon meet he carry one oar follow by a man with a broken one so they be able to make shift in the boat to the camp be overtake on the way by parea in he canoe bring vancouver 's cap which have be lose in the scuffle owe to he pursuit of the thief cook do not hear of all this trouble till after dark too late to take any further step but king say he appear very disturb by the news and remark : i be afraid these people will oblige I to use some violent measure for they must not be leave to imagine that they have gain a advantage over we he then go on board he ship and order all native ashore whilst king return to the camp and double he sentry give order he be to be call if any native be see about at eleven five be see hover near but when they find they be observe they make off and later one get close to the observatory but run when the sentry fire over he head when on he way to the ship the next morning for the chronometer king be inform that the discovery 's cutter have be steal it have be moor to the anchor buoy on board the resolution he find cook busy load he double-barreled gun and a landing party of marine be prepared cook say he be go ashore to try to gain possession of some of the principal chief in order to keep they prisoner till the boat be return and that he have already send out boat to prevent any one leave the bay with the intention of destroy they canoe if he could not recover the cutter by more peaceable mean the resolution 's great cutter be send after a large sailing canoe that be make off the small cutter be guard the western point of the bay and cook with the pinnace and launch be go to kowrowa to try and get terreeoboo on board the ship he and in fact every one else be confident the native would offer no resistance if they hear the sound of but one musket a little before eight o'clock captain cook lieutenant phillip a sergeant corporal and seven marine leave the ship for kowrowa and king return to he camp after be order to try and assure the native near the observatory that they would not be hurt to keep he man together and to be prepare to meet any outbreak have see he man be on the alert king visit the priest and satisfy they that terreeoboo would receive neither injury nor insult cook land have pick up the resolution 's launch under the command of lieutenant williamson on he way cook land the marine and march into the village where he receive the usual mark of respect he ask to see the king and he two young son the two boy come forward and conduct he to the hut where they father be and after a short conversation he feel assure that terreeoboo know nothing about the stealing of the boat he invite the three to accompany he to the resolution and the king at once consent and get up to go however the boy ' mother come up with a few chief and try to persuade he not to go and then they catch hold of he and force he to sit down meanwhile a large crowd have gather round and phillip who seem to have act with coolness and judgment throughout the affair draw up he man in line on some rock near the water about thirty yard away after try for some time to persuade the native to allow they chief to go with he cook give up the attempt observe to phillip that it would be impossible to compel they to do so without great risk of bloodshed unfortunately just at this time news arrive that a chief of the first rank have be kill at the other side of the bay the shot have be hear soon after the landing of cook 's party it be now recognize that matter have become very serious the native be see to be don they war mat and one man arm with a stone in one hand and a large iron spike in the other threaten cook in a very insulting manner he be tell to keep quiet but only become more furious so cook fire a charge of small shot into he but he mat save he from injury stone be throw at the marine and a chief attempt to stab phillip but be promptly knock down with the butt of the latter 's musket cook now fire he second barrel load with ball and kill one of the native but sergeant gibson tell he it be the wrong man so he receive order to kill the right one and do so the stone-throwing become heavier and the marine respond with a volley but before they have time to reload the native rush they kill four out of the seven and wound the rest phillip be stab between the shoulder but before the blow could be repeat he manage to shoot he assailant cook 's death cook be now close to the water 's edge and have turn round to order the boat ' crew to cease firing and pull in this be believe to have cause he death for whilst he face the native none of they except the one shot by gibson have offer he actual violence but when he turn to give order he be strike on the head and stab in the back fall with he face in a pool of water as soon as he fall a great shout arise he be drag ashore and the native snatch the dagger from each other show savage eagerness to share in he destruction phillip and he wounded marine plunge into the water and cover by musketry fire gain the boat they officer though wound jump out again to the assistance of the last man who severely injure by a blow on the face be in great danger of be capture the boat see there be no possibility of recover the body of the five who be kill be order to return at once to the ship from which they have only be absent a hour nine stand of arm cook 's double-barreled gun and he hanger fall into the hand of the native as soon as this be report the boat be recall from the bay and a strong reinforcement be send to mr king with order to strike he camp and get the resolution 's foremast off to the ship the indian be see to be assemble to the right of the tent so the gun be turn on they and a party be post on the moraus to cover the place where the mast lay about one o'clock everything be get away from the shore only a few stone be throw by native who think they mat be proof against bullet and only find out they mistake too late notwithstanding what have occur one of the priest whom burney call kerriakair remain with the english till everything have be remove and supply the man with food and water king about four o'clock be send to try to recover the body of the captain and marine he be at first receive with a volley of stone which fortunately fall short he display a white flag and pull inshore whilst the remain boat lay off to cover he with they fire if need but the stone-throwing be stop and the native also show the white flag in answer to king 's demand some of the chief promise that the body should be deliver the next day and koah swimming off to one of the boat explain that they could not be give up at once as they have already be take some distance up country burney however say that they gather from sign make by some other indian that the body have already be cut to piece and one man come down into the water flourish cook 's hanger with many token of exultation and defiance koah friendly on the 15th captain clerke formally take over the command of the resolution and appoint lieutenant gore to the discovery during the day koah visit the ship several time and in vain try to persuade clerke or king to go ashore but it be think inadvisable to run any further risk in the evening kerriakair and a friend come off in a small canoe bring a bundle contain the flesh of cook 's thigh say that the body have be burn and the limb distribute amongst the chief they have bring all they could get unknown to the other and kerriakair strongly advise clerke not to trust too much to koah he say that the inhabitant of the island be not incline for peace except those in the immediate neighborhood who would of course in case of hostility be the chief sufferer he give the number of native kill as twenty-six with a large number of wound on the 17th the ship be warped inshore so as to command the watering place the launch be send in for water with the other boat fully arm in support they be receive with shower of stone from the house and from behind stone wall notwithstanding gun fire from the ship and musketry from the boat at any of the native who expose themselves
