get into the wagon and drive off eight mile to bear creek to meet the people of the west be as thorough a combination and mixture of all nation character language condition and opinion as can well be imagine scarcely a nation in europe or a state in the union that do not furnish emigrant for the great west the greater mass from europe be of the humble class who come from hunger poverty and oppression they find themselves here with the joy of shipwrecked mariner cast on the untenanted wood and instantly become cheer with the hope of be able to build up a family and a fortune from new element the puritan and the planter the german the briton the frenchman the irishman and the swede each with he peculiar prejudice and local attachment and all the complicated and interwoven tissue of sentiment feeling and thought that country kindred and home indelibly combine with the web of youthful existence settle down beside each other the merchant mechanic and farmer find themselves place by necessity in the same society man must cleave to they kind and must be dependent upon each other pride and jealousy give way to the natural yearning of the human heart for society they begin to rub off mutual prejudice one take a step and then the other they meet half way and embrace and the society thus newly organize and constitute be more liberal enlarged unprejudiced and of course more affectionate and pleasant than a society of people of like birth and character who would bring all they early prejudice as a common stock to be transmit as a inheritance to posterity depend only on god and nature the simple backwoodsman come to regard god as he only master and like the swiss patriot would bow he knee to none other man be leave free to adopt such religious view and tenet as they choose and the generous law protect every man alike in he religious opinion minister of the gospel and priest be presume to be devote to humanity charity and general benevolence be preclude by many state constitution from any participation in the legislative authority and they compensation depend wholly upon the voluntary aid of those among whom they labor in charity and love in the wide district where the steven live the country be too sparsely settle to support a station minister and preach be a luxury unsustained by the rigid precept of law in any privilege perquisite fix revenue prescribe by reverence or authority except such as be voluntarily acknowledge the clergy find that success depend upon the due cultivation of popular talent zeal for the great cause mixed perhaps with a spice of earthly ambition the innate sense of emulation and laudable pride a desire of distinction among they cotemporary and brethren prompt they to seek popularity and to study all the art and means of win the popular favor travel from month to month through dark forest with such ample time for deep thought as they amble slowly along the lonesome horse path or unfrequented road they naturally acquire a pensive and romantic turn of thought and expression which be often favorable to eloquence hence they preaching be of the highly popular cast such as immortalize peter cartwright the first aim be to excite the minister hence too excitement or in religious parlance awakening or revival become common living remote from each other and spending much of they time in domestic solitude in vast forest or wide spreading prairie the appointment for preach be look upon as a gala-day or a please change which bring together the auditor from remote point and gratify a feeling of curiosity which prompt the pioneer to associate and interchange cordial congratulation as yet no meeting house have be erect in all the region where the steven live the meeting on bear creek be at the home of mr moore who be the happy possessor of a double log cabin one cabin or room be clear of furniture and sawn board place on stick of wood on end furnish the seat these be occupy and the entry between the cabin be fill by child the preacher who be also chorister take he position near the door so as to accommodate those without as well as those within he open he saddle-bag and push back he soil linen take out he bible and hymn-book and proceed to line a hymn start it himself the congregation all join fernando steven have hear from he sister about these wonderful meeting but he have never dream that a score of voice could raise such a uproar and he cease admire he new shoe while he fix he eye in terror on the capacious mouth of a pious old man who in he fervent zeal be singing with all he might as he sound forth each resonant note louder than the precede he mouth open wider and wider until fernando take alarm and climb upon he father 's knee at this critical moment there come on the air a crack sound and one of the board which serve the purpose of a pew break in the center and come down with a crash precipitate nearly half a score of buxom scream girl into a promiscuous heap upon the floor this be too much for fernando he could not but attribute the disaster to the wide-mouthed singer and he scream so lustily in he fright that he father take he from the house to calm he fear fernando 's first experience at meeting be not very encouraging but he do not despair soon after they return home he hear the family begin to speak of the camp-meeting and learn that one be to be hold at the head water of bear creek not far from the home of mr moore and that the family be go on the appoint day they take they place in the wagon and start for the camp ground

western country clothe in they deepest verdure and near a sparkling stream which supply the host with fresh water white tent start up in the grove and soon a sylvan village spring up as if by magic the tent and booth be pitch in a semi-circle or in a four-sided parallelogram inclose a area of two acre or more for the arrangement of seat and aisle around a rude pulpit and altar for the thronging multitude all eager to hear the heavenly messenger fernando behold all in a maze of wonder and half believe this be that heaven of which he mother have tell he so much he half expect to see the sky open and the son of god descend in all he glory toward night the hour of solemn service approach and the vast sylvan bower of the deep umbrageous forest be illuminate by numerous lamp suspend around the line of tent which encircle the public area and beside the rustic altar distribute over the same which send forth a glare of light from the fagot fire upon the worship throng and the majestic forest with a impose effect which elevate the soul to fit converse with its creator god the scenery of the most brilliant theater of the world be only a painting for child compare with this meantime the multitude with the highest excitement of social feeling add to the general enthusiasm of expectation be pass from tent to tent interchange apostolic greeting and embrace while they talk of the approach solemnity a few minute suffice to finish the evening 's repast when the moon -lrb- for they have take think to appoint the meeting at the time of the full moon -rrb- begin to show its disc

quaintest simplicity ascend a platform wipe the dust from he spectacles and in a voice of suppress emotion line the hymn of which that vast multitude could recite the word to be sing with a air in

peace and triumph gather to they father when he speak of the short space that remain for he he only regret be that he could no longer proclaim in the silence of death the unsearchable riches and mercy of he crucified redeemer no wonder as the speaker pause to dash the gathering moisture from he own eye he audience be dissolve in tear or utter exclamation of penitence many who pride themselves on a

no one doubt that he would end he day a bachelor on this bright June morning a sail be descry sse and there immediately spring up a little conversation between master and mate as to the probable character of the ship perchance captain it be a british cruiser suggest the mate if it should be we have no fear no for the _ ocean star _ can show a pair of clean heel to anything afloat these british have a habit of search all vessel they can capture and impress seaman it be ugly business it will breed another storm i do not think america will long submit at this the mate whose temper be

stranger approach very rapidly carry a press of canvas and lie over to it in fine style in a short time the stranger be almost within speak distance and captain lane make she out to be a large heavily-sparred clipper brig a collision seem inevitable if she hold she course the _ ocean star _ be a little to windward of the stranger with the starboard tack aboard and captain lane know it be the stranger 's duty to bear up and keep away he jump for he speak trumpet and hail : brig ahoy no answer and the mysterious vessel come booming right on for they with fearful speed brig ahoy shout the captain again hard up you helm or you will be into I still no answer and jump to the wheel the captain jam it down and they come up fly into the wind leave the wheel to the frightened seaman he spring into the port rail to see where the stranger would strike they as he do so that mysterious craft fly by and the whole sea seem light up by a strange illumination it be like a terrible dream -- so wild so supernatural and unearthly as captain lane stand by the port rail he see right under he quarter a large low black brig with she deck crowd with man and gun protrude from she port while on the weather rail cling with one hand to the shroud stand a strange demoniacal-looking figure holding in he outstretched hand above the water a burning blue light on the quarter-deck a little knot of man seem stand a short distance apart from they be a strikingly handsome man who from he air of superiority lane at once know to be the commander he perfectly poise and graceful attitude and thorough composure as he remove a cigar from he mouth and motion a order to the helmsman strike the beholder as wonderful in a instant the whole thing flash upon the captain -- _ he be a pirate _ he have run under the stern of the brig and burn a blue light to read the name of the vessel and see if the bird be worth pluck captain lane 's decision be instantaneous he know that the white feather never help one out with such fellow it be all the work of a instant the stranger run a couple of length astern the _ ocean star _ swing he main-yard aback and hail but while the bold buccaneer be do this captain lane have perform a equally sea-manlike maneuver he catch he sail aback and he vessel have stern way he shift he helm back she round and fill away on the other tack stand directly for the pirate it be the stranger 's time to hail now the _ ocean star _ be a sharp strong fast-sailing vessel and be under good headway and perfect control captain lane then act hurriedly but with precision give he order to he mate and helmsman and seize the cabin lantern and he speak trumpet he jump upon the topgallant forecastle and hold up he lamp make the master mason 's _ hail sign of distress _ he then hail through he trumpet in quick determine syllable : brig ahoy unless you swear as a man or as a mason that you will not molest I as true as there be a god we will sink together quick as think the answer come back through the trumpet clear and distinct : i swear as a mason hard up you helm hard up you helm the captain shout aft and pay off like a bird the _ ocean star _ sweep by the stranger 's stern

the black stern be the name morgianna he have scarce read it when the same clear tone more subdue hail he as he think with somewhat of kindness : captain do I the favor to back you main-yard i will

four-oared boat contain but a single figure besides the crew be see approach the _ ocean star _ captain lane have a ladder put over the gangway and throw a rope to the boat as it come alongside and the next moment the stranger spring upon the deck of the _ ocean star _ with a easy grace he give to the captain the quick intelligible sign of the great brotherhood and take he arm familiarly walk aft captain lane call the steward send for glass and wine and as soon as they be place upon the table close the cabin door and find himself alone with he strange visitor the captain fill he glass and sip it in spanish fashion pass the decanter to the stranger he follow he example and after the usual interchange of courtesy address he : captain i have a favor to ask of you name it you be probably

they may find a home with the surroundings of christian society you will confer a favor upon I which money can never repay captain lane look at the man with astonishment and for the first time give he a glance that be thoroughly search and critical he be apparently of about thirty-five year of age a little above the medium height with a broad forehead over which fine brown hair cluster in careless fold he wear he beard and mustache long the former extend to a point a few inch below the throat he eye be brown large and full of expression while in conversation and a mild and melancholy smile occasionally steal over he feature he manners and conversation betoken refinement and take he all in all he be the last man one would have ever take for a smuggler or a pirate captain lane become very much interested in he and gradually they conversation take a wider range in the midst of it and before they have fully complete they business arrangement in relation to the passenger whom captain lane have engage to convey to the united state the mate knock at the cabin door and inform they that a heavy squall be rise to westward they hurry on deck which no sooner have they reach than the stranger look hastily in the quarter indicate shake captain lane warmly by the hand say : i must go aboard captain that will be a heavy squall keep I in sight if you can but if we part company meet I off cape

over the side than the captain give order to shorten sail he take in royal and topgallant sail furl the course trysail and jib and double-reefed the topsail they brace the yard a little to starboard haul the foretopmast staysail sheet well aft and the captain think he have everything snug stand look over the weather rail watch the approach squall the wind have almost die away and the atmosphere seem strangely oppressive captain lane be a old sea-dog and have witness many strange phenomenon on the ocean but never have he see a squall approach so singularly it seem to move very slowly -- a great black cloud which look intensely luminous withal and yet so dense and heavy that a ordinary observer might have mistake it for one of the ordinary rain squall encounter in the tropics captain lane consult he barometer and find it fall rapidly clew the topsail up shout the captain to the mate all hand lay aloft and furl they the order be quickly obey and just as the sailor reach the deck the squall strike they it do not come as it be expect it have work up from the westward but strike the _ ocean star _ dead from the south in a instant they be over nearly on they beam end and a heavy sea rush over the lee-rail fill the deck hard up you helm shout the captain and spring aft he find the helmsman jam under the tiller and the second mate vainly endeavor to heave it up take hold with he by they unite effort they at last succeed and after a moment 's suspense the _ ocean star _ slowly wear off before the wind and rise out of the water shake herself like a affright spaniel and dart off with fearful speed before the hurricane leave order to keep she steady before it the captain go forward to ascertain the extent of the damage they have sustain it be now intensely dark the rain fall in torrent and lightning bolt strike the water all around they accompany by fearful and incessant peal of thunder a human voice could not have be hear five pace away the wind which fairly roar through the shroud and the deluge of water upon the deck be enough of themselves to drown any voice by flash of lightning the captain soon ascertain that they be comparatively unharmed and they spar be safe gather he frightened crew and officer about he he succeed at length in free the deck of water by knock out the port on either side they next sound the pump and find three foot of water in the well immediately double pump be rig and the steady clinking of brake add to the noise and terror of the scene it be a fearful night and captain lane pray heaven that he might never see such another about half a hour after the squall first strike they -- the captain of the _ ocean star _ be stand with he two officer on the quarter-deck con the vessel by the feel of the wind and rain keep she dead before the gale -- when there come a flash and a peal which make they cower almost to the deck my god be the simultaneous exclamation of all a long chain of lightning and a heavy ball of fire seem to shoot from the sky lighting up the whole sea reveal and at the same time striking in its descent a full-rigged brig which like themselves be scud before the gale under bare pole a few cable ' length off they port beam the next instant a fearful explosion hear loud above the roar storm shake the sea a volume of flame and fire shoot up in the air and when they look again for the vessel in the flash of lightning it be nowhere to be see as the morning break the gale abate and settle into a light breeze from the eastward they make all sail and stand to the southward with the wind abeam hope to fall in with some survivor of the wreck captain lane change he wet garment for something more comfortable refresh himself with a strong cup of coffee and take he glass seek the foretopsail yard about seven bell he think he discover some object in the water three or four point off the lee bow hail the deck to keep off for it he very soon make out fragment of a vessel -- spar water cask piece of deck and as they come still nearer a boat but the captain even from he lofty perch could see no sign of any one in it descend to the deck he order a boat to be clear away and run as near as he dare to the wreck he back he maintopsail and take a long and earnest survey with he glass all hand be watch with anxious eye the expression on the captain 's face he hand he glass to the mate who carefully examine every fragment which appear above water the captain look at the mate inquiringly but neither say a word the mate hand back the glass and shake he head sorrowfully again the captain look long and earnestly the mate look again and again return the glass : poor fellow -- we may as well fill away sir he say sadly there be still considerable sea on and the mere launching of a boat be attend with more than ordinary danger add to which be that to be encounter from the broken spar and fragment of wreck drift about captain lane thought of all these danger and be about to give the order to fill away the main-yard when something seem to say to he : _ there be some one in that boat _ this impression be so strong that he feel as if it would be murder to leave the spot without make a more minute search and he order the boat to be lower at once jump into the stern sheet four good oar well man soon bring he within the little field of fragment in the center of which the boat be float no wonder none of the crew be leave -- the water literally swarm with shark stand in the bow with a boat hook the captain ward off piece of wreck and gradually make he way to the strange boat the sight there which meet he eye captain lane never forget to he die day when bow down with old age and he feeble step be totter on the verge of the grave that scene come to he as vividly as on that terrible day lie in the bottom of the boat be the burnt blacken and bruise form of a man which with some difficulty the captain recognize as the handsome stranger who have visit he on the previous evening cling to he with she arm clasp tightly around he mutilate form a clasp which even death could not break she fair face press close to he blacken feature be the lifeless body of the most beautiful woman captain lane have ever see the look of agony of commiseration of tenderness of pity of horror and despair which be seal upon those lifeless feature be beyond the power of description but the saddest spectacle of all be a child a little girl about one year old clinging frantically to the breast of she dead mother and gaze silently at they in frightened wonder for year captain lane 's eye have not be dim with tear but now the fountain of grief be open up and he cheek be wet he carefully enter the boat feel of each cold body lay he hand upon each silent heart and wait in vain for a answering signal to he touch upon the pulse it be all over he say and sit down in the stern sheet of the boat he take the child in he arm and send he man back for sheet and shot and palm and needle and prayer-book they shall have christian burial declare the kind-hearted captain they go away and leave he alone with the dead and the baby the infant seem to cling to he from that moment and the great father above alone know how strangely and rapidly those cord of love be cement between the bluff old bachelor sea-captain and the infant that heart which he have think dead to all love since the awful day on board the english merchantman when he see the only be he ever love die be suddenly thrill by the tenderest emotion those sweet blue eye be upturn to he face with a glance of implore trust and the captain cry : yes blow my eye if i do not stand by you little one as long as there be a stitch of canvas leave the time be very short until he man return wrap the dead in one shroud and wind sheet with heavy shot well secure at they foot the captain put the little child 's lip to its mother 's give she a unconscious kiss which cause the man to brush they rough sleeve across they weather-beaten eye then read with a broken voice the last service for the dead the shroud be close and the opening water receive they and bear they away to they last rest place jump into he boat with the little stranger nestle in he arm captain lane be soon aboard the _ ocean star _ and with a fair wind and sunny sky be once more homeward bind the captain seem loath to relinquish he little charge there be a goat on the vessel which furnish milk and the cook prepare some dainty food for the little stranger what be she name captain he ask while feed the hungry child she be not old enough to know she name and there be not find about she clothes or in the boat anything whatever by which she name could possibly be know so she have to be rechristen what name should he give she he reflect a moment and then remember the name on the stern of that black mysterious vessel answer : morgianna morgianna say the cook yes morgianna lane she be my adopt daughter the cook smile at the thought of bluff old captain lane the bachelor have a adopt daughter after the peril and excitement of such a night it be not strange that captain lane sleep long and soundly he have good officer and when he retire he give they order not to disturb he unless absolutely necessary until he should awake they obey the injunction to the letter and on the follow morning he be awaken by hear one of the crew ask in a undertone of the steward how be little morgianna this morning little morgianna he say to himself and then it all come back and with it a strangely tender dream which have all night long haunt he slumber the captain rise hurriedly dress himself and inquire for the child who have be resign to the care of the cook she be bring to he a bright cheerful little thing just begin to lisp unintelligible word for a few day she miss she mother and wear a look of expectation on she infantile face occasionally cry out but anon this pass away and she become cheerful and happy the captain spend as much of he time with she as he could spare from he duty and as he hold the little creature on he knee hear she gentle voice in baby accent and feel she warm baby finger on he cheek a new emotion take possession of he heart he love little morgianna dearly as a father might before that voyage be over captain lane resolve to abandon the sea and retire to he fine estate at mariana a village on the seashore not a score of mile from baltimore he keep he intention a secret until the vessel be in port then the merchant with whom he have be engage in business for year be astounded to learn that captain lane have make he last voyage a nurse be engage for little morgianna and the great mansion house on the hill within a fourth of a mile of mariana be fit up for habitation servant be send to the place and the villager be lose in wonder the gossip have food for conjecture for week and many be the strange story afloat some of the old dame think the captain be go to be marry after all then the young widow and ancient maiden who have hear much about captain lane sigh and look disconsolate every kind of a story but the truth be afloat when on one bright autumnal day a carriage from baltimore be see to dash into the village and roll up the great drive between the row of poplar it be whisper he have come one who watch aver that only the captain and a child not over a year and a half old alight from the coach -lrb- the nurse come in another vehicle -rrb- the child start another rumor she be a mysterious unknown factor and the gossip bandy the captain 's name about in a reckless manner good old dame shake they

morgianna grow in beauty intelligence grace and goodness captain lane be proud of she and she be never so happy as when sit on he knee listen to he yarn of the sea she own sad dark story have never be tell to she -- that be leave for the future chapter iii jeffersonianism there be not a man of intelligence in america or europe who have not hear of the democratic party in america that great political organization which have be in existence almost if not quite one hundred year many who claim allegiance to this great party know little of its tenet and still fewer know its history there be orator on the stump in the hall of congress writer for the press all advocate the glorious principle of democracy who have never thoroughly acquaint themselves with its history the democratic party of to-day be originally know as the republican party the warm discussion on the national constitution engender party spirit in the new republic which speedily assume definite form and title first as federalist and anti-federalist which name be change to federalist and republican or democrat the federalist party head by alexander hamilton favor much concentration of power in a national government but perhaps not more than we have to-day and in fact not more than be really essential to the upbuilding of a stable republic like ours there can be no question but that washington hold to the same view but washington be the only great man america ever produce who rise so far above political party as to absorb they all he have never be class as belong to either party the republican or democratic party favor state sovereignty and the diffusion of power among the people the american people have have such bitter experience with monarch that they dread anything which savor of monarchy and it be argue that a centralized government be but a step in that direction on the other hand federalist point out the danger of state sovereignty which would surely in the end disrupt the general government subsequent history have prove that the federalist be right we have say that washington be a federalist at heart he enemy meanly jealous of he popularity often declare that he be a monarchist meanwhile a revolution violent in its nature and far-reaching in its consequence have break out in france it be the immediate consequence of the teaching of the american revolution the people of france have long endure almost irresponsible despotism and be yearning for freedom when the french officer and soldier who have serve in america during the latter year of we struggle for independence return to they country full of republican idea and aspiration they question the right of the few to oppress the many and the public heart be soon stir by new idea and in a movement that follow lafayette be conspicuous for a while the king like many tyrant be weak and vacillate and soon a body call the states-general assume the rein of government while the king be in fact a prisoner the terrible bastile whose history represent royal despotism be assail by the citizen of pari and pull down the privilege of the nobility and clergy be abolish and the church property be seize the king 's brother and many of the noble flee in affright across the frontier and try to induce other sovereign to take up the cause of royalty in france and restore the former order of thing the emperor of austrium -lrb- brother of the french queen -rrb- and the king of prussium enter into a treaty to that effect at pilnitz in 1791 when this treaty become known war at once follow robespierre and other self-constituted leader in pari hold sway for a while and the most frightful massacre of noble and priest ensue the weak and unfortunate king who have accept constitution after constitution be now depose and a republic be establish affair have assume the nature of anarchy and blood and lafayette and other moderate man disappear from the arena the king be try on charge of invite foreigner to invade france be find guilty and be behead in January 1793 he queen soon share a like fate the english troops send to flander be call to fight the french for the ruler of france have declare war against great britain spain and holland in February thoma jefferson who enter washington 's cabinet in 1789 have just return from france where he have witness the uprising of the people against they oppressor regard the movement as kindred to the late uprising of he own countryman against great britain it enlist he warmest sympathy and he expect to find the bosom of the people of the united state glowing with feeling like he own he be sadly disappointed washington be wisely conservative he wisdom see that the cruelty of the anarchist of pari be not patriotism but the worst sort of despotism the society of new york in which some of the leaven of toryism yet linger chill jefferson he become suspicious of all around he for he regard the indifference of the people to the struggle of the french they old ally as a evil omen though the tory of new york be cool toward the french republic from far different motive than washington yet the same cause be attribute to both jefferson have scarcely take he seat as secretary of state in washington 's first cabinet before he declare that some of he colleague hold decidedly monarchical view and the belief become fix in he mind that there be a party in the united state continually at work secretly and sometimes openly for the overthrow of american republicanism the idea become a monomania with jefferson from which he never recover till he death more than thirty year afterward jefferson soon rally under he standard a large party of sympathizer with the french revolutionist regard hamilton as the head and front of the monarchical party he profess to believe that the financial plan of that statesman be design to enslave the people and that the rights and liberty of the state and of individual be in danger on the other hand hamilton regard the national constitution as inadequate in strength to perform its required function and believe its weakness to be its greatest defect with this idea jefferson take issue he charge he political opponent and especially hamilton with corrupt and anti-republican design selfish motive and treacherous intention and so be inaugurate that system of personal abuse and vituperation which have ever be a disgrace to the press and political leader of this country bitter partisan quarrel now prevail in which jefferson and hamilton be the chief actor the populace be greatly excite the republican who hate the british intensely call the federalist the british party and the federalist call they opponent the french party the jeffersonian hail with joy the news of the death of the french king and applaud the declaration of war against england and holland forget the friendship which the latter have show for american during the struggle for independence amid all this uproar which proceed from he cabinet only washington remain calm no other american at that day nor since could have remain neutral and guide the ship of state through such breaker of discontent he be the safe middle water between the dangerous reef of concentration and state sovereignty have not the federal party be the victim of many unfortunate circumstance it would certainly in time have become popular in the nation it be beyond question washington 's party and notwithstanding the false charge of monarchism and british sovereignty it be patriotic have it exist forty or fifty year longer until that incubus which haunt jefferson 's brain have pass away and the republic become so firmly establish that people would no longer fear british dependency the federal party would have be a firmly fix institution have federal idea be fully inculcate instead of jeffersonianism and calhounism the rebellion of 1861 would not have occur but aaron burr murder hamilton the friend of washington the bright genius of american politics and the hope of the federal party and the federalist be leave without any great leader when the war of 1812 come the federalist be so embittered against the democrat then in power that they become lukewarm and throw so many obstacle in the way of the patriot who be make the second fight for freedom as to almost confirm the suspicion that they be the friend of great britain rather than america this forever blighted the federal party in the year 1800 thoma jefferson be elect the third president of the united state and the first of democratic proclivity although the city of washington the great american capital have be lay out on a magnificent scale in 1791 and george washington with masonic ceremony lay the corner-stone of the capitol building in 1793 the seat of government be not remove there until the year 1800 the site for the city be a dreary one at the time when the seat of government be first move there only a path lead through a alder swamp on the line of the present pennsylvanium avenue be the way of communication between the president 's house and the capitol for a while the executive and legislative officer of the government be compel to suffer many privation in the fall of 1800 oliver wolcott write : there be one good tavern about forty rod from the capitol and several house be build or erect but i do not see how the member of congress can possibly secure lodgings unless they will consent to live like scholar in a college or monk in a monastery crowd ten or twenty in one house the only resource for such as wish to live comfortably will be find in georgetown three mile distant over as bad a road in winter as the clay grounds near hartford there be in fact but few house in any one place and most of they be small miserable hut which present a awful contrast to the public building the people be poor and as far as i can judge live like fish by eat each other you may look in any direction over a extent of ground nearly as large as the city of new york without see a fence or any object except brick kiln and temporary hut for laborer there be no industry society or business on march 4 1801 thoma jefferson be inaugurate and commence he first term under favorable auspices he be then fifty-eight year of age -- a tall bony man with grizzled sandy hair and rather slovenly dress -- a man who practice he democratic simplicity in all thing and sometimes carry it to extreme a senator writing of he in 1802 say : the next day after my arrival i visit the president accompany by some democratic member in a few moment after we arrival a tall high-boned man come into the room he be dress or rather undressed in a old brown coat red waistcoat old corduroy smallclothe much soil woollen hose and slipper without heel i think he a servant when general varnum surprise I by announce it be the president in brief mr jefferson outline he policy as follow in a letter to nathaniel macon : 1 levee be do make away with 2 the first communication to

revolutionary tory in any of he office jame madison be mr jefferson 's secretary of state henry dearborn be secretary of war and levus lincoln attorney-general jefferson retain mr adam 's secretary of the treasury and navy until the follow autumn when albert gallatin a naturalized foreigner be appoint to the first name office and robert smith to the second the president early resolve to reward he political friend when he come to revise the agency in every department three day after he inauguration he write to colonel monroe i have firmly refuse to follow the counsel of those who have desire the give of office to some of the federalist leader in order to reconcile i have give and will give only to republican under exist circumstance the doctrine ever since act upon that to the victor belong the spoil be then practically promulgate from the fountain-head of government patronage and with a cabinet wholly democratic when congress meet in December 1801 and with the minor office fill with he political friend mr jefferson begin he presidential career of eight year ' duration in he inaugural address he say every difference of opinion be not a difference of principle we have call by different name brethren of the same principle we be all federalist -- we be all republican vigor and enlighten view mark he course so that even he political enemy be compel to confess he foresight and

jefferson come almost to have a wholesome dose of he doctrine of state sovereignty exemplify a convention of federalist be call at boston in 1804 in which a proposition of secession be make fortunately however there be too much patriotism in the body for the proposition to carry and the government be save chapter iv british cruiser the peace of 1783 between the united state and great britain have be extort by the necessity rather than obtain by the good will of england though by a formal treaty the united state be declare free and independent they be still hate in great britain as rebellious colony that such be the general opinion be manifest from the letter of john adam we first minister to the court of st jame and from other authentic contemporary account of course there be a few man of sufficiently enlarged and comprehensive mind to forget the past and urge even in parliament that the trade of america would be more valuable as a ally than a dependent but the number of these be small indeed the common sentiment in england toward the young republic be one of scornful detestation we be despise as provincial we be hate as rebel in the permanency of we institution there be scarce a believer in all britain this be especially the case prior to the adoption of the federal constitution both in parliament and out it be publicly boast that the union would soon fall to piece and that find they inability to govern themselves the different state would one by one supplicate to be receive back as colony this vain and empty expectation long linger in the popular mind and be not wholly eradicate until after the war of 1812 consequently the new republic be treat with arrogant contempt one of the first act of john adam as minister to england have be to propose place the navigation and trade between the dominion of great britain and the territory of the united state on a basis of complete reciprocity by accede to such a measure england might have gain much and could have lose but little the proposal be reject almost with term of insult and mr adam be sternly inform that a no other would be entertain the consequence be that the free negro of jamaica and other of the poorer inhabitant of the british west indium island be reduce to starvation by be deprive of they usual supplies from the united state this unreasonable policy on the part of england naturally exasperate the american and one of the first act of the federal government in 1789 be to adopt retaliatory measure a navy law be pass which have since be the foundation of all we treaty of reciprocity with england a protective tariff be also adopt as another means of retaliation in these measure the united state be a young nation with unlimited territory have everything to gain and england all to lose great britain be first to tire of restrictive measure and by a repeal on she part invite a repeal on ours in another way great britain exasperate the popular feeling here against she and even force the american government once or twice to the verge of war by the treaty of peace all military post hold by england within the limit of the united state be to be give up michilimacinac detroit oswegotche point au fer and dutchman 's point be long hold in defiance of the compact these post become the center of intrigue among the savage of the northwest arm be here distribute to the indian and disturbance on the american frontier be foment the war on the miamus which be bring to a bloody close by wayne 's victory be principally the result of such secret machination in short england regard the treaty of 1783 as a truce rather than a pacification and long hold to the hope of be able yet to punish the colony for they rebellion in two celebrated letter write by john adam from great britain he use the follow decide language in reference to the secret design of england : if she can bind holland in she shackle and france from internal dissension be unable to interfere she will make war immediately against we this be in 1787 two year before he have express the same idea they present system as far as i can penetrate it he write be to maintain a determine peace with all europe in order that they may war singly against america if they should think it necessary a sentiment of such relentless hostility which no attempt be make to disguise but which be arrogantly parade on every occasion could not fail to exasperate those feeling of dislike on the part of america which protracted war have engender this mutual hatred between the two nation arise from the enmity of the people rather than of the cabinet there be too much reason to believe write we minister that if the nation have another hundred million to spend they would soon force the ministry into another war with we on the side of the united state it require all the prudence of washington sustain by he hold on the affection of the people to restrain they from a war with england after that power have refuse to surrender the military post a third element of discord arise when england join the coalition against france in 1793 the course which the former have pursue for the precede ten year have as we have see tend to alienate the people of america from she and nourish sentiment of hostility in they bosom on the other hand france with that address for which she be eminent have labor to heighten the good feeling already exist between herself and the united state a treaty of alliance and commerce bind the two country but the courteous demeanor of france cement we to she by still stronger tie those of popular will before the revolution break out in paris the enthusiasm of america toward france could scarce be control there can be no doubt that if the subsequent excess have not alarm all prudent friend of liberty the people of this country could not have be restrain from engage in the struggle between france and england but the reign of terror back by the insolence of citizen genet the minister of the french republic and afterward by the exaction of the directory check the headlong enthusiasm that otherwise would have embroil we in the terrible war of that period in he almost more than human wisdom washington have select a course of strict neutrality from which public enthusiasm nor fear of loss of public favor could swerve he he course be wise and proper for the still weak confederacy and every day be productive of event which show the wisdom of this decision neither great britain nor france however be gratify by this neutrality each nation wish the aid of the american and become arrogant and insulting when they find the resolution of the american unbroken napoleon on the part of france see the impolicy of such treatment and when he become first consul he hasten to abandon it but england relax little or nothing circumstance moreover make she conduct more irritating than that of france and hence prolonged and increase the exasperation feel toward she in america as a great naval power the policy of england have be to maintain certain maritime law which she jurist claim to be part of the code of nation and enforce in she admiralty court one principle of these law be this that warlike munitions must become contraband in war in other word that a neutral vessel can not carry such into the enemy 's port hence if a vessel sailing under the flag of the united state should be capture on the high sea bind for france during the prevalence of a war between that power and england and be find to be laden with ship-timber or other manufacture or unmanufactured article for warlike purpose the vessel would by the law of nation become a prize to the captor the right to condemn a ship carry such contraband goods have always be recognize by civilized nation and indeed it be found in common justice england however have supreme control at sea and be tempt by the hope of destroy the sinew of she adversary 's strength resolve to stretch this rule so as to embrace provision as well as munitions of war she proceed gradually to she point she first issue a order on the 8th of June 1793 for capture and bring into port all vessel laden wholly or in part with corn flour or meal and destine to france or to other country if occupy by the arm of that nation such vessel be not condemn nor they cargo seize but the latter be to be purchase on behalf of the english government or if not then the vessel on give due security be allow to proceed to any neutral port of course the price of provision in france and in england be materially different and a lucrative traffic for the united state be in this way destroy moreover this proceeding be a comparative novelty in the law of nation and however it might suit the purpose of great britain it be a gross outrage on america in November of the same year it be follow by a still more glaring infraction of the rights of neutral in a order condemn to capture and adjudication all vessel laden with the produce of any french colony or with supplies for such a colony the fermentation in consequence of this order rise to such a height in america that it require all the skill of washington to avert a war the president however determine to preserve peace if possible despatched jay to london as a minister plenipotentiary by whose frank explanation redress be in a measure obtain for the past and a treaty negotiate not indeed adequate to justice but better than could be obtain again when it expire in 1806 the relaxation in the rigor of the order of November 1793 soon prove to be more nominal than real and from 1794 until the peace of amien in 1802 the commerce of the united state continue to be the prey of british cruiser and privateer after the renewal of the war the fury of the belligerent increase and with it the stringent measure adopt by napoleon and great britain the french emperor boldly avow he intention to crush england forbid by a series of decree issue from berlin milan and rambouillet the importation of she commodity into any part of europe under he control and england equally sweeping in she act declare all such port in a state of blockade thus render any neutral vessel liable to capture which should attempt to enter they the legality of a blockade where there be not a naval power off the coast competent to maintain such blockade have always be deny by the lesser maritime power its effect in the present instance be virtually to exclude the united state from foreign commerce in these extreme measure napoleon and england be equally censured but the policy of the latter affect the american far more than the former the exasperation against great britain become extreme and pervade the whole community that against france be slighter and confine to the more intelligent napoleon be first to begin these outrage on the rights of neutral but he injustice be practically feel only on land while england be first to introduce the paper blockade a measure ruinous to american merchant this be finally do on may 16 1806 when great britain announce a blockade of the coast river and port from the river elbe to the port of brest inclusive on the 21st of November of the same year napoleon in retaliation issue a decree from berlin place the british island in a state of blockade this decree be follow by a still more stringent order in council on the part of england it now become necessary for the united state either to engage in a war or to withdraw she commerce from the ocean the popular voice demand the former course though france be in the abstract as unjust as england she oppressive measure do not affect american commerce and hence the indignation of the people be direct chiefly against great britain but with the president it be different though he sympathy be with france he judgment be against she as well as england in he maturer wisdom he could now appreciate the great good sense of washington 's neutrality besides the grand old man thoma jefferson be determine to preserve peace for it be he favorite maxim that the best war be more fatal than the worst peace a further reason lead he to refuse the alternative of war he be not without hope that one or both of the belligerent would return to reason and repeal the obnoxious act if the conduct of the united state instead of be aggressive should be patient actuate by these view the president recommend to congress the passage of a embargo act a embargo law be enact in December 1807 by it all american vessel abroad be call home and those in the united state be prohibit from leave port in consequence of this measure the commerce of the country be annihilate in a hour and harbor once flourish and prosperous soon become only resort for rot ship there can be no question now that the embargo be a serious blunder it cripple the american resource for the war that ensue make the eastern state hostile to jefferson 's as well as he successor 's administration and tend to foster in the mind of the populace at large a idea that we shrink from a contest with great britain in consequence of inherent weakness there be a fourth and last cause of exasperation against england which assist more than all the rest to produce the war of 1812 this be the british claim to the right of impressment in the terrible struggle in which england find herself engage with france she maritime force be she chief dependence and accordingly she increase the number of she ship unprecedentedly but it soon become difficult to man all these vessel the thriving commerce pursue by the united state as early as 1793 draw large number of english seaman into we mercantile marine service where they obtain better wages than on board english vessel by the fiction of she law a man bear a english subject can never throw off this allegiance great britain determine to seize she seaman wherever find and force they to serve she flag in consequence she cruiser stop every american vessel they meet and search the crew in order to reclaim the english scotch or irish on board frequently it happen that person bear in america be take as british subject for where the board officer be judge and jury of a man 's nationality there be little chance of justice especially if the seaman be a promising one or the officer 's ship be short-handed in nine month during part of the year 1796 and 1797 the american minister at the court of london have make application for the discharge of two hundred and seventy-one native bear american prove to have be thus impressed these outrage against personal independence be regard among the great mass of american with the utmost indignation such injury exasperate every soul not make sordid by selfish desire for gain that a innocent man peaceably pursue a honorable vocation should be forcibly carry on board a british man-of-war and there be compel to remain shut out from all hope of ever see he family seem to the robust sense of justice in the popular breast little better than algerian bondage the rage of the people be increase by tale of horror and aggression that occasionally reach they ear from these prison ship story be tell of impressed american escape the ship who on be recapture be whip until they die in one instance a sailor goad to madness seize the captain and spring overboard drown himself and he tormentor every attempt to arrange this difficulty with england have signally fail the united state offer that all american seaman should be register and provide with a certificate of citizenship that the number of crew should be limit by the tonnage of the ship and if this number be exceed british subject enlist should be liable to impressment that deserter should be give up and that a prohibition should be issue by each party against clandestinely secrete and carry off the seaman of the other in 1800 and again in 1806 it be attempt to form treaty in reference to this subject but the pertinacity with which england adhere to she claim frustrated every effort at reconciliation in 1803 the difficulty have nearly be adjust by a convention great britain agree to abandon she claim to impressment on the high sea if allow to retain it on the narrow sea or those immediately surround she island but this be reject as inadmissible by the united state all subsequent effort at a arrangement prove unsuccessful the impressment of seaman continue and be the source of daily increase abuse not only american but dane swede german russian frenchman spaniard and portuguese be seize and forcibly carry off by british men-of-war there be even well attest instance of asiatic and african be thus impressed in short as the war in europe approach its climax seaman become more scarce in the british navy and all decency be throw aside crew be fill up under color of this claim regardless even of the show of justice in 1811 it be compute that the number of man impress from the american marine service amount to not less than six thousand in the spring of 1807 a crisis approach a small british squadron lay in american water near the mouth of the chesapeake bay watch some french frigate blockade at annapoli three of the crew of one of the vessel and one of another have desert and enlist on board the united state frigate _ chesapeake _ lie at the washington navy yard the british minister make a formal demand for they surrender we government refuse compliance because it be ascertain that two of the man be native of the united state and there be strong presumptive evidence that a third be likewise no more be say but the commander of the british squadron take the matter into he own hand the _ chesapeake _ on go to sea on the morning of June 22 1807 be intercept by the british frigate _ leopard _ whose commander hail the commodore and inform he that he have a despatch for he unsuspicious of unfriendliness the _ chesapeake _ be lay to when a british boat bear a lieutenant come alongside barron politely receive he in he cabin when the lieutenant present a demand from the commander of the _ leopard _ that the bearer be allow to muster the crew of the _ chesapeake _ that he might select and carry away the deserter the demand be authorize by instruction receive from vice-admiral berkeley at halifax barron tell the lieutenant that he crew should not be muster except by he own officer when the lieutenant withdraw and the _ chesapeake _ move on have some fear of mischief barron make some preparation to resist but it be too late to prepare to cope with the _ leopard _ which follow close in she wake and the commander call out through he trumpet : commodore barron must be aware that the vice-admiral 's command must be obey the _ chesapeake _ hold on she course although this be repeat the _ leopard _ send two shot athwart she bow these be follow by a broadside pour into the hull of the _ chesapeake _ the american vessel have no priming in she gun be unable to return the fire and after be severely bruise by repeat broadside she surrender to she assailant she crew be muster by the british officer and the deserter carry away one of they a british subject be hang at halifax and the other be american be spare on they consent to enlist in the english navy commodore barron be try on charge of neglect of duty in not be prepare for action find guilty and suspend from the service for five year without pay or emolument on march 4 1809 mr jame madison of virginium succeed mr thoma jefferson as president of the united state he cabinet be robert smith secretary of state albert gallatin secretary of the treasury william eusti secretary of war paul hamilton secretary of the navy and caesar rodney attorney-general there be a powerful party in the nation hostile to he political creed and consequently oppose to he administration and the war with england which seem inevitable french and english nation become more embroil in trouble which increase the trouble between the united state and great britain at last the english government send man-of-war to cruise off the principal port of the united state to intercept american merchant-vessel and send they to england as lawful prize in this business the _ little belt _ a british sloop-of-war be engage off the coast of virginium in the spring of 1811 where on the 16th of April she meet the american frigate _ president _ under captain ludlow bear the broad pennant of commodore rodger commodore rodger be aboard the _ president _ hail the sloop and ask : what sloop be that a cannon-shot be he reply captain ludlow say the commodore we will teach that fellow good manners be you gun in order they be we have be teach a lesson by barron 's mishap train the gun and be ready to fire with a speak trumpet the commodore once more hail the sloop with : what sloop be that this time he be greet with a broadside fire cry the commodore and the cannon of the _ president _ send a broadside of heavy shot against the impudent stranger the conflict last only about ten minute when captain bingham after lose eleven kill and twenty-one wound give a satisfactory answer the vessel part company the _ little belt _ sailing for halifax for repair it be in the year 1809 that the american brig _ dover _ one of the few of american merchant vessel which have manage to escape the ruin of jefferson 's embargo act be sailing among the lesser antille the master-captain parson be a thorough seaman with a heart as big as a ox british cruiser be a greater bugbear to american vessel than pirate and captain parson keep a constant lookout for they on the afternoon of a autumnal day when he find himself becalm off a small island not down on the chart the skipper feel no little uneasiness he pace he

wretched gloomy-looking picture of woe-begone poverty one seldom behold it be no better if they turn for consolation to the rear of the house there they eye fall upon the dirty yard of a dirty inn and the half-covered cowsh where two famishing animal mourn they hard fate as they chew the cud of sweet and bitter fancy in addition they see a old chaise once the yellow postchaise the pride and glory of the establishment now reduce from its wheel and ignominiously degrade to a hen house on the grass-grown roof a cock have take he stand with a air of protective patronage to the feathered inhabitant

objection to have they house blaze they be still somewhat undecided in regard to the matter when they landlady with a movement about as graceful as the waddle of a duck come down the rickety stair and they in despair appeal to she she relieve they of they trouble in short order on a piece of tin over she door be the number 611 she tell they the name of the street and assure they if they would

young man who we fear stare at she rudely they be hardly to be blame for it for she be as near perfection as a girl of sixteen can be tall willowy form with deep blue eye soft as a gazelle 's long silken lash and arched eyebrow with golden hair and so graceful that every movement might be set to music fernando gaze after she until she disappear into a fashionable shop and then utter a sigh start as if from a dream what do you say now old fellow ask sukey let we go home home well back to the widow mahone 's inn all right now let we try to find the trail it be no easy matter although they

ask fernando lane great jehosiphat fernando lane be on that carriage we see cry sukey start suddenly from a couch on which he have be reclining chapter vi war feeling of 1811 mr jame madison seem to have be one of the many great american capable of change he political view without lose public favor mr madison as a delegate to the constitutional convention hold at philadelphium in may 1787 be beyond question a federalist of the convention a writer of the highest authority say : mr madison be prominent in advocate the constitution and take a leading part in the debate of which he keep private note since publish by order of congress he view in regard to the federal government be set forth at length in a paper still extant in the handwriting of gen washington this paper contain the substance of a letter write to washington by mr madison before the meeting of the convention and propose a scheme of thorough centralization the writer declare that he be equally oppose to the individual independence of the state and to ` the consolidation of the whole in one simple republic ' he be nevertheless in favor of invest congress with power to exercise a negative in all case whatever on the legislative act of the state as heretofore exercise by the kingly prerogative he say further that the right of coercion should be expressly declare but the difficulty and awkwardness of operating by force on the collective will of a state render it particularly desirable that the necessity of it should be preclude from these extreme view mr madison afterward conscientiously depart but in the convention he support they with zeal and vigor it be fear at first that madison would perpetuate the policy of jefferson but the tone and temper of he inaugural address deliver march 4th 1809 fall like oil on troubled water he most implacable enemy could not refrain from utter word of approbation and the whole nation entertain hope that he measure might change the gloomy aspect of public affair madison 's administration be now sustain by a larger majority of the american people than that of jefferson have ever be and the federalist or the opposition be in a hopeless minority the continue aggression of the british be increase the democratic strength every day and in 1811 circumstance seem to make war with great britain a imperative necessity for the vindication of the honor rights and independence of the united state the indian tribe on the northwestern frontier of the united state become very uneasy and the machination of british trader and government emissary have stimulate the growth of that discontent into a decidedly hostile feeling toward the nation of republican then press upon the domain of the savage the suspension of the world 's commerce have diminish the amount of they traffic in fur and the rapid extension of american settlement northward of ohio be narrow they hunting grounds and produce a rapid diminution of game the introduction of intoxicate liquor among the savage by white trader and speculator have widely spread demoralization with consequent disease and death english emissary make the savage to believe that all these evil have be bring upon they by the encroachment of the american and in the spring of 1811 it become evident that a league be form among the tribe for the extermination of the frontier settler tecumseh the shawnee chief shrewd crafty and intrepid endeavor to emulate pontiac the great ottowa chief in the formation of a indian confederacy in the northwest for make war upon the united state he have a shrewd twin brother call the prophet whose mysterious incantation and prediction and pretend vision and spiritual intercourse have inspire the savage mind with great veneration for he as a wonderful medicine man he and tecumseh possess almost unbounded influence over the delaware shawnee wyandot miami kickapoo winnebago and chippewa the celebrated shawnee chief tecumseh accord to drake be bear a few year before the revolution at the indian village of piqua on mad river about six mile below the site of springfield clark county ohio he tribe remove from florida about the middle of the last century he father who be a chief fall at the bloody battle of point pleasant in 1774 from he youth he show a passion for war he early acquire a unbounded influence over he tribe for he bravery he sense of justice and he commanding eloquence like he great prototype pontiac humanity be a prominent trait in he character he not only be never know to ill-treat or murder a prisoner but indignantly denounce those who do employ all he authority and eloquence in behalf of the helpless in 1798 tecumseh remove with he follower to the vicinity of white river indiana among the delaware where he remain for a number of year in 1805 through the influence of laulewasikaw the brother of tecumseh a large number of shawnee establish themselves at greeneville very soon after laulewasikaw assume the office of a _ prophet _ and forthwith commence that career of cunning and pretend sorcery which always enable the shrewd hypocrite to sway the ignorant superstitious mind throughout the year of 1806 the brother remain at greeneville and be visit by many indian from different tribe not a few of whom become they follower the prophet dream many wonderful dream and claim to have have many supernatural revelation make he the great eclipse of the sun that occur in the summer of this year a knowledge of which he have by some means attain enable he to carry conviction to the mind of many of he ignorant follower that he be really the earthly agent of the great spirit he boldly announce to the unbeliever that on a certain day he would give they proof of he supernatural power by bring darkness over the sun when the day and hour of the eclipse arrive and the earth even at midday be shroud in the gloom of twilight the prophet standing in the midst of he party significantly point to the heaven and cry out : do i not prophesy truly behold darkness have shroud the sun it may readily be suppose that this striking phenomenon thus adroitly use produce a strong impression on the indian and greatly increase they belief in the sacred character of they prophet in the spring of 1808 tecumseh and the prophet remove to a tract of land on the tippecanoe a tributary of the wabash where the latter continue he effort to induce the indian to forsake they vicious habit while tecumseh be visit the neighbor tribe and quietly strengthen he own and the prophet 's influence over they the event of the early part of the year 1810 be such as to leave but little doubt of the hostile intention of the brother the prophet be apparently the most prominent actor while tecumseh be in reality the mainspring of all the movement back it be suppose by the insidious influence of british agent who supply the indian grati with powder and ball in anticipation perhaps of hostility between the two country in which event a union of all the tribe against the american be desirable tecumseh have oppose the sale and cession of land to the united state and he declare it to be he unalterable resolution to take a stand against the further intrusion of the whites upon the soil of he people so menacing have the indian become in the spring of 1810 that general wh harrison a son of benjamin harrison one of the signer of the declaration of independence and then governor of the territory of indiana invite the brother to a council at vincenne in August tecumseh appear with four hundred well-armed warrior the inhabitant be greatly alarm at this demonstration of savage military power harrison be cool and cautious while the bearing of the chief be bold and haughty he refuse to enter the place appoint for hold the council say : house be build for you to hold council in indian hold theirs in the open air he then take a position under some tree in front of the house and unabashed by the large concourse of white people before he he open the business with a speech mark by great dignity and native eloquence when he have conclude one of the governor 's aid say to he through a interpreter as he point to a chair by the side of general harrison : you father request you to take a seat by he side the chief draw he blanket around he and stand erect say with a scornful tone : my father the sun be my father and the earth be my mother on she bosom i will recline and he seat himself on the ground the chief declare it he intention to form a confederacy for the purpose of prevent any further cession of land to the white people and to recover what have be cede return those land he say and tecumseh will be the friend of the american he like not the english who be continually set the indian on the american the governor reply that the land have be receive from other tribe and that the shawnee have no business to interfere tecumseh spring to he foot cast off he blanket and with violent gesture pronounce the governor 's word false he accuse the united state of cheating and impose upon the indian and then give a sign to he warrior near he they spring to they foot seize they war club and brandish they tomahawk the governor start from he seat and draw he sword while the citizen seize any weapon or missile they could find it be a moment of great peril to the white people a military guard of twelve man under some tree a short distance off be order up a friendly indian who have secretly load he pistol while tecumseh be speak now cock it to shoot the chief the guard be also about to fire when harrison restrain they and prevent a bloody encounter the interpreter whom all the indian respect tell tecumseh that he be a bad man the council be break up tecumseh express regret that he violent temper have get the better of he but prudent man know from he conduct that war be inevitable in the spring of 1811 the hostile savage begin to roam over the wabash region in small party plunder the white settlers and friendly indian soon after the council at vincenne tecumseh go south among the creek to extend the confederacy of the people of indiana among they there be a tradition among the tuckabachee that tecumseh fail to enlist they in he enterprise in he wrath say : when i return to the north i will stamp on the earth and make it tremble when the effect of the earthquake of new madrid be feel the tuckabachee say : tecumseh have reach the north the hostile demonstration on the part of the indian in indiana alarm the people of that territory and general harrison therefore take measure to increase he regular force he warn the indian to obey the treaty at greeneville but at the same time he prepare to break up the prophet 's establishment if necessary in September the prophet send assurance to the governor that he intention be pacific about the same time he dispatch a message to the delaware who be friendly ask they to join he in a war against the united state state that he have take up the tomahawk and would not lay it down but with he life unless they wrong be redress the delaware chief immediately visit the prophet to dissuade he from commence hostility and be grossly insult on the 6th of November 1811 governor harrison with about nine hundred and fifty effective troops compose of two hundred and fifty of the 4th regiment u s infantry one hundred and thirty volunteer and a body of militia be within a mile and a half of the prophet 's town be urge to make a immediate assault upon the village but this he decline as he instruction from the president be positive not to attack the indian as long as there be a probability of they comply with the demand of the government the indian in the course of the day endeavor to cut off he messenger and evince other hostile symptom which determine harrison to at once march upon the town when he be meet by three indian one of they a principal counselor of the prophet who avow that the prophet 's design be pacific accordingly a suspension of hostility be agree upon and the term of peace be to be settle on the follow morning by the governor and the prophet 's chief at night the army encamp about three fourth of a mile from the prophet 's town the governor be well convince of the hostility of the prophet he believe that after attempt to lull he suspicion he intend to make a treacherous attack on the american little anticipation of a night attack be indulge yet every precaution be take to resist one if make all the guard that could be use in such a situation and all such as be use by wayne be employ on this occasion that be camp guard furnish a chain of sentinel around the whole camp at such a distance as to give notice of the approach of a enemy in time for the troops to take they position and yet not far enough to prevent the sentinel from retreat to the main body if overpower the usual mode of station picket guard at a considerable distance in advance of the army or camp would be useless in indian warfare as they do not require road to march upon and such guard would be inevitably cut off order be give in the event of a night attack for each corps to maintain its position at all hazard until relieved or further order be give to it the whole army be keep during the night in the military position call lie on they arm the regular troops lay in they tent with they accoutrements on and they gun at they side the militia have no tent but sleep with they clothes and bullet pouch on and they gun under they to keep they dry the order of the encampment be a line of battle to resist a night attack and so as every man sleep opposite to he post in the line there be nothing for the troops to do in case of a assault but to rise and take they position a few step in the rear of the fire around which they have repose the guard of the night consist of two captain ' command of forty-two man and of four non-commissioned officer each and two subaltern ' guard of twenty man and non-commissioned officer each -- the whole amounting to about one hundred and thirty man under command of a field officer of the day the night be dark and cloudy and after midnight there be a drizzling rain at four o'clock in the morning of nov 7 1811 governor harrison accord to practice have rise preparatory to the call up of the troops and be engage while draw on he boot by the fire in conversation with general well colonel owen and major taylor and hurst the orderly drum have be rouse to sound the reveille for the troops to turn out when there come the report of a sentry 's rifle on the left flank follow by a score of shot and the morning air ring loud with the wild war-whoop of savage in a instant the army be in line the campfire be extinguish and the governor mount he horse and proceed to the point of attack several company have take they place in the line within forty seconds after the report of the first gun and in two minute the whole army be ready for action a fact as creditable to they own activity and bravery as to the skill and energy of they officer the battle soon become general and be maintain on both side with signal and even desperate valor the indian advance or retreat by the aid of a rattle noise make with deer hoof and persevere in they treacherous attack with a apparent determination to conquer or die on the spot the battle rage with unabated fury and mutual slaughter until daylight when a gallant and successful charge by the troops drive the enemy into the swamp and put a end to the conflict prior to the assault the prophet have give he follower assurance that in the come contest the great spirit would render the arm of the american unavail that they bullet would fall harmless at the foot of the indian that the latter should have light in abundance while the former would be involve in thick darkness avail himself of the privilege confer by he peculiar office and perhaps unwilling in he own person to test the rival power of a sham prophecy and a real american bullet he prudently take a position on a adjacent eminence and when the action begin he enter upon the performance of certain mystic rite at the same time sing a war song soon after the engagement commence he be inform that he man be fall he tell they to fight on it would soon be as he predict and then in wilder and louder strain he inspiring battle song be hear commingle with the sharp crack of the rifle and the shrill war-whoop of he brave but delude follower some of the indian who be in the conflict subsequently inform the agent at fort wayne that there be more than a thousand warrior in the battle and that the number of wound be unusually great in the precipitation of they retreat they leave thirty-eight on the field some be bury during the engagement in they town other no doubt subsequently die of they wound drake place they number in kill at not less than fifty of the whites thirty-five be kill in the action and twenty-five die subsequently the total number of kill and wound be one hundred and eighty-eight -- probably as great and possibly greater than the loss of the indian among the slay be colonel abraham owen and major joseph hamilton davy of kentucky though the battle of tippecanoe consider as a conflict from the loss on each side would to-day be regard only as a skirmish yet it have a great moral influence in restrain the savage in the northwest and but for the meddling of the british agent a permanent peace with the indian could have be establish harrison burn the prophet 's town the prophet lose caste with he people when reproach for he falsehood he cunningly tell they that he prediction have fail of fulfilment because during he incantation he wife touch the sacred vessel and break the charm he follower superstitious as they be would not accept such a flimsy excuse and desert he fly to secure hiding-place where the white man could not find they after he town be burn the prophet take shelter among the wyandot the event in the northwest arouse a war spirit among the patriotic american which could not be suppress not only do british emissary incite the indian to make war but british order in council continue to be vigorously enforce insult be offer to the american flag by british cruiser and the press of great britain insolently declare that the american could not be kick into a war forbearance cease to be a virtue it become cowardice president madison find himself the standard-bearer of he party surround by irrepressible young warrior eager for fight like a cautious commander he sound a careful war note in he annual message to congress at the beginning of November 1811 the young and ardent member of the house of representative who have elect henry clay then thirty-four year

which god have place within we reach the sovereignty and independence of these state purchase and sanctify by the blood of we father from whom we receive they not for ourselves only but as the inheritance of we posterity be deliberately and systematically violate and the period have arrive when in the opinion of you committee it be the sacred duty of congress to call forth the patriotism and the resource of the country by the aid of these and with the blessing of god we confidently trust we shall be able to procure that redress which have be seek for by justice by remonstrance and forbearance in vain the report go over the land as fast as the mail in that day of stage coach could carry it and make a profound impression on the mind of the people resolution draw in accordance

flutter lord kildee soon have he under he care and introduce he to some friend among they lieutenant matson who have early in the evening make so many unsuccessful attempt to attract miss lane 's favorable notice that fernando have come to regard he as a dangerous rival despite the injunction of the fair morgianna he find himself half unconsciously quaff three or four glass to the good health of somebody he really do not know whether it be king george or president jefferson fernando naturally witty soon ingratiated himself into this well occupy clique and he dose they with glory to they heart 's content he resolve at once to enter into they humor and as the wine mount up to he brain he gradually find he acquaintance and politics extend to every country and political creed do you know thoma matson of he majesty 's ship _ spit-fire _ ask the lieutenant tom matson cry fernando indeed i do sir and do still and there be not a man in the british navy i be prouder of know of course he have never hear of thoma matson until this moment you do not say sir say the lieutenant in astonishment have he any chance of promotion sir promotion cry fernando in well-feigned astonishment why have you not hear that he be already in command of a ship you can not possibly have hear from he lately or you would have know that that be true sir i have not hear from he since he quit the _ black cloud _ in the south i think they say for he health but how do he get the step why as to the promotion that be remarkable enough say fernando quaff off a tumbler of champagne to aid he inventive faculty but fernando despite he native shrewdness and wonderful inventive power be liable to get into trouble he know as little about a ship as a landlubber might be suppose to know and he companion see at once that he would make a mess of the story so he come to he rescue by inform the assembly that a fine vocalist at the other end of the room be go to sing and ask that the story be defer until after the song they all hurry away save fernando who overcome by too deep potation sink upon a sofa temporarily unconscious he be rouse from he stupor by he companion shake he and say : fernando I boy it be a divil 's own mess ye be makin ' of this wake up and get out he rouse himself and look about the room they be in be a small apartment off the great saloon and through the half-open folding-door he could see that the festivity still continue the music and gay form of dancer remind he where he be fernando we have play this game jist as long as we can successfully we have better go i be ready and fernando get up and start diagonally across the room step with he foot very wide apart the pretended lord kildee take he arm and they get to the door where fernando miss he footing and go tumble down the step in a very undignified manner he lordship kildee have imbibe rather freely himself keep he company and for a few seconds they remain at the bottom of the flight divide they time between study astronomy and the law of gravitation fernando have badly smash the captain 's chapeau and one fine plume be go they have not go far before they run upon a watchman who threaten to run they in but the police of those day be as susceptible to a bribe as they be to-day and after donate liberally to the cause of justice and protection they be take to they room instead of the calaboose young steven have no definite recollection of how he ever get to bed but he awake next morning with a wretched headache and find himself in a red coat with the epaulet and gold lace of a officer by degree the whole thing come back to he terrence come in a few moment later a smile on he face as he remark they be in the divil 's own scrape why ask fernando we should have take the clothes back to the captain fernando who be in total ignorance of the manner in which the uniform be procured ask : how do you get they terrence tell he the whole story and fernando despite he wretched headache laugh until the tear course down he cheek that be not all I foine boy the whole thing be out the papers print this morning be full of it they say the captain be see just before daylight goin ' down the street to he boat with a sheet wrap about he again the youngster roar it be such a madcap frolic as student utterly reckless of consequence might engage in but after all it be a serious affair the clothes have to be return then the perpetrator of the outrage would be know at the college and they might be expel from the institution in disgrace the clothes be return that be a point of honor which fernando insist upon as he would neither agree to steal or wear steal goods for a day or two he be indispose and good honest sukey be afraid he friend be go to be real sick on the evening of the second day after they madcap frolic fernando tell sukey all about it and ask he advice after the tall young westerner have hear he through he say : well fernando i be sorry you be in the game at all but you be in it and now the best thing be to go to the college and make a clean breast of it to the president it be you first you know and then a fellow just from the wood like we be liable to stumble into bad scrape make a clean breast of it and keep out of such game in the future this be really the best advice that could have be give and fernando after consult terrence decide to follow it consequently they all three present themselves to the president of the faculty and in the best way they could lay the story before he terrence bring all the pathos and eloquence which he naturally possess to the aid of he friend and get both of they off pretty well the old professor be one of the best-hearted man in the world and when he come to contemplate the lonely condition of the boy so far from home he forgive they freely and fernando go out of he presence resolve never to be guilty of another unseemly trick again now if that divil 's own ship the _ xenophon _ would only lave port i would fale better remark terrence as they wend they way to they room fernando could not see any harm the _ xenophon _ could do they the president of the college have forgive they and surely they need not care for the ship the student enter ardently into they study and fernando try to forget everything about the mayor 's ball save the beautiful face of morgianna lane she be the only sweet picture in that wild dream and he would not have forget she for the world time wear slowly on a week have pass and all the papers in the country be nagging the captain about go to he vessel in a wind sheet a wag write some verse which must have be galling to the pride of the haughty briton at last it leak out that two student have play the trick on captain conkerall a newspaper reporter come to see fernando who give he a truthful history of the affair you have play the divil now say terrence when he read the interview in the next issue of the _ baltimore sun _ why never moind fernando i 'll not desert ye and if my one come to ye about satisfaction or inything of the kind and ask you to mintion you frind sind thim to terrence malone and he will make the arrangement that be all fernando have no more idea what he mean than if he have address he in hindoo and he give the matter little or no further thought he be in he room pore over he book the second day after the interview when there come a rap at he door come in he cry in he broad western fashion the door open and to he surprise a young english officer enter the apartment be this mr fernando steven he ask politely it be i be the bearer of a message from lieutenant matson pray who be lieutenant matson of he majesty 's ship the _ xenophon _ fernando think he must be mistake as he have not the least recollection of ever hearing of lieutenant matson but the ensign assure he that he be the person with whom the lieutenant have to deal and then ask if he could refer he to some friend with whom the business might be arrange then the youthful american remember terrence malone 's strange instruction and send the ensign at once to the young irishman just how terrence would settle the matter he do not know but he who have such remarkable ability for get one into a scrape could surely devise some means to get he out and fernando be perfectly willing to trust he so deem the matter wholly settle he sit down to he book once more and have actually forget the officer when terrence bolt into the room he face expressive of anxiety it be all arrange I boy ye do right in lavin ' it to I the young britisher and i have make all arrangement arrangement what arrangement ask fernando with guileless innocence arrangement for the meeting to be sure what meeting meeting with lieutenant matson throw down he book fernando start up impatiently say : i do not want to meet the infernal lieutenant i think you have settle it so i do and right dacintly too now what weapon do ye want weapon cry fernando the truth at last begin to dawn upon he great heaven terrence do you mean a duel certainly I frind nothin ' ilse there be no way to get out of it honorably fernando reel as if he have be strike a blow he have read of duel but in the solitude of he western home on the farm he have never know of any they be the bloody invention of more polite civilization one have be fight between two trapper at a trading post not over forty mile away in which rifle at thirty pace be use and both man be kill the preacher have say it be murder fernando be brave but he shrink from a duel and it be not until he pride have be appeal to that he determine to fight then terrence assure he the lieutenant 's friend be wait all that be want be the weapon i must talk with sukey sukey be send for and when the tall lanky fellow enter the apartment fernando tell he all do not you be in the game fernando let I tell you do not you be in it sukey answer but he be inform that he must or be forever disgraced besides he enemy be a hate briton whom they country be almost on the verge of war with and it would not be a bad thing to kill he in advance well if you must be in the game fernando fight with hatchet you know you use to throw a hatchet twenty step and split a pumpkin every time fight with hatchet it be a novel mode of dueling but terrence take the proposition to the lieutenant 's friend the briton say he friend be a gentleman willing to fight with any of the weapon which civilized gentleman use and if mr steven would not consent to the same the lieutenant would publish he as a barbarian and a coward pistol be settle on as a compromise and terrence go away to settle the final arrangement he return with a smile on he face and rub he hand say : cheer up I boy it be all settle what will not we fight yes it be settle that you will fight for a long time fernando be silent and then he say : when will it take place terrence to-morrow morning at sunrise fernando do not go to school that day sukey be enjoin to keep the matter a secret and he go to he classroom as if nothing unusual be about to happen fernando spend the day in write letter to be send home in case he should not survive the affair which after all he believe to be disgraceful dueling he think little better than murder but he be in for it and determine not to show the white feather do not blame fernando for he live in a barbarous age when the code of honor be think to be honorable he chief remorse be for he madcap drunken freak which have be the provocation for the event and yet when he come to think of the ludicrousness of he adventure he smile more than once on that gloomy day he think of morgianna whom in reality he love at first sight would he ever see she again or be she only the evening star which have rise on the last hour of he existence when sukey return he hold a long interview with he and give he a bundle of letter and papers to send home if -- he could not finish the sentence be not there no way to get out of it fernando ask sukey he droll face comical even in distress not honorably well now that you be in the game just shoot that infernal englishman 's head right off he shoulder that be my advice i have read lot about duel and it all depend on who be quickest at the trigger take good aim and do not let he get a second the advantage of you they go to bed early and fernando sleep soundly it be terrence who awake they and say it would not do to be late he have engage a sailor call luff william to take they in he boat to the spot a long sandy beach behind a high promontory some five or six mile from the city the spot be quite secluded and terrence declare it a love of a place for such little affair what be ye thinkin ' of fernando ask terrence when the boat with the three young man be under way i be think sir if i be to kill he what i must do after right my boy nothing like it but 1811 will settle all for ye i do not believe now that america be on the verge of war with the british that my one will make much of a row for killin ' the murdherin ' baste be ye a good shot i be with a rifle but i never could do anything to speak of with a pistol i do not moind that ye have a good eye never take it off he after you be on the ground follow he everywhere i know a fellow in ireland who always shoot he man that way look without winkin ' it be fatal at a short distance -- a very good thing to learn when ye have a little spare time as they come in sight of the beach where the duel be to be fight they perceive a few hundred yard off a group of person stand on the sand whom they recognize as they opponent fernando say terrence grasp he arm firmly as if to instill into he some of he own hope and confidence fernando although you be only a boy i have no fear of you courage but this lieutenant matson be a famous duelist and he will try to shake you nerve now remember that ye take everything that happen quite with a air of indifference do not let he think he have iny advantage over ye and you 'll see how the table will be turn in you favor trust I terrence i 'll not disgrace you steven answer you be twelve minute late mr malone say the ensign who act as the lieutenant 's second but we shall all be able to get back to breakfast -- those that will care to eat not to be outdo terrence say : all will be at supper but you friend will be where he be eat rather than eat do not be too sure the lieutenant have kill he sixth man in affair like this the remark be of course intend for fernando 's ear sukey hear it and say : fernando that be a lie do not you believe it aim at he plaguy head and you can hit it you use to snuff a candle that distance fernando smile while he keep he eye on the lieutenant that smile and that eternal stare disconcert the english officer and he turn a little pale there be something about the imperturbable youth which make he dread the meeting fernando be strangely unnaturally calm ten minute more and he might be in eternity chapter viii the belle of the beach no experienced duelist ever enter into the business with more earnestness or zeal than terrence malone he and the lieutenant 's second be some distance away settle point of position he see three or four man in the uniform of british officer come around the bluff among they the ship 's surgeon with a case of instrument and medicine in he hand captain conkerall though the real injured party be not on the scene he lieutenant readily take up he quarrel on account of he jealousy of fernando who have completely usurp he place as the favorite of miss morgianna lane arrangement be make at last and terrence come to he friend take he arm and walk he forward fernando I boy we have load the pistol he load this and i the one for the lieutenant i put in a thumpin ' heavy charge so he 'll overshoot i be to give the word but do not look at I at all i 'll manage to catch the lieutenant 's eye and do ye watch he steadily aim at he middle and fire when he do and all will be right they be all the while move to the place select for the duel i think the ground we be leave behind we be rather better say someone so it be answer the lieutenant with a sneer but it might be troublesome to carry the young gentleman down that way here all be fair and easy in a few moment they be at the spot the ground be measure off and each man be place and fernando think there be no chance for either escape now thin say terrence i 'll walk twelve pace count ` one two three fire ' and you be both to fire at the word ` fire ' the man who reserve he shot or shoot a second before fall by my hand this stern injunction seem actually to awe the briton and fernando fancy that he see the lieutenant tremble it be only fancy however the lieutenant be really calm notwithstanding the advice of terrence fernando could not help turn he eye from the lieutenant to watch the figure of he retire friend at last he stop -- a second or two elapse -- he wheel rapidly around fernando now turn he eye toward he antagonist lieutenant matson be a slender man and when he turn he right side toward fernando he be not much thicker than a rail one -- two -- three -- fire fernando watch he opponent and at the word raise he pistol and fire he hat fly from he head the crown tear completely out while he antagonist leap into the air clap he hand to the seat of he trousers and fall howl upon the ground the people around fernando all rush forward save sukey who come to he friend and see that he be unhurt begin a mild reproof : why do not you aim higher fernando terrence come back a moment later and burst into laughter say : begorra this will interfere with he sedentary habit for a month arrah I boy it be proud o ' ye i be fernando catch two or three glance throw at he with expression of revengeful passion half a score of marine be see come around the rock and terrence leave off laugh the three be alone against five time they number fernando feel some one grasp he around the waist and hurry he from the spot and ten minute later they be in the boat skimming over the water back toward baltimore put on ivery divilish stitch o ' canvas yer tub 'll carry say terrence to luff william the johnny bull will not like this a bit and bad luck to we if they git they hand on we fernando now that the nervous strain be over sink back in the boat almost completely exhaust fernando ye do it illegintly say the young irishman will he die not unless the doctor kill he try to dig it out i hope they will not what the divil 's the difference before this toime next year we 'll be shootin ' redcoat for sport say what be that shipmate drawl out luff william where look ahead a long boat full o ' british marine cry terrence boy i do not like that mr luff william if ye want a whole skin over yer body pull about and sail down the coast like the divil be after ye in less than two minute ' time they craft be put about and go fly before the wind under a full stretch of canvas the boat impel by eight stout oarsman press hard in they wake heave to heave to cry a officer in the pursue boat heave to or we will fire on you niver mind he I frind say terrence to the man at the rudder i 'll tell ye when to lay low they be in long musket shot distance and william assure they that if they could round a headland they would get a stiffer breeze and outsail they pursuer be they gain on we fernando ask not much if any be the response again the officer in the bow make a speak trumpet of he hand shout : heave to or i swear i 'll fire on you to the divil with you roar terrence we have down one redcoat in fair light what more do ye want bad luck to ye the officer speak to some one behind he and a musket be hand he terrence spring to the stern saying : now look out lay low ye lubber the blackguard 's goin ' to shoot the officer raise he musket and a moment later a puff of smoke issue from the muzzle down cry terrence all lay low and the next second the report of a musket come on the air and a bullet drop in the water a little to the larboard they be come agin cry terrence have not you sweep which we could work asked fernando there be a pair of sweep in the craft and terrence and fernando man they though fernando be a little awkward at first he soon come to use the sweep quite effectively and help the little craft along do we gain on they ask fernando not much if any the helmsman answer at this moment three or four musket be fire from the boat and the ball whistle among the sail or spatter in the water should they meet with one of those sudden calm which frequently overtake vessel off the bay they know they would be lose the british marine be lay to they oar right lustily and the boat fly over the wave have you no arm in the boat ask fernando nothin ' but a fowlin ' piece and some goose shot just the thing for I declare sukey i be always good at killin ' goose on the wing sukey hunt up the gun and load both barrel heavily with shot and slug then he take up he post in the stern ready to rake the long boat fore and aft should it come within range of he formidable gun the officer and three or four marine continue to load and fire until the boat be out of the harbor when a strong breeze strike she sail and send she spinning over the water huzzah huzzah we be gainin ' on ' em now cry sukey flourish he gun in the air the british fire half a dozen more shot at the flee boat but the bullet begin drop behind they be out of reach of they longest range musket there be not no danger now declare sukey they be not in the game the breeze continue strong and the little craft boldly cleft the water as it speed forward over the bound wave it be no use to be wear ourselves out fernando say terrence the good breeze be doin ' more for we than a hundred oar could do they put in they sweep and mount the rail aft cling to rig and shout derision and defiance at they pursuer although the briton have little hope or expectation of overtake they yet with that bull-dog tenacity characteristic of englishman they continue the chase that danger be over say terrence as they once more resume they seat in the boat what would they have do with we terrence have they capture we faith it be hard tell but i think we would find it unpleasant be not the fight fair as fair as iver one saw but begorra it do not turn out the way they expect why la sake they do not think fernando be goin ' to miss do they say sukey he be not be shootin ' squirrel out o ' the tallest tree in ohio for nothin ' this lieutenant think he be go to have some sport with a greenhorn can you see they yet ask fernando of william who sit well up in the stern hold the helm yes how far be they away two or three mile and still a-coming yes plague take 'em growl sukey why do they follow we so persistently may be they think to get we when we go ashore but bad luck to thim they 'll find it tough if they come afther we fernando i wish we have we rifle growl sukey would not we make it unprofitable for the redcoat fernando be rather non-communicative and sit in the bow of the boat lose in painful meditation he have shed blood it be the first and although in that age it be think highly honorable he feel a inward consciousness that dueling be both cowardly and brutal fear of be brand a coward have nerve he to face the pistol of he antagonist it be not true courage that make the duelist there be no more honor gentility or courage in dueling than in rob a safe the greatest coward living may be a burglar so he may from fear of public scorn fight a duel fernando have much to regret he feel that he social standing have be lower yet he be happy in the thought that the duel have have no fatal result could he ever return to the school could he ever return to he home and face he christian mother he be rouse from he painful reverie by a loud laugh on the part of terrence he turn he eye toward the jolly fellow and find he convulse with mirth what ail you terrence he ask do you aim at the spot you hit no i aim at a more vital part but thank god i miss and now i be happy it be more than the lieutenant be i be thinkin ' but terrence the most serious question be what be we go to do now that be

leave he in a maze of bewilderment at the crest of the hill she pause to wave she handkerchief smile with ravishing sweetness and disappear over the hill with she father chapter ix the englishman 's dilemma morgianna lane be the brightest gem in the little maryland village the romantic mystery which enshroud she birth seem only to add to the charm about she of course fernando could not long be in the village without learn that she be not the daughter of captain lane but a sea waif frequently foundling have some birth mark or scar about they or there be some letter or significant mark about they clothing by which in after year they may be identify and they parentage make known but in the case of morgianna there be no probability of she identity ever be discover she plump little arm be utterly devoid of scar or mark the clothes find upon the infant have no initial whatever and be cast aside just as other worn-out garment fernando steven in due time call on captain lane whom he find to be as jolly a old jack tar as life he be greatly amuse at the escapade of the student but caution he against he irish friend i have no doubt this terrence malone be a good noble young fellow but he have too much native mischief in he composition and will get you from one scrape into another with marvellous regularity i do not mean that you should cut he adrift but though you sail in company with he do not allow he to get too far windward of you when you see he be go to fly right into the tooth of some rash fate get on the other tack that be all you do honorably however in fight the duel with lieutenant matson even if he be my friend be he you friend yes he father and i ship afore the mast when we be boy together when the war break out he enter the british navy while i go aboard a yankee privateer i be glad to say we never meet in battle fernando feel himself grow just a little bit uneasy he do not like this friendship between the captain and lieutenant matson and he could see that the old seaman be glad the lieutenant 's wound be not fatal what strange emotion stir the ohio student 's soul when he meet the soft eye of morgianna word can not express she talk on a variety of subject and at time fernando flattered himself that she be please to have he with she but the next moment he reason that it might be only she good breeding which make she appear to tolerate he fernando be not foolish enough to be conceit he live in hope and doubt and be the happiest man at time and at other the most miserable though he take sukey into he confidence fernando be a little shy of terrence the reader will remember that terrence have on enter the village suggest the propriety of go under assume name fernando have forget if he ever know that he be register at the tavern as mr phil magrew of hartford and that good innocent sukey be george molesworth while terrence be larry o'connor a name quite in keep with he nationality a ludicrous mistake which come near be fatal to fernando 's respectability at mariana result from this incident they have be a week at the tavern and fernando who have live a thousand year of alternate bliss and agony in that short period be sit in the bar-room in front of a great roaring fire which the chill evening of early autumn make comfortable utterly oblivious of the grumbling of the landlord who be say : when people stay a whole week ` thout any luggage it be high time they pay up i wonder mr magrew do not take notice o not the suppose mr magrew however do not hear what he say he be gaze into the blaze fire weave bright picture from which the eye of morgianna seem gaze at he fernando have forget the academy home parent and all in this new inspiration terrence and sukey enter while the landlord be still grumble and look hard at fernando who be utterly oblivious of he wrath mister magrew be ye a man o ' honor demand mine host but mr magrew be as indifferent as a statue of stone the wagabond sit there a ' hear himself abuse a ' be too heedless to answer by the mass i will even tweak he nose magrew -- magrew -- i 'll wake you all the while terrence sukey and everybody else be wonder whom the enraged landlord mean suddenly terrence recollect that he have register fernando under the name of philip magrew he hasten to meet the landlord before he reach fernando and thus prevent a collision which would have be violent indeed I frind the honorable misthur magrew be hard o ' hear explain the irishman in a undertone be hard o ' hearin ' then he be hard o ' payin ' too answer the landlord he ` ave be a whole veek in my ` ouse and not one pickyunne ` ave pay lave all to I say the irishman in he conciliatory manner gently lead the landlord to another part of the room ye see I frind know he infirmity ask mesilf to pay all bill for misthur magrew and he give I the money i clear forget it or i should have pay you then terrence draw forth a well-filled purse which greatly mollify the landlord and when all difference be square he be completely satisfied smile and agreeable thus fernando pass over a dangerous period in he life and never know how near he come have he nose pull nor do the landlord ever know how near he come to be knock down for such a attempt morgianna have speak on one occasion of the beauty of moonlight on the seashore and fernando be bold enough to ask the pleasure of rowing herself and father to the headland some evening she assent the old sailor have a friend visit at he house a old ex-sea-captain like himself and the four decide to make the voyage across the little bay and sit for a hour on the rocky promontory and listen to the dash wave fernando willingly welcome the acquaintance as a fourth to the party for he be shrewd enough to see that the old sailor would be so wholly engross with each other that they would scarcely notice the young people and morgianna and he would be leave quite to themselves fernando though a amateur at the oar would on no account be dissuade from rowing the small boat to the promontory and have help morgianna who be lightest into a seat in the bow -lrb- inexpressible happiness -rrb- he cheerfully take he seat at the oar with the old man in the stern face each other then the little craft be cast loose and the young westerner bent to he oar and send the boat swiftly through the water of course fernando 's back be toward morgianna and he could not see she save when he twist he head quite off which he do frequently but he could hear she silvery voice hum snatch of a song or she dimpled hand playing in the phosphorescent water which sparkle like flash of fire in they wake the old man keep up a continual talk for which fernando be exceedingly grateful finally the promontory be gain and in a quiet little cove fernando beach he boat and spring out take the small white hand of morgianna and assist she to the dry sand so gallantly that she dainty little slippered foot do not touch the water then the whole party ascend the hill to the opposite side of the promontory where the sea be beat furiously fernando be almost beside himself with joy to find morgianna cling to he arm in the ascent and to hear she sweet voice in low gentle tone breathe in he ear it be a fine clear night and for all she lowness of spirit morgianna keep look up at the star in a manner so bewitching that fernando be clear out of he sens and plainly show that if ever a man be over head and ear in love that man be himself the path they be ascend be quite steep and fernando could not help glance at the pretty little hand encase in a cream-colored kid glove rest on he arm if fernando have know that a executioner be behind he with a axe raise ready to cut off he head if he touch that hand he could not have help do it from put he own right hand upon it as if by chance and take it away again after a minute or so and then put it back again he get to walk along without take it off at all as if he the escort be bind to do that as a important duty and have come for that purpose the most curious thing about this little incident be that morgianna do not seem to know it she look so innocent and unconscious when she turn she eye on fernando that it be quite provoke she talk about the sea the hill the rock the sky the star while the old man go on ahead and when she slip on the verge of a precipice three foot high and come near fall into a pool of dirty water and he save she from the fall by he coolness and daring she thank he and tell he how grateful she be that he be near and he say something about how happy he would be to be always near she to guard she footstep along life 's rugged pathway then she say something to the effect that it would be pleasant if one could always have one 's friend near and that she hope they would always be friend from that time forth and when fernando say not friend he hope morgianna be quite surprised and say not enemy she hope and when fernando suggest that they might be something better than either morgianna all of a sudden find a star which be brighter than all the other star and beg to call he attention to the same and be ten time more innocent and unconscious than ever in this way they journey up the steep ascent talk very little above a whisper and wish that the promontory be a dozen time higher -- at least such be fernando 's wish -- when they finally reach the top and see the two old man under the lee cliff listen to the ocean 's hollow roar fernando carry a robe and some wrap for morgianna and he conduct she to a sheltered spot below the first ledge of rock where he spread a robe for she to sit on and then with loving finger that thrill with each touch adjust the wrap about she shapely little shoulder for a long time they sit listen to the wild roar of the angry water below gaze on the phosphorescent flash where the swell wave break in crested splendor on the well-worn rock he be first to break the silence miss lane he say have i know that lieutenant matson be you personal friend i would have suffer disgrace rather than encounter he with a smile she answer : it all turn out right the lieutenant be scarcely injure at all have you hear of he i have hear from he she answer glance slyly at fernando from the corner of she roguish eye he write I a letter which i receive to-day fernando feel a pain at he heart but it be nothing to compare with the shame and mortification which follow she inform he that lieutenant matson be so slightly wound that he seconds decide on a second fire and send a boat to inform they as they have leave the beach but that although they chase the american for mile they could not bring they back fernando be stun by the information and fill with mortification and chagrin do you think i be afraid to meet he again he ask he voice tremble with ill-suppressed excitement i do not know but you will not anyway -- you be both my friend and my friend shall not fight fernando make no answer but at that moment he would very much have like to knock she friend on the head of course a second meeting with the briton would now have be highly please to the student but it be out of the question the hour on the promontory be pass in alternate bliss and misery and when the time come to return he be no nearer the subject dearest of all subject than before he hasten back to the tavern where he find he irish friend play card with the landlord and win several week ' board in advance terrence it be a fine fix you get I in by hurry away from the sand so soon that morning he say angrily when he get he to he room why I boy what d'ye mane that lieutenant be only slightly wound and that boat be chase we to bring we back for another shoot so ye have hear it at last I frind certainly i have and now i will be brand as a coward lave it all to I the britisher be in trouble enough sure have not ye read the baltimore papers captain conkerall be to be try by a court-martial for gettin ' bastely drunk and goin ' abroad with no garment but he shirt and a sheet with a hole in it terrence laugh until the tear trickle down he cheek fernando could not see how he could help fight the lieutenant again if he demand satisfaction but the irishman be quite sure the lieutenant would have enough to do to keep he captain out of he dilemma sukey who have enter during they conversation say : oh fernando why do not you aim higher and blow he head off why do the lieutenant challenge I when the captain be the injured party ask fernando terrence explain that while the captain be really the injured party it be a matter of courtesy that he officer lower in rank should take the quarrel upon himself more especially as fernando have be he successful rival at the ball from this the conversation gradually lead to morgianna herself and terrence laugh and wink and call fernando a lucky dog go in I boy and if ye nade any help i be at hand i fear i have injure my prospects there say fernando how by the duel lieutenant matson be a old friend of the captain and i believe a suitor for the hand of he daughter what show have a schoolboy against a lieutenant in the english navy -- none yes he have declare terrence what show can he have lave it all to I I frind and i will bring ye out all right see if i do not i have leave too many thing to you terrence and you have a most remarkable faculty for get I into trouble terrence assure he that he would yet aid he to outgeneral the englishman and he only wish that he might come into port during they stay terrence you must take no advantage of the public hatred of the english to accomplish you purpose remember lieutenant matson be the son of captain lane 's friend you might raise a mob and have he drive away but i will not consent to it indade i do not mane it I boy lave it to I if he come ashore faith we 'll out-gineral he sure next day there come letter for the runaway terrence 's father be wealthy and influential have go to baltimore intercede with the faculty and have the runaway scapegrace retain there be also letter from the parent of the young man condemn but at the time forgiving and warn they to be more careful in the future it be some distance by the road to baltimore and the boy decide to take passage in a coast schooner which be load with barley and would be ready to go in three day one morning two day before they intended departure fernando on go out upon the street be surprised and really alarm to see a english man-of-war anchor in the little harbor of marianna he uneasiness be greatly increase on read the name _ xenophon _ on the broad pennant float from the main mast he enemy be in port and he could guess he object especially when he see captain lane 's carriage wait on the sand while lieutenant matson be be row ashore fernando gnash he tooth and there be some ugly thought in he heart sukey who have come out hasten to he side and read he thought say : now do not you wish you have aim higher the citizen notice the approach of a english war vessel begin to congregate in a large body on the north side of the village and they demonstration be decidedly hostile to the landing of the briton suddenly captain lane appear among they wave he staff and shout have gain they attention the old sea-captain mount the stile near the village store and say : shipmate and friend the man come ashore be the son of a man whom i love i have send my carriage down to bring he to my house where he be to be my guest you have all hear I tell how he father save my life would you injure he now when he come to pay I a friendly visit in a short time the crowd disperse and lieutenant matson land enter the carriage and be drive to the house of captain lane from the street fernando with bitter feeling in he heart see the carriage ascend the hill he turn about and enter the tavern go to he room and shut himself up here he remain until the middle of the afternoon when there come a knock at the door and on open it he be astonish to find one of the negro of captain lane 's house he be dress in livery and hold a note in he hand which he give to mistah steven bow politely and await he answer the utter amazement of fernando can better be imagine than describe at find the note from miss morgianna lane invite himself and he friend to tea that evening with themselves lieutenant matson and ensign post of he majesty 's ship _ xenophon _ have fernando be summon to a command in he majesty 's navy he could not have be more astonished he hesitate a moment and then decide to accept this englishman should neither out-do he in generosity nor affrontery besides the invitation come from morgianna and he could not refuse he write a polite answer accept the kind invitation and go to find sukey and terrence sukey think it would be a little odd for fernando to meet a man with whom he have exchange shot but terrence declare it be the only dacint thing to do they be not haythin to bear grudge consequently they go the mind of the american be fill with doubt and perplexity while the irishman be chuckle at a plan he cunning brain be evolve and which he determine to put in execution the englishman meet the american very cordially and lieutenant matson who be every inch a gentleman do not dare be other than genteel in the presence of the lady he love for he be as passionately in love with morgianna as be fernando the lieutenant be of a romantic turn of mind and the mystery of the sea waif have interested he he be quite sure she be the daughter of some nobleman he have read in romance so many case similar to hers that he could not believe this would turn out otherwise when fernando and the lieutenant have shake hand and mutually agree to bury all past difference have they not be rival they might have become friend for each recognize in the other some quality that be admirable the beauty of a lovely woman be like music rich in cadence and sweet in rhythm but that beauty must be for one alone it can not like music be share with other the best of friend may as rival become the bitterest foe fernando do not like the englishman for with all he blandness he think he could observe a pompous air and self-consciousness of superiority disgust to sensible person this might have be prejudice or the result of imagination yet he realize that he be in the presence of a ambitious rival who would go to any length to gain he purpose the most careful and disinterested observer could not have discover any preference on the part of morgianna when they come to the table she have the lieutenant on one side and fernando on the other the old captain at the head engross much of lieutenant matson 's time talk about he father greatly to the annoyance of the officer when matson come to take he seat at the table terrence who sit on the opposite side of the lieutenant whisper : aisy the lieutenant bit he lip and he face flush angrily while sukey who sit on the opposite side of the irishman snicker and morgianna bit she pretty lip most cruelly in try to conceal the merriment which she roguish eye express this be the only break make by the irishman that evening he play he part with consummate grace and have such a way of win the favor of people that before the evening be over the englishman actually come to like he he praise the country about mariana and talk of the harbor and island declare he know they all from duck island to the chesapeake he find lieutenant matson somewhat of a sport and soon interested he in story of duck shooting all of which be invention of he own ingenious brain miss morgianna praise the wild duck of maryland and think they flesh equal to english capon the lieutenant in he gallantry vow she should have half a dozen brace of fowl before he leave and terrence volunteer to assist he fernando be amaze at the course of he friend the man-of-war be to sail the same day they schooner do and he have just determine by the aid of terrence to bag five dozen brace of duck for the belle of mariana when he friend go boldly over to the enemy i 'll give it to he when i get a chance he think there be only one more night in which they could shoot duck and terrence be engage for that occasion fernando sigh and ground he tooth in rage and disappointment while morgianna with sukey on one side and ensign post on the other go to a large broadwood piano where she soon entertain all with she music as they go to they tavern that night fernando say : a nice way you have treat I terrence you who profess to be my friend what the divil ail the boy ask terrence you have volunteer to aid the lieutenant go duck -- aisy I boy while the lieutenant be after duck lose no time with the girl do not ye see i be get he out of yer way fernando have not think of it in that light on the next evening the last they be to spend at mariana the lieutenant be row ashore attire for sport with top-boot and a double-barrelled fowling piece terrence who claim to be a experienced hunter advise he to kape they intintion sacrit as too many might want to go and that would spoil the sport duck could best be hunt after night he would show he how it be do it be almost dark when they set off in a small rowboat for duck island and twenty minute later fernando be on he way to he farewell visit to morgianna the sun have set but it be not yet dark when fernando reach the broad piazza he ask himself if she would be at home or away he have say nothing of he come this visit be wholly on he own account he have walk up and down the piazza two or three time when through the open door he catch the flutter of a garment on the stairway it be morgianna 's -- to whom else could it belong no dress but hers have such a flow as that he gather up courage and follow it into the hallway he darken the door into which the sombre shadow of twilight be already creep cause she to look around oh that face if it have not be for that think fernando i could never have face the briton she be twenty time handsomer than ever she might marry a lord he do not say this he only think it -- perhaps look it also morgianna be glad to see he and be _ so _ sorry she father be away from home fernando beg she would not worry herself on any account morgianna hesitate to lead the way into the parlor for there it be nearly dark at the same time she hesitate to stand talk in the hall which be tolerably light from the open door they still stand in the hall in a embarrassing position fernando hold she hand in he -lrb- which he have no right to do for morgianna have only give it to he to shake -rrb- and yet both hesitate to go or stay anywhere i have come say fernando to say good-bye -- to say good-bye for i do not know how many year perhaps forever i be go away now this be exactly what he should not have say here he be talk like a gentleman at large who be free to come and go and roam about the world at he pleasure when he have express both in action and word that miss lane hold he in adamantine chain morgianna release she hand and say : indeed she remark in the same breath that it be a fine night and in short betray not the least emotion with despair still settle over he heart fernando say : i could not go without come to see you i have not the heart to morgianna be more sorry than she could tell that he have take the trouble it be a long walk up the hill and as he be to sail next day he must have a deal to do as if she do not know that he have not bring even a trunk with he then she want to know how mr winner be and mr malone she think the irishman a capital good fellow and be sure no one could help like he be this all you have to say fernando ask all good gracious what do the man expect she be oblige to take she apron in she hand and run she eye along the hem from corner to corner to keep herself from laugh in he face -- not because he gaze confuse she -- not at all this be fernando 's first experience in love affair and he have no idea how different young lady be at different time he have expect a far different scene from the one which be be enact all day long he have buoy himself up with a indistinct idea that she would certainly say do not go or do not leave we or why do you go or why do you leave we or would give he some little encouragement of that sort he have even entertain the possibility of she bursting into tear of she throwing herself into he arm or fall down in a faint fit without previous word or sign but any approach to such a line of conduct as this be evidently so far from she thought that he could only look at she in silent wonder the hate english rival have win she heart and she be even glad he be go yet it be so hard to give she up morgianna in the meanwhile turn to the corner of she apron and measure the side and smooth out the wrinkle and be as silent as he at last after a long pause he say good-bye good-bye answer morgianna with as pleasant a smile as if he be only go for a row on the water and would return after supper good-bye come say fernando put out he hand morgianna dear morgianna let we not part like this i love you dearly with all my heart and soul with as much sincerity and truth as man ever love woman i be

spoilt child she have no notion of be carry off by storm in this way fernando have no business to be go away besides if he really love she why do he not fall on he knee like lover in romance or on the stage and tug wildly at he cravat or talk in a wild poetic manner i have say good-bye twice say morgianna take you arm away or i will call some one i will not reproach you fernando sadly answer it be no doubt my fault he add with a sigh i have think sometimes that you do not quite despise I but i be a fool to do so every one must who have see the life i have lead of late -- you most of all for it be he at whose life i aim god bless you he be go actually go she wait a little while think he would return peep out of the door look down the broad carriage drive as well as the increase darkness would allow see a hastily retreat shadow melt into the general gloom come in again wait a little longer then go up to she room bolt herself in throw herself on she bed and cry as if she heart would break \* \* \* \* \* meanwhile terrence malone and the lieutenant fernando 's rival be rowing toward duck island fire or six mile away the island be reach it be a dismal affair little more than a elevated marsh when the tide be out on duck island its extended dreariness be potent its spongy low-lying surface sluggish inky pool and tortuous slough twist they slimy way eel-like toward the open bay be all hard fact occasionally here and there could be see a few green tussock with they scant blade they amphibious flavor and unpleasant dampness and if you choose to indulge you fancy although the flat monotony of duck island be not inspiring the wavy line of scatter drift give a unpleasant consciousness of the spend water and make the certainty of the return tide a gloomy reflection which sunshine could not wholly dissipate the greener salt meadow seem oppress with this idea and make no positive attempt at vegetation in the low bush one might fancy there be one sacred spot not wholly spoil by the injudicious use of too much sea water the vocal expression of duck island be in keep with its general appearance melancholy and depress the sepulchral boom of the bittern the shriek of the curlew the scream of the pass brent the wrangling of quarrelsome teal the sharp querulous protest of the startled crane be all beyond power of write expression the aspect of these mournful fowl be not at all cheerful or inspiring as the boat contain the irishman and lieutenant approach the island through the gathering gloom of night could be see a tall blue heron standing midleg deep in water obviously catch cold in he reckless disregard for wet foot and consequence the mournful curlew the dejected plover and the low-spirited snipe who seek to join he in he suicidal contemplation the raven soar through the air on restless wing croak he melancholy complaint be not calculate to add to the cheerfulness of the scene -lrb- illustration : he sit down on a broken mast -rrb- it be evident that even the inhabitant of duck island be not happy in its possession and look forward with pleasure to the season of migration the boat touch the north shore and lieutenant matson jump out in mud up to he knee frightening some wild fowl which fly scream away the englishman give vent to some strong language and desire to know if there be not a better landing place terrence assure he there be not and complain that duck never seek a dacint place for they habitation nothing but the glorious reflection that he be make himself a martyr for morgianna 's sake could have induce the officer to take the torch and wade to the low bush where he be instruct to make a light and wait until he companion row around the island and drive the duck in great flock to the light which he assure the briton would attract they and they would fall at he foot as if beg to be bag slowly the officer wade through the dismal marsh to the higher land where grow the low bush and by the use of he tinder box kindle a light and wrap he boat cloak about he sit down on a broken mast which some storm have drive to the highest part of the island the minute pass on and neither the irishman nor the expect flock of bird come minute grow into hour and only the sob wave and melancholy cry of bird break the silence surely something have happen to he companion about midnight a dense fog settle over the island and the alarm and discomfiture of the englishman become supreme at one moment he be cursing terrence and the next offering prayer for he soul never do man pass a more dreary night at last dawn come and he could see far across the water he ship but a speck in the distance it be to sail that forenoon and he intend to call on morgianna and propose but here he be on this infernal island hungry damp and miserable he know the vessel would pass near enough for he to hail it and have a boat send for he but then he would miss he intended visit to captain lane 's and he future happiness depend on that visit while he be indulge in these bitter reflection a schooner suddenly fly past the island and to he amazement he see the irish student terrence malone whom he have be alternately pray for and cursing all night stand on the deck apparently in the best of health and spirit the scoundrel even have the audacity to wave he a adieu as he pass chapter x the silent gunner of course terrence malone have play a practical joke on the english lieutenant and while the latter be pass the night on the gloomiest island of all the maryland coast the former be sweetly dream of dear old ireland in the most comfortable bed the tavern afford next morning the captain of the _ xenophon _ send ashore for lieutenant matson to come aboard as they be about to hoist anchor terrence fernando and sukey be just go aboard the schooner as the messenger come fernando have pass the most miserable night of he existence and now pale and melancholy go aboard the schooner utterly unconscious of the fact that some one be watch he through a glass from the big house on the hill terrence be as jolly as usual and have almost forget the lieutenant just as the schooner be about to sail ensign post come aboard and ask for mr malone terrence be sit aft the main cabin smoking a cigar when the ensign approach ask : where be lieutenant matson i be tell he go shooting with you last evening sure he do you will find he on duck island enjoy the sport i have no doubt faith i have almost forget to tell ye to touch at the island and take he off as ye sail out of the harbor the ensign look puzzle at this and say : this be strange -- this be certainly very extraordinary would he stay on the island all night terrence assure he that the lieutenant be a great sport and that the best shooting be just before day the englishman return to he boat and be row to the man-of-war to report while the schooner weigh anchor and sail out of the harbor the _ xenophon _ follow two hour later have first send a boat to duck island for the lieutenant who swear to shoot the irishman at sight there be no time for he to call on morgianna and explain why he have not bring she the duck for soon after he arrival the ship depart for halifax where the commander have to give a account of he conduct at baltimore meanwhile the schooner on which the three student have take passage stand out to sea and start down the coast a strong breeze blow from off land sweep she out of sight of the coast when the wind suddenly shift until the skipper declare they have it right in they tooth and despite all the skill of master and crew the vessel continue to drift farther out to sea while sukey once more bewail he fate at risk he life on the water do not count I in this game again he groan if i live to get on shore i 'll never risk myself on water broader than the ohio with such headwind the schooner could not possibly reach baltimore that night all night long she struggle first on one tack and then on the other and at dawn only the blue mist see like a fog in the west mark the line of the maryland coast do not be discourage lad say the skipper cheerfully come down to breakfast and afore night i 'll have ye snug in port they go to breakfast and when they return find the master and three seaman in the forecastle hold a very earnest conversation the fourth sailor be at the wheel fernando glance off to they larboard see a large ship fly english color bear down upon they and he have no doubt that this vessel be the subject of discussion she signal to the schooner to heave to and as they be within range of she powerful gun the skipper be force to obey this vessel be the english frigate _ macedonian _ cruise along the american coast and at this time short of hand in a few moment the frigate come near and heave to while a boat with a dozen marine and a officer come alongside the schooner what be you business ask the skipper we be look for deserter and englishman well here be my crew say the skipper point to he sailor every one i will swear be american bear but who be these young man three passenger i be take to baltimore the three student begin to entertain some grave apprehension terrence for once be quiet he dialect he know would betray he and when he be ask where he live and where he be from he try hard to conceal he brogue but it be in vain sukey come forward and try to explain matter but only make they worse the result be that all three be in a short hour transport to the _ macedonian _ in iron protest be useless the _ macedonian _ be short of hand and they be force to go they be not even permit to write letter home however the skipper have they name and the whole affair be print in the _ baltimore sun _ and copy be send to the parent of the young man captain snipe of the english frigate be one of those barbarous tyrannical sea captain more brute than human and in a age when the strict discipline of the navy permit tyranny to exist he become a monster the three recruit be add to he muster-roll and gradually initiate into the mystery of sailor 's life on a war vessel poor sukey for several day be fearfully seasick but he recover and be assign to he mess fortunately they be all three assign to the same mess the common seaman of the _ macedonian _ be divide into thirty-seven mess put down on the purser 's book as mess no 1 mess no 2 mess no 3 the member of each mess club they ration of provision and breakfast dine and sup together at allotted interval between the gun on the main deck they find that live on board the _ macedonian _ be like live in a market where one dress on the door-step and sleep in the cellar they could have no privacy hardly a moment seclusion in fact it be almost a physical impossibility ever to be alone the three impressed american dine at a vast _ table d'hte _ sleep in common and make they toilet when and where they could they clothes be stow in a large canvas bag paint black which they could get out of the rack only once in twenty-four hour and then during a time of utmost confusion among three hundred and fifty other sailor each diving into he bag in the midst of the twilight of the berth-deck terrence in order to obviate in a measure this inconvenience suggest that they divide they wardrobe between they hammock and they bag stow they few frock and trowser in the former so that they could change at night when the hammock be pipe down they know not whither they be bind and they care little about the object of the voyage how be we to get out of this any way ask sukey one day when the three be together for a moment lave it all to I say terrence i be perfectly willing to leave it all to you terrence do just as you will so you get I on shore before they have be a month on the ship they chase a french merchantman for twenty-four hour and at time be near enough to fire a few shot with they long bow-chaser but a fresh breeze spring up quickly increase to a gale and the frenchman escape this be the nearest approach to a naval engagement they experience during they stay on the war frigate they cruise along the coast of ireland and scotland go to spain enter the water of the mediterranean for a few week and then return to the atlantic sailing for the west indy not only be the officer of the _ macedonian _ brutal but the crew be make up of a motley class of human being of every class of viciousness and brutality now boy if ye want to kape out of trouble say terrence do ` nt ye get into any fight with thim divil or ye 'll be bring up to the quarter-deck and flog he advice be appreciate and both fernando and sukey do they best to avoid trouble with any of they quarrelsome neighbor they submit to insult innumerable but at last sukey be one morning assail by a brutal sailor whom he knock down two other sailor be guilty of a similar offence and all four be put under arrest fernando be shock and alarm for he friend and hasten to ascertain the fact concern the charge i could not help it declare sukey whom he find in iron plague take he he hit I twice before i knock he down i do not want to be in the game the culprit could expect nothing but a flogging at the captain 's pleasure toward evening of the next day they be startle by the dread summons of the boatswain and he mate at the principal hatchway -- a summons that send a shudder through every manly heart in the frigate : _ all hand witness punishment ahoy _ the hoarseness of the cry its unrelenting prolongation it be catch up at different point and send to the lowest depths of the ship produce a most dismal effect upon every heart not callouse by long familiarity with it however much fernando desire to absent himself from the scene that ensue behold it he must or at least stand near it he must for the regulation compel the attendance of the entire ship 's company from the captain himself to the smallest boy who strike the bell at the summons the crew crowd round the mainmast many eager to obtain a good place get on the boom to overlook the scene some be laugh and chat other canvass the case of the culprit some maintain sad anxious countenance or carry a suppress indignation in they eye a few purposely keep behind to avoid look on in short among three or four hundred man there be every possible shade of character all the officer midshipman include stand together in a group on the starboard side of the mainmast the first lieutenant be a little in advance and the surgeon whose special duty it be to be present at such time stand close at he side presently the captain come forward from he cabin and take he place in the center of the group with a small paper in he hand that paper be the daily report of offens regularly lay upon he table every morning or evening master-at-arms bring up the prisoner he say a few moment elapse during which the captain now clothe in he most dreadful attribute fix he eye severely upon the crew when suddenly a lane form through the crowd of seaman and the prisoner advance -- the master-at-arms rattan in hand on one side and a armed marine on the other -- and take up they station at the mast you john you richard -lrb- richard be sukey -rrb- you mark you antone say the captain be yesterday find fight on the gun-deck have you any thing to say mark and antone two steady middle-aged man who have be admire for they sobriety reply that they do not strike the first blow they have submit to much before they yield to they passion but as they acknowledge that they have at last defend themselves they excuse be overrule john -- a brutal bully who in fact be the real author of the disturbance be about enter into a long harangue when the captain cut he short and make he confess irrespective of circumstance that he have be in the fray poor sukey the youngest and handsomest of the four be pale and tremulous he have already win the good will and esteem of many in the ship that morning fernando and terrence have go to he bag take out he best clothes and obtain the permission of the marine sentry at the brig have hand they to he to be put on before he be summon to the mast this be do to propitiate captain snipe who like to see a tidy sailor but it be all in vain to all the young american 's supplication captain snipe turn a deaf ear sukey declare he have be strike twice before he have return a blow no matter cry the captain angrily you strike at last instead of report the case to a officer i allow no man to fight on this ship but myself i do the fight now man he add fix he dark stern eye on they you all admit the charge you know the penalty strip quartermaster be the grating rig the grating be square frame of bar woodwork sometimes place over the hatch one of these square be now lay on the deck close to the ship 's bulwark and while the remain preparation be be make the master-at-arms assist the prisoner to remove they jacket and shirt this do they shirt be loosely throw over they shoulder as a partial protection from the keen breeze until they turn should come at a sign from the captain john with a shameless leer step forward and stand passively on the grate while the bareheaded old quarter-master with he gray hair streaming in the wind bind he foot to the cross-bar and stretch out he arm over he head secure they to the hammock net above he then retreat a little space standing silent meanwhile the boatswain stand solemnly on the other side with a green bag in he hand from this he take four instrument of punishment and give one to each of he mate for a fresh cat apply by a fresh hand be the ceremonious privilege accord to every man-of-war culprit through all that terrible scene fernando steven stand transfix with horror indignation and a thousand bitter indescribable feeling at another sign from the captain the master-at-arms step up remove the shirt from the prisoner at this juncture a wave break against the ship 's side and dash the spray over the man 's expose back but though the air be pierce cold and the water drench he john stand still without a shudder captain snipe lift he finger and the first boatswain 's - mate advance comb out the nine tail of he cat with he finger and then sweep they round he neck bring they with the whole force of he body upon the mark again and again and again at every blow higher and higher and higher rise the long purple bar on the prisoner 's back but he only bow he head and stand still a whisper murmur of applause at they shipmate 's nerve go round among the sailor one dozen blow be administer on he bare back and then he be take down and go among he messmate swearing : it be nothing after you get use to it antone who be a portuguese be next and he howl and swear at every blow though he have never be know to blaspheme before mark the third be in the first stage of consumption and cough and cringe during the flogging at about the sixth blow he bow he head and cry : oh jesus christ but whether it be in blasphemy or supplication no one could determine he be take with a fever a few day later and die before the cruise be over as much perhaps of mortification as from the inroad of the disease the fourth be poor sukey when tell to advance he make one more appeal to the captain avow that he be a american the captain with a oath say that be the more reason for flog he he appeal until the marine guard be order to prod he with he bayonet they have to actually drag sukey to the grating sukey 's cheek which be usually pale be now whiter than a ghost as he be be secure to the grating and the shuddering and creeping of he dazzling white back be reveal he turn he tear-stained face to the captain and implore he to spare he the disgrace which he feel far more keenly than the pain i would not forgive god almighty cry the brutal captain the

the d -- l be you stop for cry the captain as the boatswain 's - mate halt lay on and the whole dozen be apply though poor sukey faint at the tenth stroke reader this be on a english war vessel -- the vessel of a nation profess a high state of civilization we blush to say it it be no better on a american man-of-war if nautical writer of high authority be to be believe and even to-day the brute often hold a commission in the american army and navy although flogging be of the past punishment equally severe be inflict the necessity of discipline be take advantage of by man without heart a american naval officer in washington city tell the author that it be a common thing for officer on a american man-of-war to swing the hammock of the sailor or middy whom they dislike where he would have all the damp and cold end in consumption and death if this be true it be far more brutal than flog congressional investigation be usually farce congressman place they friend in the army and navy and they investigation usually result in the triumph of they friend for several day sukey be too ill to leave he hammock i do not want to get well the poor boy say i want to die i never want to see

find a open grave accord to promise fernando go with he captain snipe accompany the sergeant of the marine to see that the prisoner be properly execute he still sting under the blow he have receive and boseley be slay more to gratify the vengeance of the captain than for any violate law a number of boseley 's shipmate be permit to come and witness the terrible scene the captain say to boseley : what be you distance twelve step step off you ground add the captain i can not do it you do it for I i will do it with you the prisoner 's hand be tie behind he back and the captain take he arm walk he off twelve step as coolly as if they be only pacing the quarter-deck the captain then take a blanket spread it on the ground and tell boseley to kneel on it and he do so face he executioner the ship 's chaplain come and offer a prayer after which the sergeant ask boseley if he wish to have he eye bandage no i be not afraid to face my executioner he answer it be a intensely solemn occasion and among all those hardy rough-mannered sailor there be not one unless it be captain snipe who be not deeply affect the captain 's face be flush and he breath be strong with brandy and he seem but little move go ahead and have this do with he say to the officer in charge of the affair be you quite ready now ask the sergeant yes be the answer in a falter tone make ready and the twelve glitter musket be level at this sacrifice to the wrath of captain snipe take aim and the gunner steady themselves for the fatal word to send a fellow be to eternity fire and instantly flash a volley reverberate a wild and unearthly death knell among the crag that look down upon that awful scene in the clear morning air the smoke of the gun curl up lazily and hang like a funeral pall over the mangled bleeding form four bullet have pierce he body he fall on he face and lay motionless for a few seconds then he begin to slowly raise he head fernando come near and stand in front of he ten thousand year could not efface that scene from he mind he continue to raise he head and body without a struggle he look the captain in the eye and he mouth be in motion as though he be try to speak -- to utter some die accusation never do human eye behold a scene so pitiful as this die man gaze on he destroyer gasp to implore or to denounce he in a instant a dimness come over he eye and he fall dead oh heaven groan fernando and he hurry away to the ship for week he see that awful face every time he close he eye to sleep two year on board the british frigate have make fernando sukey and terrence tolerably fair sailor they heart be never in the work and they often dream of escape from this life of slavery fernando by judicious attention to business have never yet win the positive displeasure of the officer one day the boatswain 's mate repeat the command at the hatchway : all hand tack ship ahoy it be just eight bell noon and spring from he jacket which he have spread between the gun for a bed on the main deck fernando run up the ladder and as usual seize hold of the main-brace which fifty hand be streaming along forward when maintopsail haul be give through the trumpet he pull at this brace with such heartiness and good will that he flatter himself he would gain the approval of the grim captain himself but something happen to be in the way aloft when the yard swing round and a little confusion ensue with anger on he brow captain snipe come forward to see what occasion it no one to let go the weather-lift of the main-yard the rope be cast off however by a hand and the yard unobstructed come round when the last rope be coil away the captain ask the first lieutenant who it might be that be station at the weather -lrb- then the starboard -rrb- main-lift with a vexed expression of countenance the first lieutenant send a midshipman for the station bill when upon glance it over the name of fernando steven be find set down at the post in question at the time fernando be on the gundeck below and do not know of these proceedings but a moment after he hear the boatswain 's - mate bawl he name at all the hatchway and along all three deck it be the first time he have ever hear it send through the furthest recess of the ship and well know what this generally betoken to other seaman he heart jump to he throat and he hurriedly ask brown the boatswain 's - mate at the fore-hatchway what be want of he captain want ye at the mast he answer go to flog ye i fancy what for my eye you have be chalk you face haus not ye what be i want for he repeat but at that instant he name be thunder forth by the other boatswain 's - mate and brown hurry he away hint that he would soon find out what the captain want fernando swallow down he heart as he touch the spardeck for a single instant balanced himself on he best center and then wholly ignorant of what be go to be allege against he advance to the dread tribunal of the frigate the sight of the quarter-master rig he grating the boatswain with he detestable green bag of scourge the master-at-arms stand ready to assist some one to take off he shirt be not calculate to allay he apprehension with another desperate effort to swallow he whole soul he find himself face to face with captain snipe whose flush face show he ill humor at he side be the first lieutenant who as fernando come aft eye he with some degree of conscientious vexation at be compel to make he the scapegoat of he own negligence why be you not at you station sir ask the captain what station do you mean sir fernando ask forget the accustomed formality of touch he hat by way of salute while speak with so punctilious a officer as captain snipe this little fact do not escape the captain 's attention you pretension to ignorance will not help you sir the captain retort the first lieutenant now produce the station bill and read the name of fernando steven in connection with the starboard main-lift captain snipe say fernando in a voice firm and terrible in its sincerity it be the first time i know i be assign to that post how be this mr bacon the captain ask turn to the first lieutenant with a fault-finding expression it be impossible sir that this man should not know he station reply the lieutenant captain snipe i will swear i never know it before this moment answer fernando with a oath the captain cry : do you contradict my officer i 'll flog you by -- fernando have be on board the frigate for more than two year and remain unscourged though a slave in fact he live in hope of soon be a free man now after make himself a hermit in some thing after endure countless torment and insult without resentment in order to avoid the possibility of the scourge here it be hang over he for a thing utterly unforeseen -- a crime of which he be wholly innocent but all that be naught he see that he case be hopeless he solemn disclaimer be throw in he tooth and the boatswain 's - mate stand curl he finger through the cat there be time when wild thought enter a man 's heart when he seem almost irresponsible for he act and he deed the captain stand on the weather side of the deck sideways on a unoccupied line with he be the opening of the lee-gangway where the side-ladder be suspend in port nothing but a slight bit of sinnate-stuff serve to rail in this opening which be cut down to a level with the captain 's foot show the far sea beyond fernando stand a little to windward of he and though captain snipe be a large powerful man it be quite certain that a sudden rush against he along the slanting deck would infallibly pitch he headforemost into the ocean though he who rush must need go over with he the young american 's blood seem clotting in he vein he feel icy cold at the tip of he finger and a dimness be before he eye but through that dimness the boatswain 's - mate scourge in hand loom like a giant and captain snipe and the blue sea see through the opening at the gangway show with a awful vividness he be never able to analyze he heart though it then stand still within he but the thing that sway he to he purpose be not altogether the thought that captain snipe be about to degrade he and that he have take a oath within he soul that he should not no he feel he manhood so bottomless within he that no word no blow no scourge of captain snipe 's could cut deep enough for that he but cling to a instinct in he -- the instinct diffuse through all animated nature the same that prompt the worm to turn under the heel lock soul with he he mean to drag captain snipe from this earthly tribunal of he to that of jehovah and let he decide between they no other way could he escape the scourge to the grating sir cry captain snipe do you hear fernando 's eye measure the distance between he and the sea and he be gather himself together for the fatal spring -- captain snipe say a voice advance from the crowd every eye turn to see who speak it be the remarkably handsome and gentlemanly gunner hugh st mark who be scarcely ever know to break the silence and all be amaze that he should do so now i know that man say st mark touch he cap and speaking in a mild firm but extremely deferential manner and i know that he would not be find absent from he station if he know where it be this speech be almost unprecedented never before have a marine dare to speak to the captain of a frigate in behalf of a seaman at the mast but there be something unostentatiously forcible and commanding in st mark 's manner he have once save the captain 's life when a french boarder be about to slay he then the corporal embolden by st mark 's audacity put in a good word terrence who have be promote to a small office pour forth a torrent of eloquence and almost before he know it fernando be free as he be go to he quarter he brain in a whirl he hear job the cook say : he be not no britisher dar be not no more angler saxon blood in he vein dan in dis chile a hour later when he stand near a gun carriage still dizzy from he narrow escape from the double crime of murder and suicide st mark pass fernando he grasp the hand of the silent gunner hold it a moment in he own and whisper : thank you chapter xi shipwreck -- escape and return to ohio ship 's rule stringent as they be on the war frigate and officer severe as be those of the _ macedonian _ could not wholly curb the rollick spirit of terrence he exuberance of spirit constantly get the better of any good intention he might have form any wholesome dread he may have entertain of that famous feline of nine tail know to sailor of that day be overcome by he love of prank what guardian spirit protect the bold and mischievous have never yet be discover but it be a well authenticate fact that wild harum scarum fellow like terrence malone seldom come to grief or disaster he be always the innocent lamb of the ship whom no one would suspect of mischief the chaplain of the ship be not more grave and sanctimonious than he if the hammock net be leave so as to trip up the dignified captain and throw he on the deck in a very undignified manner no one could possibly have suspect that the harmless terrence have any thing to do with it the quarter-master be one day snore in he hammock terrence who be on duty scrub the gun deck have a large tub fill with water which be unconsciously leave just under the head of the hammock of the quarter-master no one could tell how it happen but the support be all cut save two or three which the swaying of the hammock gradually loosen until just as the officer go to change side down he come with a frightful splash head first into the tub terrence who be near run to he rescue and quickly pull he out it be bastely carelessness to lave the water there cry terrence faith i hope the captain will give the shpalpeen two dozen as do it who cut my hammock down roar the quarter-master cut yer hammock indade the quarter-master be in a rage and swear like a trooper wipe the water from he face he roar : yes cut down my hammock do not you see the net have be cut the truth ye tell quarter-master some haythin have surely be cut yer net now who could have do that i hope the culprit may be find that be all and the face of the quarter-master himself do not evince more savage fury than the irishman he be the first to report it to the lieutenant and in he zeal actually burst in on the captain himself and tell of the disaster volunteer he service to hunt down the culprit find he thunder the captain he face white with rage find he and by the trident of neptune i swear i 'll see he backbone no one in the whole ship be as zealous as the irishman in search for the culprit but he take care never to find he captain of man-of-war be fond of delicacy and the captain have a fine fat pig which he intend for a special feast to be give for he officer terrence through he zeal become such a favorite that he be even permit to superintend the cooking the quarter-master 's favorite dog which be as fat as the pig suddenly disappear the day before the feast and terrence have a search institute for he without avail and give it out as he opinion that the dog have fall overboard on the same day the officer feast on roast pig terrence 's mess have roast pig the officer declare that they roast pig be very tender but that the flavor be strong and peculiar the ship 's surgeon afterward say he never see the bone of a pig so resemble the bone of a dog there have be but one pig aboard and have it be know that terrence dine on roast pig also there might have be some grave suspicion shortly after this event there be some change in the british navy captain snipe be supplant in command of the _ macedonian _ by captain carden fernando terrence and the negro be shortly after transfer to the war-sloop _ sea shell _ captain bone while poor sukey be still leave aboard the _ macedonian _ shortly after these change captain snipe and mr hugh st mark the silent gunner be transfer to the man-of-war _ xenophon _ thus we see by those interminable and inexplicable change constantly go on in the royal navy the friend be separate there may be some reason for those constant change in the navy but they be not apparent to the sagest landsman living captain conkerall have make himself so ridiculous in baltimore that he have be force to quit the service in order to escape he ridicule of he fellow officer this leave lieutenant matson in command of the _ xenophon _ until captain snipe be assign to that duty fernando steven feel some regret in leave the _ macedonian _ one 's very suffering may endear they to a place but fernando 's chief regret be in leave the friend of he childhood sukey and he shed manly tear as each see the face of he friend fade from view terrence soon ingratiate himself into the favor of captain bone who have a weakness for punch and whist terrence know how to brew the punch to the taste of the captain and could play whist so artistically that the captain could by the hardest sort of play just win terrence boast of excellent family connection and give as he reason for he not have a mid-shipman 's commission that he father object to the sea and he have be impressed instead of enter the navy of he own accord bone be not as punctilious as most captain especially when terrence could brew such excellent punch and terrence soon become a favorite and come and go at pleasure in the captain 's cabin when the captain imbibe quite freely he often hint at a promotion for terrence fernando pay little attention to the course of the vessel he have be in nearly all the part of the world and seldom ask which continent they be on or in what water they sail he be sober silent and melancholy one bright August day in 1811 they be off some coast he know not what all day the weather have be glorious toward sunset the cloud begin to gather in heavy mass to the southeast and a little later a heavy breeze spring up from that direction as darkness come on the wind increase blow a strong gale and it blow all night as morning dawn a dense fog settle down over the vessel and completely obscure everything sounding be take but the captain who have yield to the seductive punch of terrence malone could not determine where they be when daylight come the sea have change color which prove that they be in shallow water on heave the lead it be ascertain that they be only in twelve fathom water wear ship shout captain bone in a tone of thunder the vessel be then under such small sail that she have not headway enough to stay she as she answer to she helm and pay off bring the wind aft high land be see astern suddenly the fog lift at the same instant the wind change to the southwest blow harder a cloud of canvas fly into the air and look up fernando see it be the jib the vessel lose what little headway she have and drift heavily to leeward as the fog clear toward the land they look early in that direction and to they dismay and horror they see heavy breaker beat so close to they that there be no room to wear the ship round the captain at once give order to clear away the anchor a seaman go forward with a axe to cut the lashing of the one on the port side as soon as the cable have be cut the starboard anchor be send adrift and thirty fathom of cable run out the order be give to hold on and as it be obey the port cable break the sloop immediately swing around bring all she weight on the starboard cable which be unable to stand the strain part and then they be leave entirely to the mercy of the wind and sea the suspense be short a tremendous sea come roll toward the sloop strike it with terrific force lift it high on its crest and carry it forward toward the breaker in another instant the vessel be drive with a crash on the sandy bottom at the same moment down come the foremast take with it the jib-boom and bowsprit all disappear into the sea wave after wave wash over they in quick succession the mainmast be split and the noise make by it as it be beat about by the gale be deafen all the poor wretch on board the _ sea shell _ could do be to hold on for dear life the captain order they only life-boat lower and turn to the crew he shout for the roaring of the wind be terrible that he with twelve man would set out for shore and after landing eight with himself and officer would send the boat back for other the captain have no notion that so excellent a punch brewer as terrence should be lose and insist that he go with the first boatload the other have no alternative they be compel to submit the captain he lieutenant terrence and a dozen sailor spring over the side take they place and push off as the little craft rise and fall in that frightful sea it seem doubtful if they would reach the shore dumb with terror fernando have watch the whole proceeding he could only hold on to a sail and by the sheer strength of he hand and arm save himself from be carry overboard as sea after sea sweep over they he strain he eye until it seem as though they would burst to follow the movement of that boat on which they life depend it seem but a mere speck on the wave suddenly it rise to a surprising height and then disappear altogether the next moment he see the man struggle in the water the boat be break into piece and the fragment be bring out to they every man for himself be now the cry throughout the ship how far they be from the shore no one could tell they have to take they chance although a strong swimmer fernando know that in such a tremendous sea he would be powerless there be however but the one thing to do raise he hand before he and press they firmly together fernando draw a long breath then spring from the sloop 's rail into the water beneath when he rise to the surface he try to swim it be impossible as he have foresee he be like a child in the grasp of a monster the wave toss he up like a plaything and carry he on -- he could not tell how far or where suddenly a great black object loom up before he it be a part of the wreckage he try to ward it off but he might as well have try to ward off the sloop itself for the sea lift he up and dash he onward and the great mass strike he a heavy blow over the eye -- a flash of lightning gleam then all be darkness and a blank how long after he could not tell a strange sensation come creep slowly over he a low murmur of voice reach he ear he be bewildered and benumbed but soon the truth begin to dawn and he know that wherever he might be he be not dead powerless to move he open he eye and fasten they on the object about he he now discover that he be lie on a bed of straw in a large barn how he could have get there be yet a mystery to he great delight he recognize the face of terrence malone bend over he well I boy ye be not dead yet be ye where be we terrence he faintly inquire whist I lad a ' i 'll tell ye say terrence in a undertone terrence first look round to assure himself that there be no one within hearing and then say safe on mother earth I lad and what be best of all american soil american soil -- the very announcement send a thrill of hope and joy through he heart terrence then inform he that they have be wreck on the coast of maine that most of the crew be save and the captain intend to march as soon as the man be able over the line into canada terrence assure fernando that so far as he be concern he have no intention of leave america but the matter have to be handle carefully they be on a thinly populated coast and captain bone have enough english marine to enforce he authority then how can we escape ask fernando lave it all to I say the irishman as fernando be incapable of do anything himself he very naturally leave it all to he irish friend now i want ye to be too sick to travel for a week by that time i 'll have the captain all right and snug enough though badly bruise and stunned fernando have no bone break at any time within three day after the shipwreck he could have leave the barn but follow the advice of terrence he assume a stupid state and refuse to talk with any of the officer who call to see he terrence become nurse to the invalid as well as the brewer of punch for the captain only one other person be take into the secret plan of the irishman that be the negro job job be delighted gwine ter run away he chuckle yah yah yah dat be glorious i tell yer di chile be not no britisher i tole yer dar be not no angler saxun blood in dese vein job be install assistant nurse over fernando and when the captain ask the negro about he the black face become sober and job shake he woolly head say : dun no massa spect he be gwine ter die he be awful bad captain bone give utterance to a burst of profanity and seriously hope the wounded sailor would either get well or die and be very quick about it fernando hear he as he lay in the barn loft and could not refrain from chuckle we have get to move soon growl the captain no ship will ever put into this port for we we must march to halifax golly guess di chile see himself marchin ' ter halifax the negro murmur when the captain have leave the barn captain bone be quarter at the best fisherman 's cabin in the neighborhood it be not much of a shelter but it be the best he could find captain bone be provoke at the delay in fernando 's recovery he know he be a impressed american and if he leave he he would be lose to the service and yet he dare not much longer delay go to halifax he be bargaining with a coast schooner to take himself and crew to halifax when one evening terrence come to he with a very serious face as if the fortune of great britain be in peril captain it be bad news i have for ye say terrence the brandy be all go and divil a bit o ' whiskey can be have for love or money this be alarming to captain bone but terrence suggest that three mile away live a farmer condit whose cellar abound with keg of apple jack and cider condit be a rabid republican and would not give a briton a drop if he be die for it but if the captain would be take into he confidence he have a little scheme to propose which have a trifle of risk in it just enough to give spice to it he plan be nothing more than to dress in citizen 's clothes enter the cellar after night and carry away some if not all of the keg of apple jack captain bone who enjoy a frolic think the plan a excellent one but he beg to allow the first lieutenant to become a party to the frolic this be just as terrence wish for he have intend to suggest the first lieutenant himself it be agree that on Saturday night next the three dress in citizen 's clothes be to go to the home of the farmer enter he cellar and secure enough apple jack and hard cider to alleviate the thirst of captain bone during he stay in the neighborhood farmer condit the day before the intended burglary receive a very mysterious letter in a very mysterious manner it read as follow : farmer condit : Saturday night you house be to be rob i be one of a band of robber who be to rob you i be force to join they or be kill and will have to go with they that night have a few constable ready to seize they they will not fight but let the man in tall peaked brown hat white trousers and gray coat escape for that be I if you could let I escape and seize the other you would set at liberty a poor fellow creature who warn you at the risk of he life you friend on the night in question terrence wear a tall peaked brown hat with black band he also wear white trousers and a gray coat the three set off in a cart which terrence hire to bring back the treasure it be dark before they commence they journey for the officer do not want the man to know of the affair they reach the farm house of mr condit and prepare to enter it and begin operation the cart and mule be leave under some tree it be now ten o'clock and the house be quite dark slowly they creep up to it terrence ask himself if the farmer have heed he warning like many farm-house cellar there be a trap door open on the outside to this cellar door they make they way terrence who be accustom to such affair have provide himself with a lantern which he be to light when they enter the cellar they descend the step and have scarcely reach the floor when footstep be hear descend a flight of step from the inside of the house hide behind the barrel and box ivery mother 's son of ye whisper the irishman the officer be conceal themselves when suddenly the door open and a portly elderly gentleman in he shirt sleeve knee breeches and slipper carry a light candle in one hand and a pistol in the other descend he see captain bone and he lieutenant try to hide behind a barrel the captain in he excitement have draw a pistol and be cock it terrence at this moment escape with a yell the old gentleman drop the candle which lay on the floor the thin blaze ascend upward and dimly light the scene at he yell there suddenly rush into the cellar half a dozen stout man arm with gun and pistol and the suppose burglar be arrest next morning captain bone and he chief officer be snugly repose in the county jail while terrence fernando and job set out across the country for augusta from this point they take passage in a swift coaster for new york at new york they separate terrence go to philadelphium job to baltimore and fernando to he home in ohio he journey be long and tedious at the close of a hot day in autumn 1811 the old stage coach come in sight of the dear old home the past four year seem like a terrible dream the old familiar spot where every tree and flower be endear by sacred remembrance be never half so precious as now he gray-haired father and sorrowful mother who have long give he up for dead weep over he and thank god that he have return to again bless they home friend relative and neighbor hearing of the sudden return of fernando all gather on that evening and the youth tell the sad story of he impressment and slavery he tell all save he love affair that secret be too sacred when he have finish good old mr winner be weep bitterly and there be scarce a dry eye in the house for all remember that poor sukey be still a slave to the rapacity and cruelty of a ambitious monarch chapter xii war the story of the impressment service and suffering of fernando steven and he friend be no exaggeration well authenticate history show that there be thousand of case similar and even worse than theirs the conduct of england be without precedent and unbearable they great need of man might have be some excuse for impressment of american but there be a spice of hatred in they cruel treatment of the unfortunate sailor we read much about the ruler mould the destiny of the people but in we republic the people mould the destiny of the ruler long before the president have dare express a thought of war there be staid old western farmer level-headed old fellow who declare that war be inevitable america be not a country to be rule by one man the people rule it and every man think for himself so that out of the conflict of opinion the truth be usually reach before even the fiery congress of 1812 have take up the subject of hostility the legislature of the several state urge by they farmer constituency have by concurrent resolution declare in favor of war but the timid president influence by he own conviction and the opinion of he cabinet still hesitate finally a committee of democrat wait on mr madison and tell he plainly in substance that the supporter of he administration have determine upon war with england that the patience of the people have become exhaust at he delay and that unless a declaration of war should soon be make he renomination and re-election would probably not be accomplish the president consent to yield he own conviction to the will of he political friend thus we see that president madison be not move through patriotic motive to declare war against great britain but from personal ambition patriotic motive follow personal conviction be they right or wrong on the first of April 1812 he send a confidential message to congress propose as a measure preliminary to a declaration of war the passage of a law lay a embargo upon all commerce with the united state for the space of sixty day this be do on the fourth of April and on the eighth louisiana be admit into the union as a state at the end of the sixty day embargo madison send a message to congress in which he review the difficulty with great britain portray the aggression of that power and intimate the necessity of war for the maintenance of the honor and dignity of the republic the message be refer to the committee on foreign relation when a majority of they -- john c calhoun of south carolinia felix grundy of tennessee john smillie of pennsylvanium john a harper of new hampshire joseph desha of kentucky and seaver of massachusett report June 3 a manifesto as the basis of a declaration of war on the next day a bill to that effect draw by attorney-general pinckney in the following form be adopt and present by mr calhoun : that war be and the same be hereby declare to exist between the unite kingdom of great britain and ireland and the dependency thereof and the united state of america and they territory and that the president of the united state be hereby authorize to use the whole land and naval force of the united state to carry the same into effect and to issue to private armed vessel of the united state commission or letter of marque and general reprisal in such form as he shall think proper and under the seal of the united state against the vessel goods and effect of the government of the say unite kingdom of great britain and ireland and the subject thereof pend these proceedings congress sit with closed door the bill pass the house of representative by a vote of 75 to 49 and the senate by 19 to 13 the president 's immediate signature make it a law and two day later June 19 1812 mr madison issue a proclamation in which he formally declare war against the offend government and people thus begin the second war with great britain generally know in the annals of history as the war of 1812 though it be in reality the second war for independence it be the war which establish independence beyond the cavil of a doubt and sustain the honor of the nation immediate measure be take by congress to sustain the declaration of war the president be authorize to enlist 25000 man for the regular army accept 50000 volunteer and call out 100000 militia for the defense of the seacoast about $ 3000000 be appropriate for the navy there be very few man in the united state train in the art of war at this time west point be in its infancy have be authorize only ten year before and as yet have not be able to accomplish anything the older officer of the revolution be already in they grave and the younger one be far advance in life yet to the latter alone the government feel compel to look for its military leader henry dearborn a meritorious new hampshire colonel in the continental army be commission major-general and commander-in-chief he principal brigadier be jame wilkinson who be on the staff of general gate in the capture of burgoyne wade hampton who have do good partisan service with marion sumter and other in south carolinium william hull who have serve as colonel in the old war for independence and joseph bloomfield who have be a captain in the new jersey line at that time hull be a governor of the territory of michigan satisfied that the american navy could not cope with that of great britain the american base they hope for success largely upon the suppose dissatisfaction of the inhabitant of canada and other british colonial possession on they border it be believe that the canadian would flock to the american standard as soon as it be raise on they soil the american people have always cling to the belief that canadian be not loyal to great britain it be the mistake of 1775 it be the mistake of 1812 and strange to say american still hug the delusion to they breast that canada favor annexation they have reason for they belief only in the doctrine that such a annexation would be in the interest of canada disregard the stubborn fact that in political matter prejudice rather than interest control canada be then divide into the upper and lower province the former extend westward from montreal along the shore of the st lawrence and lake ontario to lake huron and the detroit river it include about one hundred thousand inhabitant who be principally the family of american loyalist who have be compel to abandon they home in the state at the close of the war of the revolution and have since live under the foster care of the british government they be

the government give hull discretionary power for invade canada general sir isaac brock lieutenant governor of upper canada be in command of the british force on July 12 1812 hull cross the detroit river with he whole force and encamp at some unfinished work at sandwich preparatory to a attack on fort malden near the present amherstburg from this point hull issue a proclamation promising protection to the inhabitant who would remain at home and death to all who should side with the indian then gather under tecumseh at malden general proctor be send to take command at fort malden while

chicago be invest while a detachment under major van horne send down to the west side of the detroit river to escort a supply train from ohio be attack by the british and indian and after a sharp

fury of the savage instigate by he officer hull answer this by a spirited refusal and a declaration that the fort and town would be defend to the last extremity the british commence a cannonade and hull be greatly distressed at the number of woman and child in the fort expose to the fire of the enemy the more charitably inclined historian interpret he act as the result of tender regard for the helpless and innocent rather than cowardice especially as he daughter and she little child come near be slay by a ricochet cannon-ball which almost annihilate a group of officer in front of the door of the house in which the mother and she child be the firing continue until next day the alarm and consternation of general hull have now become extreme on the 12th the field officer suspect that the

success mr madison could not repress a smile henry lay before the president the strong documentary evidence which clearly prove that great britain while indulge in the most friendly expression toward the united state and negotiate treaty be secretly engage in effort to destroy the young republic of the west by foment disaffection toward it among a portion of the people and intriguing with disaffected politician with a expectation with the aid of british arm to be able to separate new england from the union and re-annex that territory to the british dominion madison who be just about to declare war against great britain be well satisfied of the importance of henry 's disclosure examine they carefully he ask : what do you ask for these papers lave that all to I misther madison say

britain the inhabitant of new england be annoy by the imply disparagement of the patriotism of they section of the union both party try to make political capital out of the affair the democrat vehemently reiterate the charge that the federalist be a british party and disunionist while the opposition declare it be only a political move of the administration to damage they party insure the re-election of madison in the autumn of 1812 and offer a excuse for the war the acrimony cause by these partisan feeling be at its height when the new england governor refuse to send they militia to the frontier and the british government in declare the blockade of the american coast discriminate in favor of that section that the british mistaking partisan feeling for unpatriotic disaffection hope to carry out they plan for disunion there be no doubt but the suspicion that the new england people contemplated disunion and annexation to the english colony be probably without foundation

with some of the member when war be declare he send the word to president that he be ready to set out at once and shortly after take command of a privateer which he father fit out while new england be

rifleman have at black rock under the british heavy gun capture the war-schooner _ caledonium _ and burn the _ detroit _ while these many story of the bravery of american be thrill the heart of patriot the cowardice of the pompous general smythe at buffalo cause much ridicule and humiliation despite all he boast and threat to invade canada he remain on american soil he be finally dismiss from the service and in a petition to congress to reinstate he he pray for permission to die for he country he petition excite much ridicule and at a public celebration of washington 's birthday a wit propose the following : general smythe 's petition to congress to die for he country may it be order that the prayer of say petition be grant early in January 1813 fernando steven ' company be ohio volunteer be for some reason he never know what transfer to the army of the west general william h harrison have succeed hull in command of this army historian do not accord to general harrison the distinction of greatness though he be one of the successful general of the last war with england it be under he that first victory be gain over the british in the northwest though he name go down to posterity connect with the battle of the thame colonel richard m johnson be the real hero of that conflict johnson 's kentucky rifleman fight and win the battle though harrison receive the credit harrison be even more honorably remember for he indian war and as the hero of tippecanoe gain a fast hold on the public heart but tippecanoe be only a skirmish and view in the light of a battle could hardly be consider a great victory the american loss be probably as great if not greater than the indian and it be only a accident that harrison be not surprised tippecanoe be fight by the soldier and to they coolness and courage belong the victory critically speak general harrison be inferior in military genius to both jackson and brown he want the terrible energy the almost reckless bravery which characterize these two leader he belong to a different school altogether he be a policy of fabius rather than of marcellus and this not from necessity but for choice the bent of he mind be to be prudent economic of means willing to listen to advice a very excellent qualification for a general or a statesman the dispute between harrison and winchester have be settle before captain rise with he company reach the army and join general winchester then on he march to the raisin January 21 1813 as winchester 's volunteer be mostly kentuckian fernando find many friend among they some have

off he manly form fernando as he ascend the path to the house do not dream that he be heroic or fine-looking when he reach the house he pause a moment on the piazza just as he have on that evening

schooled himself that as he take she hand he say in a most commonplace manner : i be send here miss lane i be a soldier and wherever duty call i go be it pleasant or unpleasant morgianna be not prepare for this the cool off-hand manner seem to hardly indicate the respect of friendship she face grow deathly pale for a moment and she almost cease breathing but she gain she self-control and in a tone as commonplace and cool as he own hope he be well and that he would not be kill in the come struggle the come struggle with the _ xenophon _ be nothing compare to he present struggle fernando still love morgianna five year have only add to the intensity of he love but he have once make a simpleton of himself and he determine not to do so again thus two hungry soul thirst for each other 's love act the cold part of casual acquaintance could the veil have be lift could the barrier have be break down what misery might have be spare but it be ever thus humanity be contradictory and the heart 's impulse be hold in check miss lane this house can not be a safe place in the come struggle say fernando we have prepare bomb-proof shelter for the woman and child and i hope you will accept

monster sea-bird in the bay not a mile away the _ xenophon _ be in no hurry to commence she have she prey so that there be no possible chance of escape and the officer and man eat breakfast and walk about the deck talk and joke on the work before they through a powerful glass which captain lane furnish he fernando recognize captain snipe stand on the quarter deck smoking a cigar fernando have the

be aboard that ship sukey 's face be deathly white and he finger convulsively clutch the air as if grasp at a imaginary throat fernando be stand on the parapet when a wreath of smoke curl up from the ship 's side follow by the boom of a heavy gun and a ball come whiz through the air and strike the breastwork it be nine minute after ten o'clock when the first shot be fire this shot be the signal for a broadside and a shower of ball with three or four shell come scream through the air strike the wall of the fort or explode over it one of the shell bury itself in the sand but a few foot from fernando and burst scattering sand and gravel over he fire cry fernando without move from he position immediately the thirty-two pounder and four smaller gun belch forth fire and thunder fernando watch the effect through the glass the thirty-two go wild and the shot from the smaller piece fall short he turn and give some instruction to the gunner while a shell come scream over he head and burst a short distance away kill one of the marine fernando there be not no need of you stand up there cry sukey you be not in the game till we get near enough to use rifle divil a bit will the blackguard iver come near enough for that cry terrence boldly mount the breastwork captain lave I have a squint through yer glass and terrence assume a liberty which he only could take the glass from he hand the scream shell and whistle shot continue to come from the _ xenophon _ faith thim bee buzz nicely round a fellow 's ear add terrence fernando seize he glass when the thirty-two be again sight and fix it on the ship as the heavy boom shake the earth he see a great splash of water twelve foot from the bow let some one else train the gun he cry you miss the mark all appeal to fernando to come down from he dangerous position be unavail he anxiety to pierce the _ xenophon _ with the thirty-two keep he on the parapet direct the gunner while ball and shell shriek about he job try three shot but only one do any injury and that be some insignificant damage to the rig fernando see at once they disadvantage oh if we only have one experienced gunner he would drive the ship from the harbor he think lieutenant willard try three or four shot and one strike the bow with glass in hand fernando remain on the earthwork watch the effect of they ball and give order to the gunner while ball and shell fly scream around he one shell explode near the embrasure of one of the smaller gun kill one and wound four as yet they have not touch one of the enemy and the young commandant be chagrined anxious and annoyed he lose he temper and rave at the gunner who be do they best they lack science he brave rifleman stand under the earthwork grasp they gun which be useless now while they lament that the briton be not in range officer citizen and even private implored fernando to come down a shell explode in the air and a piece graze he shoulder yet he keep he place on the rampart terrence malone who could see no reason for court death have seek shelter behind a gun carriage fernando 's anxiety and mortification increase as he witness the repeat failure of he gunner to hull the _ xenophon _ amid smoke dust and whizzing missile he keep he post the thunder of gun the whizzing ball and shriek shell be unheard in he great anxiety to defeat the british suddenly a hand clutch he arm and a silvery voice which he recognize in a instant cry : this be folly come down -- come down from this certain death morgianna you here he cry for heaven 's sake go to the bomb-proof shelter you must not expose yourself here i will not go a step until you come from the rampart she cling to he and appeal so earnestly the tear of anxiety and fear start from she eye while she white plead face be upturned to he that he could not deny she all other appeal have be unheeded but morgianna 's he could not refuse a wild cheer go up from the american within the fort as morgianna descend from the redoubt with the daring captain he hurry she away to the bomb-shelter where she father lay rage and fume because he infirmity would not allow he to take part in the contest fernando obtain a promise from morgianna that she would not venture from the shelter by promise in return to keep off the redoubt the british shell be tell on the american fort though the wall be strong and resist they ball several man have fall beneath they shell two solid shot and one shell strike captain lane 's elegant mansion on the hill fire from spite as the house be far remove from the fort and no one be near it a cannon-ball enter the great broad bay window overlook the sea make a wreck of the furniture in the parlor crash through the wall shiver a tall mirror and spread havoc in the room beyond the siege continue all day long and late in the afternoon just one hour before sunset the redcoat appear on the wooded hill back of the town and open fire with two small piece and musket fernando 's rifleman have be wait for this and with wild yell they leap the redoubt deploy along the stone fence and house and pick off the redcoat so rapidly that they flee pell mell to they own work glad to escape the bullet of those unerring rifleman the cannonade keep up until long after midnight the sky be ablaze with circle shell and the headland reverberate with ten thousand echo all the gun in the fort save the thirty-two be silent for the smaller cannon at that range be useless the soldier in the fort lay on they arm and fernando sleep none with anxious face he go the round of the fort occasionally watch through a embrasure the ship beyond and the circling shell during the night three more of they number be kill and six wound while as yet they have do the enemy no hurt shortly after midnight the firing grow slower and a hour later cease altogether morning dawn slowly and the flag still float over the badly battered fort a sullen gloomy silence have fall over the officer and man they watch the enemy who at daylight begin to warp the ship in a little nearer that she gun might be more effective fernando be silent and he brow dark there seem but one thing possible and that be defeat reinforcement need not be expect the _ xenophon _ come a little nearer to shore then let go she anchor again and lay broadside to the fort it be quite evident that she be afraid to come too close lest some blunder shot would strike she all of a sudden a sheet of flame and cloud of smoke from she side conceal the ship from view and ball once more rain about the fort the fire this day be more destructive than on the precede one house within the enclosure be completely batter down the church which have be convert into a hospital be set on fire fernando discover it in flame and run thither to hurry out the wound enter the burning building through which a shell go scream he be horror-stricken and amaze to find morgianna at one of the bunk bind up the wound of a sufferer morgianna morgianna he cry why do you risk you life here there be suffer and death here she answer be i better than those who risk they life for I morgianna you must not yours be no common life -- he begin in the excitement of the moment he almost forget himself she be about to answer when he say noble woman do not for heaven 's sake run needless danger they hurry the wound from the burning building another house lower down the hill be also on fire it be so near to the great gun that the heat almost blister the man who work it and for awhile they magazine be in great peril the soldier do all in they power to extinguish the flame but both church and house burn to the ground night come once more and the american be reduce to the sorest strait soon after dark the cannonading cease and a silence of death fall over the fort break only by the groan of some poor wounded fellow the people within the fort go about talk in whisper three body which they have not have time to bury lay stark and silent under the shed and there be nine fresh grave on the hillside in addition more than thirty of the defender be disabled from wound captain steven sukey terrence and lieutenant willard be hold a consultation in a room of the old tavern lieutenant willard say : captain steven there be no other alternative we must surrender to hold out longer be murder if we have a few competent gunner we might drive she away but with we inexperienced man we be waste ammunition and life to resist there be one chance say fernando perhaps we could carry the ship by the board by the board divil a bit put in terrence why they would sink we all before we could get within a hundred yard of the plague ship sukey remember that captain snipe he avowed enemy be on board the _ xenophon _ be eager to make the effort to carry she by the board it will be a desperate undertaking say lieutenant willard if we have sailor instead of rifleman it might be do very easily but it be a desperate chance yet we be in a desperate situation and faith ye 'll come to a desperate end if ye thry to carry that ship by the board interrupted terrence fernando muster three hundred man and ascertain there be boat to take they to the _ xenophon _ be about to give the order to march to the water when suddenly volley after volley of musket and pistol ring out from the ship the american have pass from the work and be draw up on the sand when they hear the firing at the _ xenophon _ they come to a halt to guess and wonder at the cause it be decide to march the man by a round-about course to the promontory and embark in boat for the ship by do this they could come upon the vessel from the side opposite to the fort and effect a more complete surprise two dozen bold fisherman be entrust to take the boat along the rocky shore to the point of embarkation the night be quite dark and the water rough so it require great skill to accomplish this difficult feat fernando and he troops have gain the neck of land reach to the promontory and fear that the enemy might have land a force there and that they would be draw into a ambuscade he halt he troops in a dense growth of wood and leave they with lieutenant willard while he with sukey terrence and job creep forward to reconnoitre they have almost reach the promontory and convinced that there be no one in ambush be about to return to the main force when suddenly a object present itself to they eye which absolutely root they to the spot at about twenty or thirty yard distant where but the moment before the long line of horizon terminate the view there now stand a strange figure which might be six and might be twelve foot in height it have evidently rise up out of the ground and be float in the air as there seem to be nothing to connect it with the earth there be a body of spotless white a obscure mass which might be a head and two long white straight arm spread apart like a cross this strange creature be advance toward they oh golly massa look ye dar dat be a ghost whisper the darkey a banshee begorra say terrence fernando be impressed that the strange vision be the result of some english trickery while sukey cock he gun declare : if it be mortal i 'll soon make it immortal hold sukey whisper fernando let we see what it be before you fire golly massa it be comin ' dis way fernando could see that the object with its strange incongruous head its long arm of which it now seem to have three or four be advance toward they over the uneven ground and he give the order to fall back until they be nearer the troops when within about one hundred pace fernando make a stand and cry : halt this be the first word utter loud enough to reach the strange four-armed one-headed but legless spectre it produce a wonderful effect for the odd figure wheel about and start off at something like a run sukey bring he gun to he shoulder and fire the report of the gun be the signal for the rifleman under lieutenant willard to charge and all give chase to the spectre do not fire another shot cry fernando the spectre have not go a hundred pace before it stumble over a loose stone and fall in a moment terrence malone have seize it and cry : huzzah boy i have catch the divil himsilf the spectre prove to be a very material like person in the form of a tall sailor with a white jacket and cap and blue trousers he superabundance of arm could be account for by the long white oar which he have be carry on he shoulder and which he explain be he only weapon offensive or defensive where be you from ask fernando i be from he majesty 's frigate _ xenophon _ he answer be you a deserter ask fernando yes sir i be a american by birth and will die before i raise my hand against my country to-day because i refuse to work at the gun i be arrest to be flog in the morning hang or shoot at the pleasure of captain snipe i believe i know that voice -- begin captain steven holy golly it be massa st mark yell a voice behind they and job tear he way through the crowd and fling he arm about the sailor cry : massa st mark massa st mark be it you faith it be the best gunner in the british navy cry terrence fernando have no trouble in recognize in the stranger the gentlemanly gunner of the _ macedonian _ who have save he from be flog terrence fernando job and sukey crowd about the newcomer and for a moment ply he with question he explain that have slip he handcuffs he rush on deck seize the oar which he still carry knock down two sentry and leap overboard they fire a hundred shot at he but be a excellent swimmer and the night be dark he manage to escape lie on he back hold to the oar he watch for the flash of they gun and pistol and when they fire duck he head under the water the appearance of mr hugh st mark naturally cause another consultation he discourage they desperate attempt to carry the ship by the board and fernando after send six fisherman to the headland to acquaint they companion there with the change march with he force back to the fort a hour later the other come when day dawn the _ xenophon _ renew she cannonading mr hugh st mark be give charge of the thirty-two and after carefully measure the distance with a experienced eye he weigh the powder and load the gun fernando watch the flight of the first ball which go whiz over the leeward rail across the deck and out at the opposite port into the sea the second shot cut some of the rig the british suppose those two shot accident but after the third they be convince that there be a experienced hand at the gun fernando in he anxiety to mark the effect of the third shot forget he promise to morgianna and with the glass in hand mount the rampart the heavy boom of the cannon shake sea and shore there be no need of a glass to mark the effect the ball crash through from side to side send the splinter fly in every direction a wild cheer rise from the fort and fernando see five or six carry below the deck while one of the gun be dismount and useless in a few seconds the great gun be again load this time the ball crash through the hull the fifth shot strike the mizzenmast about four foot above deck and cut it almost away victory be ours cry fernando wave he sword in the air hurrah for ould ireland and the united state foriver shout terrence leap on the embankment and dance a jig but the _ xenophon _ have not give up the contest yet she continue to fire she ball and shell with murderous intent until the ball from st mark 's direction have cut she mainmast down it fall over on the lee side drag with it the fore mainstay and crippling the rig to such a extent that captain snipe begin to fear he could not get he vessel out of the harbor the weight of the mainmast hang over the side of the vessel be so great that the vessel heel over to leeward a dozen carpenter with axis fly to cut away the wreck and the ship right herself while other be rejoice hugh st mark be busy send ball after ball crash into the _ xenophon _ as if he have many old score to settle sukey who stand by he side say : mr st mark do not hit the captain -- leave he for I the wind and tide bear the _ xenophon _ to the mouth of the harbor just beyond the point of duck island where she be temporarily safe from the ball of the avenge thirty-two it soon become evident that the land force under lieutenant matson intend to march to the point of land embark and return to the ship fernando determine to spoil they plan he muster two hundred and fifty of he soldier marine and militia and start to head they off lieutenant willard be leave alone in charge of the fort a villager who know a nearer route guide they by it to a pass between two hill where the briton would be compel to march sukey and terrence be send forward to reconnoitre and as they come in sight of the narrow valley surround by hill they see the head of the column of redcoat come they banner uphold to the breeze terrence wheeling about run with all speed back to the advance soldier and cry : come on I boy it be a divil 's own time we 'll have of it in the valley all to ourselves halt fix bayonet command fernando in a moment the gleaming bayonet be on each gun forward -- double -- quick the soldier at a run dash into the valley just as the british appear two volley deliver in quick succession and they be at it steel to steel fernando barehead engage a stout briton in a hand-to-hand struggle which a quick thrust from sukey 's bayonet end next captain steven find himself hotly engage with he old enemy lieutenant matson they blade flash angrily for a moment but as the lieutenant 's man throw down they arm and beg for quarter he realize the folly of resist longer and yield he stubborn pride make the struggle hard he offer he sword to he victor which he politely decline keep you sword lieutenant say fernando though you be my enemy i trust you have not forget that you be a gentleman i trust not you shall be parole as soon as we reach the fort the briton stack they arm and march in double file under a guard to the fort ox and cart be send out for the arm and two piece of artillery which be bring into the fort silent and majestic as a uncrowned prince seem neither elate nor depress by the victory stand the gunner hugh st mark by the side of the old thirty-two with which he have fire the shot that save the fort he be tall straight broad-shouldered with hair once chestnut but now almost gray he age might be anywhere between forty and fifty year so calm majestic and mysterious do he seem as with fold arm he stand gaze unconcernedly about he that fernando be constrain to ask himself : who be he chapter xix new orlean amid the exciting scene which follow in such rapid succession no one have notice that the weather have undergo a wonderful change by the time the prisoner be comfortably quarter the sun have set and the sky be obscure with dark cloud from which constant flash of lightning be emit the distant roll of thunder and the sighing of the wind give warning of the approach of a storm the _ xenophon _ be in a poor condition to weather a storm to-night say lieutenant willard with she hull raked fore and aft a dozen time she

packenham no doubt of it sukey he would wipe out the score of what be left of one hundred and eight say sukey swallow he last bite of biscuit at one gulp and examine the priming in he gun colonel smiley be first to give order to fire from fernando 's part of the work and there ring out a volley all along the line the brass piece on they right begin blaze away with the heavy iron cannon down toward the river which with the rattle of small arm almost make the ground quake under they foot directly after the firing begin captain patterson from knox county kentucky come run along he leap on the breastwork and stoop a moment to look through the darkness as well as he could shout : shoot low boy shoot low rake they rake they they be comin ' on they all-fours it be so dark that little could be see until just about the time the battle cease the morning have dawn but the dense fog and thick smoke obscure the sun the kentuckian do not seem to appreciate they danger but loaded and fire and swear laugh and joke as though it be a frolic all rank and section be soon break and after the first volley every man load and fire at will sukey do not fire as often as some of the other but at every shot he go up to the breastwork look over until he could see a redcoat and then take aim blaze away after each shot he pause to write in he book lieutenant ashby who have have a brother kill at the river raisin seem frantic with rage and fiendish glee he run up and down the line yell : we 'll pay you now for the river raisin we 'll give you something to remember the river raisin when the british come up on the opposite side of the breastwork have no gun he pick up a rifle barrel which have be break from the stock and throw it over at they then find a iron bar he leap upon the breastwork and throw it at the mass of head crowd forward to scale they work while the conflict be at its height when packenham be lead the last grand charge against the earthwork major steven ' attention be direct by repeat and vociferous shout to come down to a object on he right turn he eye in that direction he see sukey standing coolly on the top of the breastwork peer into the darkness for something to shoot at the ball be whistle as thick as hail around he and cut up the dirt at he foot come down sukey come down fernando command sukey turn round and hold up the flap of he old broad-brimmed hat with one hand to see who be speak to he answer : oh never mind fernando -- here 's sukey -- i do not want to waste my powder and i would like to know how i be to shoot until i see something i be watch for that man on the big white horse it be not long until sukey get he eye on the man on the big white horse and level he rifle pull the trigger at that instant packenham fall bleeding and die into the arm of sir duncan mcdougall he favorite aid who perform a similar service for general ross when he be mortally wound a few month before sukey coolly descend from the breastwork and sit down at the root of a tree take out he book and say : i have balance the score they flog I but by the eternal i be more than even during the action some of the tennesseean become mixed with smiley 's regiment one of they be kill about five yard from where fernando stand a ball pass through he head and from the range of british bullet it seem quite probable that he be accidentally shoot by some of the american this be the only man kill near where fernando stand the firing begin to slacken when he fall while three or four man be carry the body away a white flag be raise on the opposite side of the breastwork and the firing cease the white flag be a handkerchief on a sword or stick it be raise by a british major who be cut off and unable to retreat with the main army when the firing cease he come over the

and hand it back in a instant fernando see he sink backward he call to sukey who be near and they ease he down against the side of a tent where he give two or three gasp and be dead he have be shoot through the breast a number of british soldier and officer have seek shelter from the fire of the american in the ditch on the other side of the breastwork these of course be unable to retreat come in and surrender when the smoke lift from the battlefield it disclose a terrible spectacle the field look like a sea of blood for it be literally cover with redcoat straight out before they position the entire space occupy by the british troops be cover with dead or wound in some place where the line have make a stand they lay in pile like winrow of hay while the interval between be more thinly sprinkle about two hundred yard directly in front of they position lay a large dapple gray horse which be say to have belong to packenham nearly half way between the horse and the breastwork be a heap of slay mark the spot where packenham fall he horse have retreat some distance before it go down the battle be over and sukey sit down to finish he breakfast which have be interrupt by the stir event

never fight to a finish nor be the result as satisfactory as might have be hope have peace be make a little later america might have obtain much better term the war have be wage under great difficulty by the american who be not wholly unite and lack money man arm ship and experience yet under all these great difficulty the united state come out of the war with the respect of the world such as it have never before enjoy it become formidable to europe as a great and vigorous power with which it be not safe to trifle this be still more apparent when the government declare war on the dey of algier one of the pirate prince of north africa who for hundred of year have make war on the commerce of all nation almost with impunity have violate they treaty president madison send a naval force to the mediterranean which on June 17th and 19th capture two algerian vessels-of-war and threaten algier the dey make peace and give liberty to all prisoner without ransom and full satisfaction for

french revolution and finally the failure of napoleon bonaparte and the re-establishment of the old monarchy in france as the result first of the excess of the french republic and then of the military interference of bonaparte with the exist state of thing in europe have a important influence in modify the politics of the republican party in the united state so they come partially in jefferson 's administration and completely by the close of madison 's to follow the wise and vigorous policy pursue by washington and the federal party while the general government and the institution of the country become deeply imbue with the regard to popular rights and attention to the interest and will of the people that form the lead idea of jefferson and the original democratic or as it be then call republican party the lead event of monroe 's two administration be the attention give to internal improvement among which may be mention the erie canal in new york the encouragement of manufacture the acquisition of florida by treaty the seminole war the missourus compromise December 14th 1819 the monroe doctrine promulgate in 1822 and the visit of general lafayette to the united

of the state of missourus -rrb- slavery might exist but it be prohibit in the region north of that line a member of congress from georgium prophetically say in the course of the debate : a fire have be kindle which all the water of the ocean can not put out and which only sea of blood can extinguish have the missourus compromise be keep inviolate to the present day slavery might still have exist below thirty-six degree and thirty minute north latitude the commerce of the united state be greatly injure by swarm of privateer under spanish-american flag who have degenerate into pirate and so become outlaw subject to chastisement by any nation they infested the west indian sea and the northern coast of south america against these pirate and to protect american commerce the united state

next year commodore porter with a larger force enter the pirate infested water and almost completely destroy the buccaneer it be the policy of the government of the united state to favor the revolt of the spanish-american province whose flag these pirate have dishonor as a means for prevent the establishment in the future of monarchical power on the american continent the latter policy be avow by the president and have never be lose sight of by we government and be know in history as the monroe doctrine accordingly on the recommendation of the president congress early in 1822 resolve by a unanimous vote to recognize the independence of five of the revolt colony and appropriate $ 100000 to defray the expense of envoy to the seat of government of each whom the president soon afterward

they find captain snipe dead among the rock seem ever to ring in he ear vengeance be mine i will repay saith the lord he proceed to a careful study of the sentence and from that become a student of the bible a few day after they return he say : fernando what i do during the war be right but be not do in the right spirit i shoot from revenge i kill because i hate the british officer i seem to feel the stinging cut of the cat on my back that flogging make a devil of I i hate the sight of a redcoat it be all go now -- not that my revenge be satiated but because i be change a new light have be open up to my mind and i can see it be no disgrace to be flog for freedom it be the ignorance of my enemy that i should have pity instead of condemn fernando suspect the bent of sukey 's mind long before he make the announcement that he intend to enter the ministry back to the maryland academy at baltimore go sukey he enter the theological department and four year later begin a long and successful ministerial career major steven have not forget he promise to pay the maryland village a visit if he have be dispose to forget he promise which he be not he would have be remind of it by a

none of these letter or invitation have stronger effect to induce he to take a journey to maryland than the closely pen missive do though it be only a friendly letter fernando set out the first of June peace again reign over the fair land and the country be all ablaze with glory the ploughboy 's whistle be hear in every field in harmony with the lark the journey by mail coach be a pleasant one for be in no great haste he travel by easy stage stop over frequently to rest he see on every hand evidence of awaken interest and prosperity new house be build new town be lay out new field be invite the ploughman the busy hum of industry everywhere fill the heart of the patriot and he more than once exclaim : what a great country be ours he arrive at baltimore at the close of a delightful day and alight in front of the principal tavern some one rush across the street push pedestrian right and left and howl in a voice loud enough to be hear three block away : tear and age clear the track -- that be himself -- divil a one else this exclamation come from terrence malone who barehead and in shirt sleeve be rush through the throng of people on the street in reckless disregard of high hat and crinoline woman scream and one hysterical creature try to faint but be restrain by the fear that she elegant costume might be soil call the watchman take that fellow and lock he up knock he down who be the wretch these be only a part of the imprecation heap on the devoted head of terrence malone who regardless of everything and everybody burst he way through the crowd and reach fernando 's side o murther o holy mother o mose be it yersilf safe afther all the poor fellow could say no more but burst into tear for a more tender heart never beat in any breast terrence have just arrive a hour
