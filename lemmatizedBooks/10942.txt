when a man be twenty-one and have have no experience and graduate from a small college where he room alone in splendor and possess a gift of word and a certain delight in reading and be throw into new and to he romantic surroundings -- when all these star of chance cross they orbit he begin to write a novel the novel never have anything to do with the aforesaid new and romantic surroundings neither have it the faintest connection with anything the author have ever see that would limit he imagination once he be well settle in he new home and the first excitement of novel impression have wear off bennington de laney begin to write regularly three hour a day he do he scribble with a fountain pen on typewriter paper and leave a broad right-hand margin just as he have see brook do in it he experience above all a delightful feeling of power he enjoy to the full he ability to swing gorgeous involved sentence phrase after phrase down the long arc of rhetoric without a pause without a quiver until they rush unhast up the other slope to end in beautiful word polysyllabic but with just the right number of syllable intersperse be short sentence he count the word in one or the other of these two sort carefully note the relation they bear to each other on occasion he despair because they do not bear the right relation and he also drag out squirm the anglo-saxon and latin derivation and set they up in a row that he might observe they respective number he be uneasily conscious that he ought in the dread of college anathema to use the former but he love the many-syllabled crash or modulate music of the latter also there be the question of get variety into he paragraph length it be all excellent practice and yet this technique absorb as it be count as nothing in comparison with the subject-matter the method be talent the subject-matter be genius and genius have evolve a idea which no one have ever think of before -- something brand new under the sun it go without say that the idea symbolize a great truth one department the more impersonal of bennington 's critical faculty assure he that the idea would take rank with the idea of plato and emerson emerson bennington worship plato he also worship -- because emerson tell he to he have never read plato himself the other the more personal and modest however have perforce to doubt this not because it doubt the idea but because bennington be not naturally conceit to settle the discrepancy he begin to write he lay the scene in arabium and decide to call it _ aliri : a romance of all time _ because he like the smooth easy flow of the syllable the consciousness that he could do all this sugar-coated he wild western experience which otherwise might have be a little disagreeable he could comfort himself with the reflection that he be superior if ridiculous in spot he be certainly the latter the locality into which he destiny have lead he lay in the tumultuous center of the hill about thirty mile from custer and ten from hill city spanish gulch be three mile down the draw the holy smoke mine to which bennington be accredit he find to consist of a hole in the ground of unsounded depth two log structure and a chicken coop the log structure resemble those he have read about in one of they live arthur and he wife the wife do the cooking arthur do nothing at all but sit in the shade and smoke a pipe and this in spite of the fact that he do not look like a loafer he have no official connection with the place except that of husband to mr arthur the other member of the community be davidson alias old mizzou the latter be cordial and voluble as he be bless with a long white beard of the patriarchal type he inspire confidence he use exclusively the present tense and chew tobacco he also play interminable cribbage likewise he talk the latter be he strong point bennington find that within two day of he arrival he know all about the company 's business without have prove the necessity of stir foot on he own behalf the claim be not worth much accord to old mizzou the company have be cheat they would find it out some day none of the ore assay very high for he part he do not see why they even do assessment work bennington be to look after the latter all in good time you know you have until the end of the year to do it what else be there to do nothing much the present holder have come into the property on a foreclosed mortgage and be not do anything to develop it yet do bennington know of they plan no well it look as though the two of they be to have a pretty easy time of it do not it old mizzou try by adroit question to find out just why de laney have be send west there be in reality not enough to keep one man busy and surely old mizzou consider himself quite competent to attend to that finally he conclude that it must be to watch he -- old mizzou act on that supposition he try a new tack for two delicious hour he show up to he own satisfaction bennington 's ignorance of mining that be a easy enough task bennington do not even know what country-rock be all he succeed in elicit confirm he in the impression that de laney be send to spy on he but why de laney old mizzou wag he gray beard and why spy on he what could the company want to know he give it up one thing alone be clear : this young man 's understanding of he duty be very simple bennington imagine he be expect to see certain assessment work do -lrb- whatever that be -rrb- and be to find out what he could about the value of the property as a matter of sedulously conceal truth he be really expect to do nothing at all the place have be make for he through mr de laney 's influence because he want to go west now my boy bishop the mining capitalist have say when bennington have visit he in he new york office do you know anything about mine no sir bennington reply well that do not matter much we do not expect to do anything in the way of development the case briefly be this : we have buy this busted proposition of the people who be handle it and have assume they debt they do not run it right they have a sort of a wildcat individual in charge of the thing and he get contract for sink shaft with all the turtleback out there and then do not pay for they now what we want you to do be this : first of all you be to take charge financially at that end of the line that mean pay the local debt as we send you the money and look after whatever expenditure may become necessary then you 'll have to attend to the assessment work do you know what assessment work be no sir well in order to hold the various claim legally the owner have to do one hundred dollar ' worth of work a year on each claim if the work be not do the claim can be ` jump ' you 'll have to hire the man buy the supplies and see that the full amount be do we have a man out there name davidson you can rely on he and he 'll help you out in all practical matter he be a good enough practical miner but he be useless in boss a job or handle money between you you ought to get along i 'll try anyway that be right then another thing you can put in you spare time investigate what the thing be worth i do not expect much from you in that respect for you have not have enough experience but do the best you can it 'll be good practice anyway hunt up davidson go over all the claim find out how the lead run and how it hold out get sample and ship they to I investigate everything you can and do not be afraid to write when you be stick in other word bennington be to hold the end of the rein while some one else drive but he do not know that he feel he responsibility as to the assessment work old mizzou have already assure he there be no immediate hurry man be cheaper in the fall as to investigate he start in on that at once he and davidson climb down shaft and break off ore and work the gold pan it be fun in the morning bennington decide to work from seven until ten on _ aliri _ then for three hour he and old mizzou prospect in the afternoon the young man take a vacation and hunt wild western adventure it may as well be remark here that bennington know all about the west before he leave home until this excursion he have never even cross the alleghany but he think he appreciate the condition thoroughly this be because he be young he could close he eye and see the cowboy scour the plain as a parenthesis it should be note that cowboy always scour the plain just as sailor always scan the horizon he know how the cowboy look because he have see buffalo bill 's show and he know how they talk because he have read accurate author of the school of bret harte he could even imagine the romantic mountain maiden with he preconceived notion the country in most particulars tally interestingly at first bennington frequent the little town down the draw it answer fairly well to the story-book description but prove a bit lively for he the first day they lend he a horse the horse look sleepy it take he twenty minute to get on the animal and twenty seconds to fall off there be a audience they make he purchase strange drink at outlandish price after that they shoot hole all around he foot to induce he to dance he have inherit a obstinate streak from some of he forebear and decline when it go that far they then do other thing to he which be not pleasant most of these prank seem to have be instigate by a laugh curly-haired young man name fay fay have clear blue eye which seem always to mock you he could think up more diabolical scheme in ten minute than the rest of the man in as many hour bennington come shortly to hate this man fay he attention have so much of the gratuitous for a number of day even after the enjoyment of novelty have wear off the easterner return bravely to spanish gulch every afternoon for the mail it be a matter of pride with he he do not like to be bluff out but fay be always there tender _ foot _ the latter would shriek joyously and bear down on the shrink de laney that would bring out the loafer it all have to happen over again bennington hope that this performance would cease in time it never do by a mental process unnecessary to trace here he modify he first view and permit old mizzou to get the mail spanish gulch see he no more after all it be quite as good western experience to wander in the hill he do not regret the other in fact as he cast in review he research in wild west literature he perceive that the incident of he town visit be the proper thing he would not have have they different -- to look back on they be inspiring -- to write home about he recognize all the type -- the miner the gambler the saloon-keeper the bad man the cowboy the prospector -- just as though they have step live from the page of he classic they have the true slouch they use the picturesque language the log cabin square with he idea the bronco even exceed they but now he have see it all there be no sense in drain a agreeable cup to satiety he be quite content to enjoy he ramble in the hill like the healthy youngster he be but have he see it all on reflection he acknowledge he could not make this statement to himself with a full consciousness of sincerity one thing be lack from the preconceived picture he imagination have draw there have be no mountain flower by that he mean girl every one know what a western girl be she be a beautiful creature always with clear tan skin bright eye and curly hair she wear a tam o ' shanter she ride a horse also she talk deliciously in a silver voice about old pard altogether a charming vision -- in book this vision bennington have not yet realize the rest of the west come up to specification but this one essential fail in spanish gulch he have to be sure encounter a number of girl but they be red-handed big-boned freckled-faced rough-skinned and there be not a tam o ' shanter in the lot plainly servant bennington think the mountain flower must have go on a visit come to think of it there never be more than one mountain flower to a town chapter iii bennington hunt for gold and find a kiss one day old mizzou bring he a blue-print map this y' ar map say he spread it out under he stubby finger show the deestrict i get it of fay so you gain a idee of th ' lay of the land a whole lot they claim marked with a crost belong to th ' company you kin take she and explore this strike bennington as a excellent idea he sit down at the table and count the cross there be fourteen of they the different lode be lay off in mathematically exact rectangle run in many direction a few join one another but most lay isolate they relative position be a trifle confusing at first but after a little earnest study bennington think he understand they he could start with the holy smoke just outside the door the john logan lay beyond at a obtuse angle then a jump of a hundred yard or so to the southwest would bring he to the crazy horse this he resolve to locate for it be say to be on the same lode as a big strike some one have recently make he pick up he rifle and set out now a blue-print map maker have undoubtedly accurate idea as to point of the compass and faultless proficiency in depict bird 's - eye view but he neglect entirely the put in of various up and down slant and winding of the country which apparently twist the north pole around to the east-south-east you start due west on a bee line accord to direction after about ten foot you scramble over a fall tree skirt a boulder dip into a ravine and climb a ledge you start point be out of sight behind you you destination be heaven know where in front by the time you have walk six thousand actual foot which be as near as you can guess to fifteen hundred theoretical level one you little blazed stake in a pile of stone be likely to be almost anywhere within a liberal quarter of a mile then it be guess-work if the hill be pretty thickly stake out the chase become exciting in the middle distance you see a post you clamber eagerly to it only to find that it mark you neighbor 's claim you have lose you standpoint of a moment ago and must start afresh in a hour 's time you have discover every stake on the hill but the one you want in two hour ' time you be staggering homeward a gibbering idiot then you be bring back to profane sanity by fall at full length over the very object of you search bennington be treat to full measure of this experience he find the john logan lode without much difficulty and follow its length with less for the simple reason that its course lay over the round brow of a hill bare of tree he also discover the northeast corner of the crazy horse lode plainly mark on the white surface of a pine stake brace upright in a pile of rock thence he confidently pace south and find nothing next trip he come across pencil direction concern the miner 's dream lode the time after he run against the golden ball and the golden chain lode bennington reflect he mind be become a little heated it be because i go around those ledge and boulder he say to himself i get off the straight line this time i 'll take the straight line and keep it so he address himself to the surmount of obstruction work of that sort be not easy at one point he lose he hold on a broad steep rock and slide ungracefully to the foot of it he elbow digging frantically into the moss and he leg straddle apart as he strike bottom he imagine he hear a most delicious little laugh so real be the illusion that he grip two handful of moss and look about sharply but of course see nothing the laugh be repeat he look again and so become aware of a vision in pink standing just in front of a big pine above he on the hill and survey he with mischievous eye surprise freeze he he leg straddle he hat on one side he mouth open the vision begin to pick its way down the hill eye he the while that dancing scrutiny seem to mesmerize he he be enchant to perfect stillness but he be graciously permit to take in the particulars of the girl 's appearance she be dainty every posture of she slight figure be of a airy grace as light and delicate as that of a rose tendril sway in the wind even when she trip over a loose rock she catch she balance again with a pretty little uplift of the hand as she approach slowly and evidently not unwilling to allow she charm full time in which to work bennington could see that she face be delicately make but as to the detail he could not judge clearly because of she mischievous eye they be large and wide and clear and of a most peculiar color -- a purple-violet of the shade one sometimes find in flower but only in the flower of a deep and shady wood in this wonderful color -- which seem to borrow the richness of its hue rather from its depth than from any pigment of its own just as beyond sounding the ocean change from green to blue -- a hundred mood seem to rise slowly from within to swim visible even though the mere expression of she face give no sign of they for instance at the present moment she feature be compose to the utmost gravity yet in she eye bubble gaiety and fun as successive up-swelling of a spring or rather as the riffle of sunlight and wind or the picture flight of bird across a pool whose surface alone be stir bennington realize suddenly with overwhelming fervency that he prefer to slide in solitude the vision in the starch pink gingham now poise above he like a humming-bird over a flower from behind she back she withdraw one hand in the hand be the missing claim stake be this what you be look for she inquire demurely the mesmeric spell break and bennington be permit to babble incoherency she stamp she foot be this what you be look for she persist bennington 's chaos have not yet crystallize to relevancy wh-where do you get it he stammer again be this what you be look for she demand in very large capital the young man regain control of he faculty with a effort yes it be he rejoin sharply and then with the instinct that bid we appreciate the extent of we relief by pass a annoyance along do not you know it be a penal offence to disturb claim stake he have suddenly discover that he prefer to find claim stake on claim the vision 's eye open wider it must be nice to know so much say she in reverent admiration bennington flush as a de laney the girl he have know have always take he seriously he dislike be make fun of this be nonsense he object with some impatience i must know where it come from in the background of he consciousness still whirl the moil of he wonder and bewilderment he cling to the claim stake as a stable object the vision look straight at he without wink and those wonderful eye fill with tear yet underneath they mist seem to sparkle little point of light as wavelet through a vapor which veil the surface of the sea bennington become conscious-stricken because of the tear and still he own a uneasy suspicion that they be not real i be so sorry she say contritely after a moment i think i be help you so much i find that stake just streak it over the top of the hill it have get loose and be run away the mist have clear up very suddenly and the light-tipped sparkle of fun be chase each other rapidly as though impel by a lively breeze i think you would be ever so grateful and instead of that you scold I i do not believe i like you a bit she look he over reflectively as though make up she mind bennington laugh outright and scramble to he foot you be absolutely incorrigible he exclaim to cover he confusion at he change of face she eye fairly dance oh what a _ lovely _ word she cry rapturously what _ do _ it mean something nice or i be sure you would not have say it about I _ would _ you the eye suddenly become grave oh please tell I she beg appealingly bennington be throw into confusion at this for he do not know whether she be serious or not he could do nothing but stammer and get red and think what a ridiculous ass he be make of himself he might have consider the help he be get in that well then you need not she concede magnanimously after a moment only you ought not to say thing about girl that you do not dare tell they in plain language if you will say nice thing about I you might as well say they so i can understand they only i do think it be a little early in we acquaintance this cast bennington still more in perplexity he have a pretty-well-defined notion that he be be ridicule but concern this just a last grain of doubt remain she rattle on well say she impatiently why do not you say something why do not you take this stick i do not want it man be so stupid that last remark have be make many many time and yet it never fail of its effect which be at once to invest the speaker with daintiness indescribable and to thrust the man address into nether inferiority bennington fall to its charm he take the stake where do it belong he ask she point silently to a pile of stone he deposit the stake in its proper place and return to find she seat on the ground pluck a handful of the leaf of a little erect herb that grow abundantly in the hollow these she rub together and hold to she face inside the sunbonnet who be you anyway ask bennington abruptly as he return d' you ever see this before she inquire irrelevantly look up with she eye as she lean over the handful good for cold make you nose feel all funny and prickly she turn she hand over and begin to drop the leaf one by one bennington catch himself watch she with fascinate interest in silence he begin to find this one of she most potent charm -- the

of the ridge where the obstruction be many there be outcrop boulder ravine break twig old leaf and dike all of which have to be surmount or avoid they be all aggravate but the dike possess some intellectual interest which the other lack a dike be it understand be a hole in the earth make visible that be to say in old day when mountain be much loftier than they be now various agency bring it to pass that they split and crack and yawn down to the innermost core of they be in such hideous fashion that chasm and hole of great depth and perpendicularity be open in they thereupon the interior fire be release and these vomit up a vast supply of molten material fill say chasm and hole to the very brim the molten material cool into fire-hardened rock the rain descend and the snow melt under they erosive influence the original mountain be cut down somewhat but the erstwhile molten material be as we have say fire-hardened waste very little or not at all and as a consequence stand forth above its present surroundings in exact mould of the ancient crack or hole now some dike be long and narrow other be short and wide and still other be nearly round all however be highest point and head and shoulder above the tree look abroad over the land when bennington come to one of these dike he be force to pick he way carefully in a detour around its base between time he find hobnail much incline to click against unforeseen stone the broken twig come to possess other than literary importance after a little he nerve assert themselves unconsciously he relax he attention and begin to think the subject of he thought be the girl he have see just twenty-four hour before he catch himself remember little thing he have not consciously notice at the time as for instance the strange contrast between the mischief in she eye and the austerity of she brow or the queer little fashion she have of wink rapidly four or five time and then open she eye wide and look straight into the depths of he own he consider it quite a coincidence that he have unconsciously return to the spot on which they have meet the day before -- the rich crazy horse lode as though in answer to he recognition of this fact she voice suddenly call to he from above hullo little boy it cry he feel at once that he be please at the encounter hullo he answer where be you right here he look up and then still up until at the flat top of the castellated dike that stand over he he catch a gleam of pink the contrast between it the blue of the sky and the dark green of the tree be most beautiful and unusual nature rarely use pink except in sunset and in flower bennington think pleasedly how every impression this girl make upon he be one of grace or beauty or bright color the gleam of pink disappear and a great pine cone heavy with pitch come buzz through the air to fall at he foot that be to show you where i be come the clear voice you ought to feel honor i have only three cone leave the dike before which bennington have pause be one of the round variety it rise perhaps twenty foot above the _ débris _ at its base sheer gray its surface almost intact except for a insignificant number of frost fissure from its base the hill fall rapidly so that even from he own inferior elevation he be enable to look over the top of tree stand but a few rod away from he he could see that the summit of this dike be probably nearly flat and he surmise that once up there one would become master of a pretty enough little plateau on which to sit but he careful circumvallation could discover no possible method of ascent the wall afford no chance for a squirrel 's foothold even he begin to doubt whether he have guess aright as to the girl 's whereabouts and begin carefully to examine the top of the tree discover nothing in they he cast another puzzle glance at the top of the dike a pair of violet eye be scrutinize he gravely over the edge of it how in the world do you get up there he cry fly she explain with great succinctness look out you do not fall he warn hastily she attitude be alarming i be lie flat say she and i can not fall you have not tell I how you get up i want to come up too how do you know i want you i have such a lot of thing to say cry bennington rather at a loss for a valid reason but feel the necessity keenly well sit down and say they there be a big flat rock just behind you this do not suit he in the least i wish you would let I up he beg petulantly i can not say what i want from here i can hear you quite well you 'll have to talk from there or else keep still that be not fair persist the young man adopt a tone of argument you be a girl -- stop there you be wrong to start with do you think that a creature who could fly to the top of the rock be a mere girl not at all what do you mean ask the easily bewildered bennington what i say i be not a girl what be you then a sun fairy a sun fairy yes a real live one see that cloud over toward the sun the nice downy one i mean that be my couch i sleep on it all night i have get it near the sun so that it will warm up you see i see cry bennington he could recognize foolery -- provide it be ticket plainly enough he sit down on the flat rock before indicate and clasp he knee with he hand prepare to enjoy more be that you throne up there sun fairy he ask she have withdraw she head from sight it be she voice come down to he in grave tone it must be a very nice one the nicest throne you ever see i never see one but i have often hear that throne be unpleasant thing i be sit foolish mortal say she in tone of deep commiseration on a soft thick cushion of moss -- much more comfortable i imagine than hard flat rock and the nice warm sun be shine on I -- it must be rather chilly in the wood to-day and there be a breeze blow from the big horn -- old rock be always damp and stuffy in the shade and i be look away out over the hill -- i hope some people enjoy the sight of pile of quartzite cruel sun fairy cry bennington why do you tantalize I so with the delight from which you debar I what have i do there be a short silence can not you think of anything you have do ask the voice insinuatingly bennington 's conscience-stricken memory stir it do not seem so ridiculous under the direct charm of the fresh young voice that come down through the summer air from above like a dive 's note from a treetop to apologize to lawton 's girl the incongruity now be in force into this arcadian incident anything savor of conventionality at all it have be so idyllic this talk of the sun fairy and the cloud so like a passage from a old book of legend this dainty episode in the great strong western breeze under the great strong western sky everything should be perfect not to be blame do sun fairy accept apology he ask presently in a subdue voice they might this particular sun fairy be offer one by a man who be sorry be it a good big one indeed yes the head appear over the edge of the rock inspect he gravely for a moment and be withdraw then it be accept say the voice thank you he reply sincerely and now be you go to let down you rope ladder or whatever it be i really want to talk to you you be so persistent cry the petulant voice and so foolish it be like a man to spoil thing by questioning he suddenly feel the truth of this one can not talk every day to a sun fairy and the experience can never be repeat he settle back on the rock pardon I sun fairy he cry again rope ladder indeed to one who have but to close she eye and she find herself on a downy cloud near the sun my mortality blind I now you be a nice boy she approve more contentedly and as a reward you may ask I one question all right he agree and then with instinctive tact what do you see up there he could hear she clap she hand with delight and he feel glad that he have follow he impulse to ask just this question instead of one more personal and more in line with he curiosity listen she begin i see pine many pine just the top of they and they be all wave in the breeze do you ever see tree from on top they be quite different and out from the pine come great round hill make all of stone i think they look like skull then there be breathless descent where the pine fall away once in a while a little white road flash out yes urge bennington as the voice pause and what else do you see i see the prairie too she go on half dreamily it be brown now but the green be begin to shine through it just a very little and out beyond there be a sparkle that be the cheyenne and beyond that there be something white and that be the bad land the voice break off with a happy little laugh bennington see the scene as though it lay actually spread out before he there be something in the choice of the word clearcut decisive and descriptive but more in the exquisite modulation of the voice add here a tint there a shade to the picture and casting over the whole that poetic glamour which rarely be imitate in grosser material by nature herself when just follow sunset she suffuse the landscape with a mellow afterglow the head sunbonneted reappear perk inquiringly sideways hello stranger it call with a nasal inflection how air ye do y ' think minin ' be goin ' t ' pan out well this yar spring then she catch sight of he weapon what be you go to shoot she ask with sudden interest i think i might see a deer deer hoh she cry in lofty scorn reassume she nasal tone you be shore a tenderfoot don ' you-all know that blastin ' scare all th ' deer away from a minin ' camp bennington look confused no i have not think of that he confess stoutly enough i kind of like to shoot say she a little wistfully what sort of a gun be it a savage smokeless answer bennington perfunctorily one of the thirty-calibres inquire the sunbonnet with new interest yes gasp bennington astonished at so much feminine knowledge of firearm oh i would like to see it i never see any of those may i shoot it just once of course you may more than once shall i come up no i 'll come down you sit right still on that rock the sunbonnet disappear and there ensue a momentary commotion on the other side of the dike in a instant the girl come around the corner pick she way over the loose block of stone with the finger-tip of either hand she hold the pink starched skirt up display a neat little foot in a heavy little shoe diagonally across the skirt run two irregular brown stain she catch he look at they naughty naughty say she glance down at they with a grimace she drop she skirt and stand up beside he with a pretty shake of the shoulder now let 's see it she beg she examine the weapon with much interest throw down and back the lever in a manner that show she be accustom at least to the old-style arm how light it be she comment squint through the sight do not it kick awfully not a bit smokeless powder you know of course what 'll we shoot at bennington fumble in he pocket and produce a envelope how 's this he ask she seize it and run like a antelope -- with the same _ glide _ motion -- to a tree about thirty pace distant on which she pin the bit of paper they shoot bennington hit the paper every time the girl miss it once at this she look a little vexed you be either very rude or very sincere be she comment you be the best shot i ever see -- now do not dare say ` for a girl ' she interrupt quickly what be the prize be this a match of course it be and i insist on pay up bennington consider i think i would like to go to the top of the rock there and see the pine and the skull-stone and the prairie she glance toward he knit she brow it be my very own she say doubtfully i have never let anybody go up there before one of the diminutive chipmunk of the hill scamper out from a cleft in the rock and perch on a moss-covered log chatter eagerly and jerk he tail in the well-known manner of chipmunk oh see see she cry all excitement in a moment she seize the rifle and take careful aim fire the chatter cease the chipmunk disappear bennington run to the log behind it lay the little animal the long steel-jacketed bullet have just graze the base of its brain he pick it up gently in the palm of he hand and contemplate it it be such a diminutive beast not as large as a good-sized rat quite smaller than we own fence-corner chipmunk of the east it be little side be daintily striped its little whisker be as perfect as those of the great squirrel in the timber bottom in its pouch be the root of pine cone bennington be not a sentimentalist but the incident against the background of the light-hearted day seem to he just a little pathetic something of the feeling show in he eye the girl who have draw near look from he to the dead chipmunk and back again then she burst suddenly into tear oh cruel cruel she sob what do i do it for what do you _ let _ I do it for she distress be so keen that the young man hasten to relieve it there he reassure she lightly do not do that why you be a great hunter you get you game and it be a splendid shot we 'll have he skin when we get back home and we 'll cure the skin and you can make something out of it -- a spectacle case he suggest at random i know how you feel he go on to give she time to recover but all hunter feel that way occasionally see i 'll put he just here until we get ready to go home where nothing can get he he deposit the squirrel in the cleft of a rock quite out of sight and stand back as though pleased there that be fine he conclude with one of those instantaneous transition which seem so natural to she and yet which appear to reach not at all to she real nature she have change from a aspect of passionate grief to one of solemn inquiry bennington find she look at he with the soul brim to the very surface of she great eye i think you may come up on my rock she say simply after a moment they skirt the base of the dike together until they have reach the westernmost side there bennington be show the means of ascent which he have overlook before because of he too close examination of the cliff itself at a distance of about twenty foot from the dike grow a large pine tree the lowest branch of which extend directly over the little plateau and about a foot above it next to the large pine stand two smaller sapling side by side and a few inch apart these have be convert into a ladder by the nailing across of rustic round that be how i get up explain the girl now you go back around the corner again and when i be ready i 'll call bennington obey in a few moment he hear again the voice in the air summon he to approach and climb he ascend the natural ladder easily but when within six or eight foot of the large branch that reach across to the dike the smaller of the two sapling cease and so naturally the ladder terminate hi he call how do you get up this he look across the intervene space expectantly and then to he surprise he observe that the girl be blush furiously i -- i stammer a small voice after a moment 's hesitation i guess i -- _ shin _ a light break across bennington 's mind as to the origin of the two dark streak on the gown and he laugh the girl eye he reproachfully for a moment or so then she too begin to laugh in a embarrassed manner whereupon bennington laugh the harder he shin up the tree to find that a ingenious hand rope have be fit above the bridge limb so that the cross of the short interval to the rock be a matter of no great difficulty in another instant he stand upon the top of the dike it be as he have anticipate nearly flat under the pine branch which might make a very good chair back grow a thick cushion of moss the one tree break the freedom of the eye 's sweep toward the west but in all other direction it be uninterrupted as the girl have say the top of pine alone meet the view mile on mile of they undulate rise swell break against the barrier of a dike or lap the foot of a great round boulder-mountain here and there a darker spot suggest a break for a mountain peak rarely a fleck of white mark a mountain road back of they all -- ridge mountain cavernous valley -- tower old harney sun-browned rock-diademe a few wisp of cloud streaming down the wind from he brow lock heavy with the age of the great manitou whom he be suppose to represent eastward the prairie like a peaceful sea above the alert sky of the west and through all the air a hum -- vast murmurous swell -- as the mountain breeze touch simultaneously with strong hand the chord not of one but a thousand pine harp bennington draw in a deep breath and look about in all direction the girl watch he ah it be beautiful he murmur at last with a half sigh and look again she seize he hand eagerly oh i be so glad you say that -- and no more than that she cry i feel the sun fairy can make you welcome now chapter v the spirit mountain from now on say the girl shake out she skirt before sit down i be go to be a mystery you be already reply bennington for the first time aware that such be the fact no fencing i have a plain business proposition to make you and i be go to be great friend i can see that now i hope so and you be a -- well a open-minded young man -lrb- now what do she mean by that think bennington -rrb- will be ask all about myself i be go to tell you nothing i be go to be a mystery i be sure -- no you be not sure of anything young man now i 'll tell you this : that i be live down the gulch with my people i know -- mr lawton 's she look at he a moment exactly if you be to walk straight ahead -- not out in the air of course -- you could see the roof of the house now after we know each other better the natural thing for you to do will be to come and see I at my house will not it bennington agree that it would well you must not bennington express he astonishment i will explain a very little in a month occur the pioneer 's picnic at rapid you do not know what the pioneer 's picnic be ignorant boy it be we most important event of the year well until that time i be go to try a experiment i be go to see if -- well i 'll tell you i be go to try a experiment on a man and the man be you and i 'll explain the whole thing to you after the pioneer 's picnic and not a moment before be not you curious i be indeed bennington assure she sincerely she take on a small air of tyranny now understand I i mean what i say if you want to see I again you must do as i tell you you must take I as i be and you must mind I bennington cast a fleeting wonder over the sublime self-confidence which make this girl so certain he would care to see she again then with a grip at the heart he own that the self-confidence be well found all right he assent meekly good she cry with a gleam of mischief behold I old bill lawton 's gal if you want to be pard put she thar and so you be a girl after all and no sun fairy smile bennington as he put she thar my cloud have melt she reply quietly point toward the brow of harney they chat of small thing for a time bennington feel intuitively that there be something a little strange about this girl something a little out of the ordinary something he have never be conscious of in any other girl yet he could never seize the impression and examine it it be always just escape just take shape to the point of visibility and then melting away again just rise in the modulation of she voice to a murmur that the ear think to seize as a definite chord and then die into a hundred other cadence he try to catch it in she eye where so much else be to be see sometimes he perceive its influence but never itself it pass as a shadow in the lower deep as though the feather mass of a great sea growth have lift slowly on a undercurrent and then as slowly have sink back to its bed leave but the haunting impression of something shapeless that have darken the hue of the water it be most like a sadness that have pass perhaps it be merely a unconscious trick of thought or manner after a time she ask he he first name and he tell she i would like to know you 's too miss lawton he suggest i wish you would not call I miss lawton she cry with sudden petulance why certainly not if you do not want I to but what be i to call you do you know she confide with a pretty little gesture i have always dislike my real name it be ugly and horrid i have often wish i be a heroine in a book and then i could have a name i really like now here be a chance i be go to let you get up one for I but it must be pretty and we 'll have it all for we very own i do not quite see -- object the still conventional de laney you wit you wit have not you any wit at _ all _ she cry with impatience over he unresponsiveness well let I see it be not easy to do a thing like that on the spur of the moment sun fairy a fairy 's a fay be not it i might call you fay fay she repeat in a startled tone bennington remember that this be the name of the curly-haired young man who have lend he the buck horse and frown no i do not believe i like that he recant hastily take time and think about it she suggest i think of one that would be appropriate he say after some little time it be suggest by that little bird there it be phoebe do you think it be appropriate she object a phoebe bird or a phoebe girl always seem to I to be demure and quiet and thoughtful and sweet-voiced and fond of dim forest while i be a frivolous laughing sunny individual who like the open air and do not care for shadow at all yet i feel it be appropriate he insist he pause and go on a little timidly in the face of he new experience in give expression to the more subtle feeling i do not know whether i can express it or not you be laugh and sunny as you say but there be something in you like the phoebe bird just the same it be like those cloud shadow he point out over the mountain overhead a number of summer cloud be wing they way from the west casting on the earth those huge irregular shadow which sweep across it so swiftly yet with such dignity so rushingly and yet so harmlessly the hill be sunny and bright enough and all at once one of the shadow cross they and it be dark then in another moment it be bright again and do you really see that in I she ask curiously you be a dear boy she continue look at he for some moment with reflective eye it will not do though she say rise at last it be too ` fancy ' i do not know then he confess with some helplessness i 'll tell you what i have always _ want _ to be call say she ever since i be a little girl it be ` mary ' mary he cry astonished why it be such a common name it be a beautiful name she assert say it over be not the syllable soft and musical and caress it be a lovely name why i remember she go on vivaciously a girl who be name mary and who do not like it when she come to we school she change it but she do not dare to break it to the family all at once the first letter home she sign herself ` mae ' she father write back ` my dear daughter if the name of the mother of jesus be not good enough for you come home ' she laugh at the recollection then you have be away to school ask the young man yes she reply shortly she adroitly lead he to talk of himself he tell she naively of new york and tennis of brake party and club and even afternoon tea and ball all of which of course interested a western girl exceedingly in this it so happen that he immaturity show more plainly than before he do not boast openly but he introduce extraneous detail important in themselves he mention know pennington the painter and brooke the writer merely in a casual fashion but with just the faintest flourish it somehow become know that he family have a crest that he position be high in short that he be a de laney on both side he like to tell it to this girl because it be evidently fresh and new to she and because in the presence of she inexperience in these matter he gain a confidence in himself which he have never dare assume before she look straight in front of she and listen throw in a comment now and then to assist the stream of he talk at last when he fall silent she reach swiftly out and pat he cheek with she hand you be a dear big _ boy _ she say quietly but i like it -- oh so much from the tree top below the clear warble of the purple finch proclaim that under the frond twilight have fall the vast green surface of the hill be streak here and there with irregular peak of darkness dwindle eastward the sun be nearly down a sudden gloom blot out the fretwork of the pine shadow that have during the latter part of the afternoon lie athwart the rock they look up startle the shadow of harney have creep out to they and even as they look it steal on cat-like across the lower ridge toward the east one after another the round hill change hue as it cross they for a moment it linger in the tangle of wood at the outermost edge and then without further pause glide out over the prairie they watch it fascinate the sparkle be quench in the cheyenne the white gleam of the bad land become a dull gray scarce distinguishable from the gray of the twilight though a single mysterious cleft a long yellow bar point down across the plain pause at the horizon and slowly lift into the air the mountain shadow follow it steadily up into the sky grow and grow against the dullness of the east until at last over against they in the heaven be the huge phantom of a mountain infinitely greater infinitely grander than any mountain ever see by mortal eye and lift higher and higher command upward by that single wand of golden light then suddenly the wand be withdraw and the ghost mountain merge into the yellow afterglow of evening the girl have watch it breathless at its dissolution she seize the young man excitedly by the arm the spirit mountain she cry i have never see it before and now i see it -- with you she look at he with startle eye with you she repeat what be it i do not understand she do not seem to hear he question what be it he ask again why -- nothing she catch she breath and recover command of herself somewhat that be it be just a old legend that i have often hear and it startle I for a minute will you tell I the legend not now some time we must go now for it will soon be dark they wander along the ridge toward deerfoot gulch in silence she have take she sunbonnet off and be enjoy the cool of the evening he carry the rifle over the crook of he arm and watch she pensive face the poor little chipmunk lay stiffen in the cleft of the rock forget the next morning a prying jay discover he and carry he away he be only a

movement return she lift she face gravely searchingly to he i like you say she earnestly you have kind eye and be go down through the graceful alder sapling bennington stand and watch the swaying of the leaf top that mark she progress until she emerge into the lower gulch there she turn and look back toward the ridge but apparently could not see he though he wave he hand the next instant jim fay stroll into the park from the direction of lawton 's cabin bennington see she spring to meet he hold out both hand and then the two stroll back down the gulch talk earnestly they head close together

face bear a broad grin at this point they interrupt with howl and cat-call of applause be not he a _ peach _ say one to another and compose himself again to listen at the conclusion of a long harangue

vii the meeting at the rock on he way to keep the appointment of the afternoon bennington de laney discover within himself a new psychological experience he find that since the evening before he have be observe thing about he for the purpose of detail they to he new friend little beauty of nature -- as when a strange bird shone for a instant in vivid contrast to the mountain laurel near he window a unusual effect of pine silhouette near the sky a weird semi-poetic suggestion of one of poe 's story imply in a contorted shadow cast by a gnarled little oak in the light of the moon -- these he have notice and remember and be now eager to tell he companion with full assurance of she sympathy and understand three day earlier he would have pass they by but stranger still be he discovery that he have _ always _ notice such thing and have remember they observation of the sort have heretofore be quite unconscious without know it he have always be a nature lover one who appreciate the poetry of she mood one who see the beauty of she smile or what be more rare the greater beauty of she frown the influence have enter into he be but have lie neglect now it steal forth as the odour of a dry balsam bough steal from the corner of a loft whither it have be throw carelessly it be all delightful and new and he want to tell she of it he do so after a little he tell she about _ aliri : a romance of all time _ in which she appear so interested that he detail the main idea and the plot at she request he promise to read it to she he be very young you see and very inexperienced he throw himself generously without reserve on this girl 's sympathy in a manner of which assuredly he should have be quite ashamed only the very young be not ashamed the girl listen at first half amuse then she be touch for she see that it be sincere and youthful and indicative of clear faith in what be beautiful and in fine ideal of what be fitting perhaps dimly she perceive that this be good stuff of which to make a man provide it spring from immaturity and not from the sentimentalism of degeneracy the loss of it be a price we pay for wisdom some think the price too high as he talk on in this moonshiny way really believe he ridiculous abstraction the most important thing in the world gradually she too become young she listen with part lip and in she great eye the soul rise and rise within clear away the surface mood as twilight clear the land of everything but peace he be tell of the east again with a certain felicity of expression -- have we not say he have the gift of word -- and a abandon of sentiment which show how thoroughly he confide in the sympathy of he listener when we be young we be apt to confide in the sympathy of every listener and so we make fool of ourselves and it take we a long time to live down we reputation as we grow older we believe less and less in its reality perhaps by and by we do not trust to anybody 's sympathy not even we own we have a old country place he be say it belong to my grandfather my grandfather come by it when the little town be very small indeed so he build a old-fashioned stone house and surround it with large grounds he be see the stone house and the large grounds with that new inner observation which he have just discover and he be try to the best of he ability to tell what he see after a little he speak more rhythmically many might have think he speak sentimentally because with feeling but in reality he be merely try with great earnestness for expression a jarring word would have bring he back to he everyday mood but for the time be he be wrapt in what he see this be a condition which all writer and some lover will recognize now the place be empty -- except in summer -- except that we have a old woman who live tuck away in one corner of it i live there one summer just after i finish college outside my window there be a apple tree that just brush against the ledge there be rise vine the climbing sort on the wall and then too there be a hickory tree that tower ` way over the roof in the front yard be what be know all over town as the ` big tree ' a silver maple at least twice as tall as the house it be so broad that its shade fall over the whole front of the place in the back be a orchard of old apple tree and trellis of big blue grape on one side be a broad lawn at the back of which be one of the good old-fashioned flower garden that do one good to look at there be little pink primrose dot the sod sweet-william lavender nasturtium sweet pea hollyhock bachelor 's button portulaca and a row of tall sunflower the delight of a sleepy colony of hen i learn all the flower that summer he clasp he hand comfortably back of he head and look at she she be gaze out over the bad land to the east in the very center as a sort of protect nurse to all the littler flower he go on be a big lilac bush and there the bee and hum bird be thick on a warm spring day there be plenty of bird too but i do not know so many of they they nested everywhere -- in the ` big tree ' the orchard the evergreen the hedge and in the long row of maple tree with trunk as big as a barrel and limb that touch across the street it must be beautiful say the girl quietly without look around then he begin to suppose this as every woman know be dangerous business it _ be _ beautiful say he i can not tell you about it the word do not seem to fit some way i wish you could see it for yourself i know you would enjoy it i always want some one with I to enjoy it too suppose some way we be place so we could watch the year go by in those deep window first there be the spring and the bird and the flower all of which i have be talk about then there be the summer when the shades be draw when the shadow of the rose wave slowly across the curtain when the air outside quiver with heat and the air inside taste like a draught of cool water all the bird song be still except that one little fellow still warble sway in the breeze on the tiptop of the ` big tree ' he note slide down the long sunbeam like bead on a golden thread then we would read together in the half-darkened ` parlor ' something not very deep but beautiful like hawthorne 's story or we would together seek for these perfect line of poetry which haunt the memory in the evening we would go out to hear the cricket and the tree toad to see the night breeze toss the leaf across the calm face of the moon to be silence in spirit by the peace of the star then the autumn would come we would taste the ` concord ' and the little red grape and the big red grape we would take we choice of the yellow sweeting the hard white snow apple or the little red-cheeked fellow from the west tree and then of course there be the russet then there be the pear and all the hickory nut which rattle down on we every time the wind blow the leaf be everywhere we would rake they up into big pile and jump into they and ` swish ' about in they how brace the air be how silvery the sun how red you cheek would get and think of the bonfire and in winter murmur the girl she eye be shine in the winter the wind would howl through the ` big tree ' and everything would be bleak and cold out door we would be inside of course and we would sit on the fur rug in front of the fireplace while the evening pass by watch the ` goose in the chimney ' fly slowly away ` suppose ' some more she beg dreamily i love it it rest I she clasp she hand back of she head and close she eye the young man look quietly about he this be a wild and beautiful country say he but it lack something i think

object doubtfully but the hermit thrush be better the old country minister take I to hear he one Sunday afternoon and i shall never forget it she glance at he animated face through half-closed eye tell I she urge softly ` suppose ' we be back east he begin and in the country just about this time of year we would wait until the afternoon -- why just about this time when the sun be get low we would push through the bush at the edge of the wood where the little tinkling bird sing in the fence corner and would enter the deep high wood where the tree be tall and still the moss be thick and soft in there and there be little pool lie calm and dark and there be a kind of a _ hush _ in the air -- not silence you know but like when a big crowd of people be keep still and then we would walk very carefully and speak low and we would sit by the side of a fall log and wait after a while the thrush would sing a deep note with a thrill in it like a bell slow and solemn when you hear it you too feel a thrill as though you have hear a great and noble thought why it be almost _ holy _ he turn to the girl she be look at he why hullo he exclaim what be the matter she eye be brim with tear

all over again with the love story as the ruling _ motif _ he feel very capable of do the love story he draw some paper toward he and begin to write you see he be already develop every time a writer be make to appreciate that he work be poor he have take a step in advance of it although he do not know that be the reason of it bennington perceive the deficiency of _ aliri _ because he have promise to read it to the girl he see it through she eye the young man become absorb in redescribe the heroine with violet eye a sudden slamming of the door behind he bring he startle to he foot he laugh and be about to sit down again but notice that the door have remain open he arise to shut it over the trunk of the nearer pine play a strange flickering light throw they now into relief now into shadow strange murmured bennington to himself and step outside to investigate as he cross the sill he be seize on either side he cry out and struggle blindly but be hold as in a vice he captor whom he dimly perceive to be large man in mask whirl he sharply to the left and he find himself face to face with a third man also mask beyond he be a score or so more some of whom bear pine torch which partly blaze and partly smoking serve to cast the weird light he have see flicker on the tree trunk perfect silence reign the man with whom bennington be front eye he gravely through the hole in he mask i would like to know what this mean break out the easterner angrily the man do not reply they stand motionless as silent as the night in spite of he indignation the young man be impressed he twist he

only by the occasional burst crackle of a blister in the pine torch bennington try to realize the situation it have all come about so suddenly i guess you have get the joke on I boy he venture with a nervous little laugh and then he voice die away against the stony immobility of the man opposite as laughter sink to nothing against the horror of a great darkness bennington begin to feel impressed in earnest across he mind creep doubt as to the outcome he almost scream aloud as some one steal up behind and drop over he throat the soft cold coil of a lariat then at a signal from the chief the two man hale he away they stop beneath a gnarled oak halfway down the slope to the gulch bottom from which protrude like a long witch arm a single withered branch over this the unseen throw the end of the lariat bennington face the expressionless gaze of twenty mask on which the torchlight throw strong black shadow directly in front of he the leader post himself watch in hand any last request he

desperation and the weight of a young and active body the man go down bennington seize the lariat with both hand and try to wrench it over he head the individual who have do all the talk leap forward toward he and dodge a hastily aim blow seize he about the waist and throw he neatly to the ground bennington struggle furiously and silently the other have great difficulty in hold he down come here

bennington dimly see a tall muscular figure tense with the expectation of effort lean forward to the slack of the lariat he stare back to the front the leader raise he pistol to give the signal bennington shut he eye then ensue a pause and a murmuring of low voice bennington look and to he surprise perceive lawton 's girl in earnest expostulation with the leader of the band as he listen they voice rise so he catch snatch of they talk confound it all object the man in exasperated tone you do not play fair that be not the agreement at all agreement or no agreement this thing 's go far

bennington 's vast surprise the feature of jim fay be discover he approach and begin sullenly to undo the young man 's pinion arm the other roll up they mask and put they in they pocket they laugh to each other consumedly the tall man approach rub he jaw you hit hard sonny say he and you do not go down in yore boot -lrb- a -rrb- a little bit the group begin to break up and move down the gulch most of the man shout out a good-natured word or so of farewell bennington recover from he daze at the rapid passage of these event step forward to where fay and the girl have resume they discussion he see that the young miner have recover he habitual tone of raillery and that the girl be now look up at he with eye full of deprecation miss lawton say bennington with formality i hope you will allow I after you great kindness to see that you get down the gulch safely fay cut in before the girl could reply do not bother about that de laney say he in a most cavalier fashion i 'll see to it i do not

give they a severe shake the light of the torch down the gulch waver and disappear bennington return to he room on the table lay he manuscript and the ink be hardly dry on the last word of it outside a poor-will begin to utter its weird call the candle before he sputter and burn again with a clear flame -lrb- footnote a : western -- to become frightened -rrb- chapter ix the heaven open bennington awake early the next morning a pleased glow of anticipation warm he heart and almost before he eye be open he have raise himself to leap out of the bunk then with a disappointed sigh he sink back on the roof fall the heavy patter of raindrop after a time he arise and pull aside the curtain of a window the nearer world be drip the farther world be hide or obscure by long veil of rain drive in ragged cloud before a west wind yesterday the leaf have wave lightly the undergrowth of shrub have uplift in feathery airiness of texture the ground beneath have be crisp and aromatic with pine needle now everything bear a droop sodden aspect which speak rather of decay than of the life of spring even the chicken have wisely remain indoors with the exception of a single bedraggled old rooster whose melancholy appearance add another shade of gloom to the dismal outlook the wind twist he long tail feather from side to side so energetically that even as bennington look the poor fowl perforce have to scud careen from one side to the other like a heavily-laden craft into the shelter of he coop the wind leave to its own device skitter across cold-look little pool of water and try in vain to induce the soaked leaf of the autumn before to essay a aerial flight the rain hit the roof now in heavy gust as though some one have dash it from a pail the wind whistle through a loosen shingle and rattle around a ill-made joint within the house itself some slight sound of preparation for breakfast sound the clearer against the turmoil outside and then bennington become conscious that for some time he have _ feel _ another sound underneath all the rest it be grand and organlike in tone resemble the roar of surf on a sand beach as much as anything else he look out again and see that it be the wind in the tree the same condition that have before touch the harp murmur of a stiller day now strike out a rush and roar almost awe-inspiring in its volume bennington impulsively throw open the window and lean out the great hill back of the camp be so steep that the pine grow on its slope offer to the breeze a almost perpendicular screen of branch instead of one or at most a dozen tree the wind here pass through a thousand at once as a consequence the stir of air that in a level woodland would arouse but a faint whisper here would pass with a rustling murmur a murmur would be magnify into a noise as of the mellow fall of water and now that the storm have awaken the hill catch up its cry with a howl so awful and sustained that as the open window let in the full volume of its blast bennington involuntarily draw back he close the sash and turn to dress after the first disappointment strange to say bennington become quite resigned he have feel a little illogically that this give of a whole day to the picnic be not quite the thing he puritan conscience impress he with the sacredness of work he settle down to the fact of the rainstorm with a pleasant recognition of its inevitability and a resolve to improve he time to that end after breakfast he draw on a pair of fleece-lined slipper don a sweater occupy two chair in the well-known fashion and attack with energy the page of le conte 's _ geology _ this book as you very well know discourse at first with great interest concern erosion among other thing it convince you that a current of water be double in swiftness can transport a mass sixty-four time as heavy as when it run half as fast this astounding proposition be abstrusely prove as bennington have resolve not to make he reading mere recreation he draw diagram conscientiously until he understand it then he pass on to a earnest consideration of why the revolution of the globe and the resistance of continent cause oceanic current of a particular direction and velocity besides this there be much easier reading concern alluvial deposit so interested do he grow that old mizzou come in muddy-hoofed and glisten from a round of the stock find he quite unapproachable on the subject of cribbage the patriarch then stump over to arthur 's cabin after dinner bennington pick up the book again but find that he brain have reach the limit of spontaneous mental effort he look for old mizzou and the cribbage game the miner have go to visit arthur again bennington wander about disconsolately for a time he drum idly on the window pane then he take out he revolver and try to practice through the open doorway the smoke from the discharge hang heavy in the damp air fill the room in a most disagreeable fashion bennington 's trip to see the effect of he shot prove to he the fiendish propensity of everything he touch be it never so lightly to sprinkle he with cold water above all he skill with the weapon be not great enough as yet to make it much fun he abandon pistol shooting and yawn extensively wish it be time to go to bed in the evening he play cribbage with old mizzou after a time arthur and he wife come in and they have a dreary game of cinch the man speaking but little the woman not at all old mizzou smoke incessantly on a corncob pipe charge with a peculiarly pungent variety of tobacco which fill the air with a blue vapor and penetrate unpleasantly into bennington 's mucous membrane the next morning it be still rain bennington become very impatient indeed but he tackle le conte industriously and do well enough until he try to get it into he head why various thing happen to glacier then viscosity the line of swiftest motion relegation and direction of pressure come forth from the print page and mock he he arise in he might and go forth into the open air before go out he have put on he canvas shooting coat and a pair of hobnailed leather hunting boot lace for a little distance at the front and side he visit the horse stand disconsolate under a open shed in the corral he slop with constantly accrue mass of sticky earth at he foot to the chicken coop into which he cast a eye he even take the kitchen pail and tramp down to the spring and back in the gulch he do not see or hear a living thing a newly-born and dirty little stream be trickle destructively through all manner of shiver grass and flower the water from bennington 's sleeve run down over the harsh canvas cuff and turn he hand purple with the cold he return to the cabin and change he clothes the short walk have refresh he but it have spur he impatience outside the world seem to have change he experience with the hill up to now have always be in one phase of they beauty -- that of clear bright sunshine and soft sky now it be as a different country he could not get rid of the feeling foolish as it be that it be in reality different and that the whole episode of the girl and the rock be as a vision which have pass it grow indistinct in the presence of this iron reality of cold and wet he could not assure himself he have not imagine it all thus belated he come to thinking of she again and have now nothing else to do he fall into daydream that have no other effect than to reveal to he the impatience which have be from the first the real cause of he restlessness under the temporary confinement now the impatience grow in intensity he resolve that if the morrow do not end the storm he would tramp down the gulch to make a call all this time _ aliri _ lay quite untouched the next day dawn darker than ever after breakfast old mizzou as usual go out to feed the horse and bennington through sheer idleness accompany he they distribute the oats and hay and then stand sheltered from the direct rain converse idly suddenly the wind die and the rain cease in the place of the gloom succeed a strange sulphur-yellow glare which lay on the spirit with almost physical oppression old mizzou shout something and scramble excitedly to the house bennington look about he bewilder over back of the hill dimly discernible through the tree loom the black irregular shape of a cloud in dismal contrast to the yellow glare which now fill all the sky the horse frighten crowd up close to bennington try to push they nose over he shoulder a number of jay and finch rush down through the wood and dart rapidly each with its peculiar flight toward a clump of tree and bush stand on a ridge across the valley from the cabin old mizzou be shout to he he turn to follow the old man back of he something vast and awful roar out and then all at once he feel himself struggle with a rush of water he be jam violently against the post of the corral there he work to he foot the whole side of the hill be one vast spread of shallow toss water as though a lake have be let fall on the summit of the ridge the smaller bush be uproot and sweep along but the tree and sapling hold they own in a moment the stone and ridgelet begin to show it be over not a drop of rain have fall bennington climb the corral fence and walk slowly to the house the blacksmith shop be fill to the window and arthur 's cabin be not much better he enter the kitchen the floor there be some two inch submerge but the water be slowly escape through the down-hill door by which bennington have come in across the dining-room door mr arthur have lay a fold rug in front of the barrier stand the lady herself vigorously sweep back the threatening water from she only glorious apartment bennington take the broom from she and sweep until the cessation of the flood make it no longer necessary mr arthur commence to mop the floor the young man step outside there he be join a moment later by the other two they offer no explanation of they whereabouts during the trouble but bennington surmise shrewdly that they have hunt a dry place glory cry old mizzou lucky she miss we what be it where would it come from inquire bennington shake the surface drop from he shoulder he be wet through cloud-burst reply the miner she hit up th ' ridge a way if she would ever burst yere sonny ye would never know what drownd ye look at that gulch the water have now drain from the hill entirely it could be see that most of the surface earth have be wash away leave the skeleton of the mountain bare some of the more slightly rooted tree have fall or cling precariously to the earth with bony finger but the gulch itself be terrible the mountain laurel the elder the sarvi bush the wild rose which a few day before have be fragrant and beautiful with blossom and leaf and musical with bird have disappear in they stead roll a angry brown flood whirling in almost unbroken surface from bank to bank several oak submerge to they branch raise they arm helplessly as bennington look one of these bent slowly and sink from sight a moment later it shoot with great suddenness half its length into the air be seize by the eager water and whisk away as lightly as though it have be a tree of straw dark object begin to come down with the stream they seem to be try to preserve a semblance of dignity in they stately bob up and down but apparently find the attempt difficult the roar be almost deafening but even above it a strangely deliberate grind noise be audible old mizzou say it be the grate of boulder as they be roll along the bed of the stream the yellow glow have disappear from the air and the gloom of rain have take its place a fine mist begin to fall bennington for the first time realize he be wet and shiver and so he turn inside to change he clothes it 'll all be over in a few hour remark arthur i reckon they spanish gulch people 'll wish they live up-stream bennington pause at the doorway that be so he comment how about spanish gulch will it all be drown out no i reckon not reply arthur they 'll get wet down a lot and have wet blanket to sleep in to-night that be all you see the gulch spraddle out down there a ' then too all this timber 'll jam down this gulch a-way that 'll back up th ' water some and so she will not come all of a rush i see say bennington the afternoon be well enough occupy in repair to some extent the ravages of the brief storm a length of the corral have succumb to the flood many valuable tool in the blacksmith shop be in danger of rust from the dampness and arthur and he wife have be completely wash out all three man work hard setting thing to rights the twilight catch they before they work be do bennington find himself too weary to attempt a unknown _ débris _ - cover road by dark he play cribbage with old mizzou and win about half past nine he push back he chair and go outside the star have come out by the thousand and a solitary cricket which have in some way escape the deluge be chirp in the middle distance with a sudden uplift of the heart he realize that he would see she on the morrow he learn that no matter how philosophically we may have bear a separation the prospect of its near end show we how strong the repression have be the lifting of the bond make evident how much they have gall chapter x the world make young the morning fulfil the promise of the night before bennington de laney awake to a sun-bright world fresh with the early breeze a multitude of bird outside the window bubble and warble and carol away with all they little might either in joy at the return of peace or in sorrow at the loss of they new-built house sorrow and joy sound much alike as nature tell they the farther ridge and the prairie be once more in view but now oh wonder the great plain have cast aside its robe of monk brown and have step forth in jolly green-o'lincoln the air be full of tingling life altogether a morning to cry one to leap eagerly from bed to rush to the window to drink in deep draught of electric balmy ozone and to thank heaven for the grace of mere existence that at least be what bennington do and he do more he despatch a hasty breakfast and go forth and saddle he steed and ride away down the gulch with never a thought of sample test and never a care whether the day 's work be do or not for this be springtime and the air be snap with it near the chicken ' shelter the burnish old gobbler spread he tail and drag he wing and puff he feather and swell himself red in the face to the great admiration of a demure gray-brown little turkey hen overhead wheel two small hawk scream they clash and light feather come float down from the encounter yet presently they fly away together to a hole in a dead tree three song sparrow dash almost to he very foot so busily fight that they hardly escape the pony 's hoof everywhere love song trill from the underbrush and bennington de laney as young as full of life as unmated as they ride slowly along thinking of he lady love and -- hullo where be you go cry she he look up with eager joy to find that they have meet in the middle of what use to be the road the gulch have be sweep bare by the flood not only of every representative of the vegetable world but also of the very earth in which it have grow from the remains of the roadbed project sharp flint and rock among which the bronco pick they way good-morning mary he cry i be just come to see you be not it a great rain and be not the gulch awful down near we way the timber begin to jam and it be all choke up but up here it be desolate he turn he horse about and they pace slowly along together tell each other they respective experience in the storm it seem that the lawton have know nothing of the cloud-burst itself except from its effect in fill up the ravine rumor of the drowning of a miner be about it soon become evident that the brightness of the morning be reflect from the girl 's mood she fairly sparkle with gaiety and high spirit the two get along famously where be you go ask bennington at last on the picnic of course she rejoin promptly be not you invite i think you be i think it would be too wet he aver in explanation not a bit the rain dry quickly in the hill and the cloud-burst only come into this gulch i have here she go on twist around in she saddle to inspect a large bundle and a pair of well-stuffed saddle bag i have here a coffee pot a frying pan a little kettle two tin cup and various sort of grub i be fix for a scout sure now when we get near you camp you must run up and get a axe and some match bennington observe with approval the corpulency of the bundle and the skilful manner with which it be tie on he note with perhaps more approval she lithe figure in its old-fashioned painter 's blouse and rough skirt and the rosiness of she cheek under a cloth cap catch on awry as the pony seek a path at a snail 's pace through the sharp flint she show in a thousand way how high the gaiety of she animal spirit have mount she sing airy little piece of song she utter single clear note she mock with a ludicrously feminine croak the hoarse voice of a crow sailing over they she rally bennington mercilessly on he corduroy he yellow flap pistol holster he lace boot she go over in ridiculous pantomime the scene of the mock lynching until bennington roll in he saddle with light-hearted laughter and wonder how it be possible he have ever take the affair seriously when he return with the axe she be hugely alarmed lest he harm himself by he awkward way of carry it and give he much wholesome advice in she most maternal manner after all of which she would catch he eye and they would both laugh to startle the bird blue lead prove to be some distance away for which fact bennington be not sorry at length they surmount a little ridge over its summit there start into be a long cool draw broad and shallow near the top but deepen by insensible degree into a cañon fill already with broad-leaved shrub and thickly grow with sapling of beech and ash through the screen of slender trunk could be see miniature open park carpet with a soft tiny fern not high enough to conceal the ear of a rabbit or to quench the flame of the tiger lily that grow there soon a little brook spring from nowhere and creep timidly through and under thick moss after a time it increase in size and when it have become large enough to bubble over clear gravel mary call a halt we 'll have we picnic here she decide the ravine at this point receive another little gulch into itself and where the two come together the bottom widen out into almost parklike proportion on one side be a grass-plot encroach upon by numerous raspberry vine on the other be the brook flow noisily in the shade of sapling and of fern bennington unsaddle the horse and lead they over to the grass-plot where he picket they securely in such a manner that they could not become entangled when he return to the brookside he find that mary have undo she bundle and spread out its contents there be various utensil some corn meal coffee two slice of ham raw potato a small bottle of milk some egg wonderfully preserve by moss inside the pail and some bread and cake bennington eye all this in dismay she catch he look and laugh can not you cook well i can you just obey order we will not get anything to eat before night object bennington dolefully as he look over the decidedly raw material and he be _ so _ hungry she tease never mind you build a fire bennington brighten he have one outdoor knack -- that of lighting match in a wind and induce refractory wood to burn he skill have often be call into requisition in the igniting of beach fire and the so-called camp fire of girl he collect dry twig from the sunny place cut sliver with he knife build over the whole a wigwam-shaped pyramid of heavier twig against which he lean he firewood then he touch off the combination the sliver ignite the twig the twig set fire to the wigwam the wigwam start the firewood bennington 's honor be vindicate he feel proud mary who have be fill the coffee pot at the creek approach and view the triumph she cast upon it the glance of scorn that be no cooking fire say she so bennington under she direction place together the two parallel log with the hew side and build the small bright fire between they now you see she explain i can put my frying pan and coffee pot and kettle across the two log i can get at they easy and do not burn my finger now you may peel the potato the easterner peel potato under constant laughing amendment as to method then the small cook collect she material about she in grand preparation for the final rite she turn back the loose sleeve of she blouse to the elbow this draw a exclamation from bennington why mary how white you arm be he cry astonished she survey she forearm with a little blush turn it back and forth i _ be _ pretty tan she agree the coffee pot be fill and place across the log at one end and leave to its own device a little remove from the hottest of the fire the kettle stand next half fill with salted water in which nestle the potato like so many nested egg mary mix a mysterious concoction of corn meal egg butter and some white powder mush the whole up with milk and water the mixture she spread evenly in the bottom of the frying pan which she set in a warm place it be not much of a bake tin she comment eye it critically but it 'll do under she direction bennington impale the two slice of ham on long green switch and stick these upright in the ground in such a position that the warmth from the flame could just reach they they 'll never cook there he object do not expect they would she retort briefly then relent they finish better if they be warm through first she explain by this time the potato be bubble energetically and the coffee be send out a fragrant steam mary stab experimentally at the vegetable with a sharpened sliver apparently satisfied she draw back with a happy sigh she shake she hair from she eye and smile across at bennington ready go cry she the frying pan be cover with a tin plate on which be heap live coal more coal be poke from between the log on to a flat place be spread out thin and be crown by the frying pan and its glowing freight bennington hold over the fire a switch of ham in each hand take care accord to direction not to approach the actual blaze mary borrow he hunting knife and disappear into the thicket in a moment she return with a kettle-lifter improvise very simply from a fork branch of a saple one of the fork be leave long for the hand the other be cut short the result be like a esquimaux fishhook she then relieve bennington of he task while that young man lift the kettle from the fire and carefully drain away the water dinner she call gaily bennington look up surprised he have be so absorb in the spell work by this dainty wood fairy that he have forget the flight of time it be enough for he to watch the turn of she wrist the swift certainty of she movement to catch the glow light in she face by the fire over which she bent then he suddenly remember that she movement have all along tend toward dinner and be not get up simply and merely that he might discover new charm in the small housekeeper he find himself seat on a rock with a tin plate in he lap a tin cup at he side and a eager little lady in front of he anxious that he should taste all she dish and deliver a opinion forthwith the coffee he pronounce nectar the ham and mealy potato delicious the johnny-cake of a yellow golden crispness which the originator of johnny-cake might envy and the bread and cake and butter and sugar only the less meritorious that they have not be prepare by she own hand and on the spot and see she cry clap she hand the sun be still directly over we it be not night yet silly boy chapter xi and he do eat after the meal he want to lie down in the grass and watch the cloud sail by but she would have none of it she hale he away to the brookside there she show he how to wash dish by fill they half full of water in which fine gravel have be mixed and then whirling the whole rapidly until the tin be rub quite clean never be prosaic task more delightful they kneel side by side on the bank under the dense leaf and dabble in the water happily the fern be fresh and cool once a redbird shot confidently down from above on half-closed wing catch sight of these intruder bring up with a swish of feather and eye they gravely for some time from a neighbouring treelet apparently he be satisfy with he inspection for after a few minute he pay no further attention to they but go about he business quietly when the dish have be wash mary stand over bennington while he pack they in the bundle and strap they on the saddle now say she at last we have nothing more to think of until we go home she be like a child playing with exhaustless spirit at the most trivial game not for a moment would she listen to anything of a serious nature bennington with the heavier pertinacity of man when they have strike a congenial vein try to repeat to some extent the experience of the last afternoon at the rock mary laugh he sentiment to ridicule and he poetic to scorn everything he say she twist into something funny or ridiculous he want to sit down and enjoy the calm peace of the little ravine in which they have pitch they temporary camp but she make a quiet life miserable to he at last in sheer desperation he arise to pursue whereupon she vanish lightly into the underbrush a moment later he hear she clear laugh mock he from some elder thicket a hundred yard away bennington pursue with ardor it be as though a slow-turning ocean liner be to try to run down a lively little yacht bennington have always consider girl as weak creature incapable of swift motion and need assistance whenever the country depart from the artificial level of macadam he have also think himself fairly active he revise these idea this girl could travel through the thin brush of the creek bottom two foot to he one because she run more lightly and surely and she endurance be not a matter for discussion the question of second wind do not concern she any more than it do a child whose ordinary mode of progression be heartbreaking bennington find that he be engage in the most delightful play of he life he shout aloud with the fun of it he have the feeling that he be grasp at a sunbeam or a mist-shape that always elude he he would lose she utterly and would stand quite motionless listen for a long time suddenly without warn a exaggerated leaf crown would fall about he neck and he would be overwhelm with ridicule at the outrageous figure he present then for a time she seem everywhere at once the mottled sunlight under the tree dance and quiver after she smile and darken as she dimple or be grave the little whirlwind of the gulch seize the leaf and dance with she too the birch and aspen toss they hand and rise ever higher and wilder and more elf-like come the mock cadence of she laughter after a time she disappear again bennington stand still wait for some new prank but he wait in vain he institute a search but the search be fruitless he call but receive no reply at last he make he way again to the dell in which they have lunch and there he find she flat on she back look at the little summer cloud through wide-open eye she mood appear to have change indeed that seem to be characteristic of she that she lightness be not so much the lightness of thistle down which be ever airy the sport of every wind but rather that of the rose vine mobile and sway in every breeze yet at the same time root well in the wholesome garden earth she care now to be silent in a little while bennington see that she have fall asleep for the first time he look upon she face in absolute repose feature by feature line by line he go over it and into he heart creep that peculiar yearning which seem on analysis half pity for what have past and half fear for what may come it be bestow on little child and on those whose nature in spite of they year be essentially childlike for this girl 's face be so pathetically young its sensitive lip pout with a child 's pout its pointed chin be delicate with the delicacy that be lose when the tooth have have often to be clench in resolve its cheek be curve so softly its long eyelash shaded that cheek so purely yet somewhere like a intangible spirit which dwell in it unseen except through its littlest effect bennington seem to trace that subtle sadness or still more subtle mystery which at time show so strongly in she eye he catch himself puzzling over it try to seize it it be most like a sorrow and yet like a sorrow which have be outlive or if a mystery it be as a mystery which be such only to other no longer to herself the whole line of thought be too fine-drawn for bennington 's untrained perception yet again all at once he realize that this very fact be one of the girl 's charm to he that she mere presence stir in he perception intuition thought -- yes even power -- which he have never know before he feel that she develop he he find that instead of be weak he be merely latent that now the latent perception be unfold since he have know she he have feel himself more of a man more ready to grapple with fact and condition on he own behalf more inclined to take he own view of the world and to act on it she have give he independence for she have make he believe in himself and belief in one 's self be the first principle of independence bennington de laney look back on he old new york self as on a be infinitely remote she awake and open she eye slowly and look at he without blinking the sun have go nearly to the ridge top and a wilson 's thrush be celebrate with he hollow note the artificial twilight of its shadow she smile at he a little vaguely the mist of sleep clouding she eye it be the unguarded moment the instant of awaken at such a instant the mask fall from before the feature of the soul i do not know what bennington see mary mary he cry uncontrolledly i love you i love you girl he have never before see any one so vexed she sit up at once oh _ why _ do you have to say that she cry angrily why do you have to spoil thing why could not you have let it go along as it be without bring _ that _ into it she arise and begin to walk angrily up and down kick aside the stick and stone as she encounter they i be just begin to like you and now you do this _ oh _ i be so angry she stamp she little foot i think i have find a man for once who could be a good friend to I whom i could meet unguardedly and behold the third day he tell I this i be sorry stammer bennington he new tenderness flee frighten into the inner recess of he be i beg you pardon i do not know -- _ do not _ i will not say it again please the declaration have be manly this be ridiculously boyish the girl frown at he in two mind as to what to do really truly he assure she she laugh a little scornfully very well i 'll give you one more chance i like you too well to drop you entirely -lrb- what a air of autocracy she take to be sure -rrb- you must not speak of that again and you must forget it entirely she lower at he a delicious picture of wrath they saddle the horse and take they way homeward in silence the tenderness put out its flower head from the inner sanctuary apparently the coast be clear it venture a little further the evening be very shadowy and sweet and musical with bird the tenderness boldly invade bennington 's eye and speak oh so timidly from he lip i will do just as you say it hesitate and i 'll be very very good indeed but be i to have no hope at all why can not you keep off that standpoint entirely just that one question then i will well grudgingly i suppose nothing on earth could keep the average mortal from hope but i can not answer that there be any ground for it when can i speak of it again i do not know -- after the pioneer 's picnic that be when you cease to be a mystery be not it she sigh that be when i become a greater mystery -- even to myself i fear she add in a murmur too low for he to catch they ride on in silence for a little space more the night shadow be flow down between the tree like vapor the girl of she own accord return to the subject you be greatly to be envy she say a little sadly for you be really young i be old oh very very old you have trust and confidence i have not i can sympathize i can understand but that be all there be something within I that bind all my emotion so fast that i can not give way to they i want to i wish i could but it be get harder and harder for I to think of absolutely trust in the sense of give out the self that be my own ah but you be to be envy you have save up and accumulate the beautiful in you nature i have waste mine and now i sit by the roadside and cry for it my only hope and prayer be that a higher and better something will be give I in place of the waste and yet i have no right to expect it silly be not it she conclude bitterly bennington make no reply they draw near the gulch and could hear the mellow sound of bell as the town herd defile slowly down it toward town we part here the young man break the long silence when do i see you again i do not know to-morrow no day after the girl shake herself from a reverie if you want I to believe you come every afternoon to the rock and wait some day i will meet you there she be go chapter xii old mizzou resign bennington go faithfully to the rock for four day during whole afternoon he sit there look out over the bad land at sunset he return to camp _ aliri : a romance of all time _ gather dust letter home remain unwritten prospecting be leave to the capable hand of old mizzou until much to bennington 's surprise that individual resign he position the sample lay in neatly tie coffee sack just outside the door the tabulation and statistics only need copying to prepare they for the capitalist 's eye the information necessary to the understanding of they repose in a grimy notebook require merely throw into shape as a letter to make they valuable to the eastern owner of the property anybody could do that old mizzou explain these thing to bennington you-all do this je 's well 's i he say you express they sample east so as they kin assay 'em a ' you send they note and statistics then all they be to do be to pay th ' rest of the boy when th ' money roll in that be not none of my funeral but there be the assessment work bennington object that come along all right i aim to live yere in the camp jest th ' same as usual and i 'll help yo ' git start when you-all aim to do th ' work what do you want to quit for then if you live here you may as well draw you pay no sonny that be not my way i have some prospectin ' of my own to do a ' as long as i be a employay of bishop i do not like to take he time fer my work bennington think this very high-minded on the part of old mizzou very well he agree i 'll write bishop oh no put in the miner hastily no need to trouble i resigns in writin ' of course a ' i see to it myself well then if you 'll help I with the assessment work when shall we begin c ` yant jest now reflect old mizzou 'cause as i tell you i want to do some work of my own a ` ter th ' pioneer 's picnic i reckon the pioneer 's picnic seem to limit many thing bennington ship the ore east tabulate the statistics and write he report about two week later he receive a letter from bishop say that the assay of the sample have be very poor -- not at all up to expectation -- and ask some further information as to the latter bennington consult old mizzou the miner say i tell you so and help on the answer after this the young man hear nothing further from he employer as no more check come from the east he find himself with nothing to do for four afternoon as have be say he fruitlessly haunt the rock on the fifth morning he meet the girl on horseback she be quite the same as at first and they resume they old relation as if the fatal picnic have never take place in a very few day they be as intimate as though they have know each other for year bennington read to she certain rewrite part of _ aliri : a romance of all time _ which would have be ridiculous to any but these two they see it through the glamour of youth for in spite of she assertion of great age the girl too feel the whirl of that elixir in she vein you see he be twenty-one and she be twenty : magic year more venerable than threescore and ten she give he sympathy which be just what he need for the sake of he self-confidence and development just the right thing for he in that effervescent period which be so necessary a concomitant of growth the young business man indulge in a hundred wild scheme to be correct by older head the young artist paint strange impressionism stranger symbolism and perhaps a strangest other-ism before at last he reach the medium of he individual genius the young writer think deep and philosophical thought which he express in measure polysyllabic language he dream wild dream of ideal motive which he set forth in beautiful allegorical tale full of imagery and he delight in rhetoric -- flower-crowned flashing-eyed deep-voiced rhetoric whom he clasp to he heart and believe to be true although the whole world declare she to be false and then after a time he decide not to introduce a new system of metaphysics but to tell a plain story plainly ah it be a beautiful time to those who dwell in it and such a funny time to those who do not they come to possess a influence over each other she decide how they should meet he how they should act she have only to be gay and he be gay to be sad and he be sad to show she preference for serious discourse and he talk quietly of serious thing to sigh for dream and he would rhapsodize it sometimes terrify she almost when she see how much he mood depend on hers but once the mood be establish she dominance cease and he begin if they be sad or gay or thoughtful or poetic it be in he way and not in hers he take the lead masterfully and perhaps the more effectually in that it be do unconsciously and in a way which every reader will understand but which genius alone could put into word this mutual psychical dependence make they feel the need of each other more strongly than any merely physical dependence ever could there be much to do in a new and romantic country where the imminence of a sordid dreary future when the soil will raise its own people and the crop will be poor be mercifully veil the future then count little in the face of the past -- the past with its bearded strong man of other land bring they power and vigor here to be mould and direct by the influence of the frontier its shadow still lie over the land they do it all the rock be still the favorite place to read or talk -- crossbar nail on firmly make shin unnecessary now -- but it be often desert for day while they explore bennington have buy the little bronco and together they extend they investigation of the country in all direction they ride to spring creek valley they pass the range over into custer valley once they climb harney by way of grizzly gulch thus they grow to know the hill intimately from the summit of the rock they would often look abroad over the tangle of valley and ridge select the objective point for they next expedition many surprise await they for they find that here as everywhere a seemingly uniform exterior cover a almost infinite variety or again the horse be give a rest the sarvis-berry ripen and they pick hatful then follow the raspberry on the stony hill they walk four unnecessary mile to see a forest fire and six to buy buckskin work from a band of sioux who have come up into the timber for they annual supply of tepee pole they teach they pony trick they even go wade together like two small child in a pool of battle creek bennington be deliciously carelessly forgetfully happy only there be jim fay that individual be as much of a persecution as ever and he seem to enjoy a greater intimacy with the girl than do the easterner he do not see she as often as do the latter but he appear to be more in she confidence bennington hate jim fay chapter xiii the spire of stone one afternoon they have push over back of harney up a very steep little trail in a very tiny cleft-like cañon verdant and cool all at once the trail have stand straight on end the pony scramble up somehow and they find themselves on a narrow open _ mesa _ splash with green moss and mat with a aromatic covering of pine needle beyond the easternmost edge of the plateau stand great spire of stone a dozen in all several hundred foot high and of solid granite they soar up grandly into the open blue like so many cathedral spire draw about they that air of solitude and stillness which accompany always the sublime in nature even boundless space be amplify at the bidding of they solemn uplifted finger the girl rein in she horse oh she murmur in a hushed voice i feel impertinent -- as though i be intrude a squirrel many hundred of foot below could be hear faintly bark there _ be _ something solemn about they the boy agree in the same tone but after all we be nothing to they they be think they own thought far above everything in the world she slip from she horse let 's sit here and watch they she say i want to look at they and _ feel _ they they sit on the moss and stare solemnly across at the great spire of stone they be wait for something there she observe for something that have not come to pass and they be look for it always toward the east do not you see how they be wait yes like indian warrior wrap each in he blanket they might be the manitous they say there be lot of they in the hill yes of course she cry on fire with the idea they be the god of the people and they be wait for something that be come -- something from the east what be it civilization he suggest yes and when this something this civilization come then the indian be to be destroy and so they god be always watch for it toward the east and he go on when it come at last then the manitous will have to die and so the indian know that they hour have strike when these great stone needle fall why we have make a legend she exclaim with wonder they stretch out on they back along the slope and stare up at the newly dignified manitous in delicious silence there be a legend once you remember he begin hesitatingly the first day we be on the rock together it be about a spirit mountain yes i remember the day we see the shadow you say you would tell it to I some time do i do not you think now be a good time she consider a moment idly why yes i suppose so she assent after a pause it be not much of a legend though she clasp she hand back of she head it go like this she begin comfortably : once upon a time when the world be very young there be a evil manitou name _ ne-naw-bo-shoo _ he be a very wicked manitou but he be also very accomplish for he could change himself into any shape he wish to assume and he could travel swifter than the wind but he be also very wicked in old time the centre of all the tree be fat and people could get food from they but _ ne-naw-bo-shoo _ walk through the forest and push he staff down through the middle of the trunk and that be why the core of the tree be dark-coloured maple sap use to be pure sirup once too but _ ne-naw-bo-shoo _ dilute it with rain water just out of spite but there be one peculiar thing about _ ne-naw-bo-shoo _ he could not cross a vein of gold or of silver there be some sort of magic in they that turn he back -- repel he now one day two lover be wander about on the prairie away east of here one of they be name _ mon-e-dowa _ or the bird lover and the other be _ muj-e-ah-je-wan _ or ripple water and as these two walk over the plain talk together along come the evil spirit _ ne-naw-bo-shoo _ and as soon as he see they he chase they intend to kill they and drink they blood as be he custom they flee far over the prairie everywhere that _ muj-e-ah-je-wan _ step prairie violet grow up and everywhere that _ mon-e-dowa _ step a lark spring up and begin to sing but the wicked _ ne-naw-bo-shoo _ gain on they fast for he could run very swiftly then suddenly they see in front of they a great mountain grow with pine and seam with fissure this astonish they greatly for they know there be no mountain in the prairie country at all but they have no time to spare so they climb quickly up a broad cañon and conceal themselves now when the wicked manitou come along he try to enter the cañon too but he have to stop because down in the depths of the mountain be vein of gold and silver which he could not cross for many day he rage back and forth but in vain at last he get tired and go away then _ mon-e-dowa _ and _ muj-e-ah-je-wan _ who have be live quite peacefully on the game with which the mountain swarm come out of the cañon and turn toward home but as soon as they have set foot on the level prairie again the mountain vanish like a cloud and then they know they have be aid by _ man-a-boo-sho _ the good manitou the girl arise and shake she skirt free of the pine needle that cling to it ever since then she go on eye bennington saucily sideways the mountain have be invisible except to a very few the legend say that when a maid and a warrior see it together they will be -- what ask bennington as she pause dead within the year she cry gaily and run lightly to she pony do you like my legend she ask as the pony foot-bunched mince down the steepest of the trail very much all but the moral do not you want to die not a bit then i 'll have to that would be the same thing and bennington dare talk in this way for the next day begin the pioneer 's picnic and lately she have be very kind chapter xiv the pioneer 's picnic the lawton be not go to the picnic bennington be to take mary down to rapid where the girl be to stay with a certain dr mcpherson of the school of mine a early start be accomplish they ride down the gulch through the dwarf oak past the farthermost point and so out into the hard level dirt road of battle creek cañon beyond be the pine and a rugged road flint-edged full of dip and rise turn and twist hover on edge or bosome itself in deep rock-strewn cut mary 's little pony canter recklessly through it all scamper along like a playful dog after a stone lead bennington 's larger animal by several foot he have full leisure to notice the regular flop of the tam o'shanter over the lighter dance of the hair the increase rosiness of the cheek dimple into almost continual laughter to catch stray snatch of gay little remark throw out at random as they tear along after a time they draw out from the shadow of the pine into the clearing at rockerville where the hydraulic giant have eat away the hill-side and leave in they ugly unhealed sore then more rough pine-shadowed road from which occasionally would open for a moment broad vista of endless glade clear as park breathless descent or sharp steep cut at the bottom of which spring creek or as much of it as be not turn into the rockerville sluice brawl or idle along it be time for lunch so they dismount near a deep still pool and eat the pony crop the sparse grass or twist on they back all four leg in the air squirrel chatter and scold overhead some of the indigo-coloured jay of the lowland shoot in long level flight between the tree the girl and the boy help each other hinder each other playing here and there near the question but swerve always deliciously just in time after lunch more ride through more pine the road dip strongly once then again and then abruptly the forest cease and they find themselves canter over broad rolling meadow knee-high with grass from which meadow lark rise in all direction like grasshopper soon after they pass the canvas schooner of some who have start the evening before down the next long slope the pony drop cautiously with bunch foot and tentative step spring creek be ford for the last time another steep grassy hill be surmount and they look abroad into rapid valley and over to the prairie beyond behind they the hill lay dark with the everlasting greenery of the north -- even low with only sun-browned harney to raise its cliff-like front above the rest of the range as though by a common impulse they rein in they horse and look back i wonder just where the rock be she muse they try to guess at its location the treeless ridge on which they be now stand run like a belt outside the hill they journey along its summit until late in the afternoon and then all at once find the city of rapid lie below they at the mouth of a mighty cañon like a toy village on fine velvet brown in the city they separate mary go to the mcpherson ' bennington to the hotel it be now near to sunset so it be agree that bennington be to come round the follow morning to get she at the hotel bennington spend a interesting evening view the pioneer with they variety of costume manners and speech he hear many good story humorous and blood-curdling and it be very late before he finally get to bed the immediate consequence be that he be equally late to breakfast he hurry through that meal and step out into the street with the intention of hasten to dr mcpherson 's for mary but this he find to be impossible because of the overcrowded condition of the street the sport of the day have already begin from curb to curb the way be jam with a dense mass of man woman and child through whom he have to worm he way after ten foot of this he hear he name call and look up catch sight of mary herself perch on a dry-goods box frantically wave a handkerchief in he direction you be a nice one she cry in mock reproach as he struggle toward she she eye be bright and she cheek fly red signal of enjoyment bennington explain i know well it do not matter any way i just capture this box climb up there be room i have lose the doctor and mr mcpherson already two mount man decorate with huge tin marshal ' badge ride slowly along force the crowd back to the right and to the leave the first horse race be on suddenly there be a eager scramble a cloud of dust a swift impression of dim ghostlike figure it be over the crowd flow into the street again the two press together hand in hand on the top of the dry-goods box they laugh at each other and everything something beautiful be very near to they for this be the pioneer 's picnic and both remember that the pioneer 's picnic mark the limit of many thing what be next what be next she call excitedly to a tall young cattleman the cowboy look up at she and he face relax into a pleased smile why it be a drillin ' match over in the next street miss he answer politely you would better run right along over and get a good place he glance at de laney smile again and turn away apparently to follow he own advice come on we 'll follow he cry mary jump down and abandon we box object bennington but she be already in full pursuit of the tall cowboy the ring around the large boulder -- drag by mule team from the hill -- have just begin to form when they arrive so they be enable to secure good place near the front rank where they kneel on they handkerchief and the crowd hem they in at the back the drilling match be to determine which pair of contestant could in a give time with sledge and drill cut the deepest hole in a granite boulder to one who stand apart the sight must have be picturesque in the extreme the white dust stir by restless foot rise lazily across the heated air the sun shine down clear and hot with a certain wide-eyed glare that be see only in the rarefy atmosphere of the west around the outer edge of the ring hover a few anxious small boy agonize that they be miss part of the show stolidly indifferent indian wrap close in they blanket smoke silently await the next pony race the rider of which be skylark about try to pull each other from they horse ' back when the last pair have finish the judge measure the depths of the hole drill and announce the victor the crowd shout and break for the saloon the latter have be ply a brisk business so that man be about ready to embrace in brotherhood or in battle with equal alacrity suddenly it be the dinner hour the crowd break bennington and mary realize they have be wander about hand in hand they direct they step toward the mcpherson with the greatest propriety it be a glorious picnic the house be gratefully cool and dark after the summer heat out of door the little doctor sit in the darkest room and dissertated cannily on the strange variety of subject which a scotchman can always bring up on the most ordinary occasion the doctor be not only a learn man as be evidence by he position in the school of mine and he wonderful collection but be a scout of long stand a physician of merit and a indian authority of acknowledged weight withal he be so modest that these thing become know only by implication or hearsay never by direct evidence mr mcpherson be not scotch at all but plain comfortable american redolent of wholesome cleanliness and good temper and beam with kindliness and round spectacles never be such a doctor never be such a mr mcpherson never be such a dinner and they bring in after-dinner coffee in small cup ah ha mr de laney laugh the doctor who have be watch he with quizzical eye we be pretty bad but we be not get quite to savagery yet bennington hasten to disavow that be all right the doctor reassure he that be all right i do not wonder at ye in this country but mr mcpherson and mysel ' jest take a wee trip occasionally to keep we wit bright be not it so mr mac it be that say she with a doubtful inner thought as to the propriety of offer cream and as for you go on the doctor dissertatively i suppose ye be get to be somewhat of a miner yourself i mind I we do a bit of assay work for you people the other day -- the crazy horse be not it a good claim i should judge from the sample and so i write davidson when be this ask the easterner puzzle the last week i do not know he have have any assay do o weel say the doctor comfortably it may not have occur to he to report yet it be rich mr mcpherson let 's talk about dress call mary across the table here we have come down for a _ holiday _ and they insist on talk mining and so the subject be drop but bennington could not get it out of he mind why should mizzou have have the crazy horse assay without say anything about it to he why have he not report the result how do it happen that the doctor 's assistant have find the ore rich when the company 's assayer east have prove it poor why should mizzou have it assay at all since he be no longer connect with the company but above all suppose he have do this with the intention of keep it secret from bennington what possible benefit or advantage could the old man derive from such a action he puzzle over this it seem to still the effervescence of he joy he realize suddenly that he have be very careless in a great many respects the work have all be trust to davidson while he often have never even see it he have be entirely occupy with the girl he experience that sudden sinking feeling which always come to a man whom neglect duty wake from pleasure what be davidson 's object could it be that he hope to buy in a rich claim at a low figure and to that end have send poor sample east the more he think of this the more reasonable it seem he resignation be for the purpose of put he in the position of outside purchaser he resolve to carry through the affair diplomatically during the afternoon he ruminate on how this be to be do mary could not understand he preoccupation it pique she a slight strangeness spring up between they which he be too _ distrait _ to notice finally as he tumble into bed that night a idea so brilliant come to he that he sit bolt upright in sheer delight at he own astuteness he would ask dr mcpherson for a copy of the assay if he suspicion be correct these assay would represent the richest sample he would send they at once to bishop with a statement of the case in that manner put the capitalist on he guard there be something exquisitely humorous to he in the idea of thus turn to he own use the information which davidson have accumulate for he fraudulent purpose he go to sleep chuckle over it chapter xv the girl on the train the next morning the young man have quite regain he good spirit the girl on the other hand be rather quiet dr mcpherson make no objection to furnish a copy of the assay the record however be at the school of mine he drive down to get they and in the interim the two young people at mr mcpherson 's suggestion go to see the train come in the platform of the station be fill to suffocation assume that the crowd 's intention be to view the unaccustomed locomotive it be strange it do not occur to they that the opposite side of the track or the adjacent prairie would afford more elbow room they huddle together on the board of the platform as though the appearance of the spectacle depend on every last individual 's keep he foot from the naked earth they push good-naturedly here and there expostulate call to one another facetiously look anxiously down the straight dwindle track for the first glimpse of the locomotive mary and bennington find themselves catch up at once into the vortex after a few moment of desperate clinging together they be force into the front row where they stand on the very edge brace back against the pressure half laughing half vex the train draw in with a grind rush from the step swing the conductor face look from the open window on the platform of one of the last car stand a young girl and three man one of the man be elderly with white hair and side whisker the other two be young and well dress the girl be of we best patrician type -- the type that may know little think little say little and generally amount to little and yet carry its negative quality with so use a air of polite society as to raise they by sheer force to the dignity of positive virtue from head to foot she be faultlessly groom from eye to attitude she be languidly superior -- the impolitic would say bored yet every feature of she appearance and bearing even to the very tip of she enamelled and sensibly thick boot imply that she be of a different class from the ordinary and satisfied on common people that impulse which attract she lesser sister to the vulgar menagerie she belong to the proper street -- at the proper time of day any one acquaint with the species would have know at once that this private-car trip to deadwood be to please the prosperous-looking gentleman with the side whisker and that it be make bearable only by the two smooth-shaven individual in the background she catch sight of the pair directly in front of she and raise she lorgnette with a languid wrist she stare be from the outside-the-menagerie standpoint bennington be not use to it for the moment he have the fifth avenue feeling and know that he be not properly dress therefore naturally he be confuse he lower he head and blush a little then he become conscious that mary 's clear eye be examine he in a very troubled fashion three hour and a half afterward it suddenly occur to he that she might have think he have blush and lower he head because he be ashamed to be see by this other girl in she company but it be then too late the train pull out the westerner at once scatter in all direction half a hour later the choke cloud dust rise like smoke from the different trail that lead north or south or west to the heart of the hill the picnic be over he suggest gently at they noon camping place yes thank heaven you remember you promise what promise that you would explain you ` mystery ' i have change my mind a leaf float slowly down the wind a raven croak the breeze make the sunbeam waver mary the picnic be over he repeat again very gently yes yes yes i love you mary the raven spread he wing and fly away do you love I he insist gently i want you to come to dinner at we house to-morrow noon that be a strange answer mary it be all the answer you 'll get to-day why be you so cross be anything the matter nothing i love you mary i love you girl at least i can say that now yes you can say it -- now chapter xvi a noon dinner bennington do not know what to make of he invitation at one moment he tell himself it must mean that mary love he and that she wish he to meet she parent on that account at the next he torment himself with the conviction that she thus merely avoid the issue between these mood he alternate without be able to abide in either he forget all about old mizzou promptly at noon the follow day he turn up the little right-hand trail for the first time the lawton house he find first of all to be scrupulously neat it stand on a knoll as do most gulch cabin in order that occasional freshet might pass below and the knoll look as though it have be clip with a pair of scissors not a crooked little juniper bush be allow to intrude its plebeian sprawl among the dignified pine and the gracefully infrequent bush in front of the cabin itself be a rockery of pink quartz on which be pile elk antler the building be l-shaped of two low story have a veranda with a railing and possess various ornamental wood edging all of which be paint the whole affair be mathematically square and correspondingly neat some box and pot of flower adorn the window ledge bennington 's knock be answer by a elderly woman who introduce herself at once as mr lawton she commence a voluble and slightly embarrassed explanation of how she would be down in a moment or so at the same time lead the way into the parlor while this explanation be go forward bennington have a good chance to examine he hostess and she surroundings mr lawton be of the fat but energetic variety she fairly shine with cleanliness and with a insistent determination to keep busy you could see that all the time she tongue be utter polite platitude concern the weather she mind be hover like a dragon fly over this or that flower of domestic economy she be one of the woman who carry they housekeeping to a perfection uncomfortable both to herself and everybody else and then delude themselves into the martyrlike belief that she be do it all entirely for other as a consequence she exhibit much of the time a aggrieved air that comport but ludicrously with she tendency to bustle and it must be confess that in other way mr lawton be ludicrous she dumpy little form be dress in the loudest of print the figure of which turn she into a huge flower bed of brilliant cabbage-like bloom over this chaos of color peer she round little face with its snap eye she discourse in sentence which begin coherently but fray out soon into nothingness under the stress of inner thought i do not see where that husban ' of mine be i reckon you 'll think we be just awful rude mr de laney and that gal a ' maude i declare it be jest enough to try any one 's patience it surely be you have no idea mr de laney what with the hen settin ' and this mis ` able dry spell that send th ' dust all over everything and every one ` way behin ' hand on everythin ' -- she eye be become vacant as she wonder about certain biscuit i be sure it must be agree bennington uncomfortably what be i a-sayin ' you must excuse I mr de laney but you be a man can have no idea of the life we poor woman folk lead slavin ' we very live away to keep thing runnin ' and then no thanks fer it a ` ter all i would just like t ' see bill lawton try it _ fer jest one week _ he would be a ravin ' lunatic a ' thet i tell he often this country 's jest awful too i tell he he must get out sometimes and i ` spect he will when he be make he pile poor man a ' then we 'll have a chanst to go back east again when we live east mr de laney we have a house -- not like this little shack a good house with nigh on to a dozen room and i have a gal to help I and some chanst to buy thing once in a while but now that bill lawton 's move west what be goin ' to become o ' I i do not know i be nigh wear out with it all then you live east once ask bennington law yes we live in illinoy once and th ' lord only know i wisht we live there yet though the farmin ' be a sight of work and no pay sometimes the inner doubt as to the biscuit prove too much for she heaven know you be not t ' git much to eat she cry jump up but you be not goin ' to git anythin ' a tall if i do not run right off and tend to they biscuit she bustle out bennington have time then to notice the decoration of the parlor they offer to the eye a strange mixture of the east and west -- reminiscence of the old home in illinoy and trophy of the new camping-out on the frontier from the ceiling hang a heavy lamp with prismatic dangler surround by a globe on which be depict stag in the act of leap six-barred gate by way of complement to this gorgeous centrepiece the paper on the wall show in infinitely recur duplicate a huntress in green habit and big hat carry on a desperate flirtation with a young man in the habiliment of the fifteenth century while across the background a huddle of dog pursue a mammoth deer mathematically beneath the lamp stand a table cover with a red-figured spread on the table be a glass bell underneath which be wax flower and a poorly-stuffed robin in one angle of the room austerely huddle a three-cornered whatnot of four shelf two china pug and a statuette of a simpering pair of child under a massive umbrella adorn this article of furniture on the wall tick a old-fashioned square wooden clock the floor be conceal by a rag carpet so much for the east the west contribute brilliant green copper ore flaky white tin ore glitter white quartz ore shine pyrites and one or two businesslike specimen of oxygenate quartz all of which occupied point of exhibit on the whatnot over the carpet be spread a deer skin and a rug make from the hide of a timber wolf bennington find all this interesting but depressing he be glad when mr lawton return and take up she voluble discourse in the midst of a dissertation on the relation of corn meal to egg the door open and mr lawton sidle in oh here y ' be at last observe he spouse scornfully and rattle on lawton nod awkwardly and perch himself on the edge of a chair he have assume a ill-fitting suit of store clothes in which he unaccustomedly writhe and evidently to judge from the sleekness of he hair have recently plunge he head in a pail of water he say nothing but whenever mr lawton be not look he wink elaborately and solemnly at bennington as though to imply that circumstance alone prevent any more open show of cordiality at last catch the young man 's eye at a more than usually propitious moment he go through the pantomime of open a bottle then furtively arise and disappear mr lawton remember she cake run out bennington be leave alone again he have not speak six word the door slowly open and another member of the family sidle in bennington own a helpless feeling that this be a sort of show and that these various actor in it be parade they entrance and they exit before he or that he himself be the object of inspection on whom the other be satisfy they own curiosity the newcomer be a child a little girl about eight or ten year old bennington like child as a usual thing no one on earth could have become possess in this one 's favor she be a creature of regular but mean feature extreme gravity and evidently of a inquire disposition on see she for the first time one sophisticated would have expect a deluge of question bennington do but she merely stand and stare without wink hullo little girl bennington greet she uneasily the creature only stare the harder my doll 's name be garnet m-a-ay she observe suddenly with a long-drawn nasal accent after this interesting bit of information another silence fall what be you name little girl bennington ask desperately at last maude remark the phenomenon briefly this statement she deliver in that whine tone which the extremely self-conscious infant imagine to indicate playful childishness she approach d' you want t ' see my picter she whimper confidingly bennington express he delight for seven geological age do he gaze upon cheap and horrible woodcut of gentleman in fashionable raiment try to lean against conspicuously inadequate rustic gate equally fashionable lady with flat chest and rat 's nest hair and animal whose attitude denote playful sportiveness of disposition each of these picture be explain in minute detail bennington 's distress become apathy mr lawton return from the cake presently yet she voice seem to break in on the duration of century now maude she exclaim with a proper maternal pride you must not be botherin ' the gentleman she pause to receive the expect disclaimer it be make albeit a little weakly maude be very good with she book she explain miss brown that be the school teacher that come over from hill town summer she say maude read a sight better than lot as be two or three year older now how old would you think she be mr de laney mr de laney try to appraise while the object hang she head self-consciously and twist she foot he have no idea of child 's age about eleven he guess with a air of wisdom jest eight a ' a half cry the dame folding she hand triumphantly she let she fond maternal gaze rest on the prodigy suddenly she dart forward with extraordinary agility for one so well endowed with flesh and seize she offspring in relentless grasp i do declare maude eliza she exclaim in horror-stricken tone you be not wash you ear you come with I they disappear in a blue mist of wail as though this be he cue the crafty feature of lawton appear cautiously in the doorway bestow a furtive and search inspection on the room and finally wink solemnly at its only occupant a hand be insert the forefinger beckon bennington arise wearily and go out lawton lead the way to a little oat shed standing at some distance from the house behind this he pause from beneath he coat he draw a round bottle and two glass tumbler no joke skippin ' th ' ole lady he chuckle in a undertone he pour out a liberal portion for himself and pass the bottle along bennington be unwilling to hurt the old fellow 's feeling after he have take so much trouble on he account but he be equally unwilling to drink the whisky so he throw it away when lawton be not look they walk leisurely toward the house lawton explain various improvement in a loud tone of voice intend more to lull he wife 's suspicion than to edify the young man the lady look on they sternly and announce dinner at the table bennington find mary already seat the easterner be place next to mr lawton at he other hand be maude eliza mary sit opposite throughout the meal she say little and only look up from she plate when bennington 's attention be call another way she mere presence however seem to open to the young man a different point of view he find mr lawton 's lengthy dissertation amusing he consider mr lawton in the light of a unique character and maude eliza while as disagreeable as ever come in for various excuse and explanation on she own behalf in the young man 's mind he become more responsive he tell a number of very good story at which the other laugh he detail some experience of he own at place in the world far remote select it must be confess with some slight reference to they dazzling effect on the company without actually show off he manage to get the effect of it the result of he effort be to harmonize to some extent these diverse element mrs lawton become more coherent mr lawton more communicative maude eliza stop whine -- occasionally and temporarily bennington have rarely be in such high spirit he be surprised himself but then be not that day of moment to he and would he not have be a strange sort of individual to have see in the world aught but brightness but mary respond not at all rather as bennington arise she fall until at last she hardly even move in she place chirk up chirk up cry mr lawton gaily for she i know some one who ought to be happy anyhow she glance meaningly from one to the other and laugh heartily bennington feel a momentary disgust at she tactlessness but cover it with some laughing sally of he own the meal break up in great good humor mr lawton and maude eliza remain to clear away the dish mr lawton remark that he must get back to work and shake hand in farewell most elaborately bennington laughingly promise they all that he would surely come again then he escape and follow mary up the hill surmise truly enough that she have go on toward the rock he think he catch a glimpse of she through the elder he hasten he footstep at this he stumble slightly from he pocket fall a letter he have receive that morning he pick it up and look at it idly it be from he mother and cover a number of closely-written page as he be about to thrust it back into he pocket a single sentence catch he eye it read : sally ogletree give a supper last week which be a very pretty affair he stop short on the trail and the world seem to go black around he he almost fall then resume he way but step now be hesitate and slow and he walk with he eye bent thoughtfully on the ground chapter xvii noblesse oblige the thought which cause bennington de lane so suddenly look grave be suggest by the sentence in he mother 's letter for the first time he realize that these people up to now so amusing be possibly destine to come into intimate relation with himself old bill lawton be mary 's father while mr lawton be mary 's mother maude be mary 's sister the next instant a great rush of love into he heart drive this feeling from it what matter anything provide she love he and he love she generous sentiment so fill he that there be room for nothing else he even experience dimly in the depths of he consciousness a faint pale joy that in thus accept what be disagreeable to he finer sensibility he be prove more truly to he own self the boundlessness of he love for the moment he be exalt by this instant revulsion against anything calculate in he passion and then slowly one by one the objection steal back like a flock of noisome sombre creature put to flight by a sudden movement but now return to they old nesting place the very unassuming method of they recurrence lend they a add influence almost before bennington know it they have establish a case and he find himself face to face with a very ugly problem perhaps it will be a little difficult for the average and democratic reader to realize fully the terrible proportion of this problem we whose life assume little require little of they intangible objection to the desire of we heart do not count for much against they realization there need the rough attrition of reality to turn back we calm complacent acquisition of that which we see to be for we best interest in the emotional world claim of ancestry mean nothing claim of society mean not much more claim of wealth be consider as evanescent among a class of man who by they effort and genius be able to render absolute wealth itself a evanescent quality when one of we love he question the worth of the object of he passion that established nothing else be of great importance there be a grand and noble quality in this but it miss much about the other state of affair -- wherein the woman 's appurtenance of all kind as well as the woman herself be significant -- be a delicate and subtle aura of the higher refinement -- the long refinement of the spirit through many generation -- which to a eye accustom to look for gradation of moral beauty possess a peach-blow iridescence of its own from one point of view the old-fashioned form of thought and courtesy be stilted and useless from another they retain still the lofty dignity of _ noblesse oblige _ so we would have none set down bennington de laney as a prig or a snob because he do not at once decide for he heart as against he aristocratic instinct not only all he early education but the life lesson of many generation of ancestor have teach he to set a fictitious value on social position he be a de laney on both side he have never be allow to forget it a long line of forefather proud-eyed in they gilded frame mutely gaze they sense of the obligation they have bequeath to this last representative of they race when one belong to a great family he can not live entirely for himself he disgrace or failure reflect not alone on he own reputation but it sully the fair fame of man long dead and bury and this be a dreadful thing for all these old puritan and cavalier these knight and baron these king 's councillor and scholar have perchance live out the long year of they life with all good intent and purpose and with all earnestness of execution merely that they might build and send down to posterity this same fair fame it be a bold man or a wicked man who will dare lightly to bring the effort of so many life to naught in the thought of these century of endeavor the sacrifice of mere personal happiness do not seem so great a affair after all the family name have take to itself a soul it be a living thing it may be work for it may be nourish by affection it may even be worship man may give they life to it with as great a devotion with as exalt a sense of renunciation and as lofty a joy in that renunciation as those who vow allegiance to st franci or st dominic the tear of the heart from the bosom often prove to be a mortal hurt when there be nothing to put in the gap of its emptiness not so when a tradition like this may partly take its place these and more subtle consideration be the noblest element of bennington de laney 's doubt but perhaps they be no more potent than some other which rush through the breach make for they in the young man 's decision he have always live so much at home that he have come to accept the home point of view without question that be to say he never examine the value of he parent 's idea because it never occur to he to doubt they he have no perspective in a way then he accept as axiom the social tenet hold by he mother or the business method practice by he father he believe that elderly man should speak precisely and in grammatical but colourless english he believe also that people should in society conduct themselves accord to the fashion-plate pattern design by mrs de laney he believe these thing not because he be a fool or shallow or lack in humor or snobbish but because nothing have ever happen to cause he to examine he belief closely that he might appreciate what they really be one of these view be that culture people be of a class in themselves and could not and should not mix with other class mrs de laney entertain a horror of vulgarity so deep-rooted be this horror that a remote taint of it be sufficient to thrust forever outside the pale of she approbation any unfortunate who exhibit it she prefer stupidity to common sense when the former be ally with good form and the latter only with plain kindliness this be partly instinct and partly the result of cultivation she would shrink with uncontrollable disgust from any of the lower class with whom she come unavoidably in contact a slight breach of the convention earn she distrust of one of she own caste as this personal idiosyncrasy fall in line with the de laney pride it be approve by the head of the family under encouragement it become almost a monomania bennington picture to himself only too vividly the effect of the lawton on this lady 's aristocratic prejudice he know only too well that bill lawton 's table manners would not be allow even in she kitchen he could imagine mr lawton 's fatuous conversation in the de laney 's drawing-room or maude eliza 's dressed-up self-consciousness the experience of have the three westerner to dinner just once would bennington know drive he lady mother to the verge of nervous prostration -- he remember he father 's one and only experience in bring business connection home to lunch -- he imagination fail to picture the effect of she have to endure they as actual member of the family as if this be not bad enough he restless fancy carry he a step farther he perceive the agony of shame and mortification real even though they be conventional she would have to endure in the face of society that the de laneys social leader rigid in respectability should be force to the humiliation of acknowledge a misalliance should be force to the add humiliation of confess that this marriage be not only with a family of inferior social standing but with one actually unlettered and vulgar bennington know only too well the temper of he mother -- and of society it would not be difficult to expand these doubt to amplify these reason and even to adduce other which occur to the unhappy young man as he climb the hill but enough have be say surely the reader no matter how remove in sympathy from that line of argument must be able now at least to sympathize to perceive that bennington de laney have some reason for think some excuse for the tardiness of he step as they carry he to a meeting with the girl he love for he do love she perhaps the more tenderly that doubt must perforce arise all these consideration affect not at all he thought of she but now for the first time bennington de laney be weigh the relative claim of duty and happiness he happiness depend upon he love that he duty to he race he parent he caste have some reality in fact and a very solid reality in he own estimation the author hope he have show if not several page have be write in vain the conflict in he mind have carry he to the rock here as he expect he find mary already arrive he ascend to the little plateau and drop wearily to the moss he face have go very white in the last quarter of a hour you see now why i ask you to come to-day she say without preliminary now you have see they and there be nothing more to conceal i know i know he reply dully i be try to think it out i can not see it yet they take entirely for grant that each know the subject of the other 's thought the girl seem much the more self-possessed of the two we may as well understand each other she say quietly without emotion you have tell I a certain thing and have ask I for a certain answer i could not give it to you before without deceive you now the answer depend on you i have deceive you in a way she go on more earnestly but i do not mean to i do not realize the difference truly i do not until i see the girl on the train then i know the difference between she and I and between she 's and mine and when you turn away i see that you be she kind and i see too that you ought to know everything there be about I then you speak i mean what i say too he interrupt you must believe that mary whatever come i be sorry you do she go on as though she have not hear he then with just a touch of impatience tinge the even calm of she voice oh why will man insist on say those thing she cry the way to win a girl be not thus he should see she often without speaking of love be everything to she until at last she find she can not live without he have i be that to you mary have it come to that with I he ask wistfully heaven help I i be afraid it have she cry bury she face in she hand a great gladness leap up into he face and die as the blaze of a fire leap up and expire that make it easier -- and harder he say it be bad enough as it be i do not know how i can make you understand dear i understand more than you think she reply become calm again and let she hand fall into she lap i be go to speak quite plainly you love I ben -- ah do not i know it she cry with a sudden burst of passion i have see it in you eye these many day i have hear it in you voice i have feel it well out from you great heart it have be sweet to I -- so sweet you can not know no man ever could know how that love of yours have fill my soul and my heart until there be room for nothing else in the whole wide world you love I he say wonderingly if i have not know that do you think i would have endure a moment 's hesitation after you have see the objectionable feature of my life do you think that if i have the slightest doubt of you love i could now understand _ why _ you hesitate but i do and i honor you for it you love I he repeat yes yes ben dear i _ do _ love you i love you as i never think to be permit to love do you want to know what i do that second day on the rock -- the day you first show I what you really be the day you tell I of you old home and the great tree it be all so peaceful and tender and comforting so sweet and pure that it rest I i feel here be a man at last who could not misunderstand I could not be abrupt and harsh and cruel i say to myself ` he be not perfect nor do he expect

of the result at last he raise he head slowly and turn to she with a air of decision mary -- he begin at that moment there become audible a sudden rattle of stone below the rock and at the same instant a harsh voice break in rudely upon they conversation chapter xviii the claim jumper bennington instinctively put he finger on he lip to enjoin silence and peer cautiously over the edge of the dike perhaps he be glad that this diversion have occur to postpone even for a short time the announcement of a decision it have cost he so much to make perhaps he recognize the voice three man be clamber a trifle laboriously over the broken rock at the foot of the dike swearing a little at they unstable footing but all apparently much in earnest in they conversation even as bennington look they come to a halt and then sink down each on a convenient rock talk interestedly one be old mizzou one be the man arthur the third be a stranger whom bennington have never see the latter have hardly the air of the country he be a dapper little man dress in a dark gray bob-tailed cutaway and a brown derby hat which be push far back on he head he face however be keen and alert and brown all of which characteristic indicate a active western life at no very remote day the word which have so powerfully arrest bennington de laney 's attention be deliver by old mizzou to this stranger thar the

dollar be not no way cheap this speech be so significantly in line with bennington 's surmise that he catch he breath and draw back cautiously out of sight but still in such a position that he could hear plainly every word utter by the group below the girl be watch he with bright interested eye listen carefully he whisper bring he mouth close to she ear i think there be some sort of plot here she nod ready comprehension and they settle themselves to hear the follow conversation : i see the assay reply the stranger 's voice to mizzou 's last statement but who be this mcpherson how do i know the

rock as he swing himself down the tree no he say without look back after he disappear -- in the direction of the holy smoke camp as she notice -- she descend rapidly to the ground and hurry sob excitedly away toward spanish gulch she be all alive with distress she have never realize until the moment of he failure how much she have love this man near the village she pause bath she eye in the brook and assume a air of deliberation and calmness begin make inquiry as to the whereabouts of jim fay chapter xix bennington prove game bennington de laney sit on the pile of rock at the entrance to the holy smoke shaft across he knee lay the thirty-calibre rifle he face be very white and set perhaps he be think of he return to new york in disgrace of he interview with bishop of he inevitable meeting with a multitude of friend who would read in the daily papers the account of he incompetence -- criminal incompetence they would call it the shadow be begin to lengthen across the slope of the hill up the gulch cow bell tinkle up the hill bird sing and through the little hollow twilight flow like a vapor the wild rose on the hillside be bloom -- late in this high altitude the pine be sing they endless song but bennington de laney be look upon none of these softer beauty of the hill rather he watch intently the lower gulch with its flood-wracked water-twisted skeleton lay bare could it be that in the destruction there figure forth he catch the symbol of he own condition that the dreary gloom of that ruin typify the chaos of sombre thought that occupy he own remorseful mind if so the fancy must have absorb he the moment slip by one by one the shadow grow longer the bird song louder and still the figure with the rifle sit motionless he face white and still watch the lower gulch or could it be that bennington de laney wait for some one and that therefore he gaze be so fix it would seem so for when the beat of hoof become audible the white face quicken into alertness and the motionless figure stir somewhat the rider come in sight rise and fall in a steady unhesitating lope he swing rapidly to the left and ascend the knoll opposite the shaft of the holy smoke lode he rein in he bronco and dismount the rider be jim fay bennington de laney do not move he look up at the newcomer with dull resignation he take it hard poor fellow think fay well what be to be do ask the easterner in a strained voice i suppose you know all about it or you would not be here yes i know all about it say fay gently you must not take it so hard perhaps we can do something we 'll be able to save one or two claim any way if we be quick about it i have hear something about patent claim go on de laney in the same strange dull tone could that be do no you have to do five hundred dollar ' worth of work and advertise for sixty day there be not time that settle it i do not know what we can do then well that depend i have come to help do something we have get to get a everlasting hustle on we that be all and i be afraid we be begin a little behindhand in the race you ought to have hunt I up at once i do not see what there be to do repeated bennington thickly do not you the assessment work have not be do -- that be the idea be not it -- and so the claim have revert to the government they be therefore open to location as in the beginning and that be just what davidson and that crowd be go to do to they well they be just as much open to we we 'll just _ jump we own claim _ what cry the easterner excite well relocate they ourselves if that suit you better bennington 's dull eye begin to light up so get a move on you go on fay hustle out some paper so we can make location notice under the term of a relocation we can use the old stake and ` discovery ' so all we have to do be to tack up a new notice all round that be the trouble that gang 's get they notice all write and i be afraid they have get ahead of we come on bennington who have up to this time remain seat on the pile of stone seem fill with a new and great excitement he totter to he foot throw he hand aloft thank god thank god he cry catch he breath convulsively fay turn to look at he curiously we be not that much out of the wood he remark the other gang 'll get in they work do not you fret they never will they never will cry the easterner exultantly they can not we 'll locate 'em all the tear well over he eye and run down he cheek what do you mean asked fay begin to fear the excitement have unsettle he companion 's wit because they be there cry bennington point to the mouth of the shaft near which he have be sit davidson slayton arthur -- they be all there and they can not get away i do not know what else to do i have to do something fay cast a understanding glance at the young man 's rifle and spring to the entrance of the shaft as though in direct corroboration of he speech fay could perceive just emerge from the shadow the sinister figure of the man arthur creep cautiously up the ladder evidently encourage to a attempt to escape by the sound of the conversation above the westerner snatch he pistol from he holster and present it down the shaft kindly return he command in a soft voice the upward motion of the dim figure cease and in a moment it have fade from view in the descent fay wait a moment in five minute he announce in louder tone i be go to let loose this six-shooter down that shaft i should advise you gentleman to retire to the tunnel he peer down again intently a sudden clatter and thud behind he startle he he look around bennington have fall at full length across the stone and he rifle fall have clash against the broken ore fay with a slight shrug of contempt at such womanish weakness run to he assistance he straighten the easterner out and place he fold coat under he head he 'll come around in a minute he mutter he glance toward the gulch and then back to the shaft can not leave that lay-out he go on he bent over the prostrate figure and begin to loosen the band of he shirt something about the boy 's clothing attract he attention so draw he knife he deftly and gently rip away the coat and shirt then he arise softly to he foot and bare he head i apologize to you say he address the recumbent form you be game in the fleshy part of the naked shoulder be a small round hole clot and smear with blood jim fay stoop and examine the wound closely the bullet have enter near the point of the shoulder but a little below so that it have merely cut a secant through the curve of the muscle if it have strike a quarter of a inch to the leave it would have gouge a furrow a quarter of a inch beyond that would have cause it to miss entirely fay see that the hurt itself be slight and that the easterner have faint more because of loss of blood than from the shock this determine to he satisfaction he move quickly to the mouth of the shaft way below he cry in a sharp voice and discharge he revolver twice down the opening then he steal noiselessly away and run at speed to the kitchen of the shack whence he immediately return with a pail of water and a number of towel he set these down and again peer down the shaft way below he repeat and drop down a sizable chunk of ore apparently satisfy that the prisoner be well warn he give he whole attention to he patient he wash the wound carefully then he make a compress of one of the towel and bind it with the other two look up he discover bennington watch he intently it be all right he assure the latter in answer to the question in he eye nothing but a scratch lie still a minute till i get this fasten and you can sit up and watch the rat hole while i get you some clothes in another moment or so the young man be prop up against a empty ore bucket he shoulder bind and he hand sling comfortably in a sling from he neck there you be say jim cheerily now you take my six-shooter and watch that aggregation till i get back they will not come out any but you may as well be sure he hand bennington he revolver and move off in the direction of the cabin whistle cheerfully the young man look after he thoughtfully nothing could have be more considerate than the westerner 's manner nothing could have be kinder than he prompt action -- bennington see that he pony now crop the brush near at hand be black with sweat -- nothing could have be more straightforward than he assistance in the matter of the claim and yet bennington de laney be not satisfied he feel he owe the sudden change of front to a word speak in he behalf by the girl this be a strange influence she possess thus to alter a man 's attitude entirely by the mere voicing of a wish the westerner return carry a loose shirt and a coat which he draw entire over the injured shoulder which leave one sleeve empty i guess that fix you say he with satisfaction look here put in bennington suddenly you have be mighty good to I in all this if you have not come along as you do these fellow would have nab I sooner or later and probably i would have lose the claim any way i feel i owe you a lot but i want you to know before you go any further that that do not square we you have have it in for I ever since i come out here and you have make it mighty unpleasant for I i can not forget that all at once i want to tell you plainly that although i be grateful enough i know just why you have do all this it be because _ she _ ask you to and know that i can not accept what you do for I as from a friend for i do not feel friendly toward you in the least he face flush painfully i be not try to insult you or be boorish he say i just want you to understand how i feel about it and now that you know i suppose you would better let the matter go although i be much oblige to you for fix I up he glance at he shoulder fay listen to this speech quietly and with patience what do you intend to do he ask when the other have quite finish i do not know yet if you 'll say nothing down below -- and i be sure you will not -- i 'll contrive some way of keep this procession down the hole and of feed they and then i 'll relocate the claim myself with one arm yes with one arm cry bennington fiercely with no arm at all if need be he break off suddenly with the new yorker 's ingrained instinct of repression i beg you pardon i mean i 'll do as well as i can of course how about the woman -- arthur 's wife she 'll give you trouble she have lock herself in she cabin already i will assist she to continue the imprisonment fay laugh outright and you expect with one arm and wound to feed four people keep they in confinement and at the same time to relocate eighteen claim lie scatter all over the hill well you be optimistic to say the least i 'll do the best i can repeat bennington doggedly and you will not ask help of a friend ready to give it not as a friend well fay chuckle apparently not displeased you be a obstinate young man or rather a pig-headed young man but i do not know as that count against you i 'll help you out anyway -- if not as a friend then as a enemy you see i have my march order from someone else and you have not anything to do with it bennington bow coldly but he immense relief flicker into he face in spite of himself what should we do first he ask formally sit here and wait for the kid respond jim who be the kid friend of mine -- trustworthy jim rearrange bennington 's covering and light a pipe tell we about it say he there be not much to tell i know i have to do something so i just hold they up and make they get down the shaft i do not know what i be go to do next but i be glad to have they out of the way to get time to think who plug you inquire fay motion with the mouthpiece of he pipe toward the wound shoulder that be arthur he have a little gun in he coat pocket and he shoot from inside the pocket i would make they drop all the gun they have i thought do you take a crack at he then ask fay interested oh no i just cover he and make he shell out as a matter of fact i do not believe any one of they know i be hit fay smoke on in silence glancing from time to time with satisfaction at the youth opposite during the passage of these event the day have not far advance the shadow of harney have not yet reach out to the edge of the hill hullo the kid say fay suddenly two pedestrian emerge from the lower gulch and bent they step toward the camp as they come nearer bennington with a gasp of surprise recognize the lesly the sprightly youth be dress just alike in knickerbockers and norfolk jacket of dark brown plaid and small college cap to match -- a outfit which bennington have always believe would attract too vivid attention in this country as they come nearer he see that the jacket be fit with pocket of great size in the pocket be sketch book and bulge article they catch sight of the two figure on the ore heap simultaneously behold we attentive host cry jeem he be now in the act of receive we with all honor bennington 's face fairly shine with pleasure at the encounter hullo fellow hullo there he cry out delightedly again and again and rise slowly to he foot this disclose the fact of he injury and the brother run forward with real sympathy and concern express on they lively countenance there ensue a rapid fire of question and answer the lesly prove to be already familiar with the detail of the attempt to jump the claim and understand at once fay 's brief account of the present situation over which they rejoice in the well-known leslie fashion they explode in genuine admiration of bennington 's adventure and praise that young man enthusiastically bennington could feel even before this that he stand on a different footing than formerly with these self-reliant young man they treat he as familiarly as ever but with a new respect the truth be they astuteness in read character which be as essentially a attribute of the artistic temperament in black and white as in word and phrase have show they already that they old acquaintance have grow from boy to man since last they have meet they know this even before they learn of its manifestation so astounding be the change that they give it credit perhaps for be more thorough than it be after the situation have be make plain bennington revert to the unexpectedness of they appearance but you have not tell I yet how you happen to be here he suggest i would as soon have expect to see ethel henry come up the gulch do not you get we letter cry bert in astonishment no i have not receive any letter do you write do we write well i should think so we write three time tell you we be come and when to expect we jeem and i wonder why you do not meet we that explain it seem funny you do not get any of those letter no i do not believe it be so funny after all respond bennington who have be think it over i

train around here off and on as i tell you once and this year jeem and i think we would do we summer sketch here and sort of revive old time so we pack up and come i be mighty glad you come anyway reply bennington fervently so be i we be just in time to help foil the villain as foiler jeem and i be a artistic success we have study foil under the best master in the bowery and sixth avenue theater where 's bill ask jim suddenly will be around in the morning you be to report progress at once do not dare to come up until after the row dreadful anxious though would have come if jeem and i have not forbid it bennington wonder vaguely who bill might be but he be begin to feel a little tired from the excitement and he wound so he say nothing the next thing be grub remark fay rise and gather he pony 's rein i 'll mosey up to the shack and see about supper you fellow can sit around and talk until i get organize he turn to move away lead he horse hold on a minute jim call bert you might lend I you bronc and i 'll lope down and set bill 's mind easy it will not take long good scheme approve jim heartily that be thoughtful of you bertie he drop the rein where he stand and the pony with the usual well-trained western docility hang he head and halt bert arise and look down the shaft supper will be serve shortly gentleman he observe suavely he turn toward the pony bert call bennington in a different voice do you say you be go down the gulch yes do you want to do something for I why surely what be it would you just as soon stop at the lawton ' and tell miss lawton for I that it be all right you 'll find the lawton house -- yes i know where the lawton house be interrupted bert but miss lawton you say do not you remember bert put in jame there be a kid there -- maude

on bert interpose jame as the other be about to exclaim do you mean ben the one you have be give such a rush for the last two month miss lawton and i be very good friend reply bennington with dignity wonder whence jame have he information bert draw in he breath sharply and open he mouth to speak hold on bert interpose jame again there be possibility in this do not destroy artistic development by undue haste what do you call the young lady ben miss lawton of course daughter of bill lawton why yes oh my eye ejaculate jame and you have eye in you head he cry after a moment you have ear in you head blame if you have not everything in you head but brain she be a good one i do not appreciate the subtlety of that woman before ben you everlasting idiot do you mean to tell I that you have see that girl every day for the last two month and do not know yet that she be too good to belong to bill lawton bert begin to laugh hysterically what do you mean cry bennington what i say _ she _ be not bill lawton 's daughter she name be not lawton at all o glory he do not even know she name jame in he turn go into a fit of laugh in uncontrollable excitement bennington seize he with he sound hand

bill for short and jim fay be she brother and the lawton they board there across bennington 's mind flash vaguely a suspicion that turn he faint with mortification who be this jim fay he ask he be jim fay -- jame leicester fay of boston not -- yes exactly the boston fay bert swing himself into the saddle better not say anything to bill about the young ` un 's shoulder call after he the ever-thoughtful jame chapter xx mask off now that it be all explain it seem to bennington de laney to be ridiculously simple he wonder how he could have be so blind for the moment however all other emotion be swallow up in intense mortification over the density he have display and the ridiculous light in which he must have appear to all the actor in the comedy he companion perceive this and kindly hasten to relieve it you be wonder how it all happen say he but you do not want to ask about it i be go to tell you the story of you life you see bert and i know the fay very well in boston and we know also that they be out here in the hill that be what tickle we so when you say you be come out to this very place you know yourself ben that you be pretty green when you be in new york -- you must know it because you have get over it so nicely since -- and it strike we after you talk so much about the ` wild west ' that it would be a shame if you do not get some of it so we write jim that you be come and to see to it that you have a time jim chuckle a little from he letter i guess you have it he write about that horse he spring on you and the time they lynch you and all the rest of it and we think we have do pretty well especially since jim write he think you be not half bad and have come through in good shape he write too that you have run against bill and that bill be fool you up in some way -- way unspecified he seem to be a little afraid that bill be trifle with you young affection -- how be it ben anyway -- but he say that bill be very haughty on the subject and as he would never be able to do anything with she before he do not believe he would have much success if he should try now i suggest that bill might get in a little deep herself go on jame watch he listener 's face keenly but bert seem inclined to the opinion that any one as experience as bill be perfectly able to take care of herself anywhere she be a mighty fine girl ben old man suddenly conclude this startling youth hold out he hand and i wish you every success in the world in get she thank you jeem reply bennington simply without attempt to deny the state of affair i be sure i be glad of you good wish but i be afraid i have not any show now he sigh deeply i 'll give a opinion on that after i see bill again observe the artist sagely it always strike I as be queer that two of the most refined people about here should happen to be live in the same house comment bennington only just aware that it have so strike he do it indeed say leslie drolly you be just burst with sagacity now be not you and you sherlock-holme intellect be seethe with conjecture the lover 's soul be far above the sordid earthly consideration which interest we ordinary mortal but i 'll bet a hat you be wonder how it come that a boston girl be out here without any more restraint on she action than a careless brother who do not bother himself and why she be out here at all and a few thing like that ` fess up well acknowledge bennington a trifle reluctantly of course it be a little out of the ordinary but then it be all right somehow i 'll swear all right of course it be all right they have not any father or mother you know and they be independent of action as you have no doubt notice bill keep house for jim for some time -- and they use to keep a great house i tell you say jame smack he lip in recollection bert and i use to visit there a good deal that be why they call I jeem -- to distinguish I from jim then jim get tire of do nothing -- they possess everlasting rock -- you know they lament dad be a sort of amateur croesus -- and he decide to monkey with mine bert and i be here one summer so bill and jim just pull up stake and come along too they have be here ever since they be both true sport and like the life and all that and besides jim have keep busy monkey with mining speculation they be the salt of the earth that pair if they _ do _ worry poor old boston to death with they way of do thing that be one reason i like 'em so much society have fit over they doings but it can not get along without they the fay be a pretty good family be not they inquire bennington he be irresistibly impel to ask this question best go mayflower william the conqueror and all that rot you must know of the boston fay i do that be i have hear of they but i do not know whether they be the same jeem perceive that the topic interested the young fellow so he descant at length concern the fay they belongings and they doings time pass rapidly bennington be surprise to see jim come down to they through the afterglow of sunset announce vociferously that the meal be at last prepared i have feed the old lady he announce and unlock she she do not know what be up anyway she just sit there like a graven image scare to death she do not know a relocation from a telegraph pole i tell she to get a move on she and fix we up some bunk and i guess she be at it now they consult as to the best means of guard the prisoner it be finally agree that leslie should stand sentinel until the other have finish supper i want to watch the effect of this light on the hill he announce positively and i be not hungry and jim ought to cool off before come out into the air and ben 's shoulder ought to be take care of get along with ye bennington accompany jim to the meal very cheerfully the fact as to the latter 's persecution remain the same but in some way they do not hold the same proportion as heretofore the mere item that jim fay be mary 's brother instead of she lover make all the difference in the world he chatter in a lively fashion concern the method of work to be adopt suddenly he pull himself up short i think i must beg you pardon he say i hear about it all from jim leslie i have be very green and you be quite right if you still want to do so let 's go into this together as friend no pardon come to I respond fay heartily i have be a little tough on you occasionally that i 'll admit and if i have do too much i be sure i beg _ you _ pardon i see you have the right stuff in you that day when you stick to the horse until you ride he and i have always like you first-rate since then and i would not worry about this last matter you be green to the country and be put down here without definite instruction you trust davidson of course and get fool in it but then you just follow bishop 's lead in that he would be trust davidson before you get here and if he have not trust he right along you can bet you would have have you direction from a to z he be as much to blame as you be and you 'll find that he know it i be afraid you can not make I feel any better about that object bennington shake he head despondently well you 'll feel better after a time and anyway there be no actual harm do at this moment bert leslie enter bill 's tickled to death he announce she say she be come up first thing in the morning she want to come right off and cook supper but i would not let she she could not very well stay here all night and it be pretty late now what you get here pork coffee murphy he sit down and begin to eat hungrily jim arise to relieve the sentinel at the mouth of the shaft at the same time advise de laney to go to bed as soon as possible you be tire he say and need rest wet that compress well with pond 's extract and we 'll dress it again in the morning in the kitchen he find the strange sombre woman sit bolt upright in silence she arm fold rigidly across she flat bosom she look straight in front of she and rock slowly to and fro on she chair you must not worry mr arthur console fay kindly pause for a moment there be not go to be any trouble it be just a little matter of mining law we 'll have to keep you husband lock up for a few day but he will not be harm the woman make no reply fay look at she sharply again and pass out jeem he direct that individual at the mouth of the shaft go get you grub send the kid to bed right off and then you and bert come down here and we 'll fix up these prairie dog of ours down the hole jeem and he brother therefore help the wounded hero to bed and leave he to a much-needed slumber after which they return to the spot of light in the darkness which mark the glow of fay 's pipe that capable individual issue direction first of all they lower by means of a light cord food and water to they prisoner the latter maintain a sullen silence and it be only by the lighten of the burden at the end of the line that those above know they provision have be appropriate then follow blanket the lesly be strongly in favor of as uncomfortable a confinement as possible and so disapprove of blanket but fay insist after that the brother man the windlass and let jim down in a bowline about twenty foot while he detach and remove two length of the shaft ladder this leave no means of ascent as the wall of the shaft be smoothly timbered but to make matter sure they cover the mouth with inch thick board on which they pile large chunk of ore you do not suppose they 'll smother suggest bert not much there be only three of they and often man drill will stay down ten or twelve hour at a time without use up the air sweet dream gentleman call the irrepressible jeem in farewell there be one other thing say jim and then we can crawl in he approach the cabin in which arthur and he wife be accustom to sleep and listen until he have satisfy himself that mr arthur be inside then he softly lock the door the key of which he have appropriate immediately after supper and prop shut the heavy wooden shutter of the window no dramatic escape in ours thank you he mutter he draw back and survey he work with satisfaction come on boy let 's turn in to-morrow we slave chapter xxi the land of vision although he have retire so early and in so exhaust a condition bennington de laney could not sleep he have take a slight fever and the wound in he shoulder be stiff and painful for hour on end he lay flat on he back stare at the dim illuminations of the window and listen to the faint out-of-door noise or the sharper boring of insect in the log of the structure he mind be not active he lay in a semi-torpor whose most vivid consciousness be that of mental discomfort and the interminability of time the event of the day rise up before he but he seem to loathe they merely because they have be of so active a character and now he could not bear to have he brain tease even with they impalpable shadow strangely enough this altitude seem to create a certain dead polarity between he and they they lay sullenly outside he brain repel by this dead polarity and he look at they languidly against the dim illumination of the window with a dull joy that they could not come near he and enter the realm of he thought all this be the fever in a little time these event become endowed with more palpable body which move the square of semilucent window fade into something indescribable and that into something indescribable and that into something else still indescribable they move swiftly and thing happen he find himself suddenly in a long gallery half in the dusk half in the lamplight pacing slowly back and forth wait for something he know not what to he come a bustling motherly old woman with a maid 's cap on who say sure master ben the moon be shine and let I tell ye at the end of the hall be a balcony of iron and miss mary will be glad you know that same and at that he seem to himself to be hunting for a coin with which to tip she he discover it turn to lead between he finger whereupon the old woman laugh shrilly and disappear and he find himself alone on the prairie at midnight he mind seem to be fill with great thought which would make he famous over and over again he say to himself : the rain pour and the people down below chuckle as they move about each under he little umbrella of self-conceit they look up to the mountain say ` the fool why look he so high he be lose in the mist up there and he might be safe and dry with we ' but the mountain have over he the arch of the universe and sleep calmly in the sun of truth little reck he of the cloud below and know not at all the little self-satisfied fool who pity he and he think this be the sum of all wisdom and that with it would come immortality then a bell begin to boom a deep-toned bell whose toll be inexpressibly solemn and pour into he heart a sadness too deep for sorrow as though there dwell a enchantment in the very sound itself the dark prairie shift like a scene and in they stead he see in a cold gray twilight a high doorway build of a cold gray stone rough-hewed and heavy through its arch pass then a file of gray-cowled monk they face conceal each carry a torch whose flicker waver light cast weird cowled figure on the gray stone and in they midst be bear a bier cover with white and as the deep bell boom on through all the vision like a subtle thrilling presence bennington seem to himself to stand finger on lip the eternal custodian of the secret of it all -- the secret that each of these cowled figure be a man -- a divine soul and a body with ear and eye and a brain that he have thought and he life that be and be to come be of these thought that there beat heart beneath that gray and that they voice must not be heed that in the morning these wearied eye await but the eve and that the evening bring no hope for a new day that these silent awesome being live within the heavy stone alone with monotony until the bell toll as now and they be carry through the arched doorway into the night and above all that to each there be sixty minute in the hour and twenty-four hour in the day and year and year of these day this be the secret and he be its custodian none of the other know of it but its awfulness make he sad and stern he check the day he number the hour he count the minute rigorously lest one escape one do escape and he turn back to catch it and pursue it far away from the stone doorway and the dull twilight and even the sound of the bell off into a land where there be many hill and valley among which the fugitive minute hide elusively and he pursue the minute call upon it to come to he and the name by which he call it be mary then he see that the square of the window have become yellow with the sun and that through it he could hear plainly the voice of the lesly talk in high tone he brain be very clear more so than usual and he not only receive many impression and order they with ease and despatch but he very sens seem more than ordinarily acute he could distinguish even by day when the night stillness have withdraw its favor condition the boring of the sawdust insect in the log of the cabin only he be very tired he hand seem a long distance away as though it would require a extraordinary effort of the will to lift they so he lay quiet and listen the conversation of which he be the eavesdropper be carry on by fit and start first a sentence would be deliver by one of the lesly then would ensue a pause as though for a reply inaudible to any but the interlocutor themselves then another sentence and so on like a man at a telephone after a moment 's puzzling over it bennington understand that jim leslie be talk to one of the prisoner down the shaft you have the true sport spirit sir cry the voice of jeem i honor you for it but so philosophical a resignation while it incline we soul to know more of you personally nevertheless render you much less interesting in such a juncture as the present i would like to hear from mr davidson pause that be a performance mr davidson which i can not entirely commend it be fluent to be sure but it lack variety a true artist would have intersperse those finer shades and gradation of meaning which go to express the numerous and clash emotion which must necessarily agitate you venerable bosom you surely mean more than _ damn _ _ damn _ be expressive and forceful because capable of be enunciate at one explosive effort of the breath but it be monotonous when too freely employ to be sure you might with some justice reply that you have qualify say adjective strongly -- but the qualification be trite though blasphemous and you limit it very nicely -- but the limitation to myself be unjust as it overlook my brother 's equitable claim to notice pause i _ beg _ pardon kindly repeat pause delicious mr davidson you have redeem yourself bertie do you hear mr davidson 's last remark no reply another voice could not be bother what be it mr davidson with a polished sarcasm that amount to genius advise I in he picturesque vernacular ` t ' set thet jaw of mine goin ' and then go away a ' leave it ' pause i beg you mr slayton do not think of such a thing i would not have he repress for anything in the world as you value we future acquaintanceship do not end we interview thank you i appreciate you compliment and in return will repeat that though in a pretty sharp game you be a true sport we friend arthur be strangely silent i have never meet mr arthur i have hear that either he face or he hat look like a fried egg but i forget for the moment which be so characterize pause fie fie mr arthur addison in he most intoxicated moment would never have use such language and then the man in the cabin lie on the bed begin to laugh in a low tone he laugh be not pleasant to hear he be realize how funny thing be to other people -- thing that have not be funny to he at all for the first time he catch a focus on he father with he pompous pride and he stilted diction on he mother 's social creed he care as much for they as ever and he respect be as great but now he realize that outsider could never understand they as he do and that always to other they must appear ridiculous so he laugh and too he perceive that the world would see something grimly humorous in he insistence on the girl 's parentage when all the time in the home to which he be to bring she dwelt these unlovable snobbish old parent of he own so he laugh and he think of how he have be fool and play with and dupe and cheat and all but disgrace by the very people on whom he have look down from a fancied superiority and so he laugh and as he laugh he hand swell up to the size of pillow and he think that he be dress in a loose garment spot all over with great spot and that he be stand on a stage before these grave silent hillman the light come in through a golden-yellow square just behind they in the front row sit mary look at he with wide-open trusting eye and he be revolve these hand like pillow around each other try to make the sombre man and the wistful girl laugh with he while over and over certain word slip in between he cachinnation like stray bird-note through a rattle of drum i have no fresh motley for my lady 's amusement he be say to she no new philosophy to spread out for my lady 's inspection no bright picture to display for my lady 's pleasure and so i like a poor poverty-stricken minstrel whose harp have be break yet dare beg at the castle gate for a crumb of my lady 's bounty at which he would have weep but could only laugh louder and louder then dimly he know again he be in he own room and he feel that several people be move back and forth quickly he try to rise but could not and he know that he be slip back to the hall and the solemn crowd of man he do not want to go he grasp convulsively at the blanket with he sound hand and shriek aloud i be sick i be sick i be sick he cry louder and louder some one lay a cool hand on he forehead and he lay quiet and smile contentedly the room and the people become wraithlike he see they still but he see through they to a reality of soft meadow and summer sky from which mary lean rest she hand on he brow voice speak but muffle as though by many veil they talk of various thing it be the mountain fever he hear one say it be a wonder he escape it so long then the cool hand be withdraw from he brow and inexorably he be hurry back into the land of vision chapter xxii flower o ' the world bennington de laney find himself lie comfortably in bed listen with closed eye to a number of sound of these there most impressed he two they be a certain rhythmical muffle beat punctuate at interval by a slight rustling of paper and a series of metallic click soften somewhat by distance after a time it occur to he to open he eye at once he notice two thing more -- that he have some way acquire fresh white sheet for he bed and that on a little table near the foot of he bunk stand a vase of flower these two new impression satisfy he for some time he brood over they slowly for he brain be weak then he allow he gaze to wander to the window from above its upper sash depend two long white curtain of some lacelike material freshly starched and with deep edge ruffle slightly in a please fashion they stir slowly in the warm air from the window bennington watch they lazily breathe with pleasure the balmy smell of pine and listen to the sound the clinking noise come through the open window he know now that they mean the impact of sledge on drill some one be drill somewhere he glance rove on and rest without surprise on a girl in a rock chair sway softly to and fro and read a book the turning of whose leaf have cause the rustling of paper which he have notice first for a long time he lay silent and contented she fine brown hair have be draw back smoothly away from she forehead into a loose knot she be dress in a simple gown of white -- soft and rest on the curve of she slender figure as lightly as down on the surface of the warm meadow from beneath the full skirt peep a little slippered foot which tap the floor rhythmically as the chair rock to and fro finally she glance up and discover he lock at she she arise and come to the bedside she finger on she lip you must not talk she say sweetly a great joy in she eye i be so glad you be better she leave the room and return in a little time with a bowl of chicken broth which she feed he with a spoon it taste very good to he and he feel the stronger for it but as yet he voice seem a long distance away when she turn to leave the room however he murmur inarticulately and attempt to stir she come back to the bed at once i 'll be back in a minute she say gently but see some look of plead in he eye she put the empty bowl and spoon on the little table and sit down on the floor near the bed he smile and then close he eye fall asleep -- outside the border of the land of vision and with the music of a woman 's voice haunt the last moment of he consciousness after the fever have once break he return to strength be rapid although accompany by delirium and though run its full course of week the mountain fever be not as intense as typhoid the exhaustion of the vital force be not as great and recuperation be easier in two day bennington be sit up in bed possess of a appetite that threaten to depopulate entirely the little log chicken coop he find that the tenancy of the camp have materially changed mr lawton and miss fay have move in bag and baggage -- but without the inquisitive maude bennington be glad to observe mr lawton in the presence of a emergency turn out to be helpful in every way she know all about mountain fever for one thing and as the country be not yet bless with a doctor this be not a unimportant item then too she be a most capable housekeeper -- she cook market sweep dust and tyrannize over the mere man in a manner to be envy even by a new england dame fay and the lesly have also take up they quarter in the camp old mizzou and the arthur have go the old bunk house now accommodate a good-sized gang of miner who have be engage by fay to do the necessary assessment work altogether the camp be very populous and lively after a little bennington learn of everything that have happen during the three week of he sickness it all come out in a series of charming conversation when in the evening twilight they gather in the room where the sick man lay mary -- as bennington still like to name she -- occupy the rock chair and the three young man distribute themselves as best suit they it be most homelike and rest bennington have never before experience the delight of see a young girl about a house and he enjoy to the utmost the deft little touch by which be impart that airily feminine appearance to a room or more subtly the mere spirit of daintiness which breathe always from a woman of the right sort he feel there be add a newer and calmer element of joy to he love during the first period of he illness then jim fay and the leslie brother have work energetically relocate the claim while mr lawton and miss fay have take charge of the house by the end of the first day the job be finish the question then come up as to the disposition of the prisoner we do not want the nuisance of a prosecution say fay because that would mean that these mossback could drag we off to rapid city any old time as witness and keep we there indefinitely neither do we want to let they off scot-free they would make we altogether too much trouble for that bert here suggest a very simple way out i go down to spanish gulch and tell the boy the whole story from start to finish well it be not hard to handle a western crowd if you go at it right the boy always think you have good stuff in you since you ride the horse and smash leary 's face that night it would have be easy to have cook up all kind of trouble for we precious gang but i manage to get the boy in a frivolous mood so they merely come up and have fun i should say they do bert interject they drag the crowd out of the shaft -- and they be a tough-looking proposition i can tell you -- and stand they up in a row they shave half of davidson 's head and half he beard on opposite side they leave tuft of hair all over arthur they make a six-pointed star on the top of slayton 's crown then they put the man 's clothes on wrong side before and tie they face the rear on three scrubby little burro then the whole outfit be start toward deadwood the boy take they as far as blue lead where they deliver they over to the gang there with instruction to pass they along they probably get to deadwood i do not know what be become of they since i think it be cruel put in miss fay decidedly perhaps but it be better than hang they what become of mr arthur ask the invalid i ship she to deadwood with a little money poor creature it would be a good thing for she if she husband never do show up she would get along better without he the claim located and the sharper get rid of fay proceed at once to put the assessment work under way in this he long western experience and he intimate acquaintance with the man stand he in such good stead that he be enable to contract the work at a cheaper rate than bishop 's estimate i write to bishop he say and tell he all about it in he answer which i 'll show you he take all the blame to himself just as i anticipate he would and he be so tickled to death over the show make by the assay that he be come out here himself to see about development so i be afraid you be go to lose you job i be not sorry to go home but i be sorry to leave the hill he look wistfully through the twilight toward mary 's slender figure outline against the window the three man catch the glance and begin at once to talk in low tone to each other in a moment they go out somehow on return from the land of vision ben find that the world have move and that one of the result of the movement be that many thing be take for grant by the little community of four who surround he it be as though the tangle have unravel quietly while he sleep she lean toward he shyly and whisper something to he ear he smile contentedly they talk then long and comfortably in the dusk -- about how the lesly have write the letter how much trouble she have take to conceal she real identity and all the rest i send bill lawton up to warn you camp the first day i meet you say she why i remember he cry he be there when i get back and they talk on of they many experience in the fashion of lover and how they have come to care for each other and when i make up my mind it be so foolish a joke she confess that i determine to tell you all about it you remember i have something to tell you at the pioneer 's picnic that be it but then you remember the girl in the train and how when she look at we you turn away i remember that well enough reply bennington but what have that to do with it it be a perfectly natural thing to do dearest i see that plainly enough now but it hurt I a little that you should be ashamed of I as a western girl and i make up my mind to test you why i be not thinking of that at all cry bennington i be just ashamed of my clothes i never think of you she reach out and pat he hand i be glad to hear that ben dear after all it do hurt and i be so foolish i think if you be ashamed of I you would never stand the thought of the lawton so i do not tell you the truth then but resolve to test you in that way foolish little girl say he tenderly but it come out all right do not it yes she sigh with a happy gesture of the hand they fall silent i want you to tell I something dear say bennington after a while you need not unless you want to but i have think about it a great deal i will tell you ben anything in the world we ought to be frank with each other now do not you think so i do not know as i ought to say anything about it after all he hesitate evidently embarrassed but mary you know you have hint a little at it yourself you remember you say something once about lose faith and be make hard and -- she take both he hand in hers and draw they closely to she breast although he could not see she eye against the dusk he know that she be look at he steadily listen quietly ben dear and i will tell you before i come out here i think i love a man and he -- well he do not treat I well i have trust he and every one else implicitly until the very moment when -- i feel it very much and i come west with jim to get away from the old scene now i know that it be only fascination but it be very real then you do not like that ben do you the memory be not pleasant to I and yet she say with a wistful little break of the voice if it have not be for that i would not have be the woman i be and i could not love you dearest as i do it be never in the same way twice but each time something better and higher be add to it oh my darling i _ do _ love you i do love you so much and you must be always my generous poetic _ boy _ as you be now she strain he hand to she as though afraid he would slip from she clasp all that be ideal so soon harden i can not bear to think of you change bennington lean forward and they lip meet we will forgive he he murmur and what that remark have to do with it only we gentler reader will be able to say ah the delicious throb silence after the first kiss what be you decision that afternoon on the rock ben you never tell I she ask presently in a lighter tone would you have take I in spite of my family he laugh with faint mischief before i tell you i want to ask _ you _ something he say in he turn suppose i have decide that even though i love you i must give you up because of my duty to my family -- suppose that i say -- what would _ you _ have do would you love for I have be so strong that you would have finally confess to I the fact that the lawton be not you parent or would you have throw I over entirely because you think i do not love you enough to take you for yourself she consider the matter seriously for some little time ben i do not know she confess at last frankly i can not tell no more can i sweetheart i have not decide she pucker she brow in the darkness with genuine distress woman worry more than man over past intangibility he smile comfortably to himself for in he grasp he hold unresist the dearest little hand in the world outside the ever-charming ever-mysterious night of the hill be steal here and there in sigh and silence from the darkness come the high sweet tenor of bert leslie 's voice in the word of a song : a sailor to the sea a hunter to the pine and sea and pine alike to joy the rover the wood-smell to the nostril of the lover of the trail and heart to heart the whole world over through and through the word of the song like a fine silver wire through richer cloth of gold twine the long-drawn tremulous note of the white-throated sparrow the nightingale of the north the dear old hill he murmur tenderly we must come back to they often sweetheart i wish i _ wish _ i know she cry hold he hand tighter know what he ask surprised what you would have do and what i would have do well he reply with a happy sigh i know what i be _ go _ to do and that be quite enough for I the end end of project gutenberg 's the claim jumper by stewart edward white
