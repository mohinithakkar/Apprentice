on she heel and speak gibberish for which she be presently drive out of the place by tarn roberton the baillie and the village dog but the thing stick in my memory and together with the fact that i be a Thursday 's bairn and so accord to the old rhyme have far to go convinced I long ere i have come to man 's estate that wanderings and surprise would be my portion it be in the rain that this tale begin i be just turn of eighteen and in the back-end of a drip September set out from we moorland house of auchencairn to complete my course at edinburgh college the year be 1685 a ill year for we countryside for the folk be at odds with the king 's government about religion and the land be full of covenant and repression small wonder that i be backward with my colleging and at a age when most lad be buckle to a calling be still attend the prelection of the edinburgh master my father have blow hot and cold in politics for he be fiery and unstable by nature and swift to judge a cause by its latest professor he have cast out with the hamilton gentry and have break the head of a dragoon in the change-house of lesmahagow have he little estate mulct in fine all of which together with some natural curiosity and a family love of fight send he to the ill-fated field of bothwell brig from which he be lucky to escape with a bullet in the shoulder thereupon he have be put to the horn and be now lie hide in a den in the moss of douglas water it be a sore business for my mother who have the task of ward off prying eye from we ragged household and keep the fugitive in life she be a tweedside woman as strong and staunch as a oak and with a heart in she like robert bruce and she be cheerful too in the worst day and would go about the place with a bright eye and a old song on she lip but the thing be beyond a woman 's bearing so i have perforce to forsake my colleging and take a hand with we family vexation the life make I hard and watchful trust no man and brusque and stiff towards the world and yet all the while youth be work in I like yeast so that a spring day or a west wind would make I forget my trouble and thirst to be about a kindlier business than skulk in a moorland dwelling my mother beseech I to leave she what she would say have young blood to do with this bickering of kirk and old wife ' lamentation you have to learn and see and do andrew and it be time you be begin but i would not listen to she till by the mercy of god we get my father safely forth of scotland and hear that he be dwelling snugly at leyden in as great patience as he nature allow thereupon i bethought I of my neglect colleging and leave my book and plenish to come by the lanark carrier set out on foot for edinburgh the distance be only a day 's walk for a active man but i start late and purpose to sleep the night at a cousin 's house by kirknewton often in bright summer day i have travel the road when the moor lay yellow in the sun and lark make a cheerful chorus in such weather it be a pleasant road with long prospects to cheer the traveller and kindly ale-house to rest he leg in but that day it rain as if the floodgate of heaven have open when i cross clyde by the bridge at hyndford the water be swirl up to the key-stone the way be a foot deep in mire and about carnwath the bog have overflow and the whole neighborhood swam in a loch it be pitiful to see the hay afloat like water-weed and the green oats scarcely show above the black flood in two minute after start i be wet to the skin and i thank providence i have leave my little dutch _ horace _ behind I in the book-box by three in the afternoon i be as unkempt as any tinker my hair plaster over my eye and every fold of my coat run like a gutter presently the time come for I to leave the road and take the short-cut over the moor but in the deluge where the eye could see no more than a yard or two into a gray wall of rain i begin to misdoubt my knowledge of the way on the left i see a stone dovecot and a cluster of tree about a gateway so know how few and remote be the dwelling on the moorland i judge it wiser to seek guidance before i stray too far the place be grow up with grass and sore neglect weed make a carpet on the avenue and the dyke be break by cattle at a dozen place suddenly through the fall water there stand up the gaunt end of a house it be no cot or farm but a proud mansion though badly need repair a low stone wall border a pleasance but the garden have fall out of order and a dial-stone lay flat on the earth my first thought be that the place be tenantless till i catch sight of a thin spire of smoke struggle against the downpour i hope to come on some gardener or groom from whom i could seek direction so i skirt the pleasance to find the kitchen door a glow of fire in one of the room cry welcome to my shiver bone and on the far side of the house i find sign of better care the rank grass have be mow to make a walk and in a corner flourish a little group of pot-herb but there be no man to be see and i be about to retreat and try the farm-town when out of the doorway step a girl she be maybe sixteen year old tall and well-grown but of she face i could see little since she be all muffle in a great horseman 's cloak the hood of it cover she hair and the wide flap be fold over she bosom she sniff the chill wind and hold she head up to the rain and all the while in a clear childish voice she be sing it be a song i have hear one make by the great montrose who have suffer shameful death in edinburgh thirty year before it be a man 's song full of pride and daring and not for the lip of a young maid but that hooded girl in the wild weather sing it with a challenge and a fire that no cavalier could have better my dear and only love i pray that little world of thee be govern by no other sway than purest monarchy for if confusion have a part which virtuous soul abhor and hold a synod in thy heart i 'll never love thee more so she sing like youth daring fortune to give it aught but the best the thing thrill I so that i stand gaping then she look aside and see I you business man she cry with a imperious voice i take off my bonnet and make a awkward bow madam i be on my way to edinburgh i stammer for i be mortally ill at ease with woman i be uncertain of the road in this weather and come to beg direction you leave the road three mile back she say but i be for cross the moor i say she push back she hood and look at I with laugh eye i see how dark those eye be and how raven black she wander curl of hair you have come to the right place she cry i can direct you as well as any jock or sandy about the town where be you go to i say kirknewton for my night 's lodging then march to the right up by yon plant till you come to the howe burn follow it to the top and cross the hill above its well-head the wind be blow from the east so keep it on you right cheek that will bring you to the spring of the leith water and in a hour or two from there you will be back on the highroad she use a manner of speech foreign to we part but very soft and pleasant in the ear i thank she clap on my drip bonnet and make for the dyke beyond the garden once i look back but she have no further interest in I in the mist i could see she peer once more skyward and through the drone of the deluge come a echo of she song i 'll serve thee in such noble way as never man before i 'll deck and crown thy head with bay and love thee more and more the encounter cheer I greatly and lift the depression which the eternal drizzle have settle on my spirit that bold girl singing a martial ballad to the storm and take pleasure in the snellness of the air be like a rousing summons or a cup of heady wine the picture ravish my fancy the proud dark eye the little wanton curl peep from the hood the whole figure alert with youth and life -- they cheer my recollection as i trod that sour moorland i try to remember she song and hum it assiduously till i get some kind of version which i shout in my tuneless voice for i be only a young lad and my life have be bleak and barren small wonder that the call of youth set every fiber of I a-quiver i have do better to think of the road i find the howe burn readily enough and scramble up its mossy bottom by this time the day be wear late and the mist be deepen into the darker shades of night it be a eery business to be out on the hill at such a season for they be deathly quiet except for the lash of the storm you will never hear a bird cry or a sheep bleat or a weasel scream the only sound be the drum of the rain on the peat or its plash on a boulder and the low surge of the swell stream it be the place and time for dark deed for the heart grow savage and if two enemy meet in the hollow of the mist only one would go away i climb the hill above the howe burn-head keep the wind on my right cheek as the girl have order that take I along a rough ridge of mountain pit with peat-bog into which i often stumble every minute i expect to descend and find the young water of leith but if i hold to my direction i must still mount i see now that the wind must have veer to the south-east and that my plan be lead I into the fastness of the hill but i would have wander for week sooner than disobey the word of the girl who sing in the rain presently i be on a steep hill-side which i ascend only to drop through a tangle of scree and jumper to the mire of a great bog when i have cross this more by luck than good guidance i have another scramble on the steep where the long tough heather clog my footstep about eight o'clock i awake to the conviction that i be hopelessly lose and must spend the night in the wilderness the rain still fall unceasingly through the pit-mirk and i be as sodden and bleached as the bent i trod on a night on the hill have no terror for I but i be mortally cold and furiously hungry and my temper grow bitter against the world i have forget the girl and she song and desire above all thing on earth a dry bed and a chance of supper i have be plunge and slip in the dark moss for maybe two hour when look down from a little rise i catch a gleam of light instantly my mood change to content it could only be a herd 's cottage where i might hope for a peat fire a bicker of brose and at the worst a couch of dry bracken i begin to run to loosen my numbed limb and presently fall headlong over a little scaur into a moss-hole when i crawl out with peat plaster my face and hair i find i have lose my notion of the light 's whereabouts i strove to find another hillock but i seem now to be in a flat space of bog i could only grope blindly forwards away from the moss-hole hope that soon i might come to a lift in the hill suddenly from the distance of about half a mile there fall on my ear the most hideous wail it be like the cat on a frosty night it be like the clanging of pot in a tinker 's cart and it would rise now and then to a shriek of rhapsody such as i have hear at field-preaching clearly the sound be human though from what kind of crazy human creature i could not guess have i be less utterly forwandered and the night less wild i think i would have speed away from it as fast as my leg have carry I but i have little choice after all i reflect the worst bedlamite must have food and shelter and unless the gleam have be a will-o ' - the-wisp i foresee a fire so i hasten in the direction of the noise i come on it suddenly in a hollow of the moss there stand a ruin sheepfold and in the corner of two wall some plaid have be stretch to make a tent before this burn a big fire of heather root and bog-wood which hiss and crackle in the rain round it squat a score of woman with plaid draw tight over they head who rock and moan like a flight of witch and two -- three man be on they knee at the edge of the ash but what catch my eye be the figure that stand before the tent it be a long fellow who hold he arm to heaven and sing in a great throaty voice the wild dirge i have be listen to he hold a book in one hand from which he would pluck leaf and cast they on the fire and at every burnt-offering a wail of ecstasy would go up from the hooded woman and kneel man then with a final howl he hurl what remain of he book into the flame and with upraised hand begin some sort of prayer i would have flee if i could but providence will it otherwise the edge of the bank on which i stand have be rot by the rain and the whole thing give under my foot i slither down into the sheepfold and pitch headforemost among the worship woman and at that with a yell the long man leap over the fire and have I by the throat my bone be too sore and weary to make resistance he drag I to the ground before the tent while the rest set up a skirl that deafen my wit there he plump I down and stand glower at I like a cat with a sparrow who be ye and what do ye here disturb the remnant of israel say he i have no breath in I to speak so one of the man answer some gangrel body

have long be a thorn in the side of the preacher hold certain strange heresy that discomfort even the wildest of the hill-folk they have clap he into prison but the man be three part mad have be let go and ever since have be make strife in the westland part of clydesdale i have hear much of he and never any good it be he way to draw after he a throng of demented woman so that the poor draggle-tailed creature forget husband and bairn and follow he among the moss there be deed of violence and blood to he name and the look of he be enough to spoil a man 's sleep he be about six and a half foot high with a long lean head and stare cheek bone he brow grow like bush and beneath glow he evil and sunken eye i remember that he have monstrous long arm which hang almost to he knee and a great hairy breast which show through a rent in he seaman 's jerkin in that strange place with the drip spell of night about I and the fire casting weird light and shadow he seem like some devil of the hill awaken by magic from he ancient grave but i see it be time for I to be speak up i be neither gangrel nor spy nor amalekite nor yet be i zebedee linklater my name be andrew garvald and i have to-day left my home to make my way to edinburgh college i try a short road in the mist and here i be nay but what seek ye cry muckle john the lord have lead ye to we company by he own good way what seek ye i say again and yea a third time i go to finish my colleging i say he laugh a harsh croak laugh little ye ken young man we travel to watch the surprising judgment which be about to overtake the wicked city of edinburgh a angel have reveal it to I in a dream fire and brimstone will descend upon it as on sodom and gomorrah and it will be consume and wither away with its cruel ahab and its paint jezebel its subtle doeg and its lie balaam its priest and its judge and its proud man of blood its bible-idolater and its false prophet its purple and damask its gold and its fine linen and it shall be as tyre and sidon so that none shall know the site thereof but we who follow the lord and have cleanse he word from human abomination shall leap as he-goat upon the mountain and enter upon the heritage of the righteous from beth-peor even unto the crossing of jordan in reply to this rigmarole i ask for food since my head be begin to swim from my long fast this to my terror put he into a great rage ye be carnally mind like the rest of they ye will get no fleshly provender here but if ye be not besot in you sin ye shall drink of the water of life that floweth freely and eat of the honey and manna of forgiveness and then he appear to forget my very existence he fall into a sort of trance with he eye fix on vacancy there be a dead hush in the place nothing but the crackle of the fire and the steady drip of the rain i endure it as well as i might for though my leg be sorely cramped i do not dare to move a inch after nigh half a hour he seem to awake peace be with you he say to he follower it be the hour for sleep and prayer i john gib will wrestle all night for you sake as jacob strove with the angel with that he enter the tent no one speak to I but the ragged company seek each they sleeping-place a woman with a kindly face jog I on the elbow and from the neuk of she plaid give I a bit of oatcake and a piece of roasted moorfowl this make my supper with a long drink from a neighbouring burn none hinder my movement so like little the smell of wet uncleanly garment which cling around the fire i make my bed in a heather bush in the lee of a boulder and from utter weariness fall presently asleep chapter ii of a high-handed lady the storm die away in the night and i awake to a clear rain-washed world and the chill of a autumn morn i be as stiff and sore as if i have be whip my clothes be sodden and heavy and not till i have wash my face and hand in the burn and stretch my leg up the hill-side do i feel restore to something of my ordinary briskness the encampment look weird indeed as see in the cruel light of day the woman be cooking oatmeal on iron girdle but the fire burn smokily and the cake i get be no better than dough they be a disjaskit lot with tousled hair and pinch face in which shone hungry eye most be barefoot and all but two -- three be ancient beldam who should have be at home in the chimney corner i notice one decent-looking young woman who have the air of a farm servant and two be well-fed country wife who have probably leave a brood of child to mourn they the man be little better one have the sallow look of a weaver another be a hind with a big foolish face and there be a slip of a lad who might once have be a student of divinity but each have a daftness in the eye and something weak and unwholesome in the visage so that they be a offence to the fresh gusty moorland all but muckle john himself he come out of he tent and pray till the hill-side echo it be a tangle of bedlamite ravings with long screed from the scripture intermix like currant in a bag-pudding but there be power in the creature in the strange lift of he voice in he grim jowl and in the fire of he sombre eye the other i pitied but he i hate and fear on he and he kind be to be blame all the madness of the land which have send my father overseas and desolate we dwelling so long as crazy prophet preach brimstone and fire so long would rough-shoe soldier and cunning lawyer profit by they folly and often i prayed in those day that the two evil might devour each other it be time that i be cut loose from this ill-omened company and continue my road edinburgh-ward we be lie in a wide trough of the pentland hill which i well remember the folk of the plain call it the cauldstaneslap and it make a easy path for sheep and cattle between the lothian and tweeddale the camp have be snugly choose for except by the gleam of a fire in the dark it be invisible from any distance muckle john be so fill with he vapouring that i could readily slip off down the burn and join the southern highway at the village of linton i be on the verge of go when i see that which pull I up a rider be come over the moor the horse leap the burn lightly and before i could gather my wit be in the midst of the camp where muckle john be vociferate to heaven my heart give a great bind for i see it be the girl who have sing to I in the rain she ride a fine sorrel with the easy seat of a skilled horsewoman she be trimly clothe in a green riding-coat and over the lace collar of it she hair fall in dark clustering curl she face be grave like a determine child 's but the wind of the morning have whip it to a rosy color so that into that clan of tatterdemalion she ride like proserpine descend among the gloomy shades in she hand she carry a light riding-whip a scream from the woman bring muckle john out of he rhapsody he stare blankly at the slim girl who confront he with hand on hip what seekest thou here thou shameless woman he roar i be come say she for my tirewoman janet somerville who leave I three day back without a reason word be bring I that she have join a mad company call the sweet-singer that lay at the cauldstaneslap

more decent-like than the rest at the sight of the girl the woman bob a curtsy come out of it silly janet say she on the horse you 'll never make a sweet-singer for there be not a notion of a tune in you head it be not singing that i seek my leddy say the woman blush i follow the call o ' the lord by the mouth o ' he servant john gib you 'll follow the call of you mother by the mouth of I elspeth blair forget these haver janet and come back like a good christian soul mount and be quick there be room behind I on bess the word be speak in a kindly wheedling tone and the girl 's face break into the prettiest of smile perhaps janet would have obey but muckle john swift to prevent defection take up the parable begone ye daughter of heth he bellow ye that be like the devil that pluck soul from the way of salvation begone or it be strongly bear in upon I that ye will dree the fate of the woman of midian of whom it be write that they be slaughter and spare not the girl do not look he way she

catch the sorrel 's bridle and swing it round the girl do not move but look he square in the face the young eye front he demoniac glower then very swiftly she arm rise and she lay the lash of she whip roundly over he shoulder the man snarl like a beast leap back and pluck from he seaman 's belt a great horse-pistol i hear the click of it cock and the next i know it be level at the girl 's breast the sight of she and the music of she voice have so enthralled I that i have make no plan as to my own conduct but this sudden peril put fire into my heel and in a second i be at he side i have bring from home a stout shepherd 's staff with which i strike the muzzle upward the pistol go off in a great stench of powder but the bullet wander to the cloud muckle john let the thing fall into the moss and pluck another weapon from he belt this be a ugly knife such as a cobbler use for pare hide i know the seaman 's trick of throw have see they brawl at the pier of leith and i have no notion for the steel in my throat the man be far beyond I in size and strength so i dare not close with he instead i give he the point of my staff with all my power straight in the midriff the knife slither harmlessly over my shoulder and he fall backwards into the heather there be no time to be lose for the whole clan come round I like a flock of daw one of the man the slim lad have a pistol but i see by the way he handle it that it be unprimed i be most afraid of the woman who with they long claw would have scratch my eye out and i know they would not spare the girl to she i turn anxiously and to my amazement she be laugh she recognize I for she cry out be this the way to kirknewton sir and all the time she shake with merriment in that hour i think she as daft as the sweet-singer whose nail be uncommonly near my cheek i get she bridle tumble over the countryman with a kick and force she to the edge of the sheepfold but she wheel round again cry i must have janet and face the crowd with she whip that be well enough but i see muckle john stagger to he foot and i fear desperately for he next move the girl be either mad or extraordinarily brave get back you pitiful knave she cry lay a hand on I and i will cut you to ribbon make haste janet and quit this folly it be gallant talk but there be no sense in it muckle john be on he foot half the clan have go round to we rear and in a second or two she would have be tear from the saddle a headstrong girl be beyond my management and my word of entreaty be lose in the babel of cry but just then there come another sound from the four quarter of the moor there close in upon we horsemen they come silently and be about we before i have a hint of they presence it be a troop of dragoon in the king 's buff and scarlet and they ride we down as if we have be hare in a field the next i know of it i be sprawl on the ground with a dizzy head and horse trample around I i have a glimpse of muckle john with a pistol at he nose and the sorrel curveting and plunge in a panic then i bethought myself of save my bone and crawl out of the mellay behind the sheepfold presently i realize that this be the salvation i have be seek gib be be pinion and two of the rider be speak with the girl the woman hang together like hen in a storm while the dragoon lay about they with the flat of they sword there be one poor creature come run my way and after she follow on foot a long fellow who make clutch at she hair he catch she with ease and proceed to bind she hand with great brutality ye beldame he say with many oath i 'll pare you talon for ye now i who a minute before have be in danger from this very crew be smite with a sudden compunction except for muckle john they be so pitifully feeble a pack of humble elderly folk wear out with fasting and march and ill weather i have be sicken by they crazy devotions but i be more sicken by this man 's barbarity it be the woman too who have give I food the night before so i step out and bid the man release she he be a huge sunburned ruffian and for answer aim a clour at my head take that my mannie he say i 'll learn ye to follow the petticoat he scorn put I into a fury in which anger at he brutishness and the presence of the girl on the sorrel move my pride to a piece of naked folly i fly at he throat and since i have stand on a little eminence the force of my assault topple he over my victory last scarcely a minute he fling I from he like a feather then pick I up and lay on to I with the flat of he sword ye thrawn jackanapes he cry as he beat I ye 'll pay dear for play you prank wus ' john donald i be a child in he mighty grasp besides have no breath leave in I to resist he tie my hand and leg hale I to he horse and fling I sack-like over the crupper there be no more shamefaced lad in the world than I at that moment for come out of the din i hear a girl 's light laughter chapter iii the canongate tolbooth never daunton youth be i remember a say of my grandmother 's but it be the most dauntoned youth in scotland that now jog over the moor to the edinburgh highroad i have a swimming head and a hard crupper to grate my rib at every movement and my captor would shift I about with as little gentleness as if i have be a bag of oats for he horse 's feed but it be the ignominy of the business that keep I on the brink of tear first i be believe to be one of the maniac company of the sweet-singer whom my soul abhor _ item _ i have be worst by a trooper with shameful ease so that my manhood cry out against I lastly i have cut the sorriest figure in the eye of that proud girl for a moment i have be bold and fancied myself she savior but all i have get by it be she mocking laughter they take we down from the hill to the highroad a little north of linton village where i be dump on the ground my leg untie and my hand strap to a stirrup leather the woman be give a country cart to ride in and the man include muckle john have to run each by a trooper 's leg the girl on the sorrel have go and so have the maid janet for i could not see she among the dishevelled wretch in the cart the thought of that girl fill I with bitter animosity she must have know that i be none of gib 's company for have i not risk my life at the muzzle of he pistol i have take she part as bravely as i know how but she have leave I to be drag to edinburgh without a word woman have never come much my way but i have a boy 's distrust of the sex and as i plod along the highroad with every now and then a cuff from a trooper 's fist to cheer I i have hard thought of they heartlessness we be a pitiful company as in the bright autumn sun we come in by the village of liberton to where the reek of edinburgh rise straight into the windless weather the woman in the cart keep up a continual lamenting and muckle john who walk between two dragoon with he hand tie to the saddle of each so that he look like a crucified malefactor polluted the air with hideous profanity he curse everything in nature and beyond it and no amount of clout on the head would stem the torrent sometimes he would fall to howl like a wolf and folk run to they cottage door to see the portent group of child follow we from every wayside clachan so that we give great entertainment to the dweller in lothian that day the thing infuriate the dragoon for it make they a laughing-stock and the sin of gib be visit upon the more silent prisoner we be hurry along at a cruel pace so that i have often to run to avoid the drag at my wrist and behind we bump the cart full of wailful woman i be sick from fatigue and lack of food and the south port of edinburgh be a welcome sight to I welcome and yet shameful for i fear at any moment to see the face of a companion in the jeer crowd that line the causeway i think miserably of my pleasant lodgings in the bow where my landlady mistress macvittie would be look at the box the lanark carrier have bring and be wonder what have become of they master i see no light for myself in the business my father 's ill-repute with the government would tell heavily in my disfavor and it be beyond doubt that i have assault a dragoon there be nothing before I but the plantation or a long spell in some noisome prison the woman be send to the house of correction to be whip and dismiss for there be little against they but foolishness all except one a virago call isobel bone who be herd with the man the canongate tolbooth be we portion the darkest and foulest of the city prison and presently i find myself force through a gateway and up a narrow staircase into a little chamber in which a score of being be already pen a small unglazed window with iron bar high up on one wall give we such light and air as be go but the place reek with human breathing and smell as rank as a kennel i have a delicate nose and i could not but believe on my entrance that a hour of such a hole would be the death of I soon the darkness come and we be give a tallow dip in a horn lantern hang on a nail to light we to food such food i have never dream of there be a big iron basin of some kind of broth make as i judge from offal from which we drink in pannikin and with it be hunk of mildewed rye-bread one mouthful sicken I and i prefer to fast the behavior of the other prisoner be most seemly but not so that of my company they scramble for the stuff like pig round a trough and the woman isobel threaten with she nail any one who would prevent she i be black ashamed to enter prison with such a crew and withdraw myself as far distant as the chamber allow I i have no better task than to look round I at those who have tenant the place before we come there be three woman decent-looking body who talk low in whisper and knit the man be mostly countryfolk cull as i could tell by they speech from the west country whose only fault no doubt be that they have attend some field-preaching one old man a minister by he dress sit apart on a stone bench and with closed eye commune with himself i venture to address he for in that horrid place he have a welcome air of sobriety and sense he ask I for my story and when he hear it look curiously at muckle john who be now recite gibberish in a corner so that be the man gib he say musingly i have hear tell of he for he be a thorn in the flesh of bless mr cargill often have i hear he repeat how he go to gib in the moor to reason with he in the lord 's name and get nothing but a mouthful of devilish blasphemy he be without doubt a child of belial as much as any proud persecutor woe be the kirk when she foe shall be of she own household for it be with the word of the gospel that he seek to overthrow the gospel work and how be it with you my son do you seek to add you testimony to the sweet savor which now ascend from moor moss peat-bog close kennel prison dungeon ay and scaffold in this distressed land of scotland you have not tell I you name when he hear it he ask for my father whom he have know in old day at edinburgh college then he inquire into my religious condition with so much fatherly consideration that i could take no offence but tell he honestly that i be little of a partisan finding it hard enough to keep my own foot from temptation without judge other i be weary i say of all covenant and resolution and excommunication and the constraining of man 's conscience either by government or sectary some day and i pray that it may be soon both side will be dead of they wound and there will arise in scotland man who will preach peace and tolerance and heal the grievously irritated sore of this land he sigh as he hear I i fear you be still far from grace lad he say you be shape for a laodicean of whom there be many in these latter time i do not know it may be that god will that the laodicean have they day for the fire of we noble covenant have flame too smokily yet those fire die not and sometime they will kindle up purify and strengthen and will burn the trash and stubble and warm god 's feckless people he be so old and gentle that i have no heart for disputation and could only beseech he blessing this he give I and turn once more to he devotions i be very weary my head be splitting with the foul air of the place and i would fain have get I to sleep some dirty straw have be lay round the wall of the room for the prisoner to lie on and i find a neuk close by the minister 's side but sleep be impossible for muckle john get another fit of cursing he stand up by the door with he eye blaze like a wild-cat 's and deliver what he call he testimony he voice have be use to shout order on shipboard and not one of we could stop he ear against it never have i hear such a medley of profane nonsense he curse the man charle stuart and every councillor by name he curse the persecutor from he highness of york down to one welch of borrowstoneness who have be the means of he first imprisonment he curse the indulge and tolerate minister and he curse every man of the hill-folk whose name he could remember he testify against all due and cess against all custom and excise tax and burden against beer and ale and wine and tobacco against mumming and peep-show and dancing and every sort of play against christmas and easter and pentecost and hogmanay then most nobly do he embark on theology he make short work of hell and shorter work of heaven he rave against idolater of the kirk and of the bible and against all preacher who by he way of it have pervert the word as he go on i begin to fancy that muckle john 's true place be with the mussulman for he leave not a stick of christianity behind he such blasphemy on the open hill-side have be shocking enough but in that narrow room it be too horrid to be bear the minister stick he finger in he ear and advance to the maniac bid he be silent before god should blast he but what could he thin old voice do against gib 's bellow the mariner go on undisturbed and give the old man a blow with he foot which send he stagger to the floor the thing have become too much for my temper i cry on the other man to help I but none stir for gib seem to cast a unholy spell on ordinary folk but my anger and discomfort banish all fear and i rush at the prophet in a whirlwind he have no eye for my come till my head take he fairly in the middle and drive the breath out of he chest that quiet he noise and he turn on I with something like wholesome human wrath in he face now i be no match for this great be with my ungrown strength but the lesson of my encounter with the dragoon be burn on my mind and i be determine to keep out of grip with he i be light on my foot and in we country bout have often worst a heavier antagonist by my quickness in movement so when muckle john leap to grab I i dart under he arm and he stagger half-way across the room the woman scuttle into a corner all but the besom isobel who make clutch at my coat cry the sword of the lord and of gideon gib make a great lunge at I with he fist but the sword of gideon miss its aim and skin its knuckle on the stone wall i saw now to my great comfort that the man be beside himself with fury and be swing he arm wildly like a flail three or four time i avoid he rush note with satisfaction that one of the countryman have get hold of the shriek isobel then my chance come for as he lunge i strike from the side with all my force on he jaw i be left-handed and the blow be unlock for he stagger back a step and i deftly trip he up so that he fall with a crash on the hard floor in a second i be on the top of he shout to the other to lend I a hand this they do at last and so maze be he with the fall be a mighty heavy man that he scarcely resist if you want a quiet night i cry we must silence this mountebank with three leathern belt one my own and two borrow we make fast he foot and arm i stuff a kerchief into he mouth and bind he jaw with another but not so tight as to hinder he breathing then we roll he into a corner where he lay peacefully make the sound of a milch cow chew she cud i return to my quarter by the minister 's side and presently from utter weariness fall into a uneasy sleep \* \* \* \* \* i wake in the morning greatly refresh for all the closeness of the air and the memory of the night 's event return be much concern as to the future i could not be fight with muckle john all the time and i make no doubt that once he limb be free he would try to kill I the other be still asleep while i tiptoe over to he corner at first sight i get a fearsome shock for i think he be dead of suffocation he have work the gag out of he mouth and lay as still as a corpse but soon i see that he be sleep quietly and in he slumber the madness have die out of he face he look like any other sailorman a trifle ill-favoured of countenance and dirty beyond the ordinary of sea-folk when the gaoler come with food we all waken up and gib ask very peaceably to be release the gaoler laugh at he predicament and inquire the tale of it and when he hear the truth call for a vote as to what he should do i be satisfy from the look of muckle john that he dangerous fit be over so i give my voice for release gib shake himself like a great dog and fall to he breakfast without a word i find the thin brose provide more palatable than the soup of the evening before and manage to consume a pannikin of it as i finish i perceive that gib have squat by my side there be clearly some change in the man for he give the woman isobel some very ill word when she start rant up in the little square of window one could see a patch of clear sky with white cloud cross it and a gust of the clean air of morning be blow into we cell gib sit look at it with he eye abstract so that i fear a renewal of he daftness can ye whistle ` jenny nettle ' sir he ask I civilly it be surely a queer request in that place and from such a fellow but i comply and to the best of my skill render the air he listen greedily ay you have get it he say hum it after I i aye love the way of it yon be the tune i use to whistle mysel ' on shipboard when the weather be clear he have the seaman 's trick of thinking of the weather first thing in the morning and this little thing work a change in my view of he he madness be seemingly like that of a epileptic and when it pass he be a simple creature with a longing for familiar thing the wind 's to the east he say i could wish i be beat down the forth in the _ loupin ' jean _ she be a trim bit boat for he that could handle she man i say what make you leave a clean job for the ravings of yesterday i be in the lord 's hand he say humbly i be but a penny whistle for he breath to blow on this he say with such solemnity that the meaning of a fanatic be suddenly reveal to I one or two distorted notion a wild imagination and fierce passion and there you have the ingredient ready but moment of sense must come when the better nature of the man revive i have a thought that the clout he get on the stone floor have do much to clear he wit what will they do wus ' I think ye he ask this be the second time i have fall into the hand o ' the amalekite and it be no likely they 'll let I off sae lightly what will they do with we all say i the plantation maybe or the bass it be a bonny creel you have land I in for i be as innocent as a newborn babe the notion of the plantation seem to comfort he i have be there afore once in the brig _ john rolfe _ o ' greenock and once in the _ luckpenny _ o ' leith it be a het land but a bonny and full o ' all manner o ' fruit you can see tobacco growin ' like ait and mair big tree in one plantin ' than in all the shire o ' lothian besides -- but i get no more of muckle john 's travels for the door open on that instant and the gaoler appear he look at we head then single I out and cry on I to follow come on you he say ye be wantit in the captain 's room i follow in bewilderment for i know something of the law 's delay and i could not believe that my hour of trial have come already the man take I down the turret stair and through a long passage to a door where stand two halberdier through this he thrust I and i find myself in a handsome panelled apartment with the city arm carve above the chimney a window stand open and i breathe the sweet fresh air with delight but i catch a reflection of myself in the polish steel of the fireplace and my spirit fall for a more woebegone ruffian my eye have never see i be as dirty as a collier my coat be half off my back from my handle on the moor and there be long rent at the knee of my breeches another door open and two person enter one be a dapper little man with a great wig very handsomely dress in a plum-coloured silken coat with a snowy cravat at he neck at the sight of the other my face crimson for it be the girl who have sing montrose 's song in the rain the little gentleman look at I severely and then turn to he companion be this the fellow elspeth he inquire he look a sorry rascal the minx pretend to examine I carefully she color be high with the fresh morning and she keep tap she boot with she whip handle why yes uncle gregory she say it be the very man though none the better for you night 's attention and you say he have no part in gib 's company but interfere on you behalf when the madman threaten you such be he impertinence she say as if i be not a match for a dozen crazy hill-folk but doubtless the lad mean well it be also record against he that he assault one of he majesty 's servant to wit the trooper john donald and offer to hinder he in the prosecution of he duty la uncle cry the girl who be to distinguish friend from foe in a mellay have you never see a dog in a fight bite the hand of one who would succor he maybe maybe say the gentleman you illustration elspeth would do credit to he majesty 's advocate you plea be that this young man whose name i do not know and do not seek to hear should be free or justice will miscarry god know the law have enough to do without clog its wheel with innocence the girl nod she wicked laughing eye roam about the apartment with little regard for my flush face then the crown assoilzy the panel and desert the diet say the little gentleman speak sir and thank he majesty for he clemency and this lady for she intercession i have no word for if i have be sore at my imprisonment i be black angry at this manner of release i do not reflect that miss elspeth blair must have rise early and ridden far to be in the canongate at this hour 'twa justice only that move she i think and no gratitude or kindness to she i be something so lowly that she need not take the pain to be civil but must speak of I in my presence as if it be a question of a stray hound my first impulse be to refuse to stir but happily my good sense return in time and preserve I from play the fool i thank you sir i say gruffly -- and the lady do i understand that i be free to go through the door down the left stairway and you will be in the street say the gentleman i make some sort of bow and move to the door farewell mr whiggamore the girl cry keep a cheerful countenance or they 'll think you a sweet-singer you breeches will mend man and with she laughter most unpleasantly in my ear i make my way into the canongate and so to my lodgings at mr macvittie 's \* \* \* \* \* three week later i hear that muckle john be destine for the plantation in a ship of mr barclay of urie 's which trade to new jersey i have a fancy to see he before he go and after much trouble i be suffer to visit he he gaoler tell I he have be mighty wild during he examination before the council and have have frequent bout of madness since but for the moment he be peaceable i find he in a little cell by himself outside the common room of the gaol he be sit in a attitude of great dejection and when i enter could scarcely recall I to he memory i remember think that what with he high cheek-bone and lank black hair and brooding eye and great muscular frame scotland could scarcely have furnish a wilder figure for the admiration of the carolina or wherever he go to i do not envy he future master but with I he be very friendly and quiet he ailment be home-sickness for though he have be a great voyager it seem he be loath to quit we bleak countryside for ever i use aye to think o ' the first sight o ' inchkeith and the lomond hill and the smell o ' herring at the pier o ' leith what say the word ' _ weep not for the dead neither bemoan he but weep sore for he that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see he native country _ ' i ask he if i could do he any service there be a woman at cramond he begin timidly she might like to ken what have become o ' I would ye carry a message i do better for at gib 's dictation i compose for she a letter since he could not write i write it on some blank page from my pocket which i use for college note it be surely the queerest love-letter ever indite for the most part of it be theology and the rest be instruction for the dispose of he scanty plenishing i have forget now what i write but i remember that the woman 's name be alison steel chapter iv of a stairhead and a sea-captain with the escapade that land I in the tolbooth there come a end to the nightmare year of my first youth a week later i get word that my father be dead of a ague in the low country and i have to be off post-haste to auchencairn to see to the order of we little estate we be destine to be bitter poor what with due and regality incident on the passing of the ownership and i think it best to leave my mother to farm it with the help of robin gilfillan the grieve and seek employment which would bring I a honest penny she one brother andrew sempill from whom i be name be a merchant in glasgow the owner of three ship that trade to the western sea and by repute a man of a shrewd and venturesome temper he be single too and i might reasonably look to be he heir so when a letter come from he offer I a hand in he business my mother be instant for my go i be little loath myself for i see nothing now to draw I to the profession of the law which have be my first notion hame 's hame run the proverb as the devil say when he find himself in the court of session and i have lose any desire for that sinister company besides i like the notion of have to do with ship and far land for i be at the age when youth burn fiercely in a lad and he fancy be as riotous as a poet 's yet the event i have just relate have work a change in my life they have drive the unthinking child out of I and force I to reflect on my future two thing rankle in my soul -- a wench 's mock laughter and the treatment i have get from the dragoon it be not that i be in love with the black-haired girl indeed i think i hate she but i could not get she face out of my head or she voice out of my ear she have mock I treated I as if i be no more than a foolish servant and my vanity be raw i long to beat down she pride to make she creep humbly to I andrew garvald as she only deliverer and how that should be compass be the subject of many hot fantasy in my brain the dragoon too have toss I about like a silly sheep and my manhood cry out at the recollection what sort of man be i if any lubberly soldier could venture on such liberty i go into the business with the monstrous solemnity of youth and take stock of my equipment as if i be cast up a account many a time in those day i study my appearance in the glass like a foolish maid i be not well feature have a freckled square face a biggish head a blunt nose gray colourless eye and a sandy thatch of hair i have great square shoulder but my arm be too short for my stature and -- from a accident in my nursing day -- of indifferent strength all this stand on the debit side of my account on the credit side i set down that i have unshaken good health and a uncommon power of endurance especially in the leg there be no runner in the upper ward of lanark who be my match and i have travel the hill so constantly in all weather that i have acquire a gipsy lore in the matter of beast and bird and wild thing i have long clear unerring eyesight which have often stand I in good stead in the time of my father 's trouble of moral quality heaven forgive I i fear i think less but i believe though i have be little prove that i be as courageous as the common run of man all this look babyish in the writing but there be a method in this self-examination i believe that i be fate to engage in strange venture and i want to equip myself for the future the press business be that of self-defence and i turn first to a gentleman 's proper weapon the sword here alas i be doom to a bitter disappointment my father have give I a lesson now and then but never enough to test I and when i come into the hand of a glasgow master my unfitness be soon manifest neither with broadsword nor small sword could i acquire any skill my short arm lack reach and vigor and there seem to be some stiffness in wrist and elbow and shoulder which compel I to yield to smaller man here be a pretty business for though gentleman bear i be as loutish with a gentleman 's weapon as any country hind this discovery give I some melancholy week but i pluck up heart and set to reasoning if my hand be to guard my head it must find some other way of it my thought turn to powder and shot to the musket and the pistol here be a weapon which need only a stout nerve a good eye and a steady hand one of these i possess to the full and the other be not beyond my attainment there live a armourer in the gallowgate one weir with whom i begin to spend my leisure there be a alley by the molendinar burn close to the archery butt where he would let I practice at a mark with gun from he store soon to my delight i find that here be a weapon with which i need fear few rival i have a natural genius for the thing as some man have for sword-play and weir be a zealous teacher for he love he flint-lock see andrew he would cry this be the true leveller of mankind it will make the man he master 's equal for though you gentleman may cock on a horse and wave he andrew ferrara this will bring he off it brain my lad will tell in come day for it take a head to shoot well though any flesher may swing a sword the better marksman i grow the less i like the common make of gun and i cast about to work a improvement i be especially fond of the short gun or pistol not the bell-mouthed thing which shoot a handful of slug and be as little precise in its aim as a hailstorm but the light foreign pistol which shoot as true as a musket weir have learn he trade in italy and be a neat craftsman so i employ he to make I a pistol after my own pattern the butt be of light tough wood and brass-bound for i do not care to waste money on ornament the barrel be shorter than the usual and of the best spanish metal and the pan and the lock be set after my own device nor be that all for i become a epicure in the matter of bullet and make my own with the care of a goldsmith i would weigh out the powder charge as nicely as a apothecary weigh he drug for i have discover that with the pistol the weight of bullet and charge mean much for good marksmanship from weir i get the notion of put up ball and powder in cartouch and i devise a method of priming much quicker and surer than the ordinary in one way and another i believe i acquire more skill in the business than anybody then live in scotland i cherish my toy like a lover i christen it elspeth it lay by my bed at night and live by day in a box of sweet-scented foreign wood give I by one of my uncle 's skipper i doubt i think more of it than of my duty to my maker all the time i be very busy at uncle andrew 's counting-house in the candlerigg and down by the river-side among the sailor it be the day when glasgow be rise from a cluster of street round the high kirk and college to be the chief merchant ' resort in scotland standing near the western sea she turn she eye naturally to the america and a great trade be begin in tobacco and raw silk from virginium rich wood and dye stuff from the main and rice and fruit from the summer island the river be too shallow for ship of heavy burthen so it be the custom to unload in the neighborhood of greenock and bring the goods upstream in barge to the quay at the broomielaw there my uncle in company with other merchant have he warehouse but he counting-house be up in the town near by the college and i spend my time equally between the two place i become furiously interested in the work for it have ever be my happy fortune to be intent on whatever i might be do at the moment i think i serve my uncle well for i have much of the merchant 's aptitude and the eye to discern far-away profit he like my boldness for i be impatient of the rule-of-thumb way of some of we fellow-trader we be deal with new land i would say and there be need of new plan it pay to think in trading as much as in statecraft there be plenty that look askance at we and curse we as troubler of the peace and there be some who prophesy speedy ruin but we discomfort we neighbor by prosper mightily so that there be talk of uncle andrew for the provost 's chair at the next vacancy they be happy year the four i spend in glasgow for i be young and ardent and have not yet suffer the grave miscarriage of hope which be we human lot my uncle be a busy merchant but he be also something of a scholar and be never happier than when dispute some learn point with a college professor over a bowl of punch he be a great fisherman too and many a salmon i have see he kill between the town and rutherglen in the autumn afternoon he treat I like a son and by he aid i complete my education by much reading of book and a frequent attendance at college lecture such leisure as i have i spend by the river-side talk with the ship captain and get news of far land in this way i learn something of the handling of a ship and especially how to sail a sloop alone in rough weather i have venture myself the only crew far down the river to the beginning of the sealock and more than once escape drown by a miracle of a Saturday i would sometimes ride out to auchencairn to see my mother and assist with my advice the work of robin gilfillan once i remember i ride to carnwath and look again on the bleak house where the girl elspeth have sing to I in the rain i find it lock and desert and hear from a countrywoman that the folk have go and a guid riddance say the woman the blair be aye a cauld and oppressive race and they be black prelatist forbye but i while miss yon hellicat lassie she have a cheery word for a ` body and she keepit the place fra languor but i can not linger over the tale of those peaceful year when i have so much that be strange and stir to set down presently come the revolution when king jame flee overseas and the dutch king william reign in he stead the event be a godsend to we trade for with scotland in a bicker with covenant and dragooning and new tax threaten with each new parliament a merchant 's credit be apt to be a brittle thing the change bring a measure of security and as we prosper i soon begin to see that something must be do in we virginian trade year before my uncle have send out a man lambie by name who watch he interest in that country but we have to face such fierce rivalry from the bristol merchant that i have small confidence in mr lambie who from he letter be a sleepy soul i broach the matter to my uncle and offer to go myself and put thing in order at first he be unwilling to listen i think he be sorry to part with I for we have become close friend and there be also the difficulty of my mother to whom i be the natural protector but he opposition die down when i win my mother to my side and when i promise that i would duly return i point out that glasgow and virginium be not so far apart planter from the colony would dwell with we for a season and they son often come to glasgow for they schooling you could see the proud fellow walk the street in brave clothes and march into the kirk on sabbath with a couple of servant carry cushion and bible in the better class of tavern one could always meet with a virginian or two compound they curious drink and swearing they outlandish oath most of they have go afield from scotland and it be a fine incentive to we young man to see how mightily they have prosper my uncle yield and it be arrange that i should sail with the first convoy of the new year from the moment of the decision i walk the earth in a delirium of expectation that February i remember be blue and mild with soft air blow up the river down by the broomielaw i find a new rapture in the smell of tar and cordage and the queer foreign scent in my uncle 's warehouse every skipper and greasy sailor become for I a figure of romance i scan every outland face wonder if i should meet it again in the new world a negro in cotton drawer shiver in we northern dune have more attraction for I than the fairest maid and i be eager to speak with all and every one who have cross the ocean one bronzed mariner with silver earring i entertain to three stoup of usquebaugh hope for strange tale but the little i have from he before he grow drunk be that he have once voyage to the canary you may imagine that i keep my fancy to myself and be outwardly only the sober merchant with a mind set on freight and hogshead but whoever remember he youth will know that such term to I be not the common parlance of trade the very name of the tobacco negro 's head sweet-scented oronoke carolina red gloucester glory golden rod sing in my head like a tune that tell of green forest and magic island but a incident befall ere i leave which be to have unforeseen effect on my future one afternoon i be in the shooting alley i have speak of make trial of a new size of bullet i have mould the place be just behind parlane 's tavern and some gentleman who have be drink there come out to cool they head and see the sport most of they be cock-laird from the lennox and after the highland fashion have in they belt heavy pistol of the old kind which folk call dag they be cumbrous ill-made thing gaudily ornament with silver and damascus work fit ornament for a savage highland chief but little good for serious business unless a man be only a pace or two from he opponent one of they who have drunk less than the other come up to I and very civilly propose a match i be nothing loath so a course be fix and a mutchkin of french _ eau de vie _ name as the prize i borrow a old hat from the landlord which have stick in its side a small red cockade the thing be hang as a target in a leafless cherry tree at twenty pace and the cockade be to be the center mark each man be to fire three shot apiece barshalloch -- for so he companion call my opponent after he lairdship -- make a great to-do about the loading and would not be content till he have draw the charge two -- three time the spin of a coin give he first shoot and he miss the mark and cut the bole of the tree see i say i will put my ball within a finger 's - breadth of he sure enough when they look the two bullet be all but in the same hole he second shot take the hat low down on its right side and clip away a bit of the brim i saw by this time that the man could shoot though he have a poor weapon and understand little about it so i tell the company that i would trim the hat by slice a bit from the other side this i achieve though by little for my shot remove only half as much cloth as its predecessor but the performance amaze the onlooker ye have find a fair provost at the job barshalloch one of they hiccup better quit and pay for the mutchkin my antagonist take every care with he last shot and just miss the cockade hit the hat about the middle cut the branch on which it rest and bring it flutter to the ground a pace or two farther on it lay there dimly see through a low branch of the cherry tree with the cockade on the side nearest I it be a difficult mark but the light be good and my hand steady i walk forward and bring back the hat with a hole drill clean through the cockade at that there be a great laughter and much jocosity from the cock-laird at they friend 's expense barshalloch very handsomely compliment I and send for the mutchkin he word make I warm towards he and i tell he that half the business be not my skill of shooting but the weapon i carry he beg for a look at it and examine it long and carefully will ye sell friend he ask i 'll give ye ten golden guinea and the best filly that ever come out o ' strathendrick for that pistol but i tell he that the offer of strathendrick itself would not buy it no say he well i will not say ye be wrong a man should cherish he weapon like he wife for it carry he honor presently have drunk the wager they go indoors again all but a tall fellow who have be a looker-on but have not be of the lennox company i have remark he during the contest a long lean man with a bright humorous blue eye and a fiery red head he be maybe ten year older than I and though he be finely dress in town clothes there be about he whole appearance a smack of the sea he come forward and in a very highland voice ask my name why should i tell you i say a little nettled just that i might carry it in my head i have see some pretty shooting in my day but none like yours young one what be you trade that ye have learn the pistol game so cleverly now i be flush with pride and in no mood for a stranger 's patronage so i tell he roundly that it be none of he business and push by he to parlane 's back-door but my brusqueness give no offence to this odd be he only laugh and cry after I that if my manners be the equal of my marksmanship i would be the best lad he have see since he home-coming i have dinner with my uncle in the candlerigg and sit with he late afterwards cast up account so it be not till nine o'clock that i set out on my way to my lodgings these be in the saltmarket close on the river front and to reach they i go by the short road through the friar 's vennel it be a ill-reputed quarter of the town and not long before have be note as a haunt of coiner but i have go through it often and meet with no hindrance in the vennel stand a tall dark bit of masonry call gilmor 's lordship which be pierce by long close from which twist stairway lead to the upper landing i be note its gloomy aspect under the dim February moon when a man come towards I and turn into one of the close he swing along with a free careless gait that mark he as no townsman and ere he plunge into the darkness i have a glimpse of fiery hair it be the stranger who have accost I in parlane 's alley and he be either drunk or in wild spirit for he be singing : -- we be a ' dry wus ' the drinkin ' o ' t we be a ' dry wus ' the drinkin ' o ' t the minister kiss the fiddler 's wife and he couldna preach for thinkin ' o ' t the ribald chorus echo from the close mouth then i see that he be follow by three other bent slink fellow who slip across the patch of moonlight and eagerly scan the empty vennel they could not see I for i be in shadow and presently they too enter the close the thing look ugly and while i have no love for the red-haired man i do not wish to see murder or robbery committed and stand idly by the match of the afternoon have give I a fine notion of my prowess though have i reflect my pistol be in its case at home and i have no weapon but a hazel staff happily in youth the blood be quicker than the brain and without a thought i run into the close and up the long stairway the chorus be still be sing ahead of I and then it suddenly cease in dead silence and in pitchy darkness i struggle up the stone step wonder what i should find at the next turn the place be black as night the step be uneven and the stair corkscrew most wonderfully i wish with all my heart that i have not come as i groped upward hug the wall then a cry come and a noise of hard breathing at the same moment a door open somewhere above my head and a faint glow come down the stair presently with a great rumble a heavy man come roll past I but with he head at the stair-side he come to anchor on a landing below I and find he foot plunge downward as if the devil be at he heel he leave behind he a short highland knife which i pick up and put in my pocket on he heel come another with he hand clap to he side and he moan as he slither past I something drip from he on the stone step the light grow stronger and as i round the last turn a third come bound down stumble from wall to wall like a drunk man i see he face clearly and if ever mortal eye hold baffled murder it be that fellow 's there be a dark mark on he shoulder above I as i blink stand my red-haired friend on the top landing he have he sword draw and be whistle softly through he tooth while on the right

without another word he be off and as i commit the gibberish to memory i could hear he song go up the saltmarket : -- the minister kiss the fiddler 's wife and he couldna preach for thinkin ' o ' t chapter v my first come to virginium there be few moment in life to compare with a traveller 's first sight of a new land which be destine to be for short or long he home when after a fair and speedy voyage we pass point comfort and have rid ourselves of the revenue man and the tide bear we up the estuary of a noble river i stand on deck and drink in the heady foreign scent with a boyish ecstasy presently we have open the capital city which seem to I no more than a village set amid garden and mr lambie have come aboard and greet I he convey I to the best ordinary in the town which stand over against the court-house late in the afternoon just before the dark fall i walk out to drink my fill of the place you be to remember that i be a country lad who have never set foot forth of scotland i be very young and hot on the quest of new sight and doings as i walk down the unpaven street and through the narrow tobacco-grown lane the strange smell of it all intoxicate I like wine there be a great red sunset burning over the blue river and kindle the far forest till they glow like jewel the frog be croak among the reed and the wild duck squatter in the dusk i pass a indian the first i have see with cock 's feather on he head and a curiously tattoo chest move as light as a sleep-walker one or two townsfolk take the air smoking they long pipe and down by the water a negro girl be sing a wild melody the whole place be like a mad sweet-scented dream to one just come from the unfeatured ocean and with a memory only of grim scot city and dour scot hill i feel as if i have come into a large and generous land and i thank god that i be but twenty-three but as i be moon along there come a sudden interruption on my dream i be beyond the house in a path which run among tobacco-shed and little garden with the river lap a stone 's - throw off down a side alley i catch a glimpse of a figure that seem familiar 'twa that of a tall hulk man move quickly among the tobacco plant with something stealthy in he air the broad bow shoulder and the lean head bring back to I the rainy moorland about the cauldstaneslap and the mad fellow whose prison i have share muckle john have go to the plantation and 'twa muckle john or the devil that be move there in the half light i cry on he and run down the side alley but it seem that he do not want company for he break into a run now in those day i rejoice in the strength of my leg and i be determine not to be thus balk so i double after he into a maze of tobacco and melon bed but it seem he know how to run i catch a glimpse of he hairy leg round the corner of a shed and then lose he in a patch of cane then i come out on a sort of causeway floor with board which cover a marshy sluice and there i make great stride on he he be clear against the sky now and i could see that he be clothe only in shirt and cotton breeches while at he waist flap a ugly sheath-knife round the hut corner i run full into a man hold you cry the stranger and lay hand on my arm but i shake he off violently and continue the race the collision have crack my temper and i have a mind to give muckle john a lesson in civility for muckle john it be beyond doubt not two man in the broad earth have that ungainly bend of neck the next i know we be out on the river bank on a shore of hard clay which the tide have create here i see he more clearly and i begin to doubt i might be chase some river-side ruffian who would give I a knife in my belly for my pain the doubt slacken my pace and he gain on I then i see he intention there be a flat-bottomed wherry tie up by the bank and for this he make he fling off the rope seize a long pole and begin to push away the last ray of the westering sun fall on he face and my hesitation vanish for those pent-house brow and deep-set wild-cat eye be fix for ever in my memory i cry to he as i run but he never look my road somehow it be bear in on I that at all cost i must have speech with he the wherry be a yard or two from the shore when i jump for its stern i light firm on the wood and for a moment look muckle john in the face i see a countenance lean like a starve wolf with great weal as of old wound on cheek and brow but only for a second for as i balanced myself to step forward he ram the butt of the pole in my chest so that i staggered and fall plump in the river the water be only up to my middle but before i could clamber back he have ship he oar and be well into the center of the stream i stand stare like a zany while black anger fill my heart i plucked my pistol forth and for a second be on the verge of murder for i could have shoot he like a rabbit but god mercifully restrain my foolish passion and presently the boat and the rower vanish in the evening haze this be a bonny beginning think i as i wade through the mud to the shore i be wear my best clothes in honor of my arrival and they be all foul and plashing then on the bank above I i see the fellow who have run into I and hinder my catch muckle john on dry land he be shake with laughter i be silly and hot-headed in those day and my wetting have not dispose I to be laugh at in this fellow i see a confederate of gib 's and if i have lose one i have the other so i march up to he and very roundly damned he insolence he be a stern lantern-jawed man of forty or so dress very roughly in leather breeches and a frieze coat long gray woollen stocking be roll above he knee and sling on he back be a ancient musket easy my lad he say it be a free country and there be no statute against mirth i 'll have you before the sheriff i cry you trip I up when i be on the track of the biggest rogue in america so say he mock I you 'll be a good judge of rogue be it a runaway redemptioner maybe you would be look for the twenty hogshead reward this be more than i could stand i be carry a pistol in my hand and i stick it to he ear march my friend i say you 'll walk before I to a justice of the peace and explain you doings this night i have never threaten a man with a deadly weapon before and i be to learn a most unforgettable lesson a hand shoot out catch my wrist and force it upward in a grip of steel and when i would have use my right fist in he face another hand seize that and my arm be padlock cool ironical eye look into mine you be very free with you little gun my lad let I give you a word in season never hold a pistol to a man unless you mean to shoot if you eye waver you have better have a porridge stick he press my wrist back till my finger relax and he catch my pistol in he tooth with a quick movement of the head he drop it inside he shirt there be some would have kill you for that trick young sir he say it be try to the temper to have gunpowder so near a man 's brain but you be young and by you speech a new-comer so instead i 'll offer you a drink he drop my wrist and motion I to follow he very crestfallen and ashamed i walk in he wake to a little shanty almost on the wateredge the place be some kind of inn for a negro bring we two tankard of apple-jack and tobacco pipe and light a foul-smelling lantern which he set between we first say the man let I tell you that i never before clapped eye on the long piece of rascality you be seek he look like one that have cheat the gallows he be a man i know in scotland i say grumpily likely enough there be a heap of scot redemptioner hereaways i be out of scotland myself or my forbear be but my father be settle in the antrim glen there be wild devil among they and you friend look as if he have give the slip to the hound in the marsh there be little left of he breeches drink man or you 'll get fever from you wet dud i drink and the strong stuff mount to my unaccustomed brain my tongue be loosen my ill-temper mellow and i find myself tell this grim fellow much that be in my heart so you be a merchant he say it be not for I to call down a honest trade but we could be do with fewer merchant in these part they be so many leech that suck we blood be you here to make siller i say i be and he laugh i never hear of you uncle 's business mr garvald but you 'll find it a stiff task to compete with the lad from bristol and london they have get the whole dominion by the scruff of the neck i reply that i be not in awe of they and that i could hold my own with anybody in a fair trade fair trade he cry scornfully that be just what you will not get that be a thing unkenned in virginia look you here my lad the parliament in london treat we virginian like so many puling bairn we can not sell we tobacco except to english merchant and we can not buy a horn spoon except it come in a english ship what be the result of that you as a merchant can tell I fine the english fix what price they like for we goods and it be the lowest conceivable and they make they own price for what they sell we and that be as high as a jew 's there be a fine profit there for the gentlemen-venturer of bristol but it be starvation and damnation for we poor virginian what be the result he cry again why that there be nothing to be have in the land except what the merchant bring there be scarcely a smith or a wright or a cobbler between the jame and the potomac if i want a bed to lie in i have to wait till the come of the tobacco convoy and go down to the wharf and pay a hundred pound of sweet-scented for a thing you would buy in the candlerigg for twenty shilling how in god 's name be a farmer to live if he have to pay usury for every plough and spade and yard of dimity remember you be speak to a merchant i say you have tell I the very thing to encourage I if price be high it be all the better for I it would be he say grimly if you name werena what it be and you come from elsewhere than the clyde d'you think the proud english corporation be go to let you inside not they the most you 'll get will be the scrap that fall from they table my poor lazarus and for these you 'll have to go hat in hand to dive he face grow suddenly earnest and he lean on the table and look I straight in the eye you be a young lad and a new-comer and the accursed scale of virginium be not yet on you eye forbye i think you have spirit though it be maybe mix with a deal of folly you have you choice before you mr garvald you can become a lickspittle like the rest of they and no doubt you 'll gather a wheen bawbee but it will be a poor shiver soul will meet its maker in the hinder end or you can play the man and be a good virginian i 'll not say it be a easy part you 'll find plenty to cry you down and there will be hard knock go but by you face i judge you be not afraid of that let I tell you this land be on the edge of hell and there be sore need for stout man they 'll declare in this town that there be no indian on this side the mountain that would dare to lift a tomahawk little they ken in he eagerness he have grip my arm and he dark lean face be thrust close to mine i be with bacon in '76 in the fray with the susquehannock i speak the indian tongue and there be few alive that ken the tribe like I the folk here live snug in the tidewater which be maybe a hundred mile wide from the sea but of the west they ken nothing there might be a army thousand strong conceal a day 's journey from the manor and never a word would be hear of it but they tell I the indian be change nowadays i put in they say they have settle down to peaceful way like any christian put you head into a catamount 's mouth if you please he say grimly but never trust a indian the only good kind be the dead kind i tell you we be live on the edge of hell it may come this year or next year or five year hence but come it will i hear we be fight the french and that mean that the tribe of the canada will be on the move little you know the speed of a war-party they would cut my throat one morning and be hammer at the door of jame town before sundown there should be a line of fort in the west from the roanoke to the potomac and every man within fifty mile should keep a gun load and a horse saddle but think you the council will move it cost money say the wiseacre as if money be not cheaper than a slit wizzand i be deeply solemnize though i scarce understand the full drift of he word and the queer thing be that i be not ill-pleased i have come out to seek for trade and it look as if i be to find war and all this when i be not four hour land what think you of that he ask as i keep silent i have be warn a man i know on the rappahannock pass the word that the long house be stir tell that to the gentry in jame town what side be you go for young sir i 'll take my time i say and see for myself ask I again this day six month he laugh loud a very proper answer for a scot he cry see for yourself travel the country and use the wit god give you to form you judgment he pay the lawing and say he would put I on the road back these alley be not very healthy at this hour for a young gentleman in braw clothes once outside the tavern he lead I by many curious by-path till i find myself on the river-side just below the court-house it strike I that my new friend be not a popular personage in the town for he would stop and reconnoitre at every turning and he choose the darkest side of the road good-night to you he say at length and when you have finish you travels come west to the south fork river and ask for simon frew and i 'll complete you education i go to bed in a glow of excitement on the morrow i should begin a new life in a world of wonder and i rejoice to think that there be more than merchandise in the prospect chapter vi tell of my education i have not be a week in the place before i see one thing very clear -- that i should never get on with mr lambie he notion of business be to walk down the street in a fine coat and to sleep with a kerchief over he face in some shady veranda there be no vice in the creature but there be mighty little sense he live in awe of the great and rich and a nod from a big planter would make he happy for a week he use to deafen I with tale of colonel randolph and worshipful mr carew and colonel byrd 's new house at westover and the rare fashion in cravat that young mr mason show at the last surrey horse-racing now when a scot choose to be a sycophant he be more whole-hearted in the job than any one else on the globe and i grow very weary of mr lambie he be no better than a old wife and as timid as a hare forbye when i speak of fight the english merchant he hold up he hand as if i have utter blasphemy so be determine to find out for myself the truth about this wonderful new land i leave he the business in the town buy two good horse hire a servant by name john faulkner who have work out he time as a redemptioner and set out on my travels this be a history of doings not of thought or i would have much to tell of what i see during those month when lean as a bone and brown as a hazelnut i track the course of the great river the road be rough where road there be but the land smile under the sun and the virginian high and low keep open house for the chance traveller one night i would eat pork and hominy with a rough fellow who be carve a farm out of the forest and the next i would sit in a fine panelled hall and listen to gentlefolk ' speech and dine off damask and silver i could not tire of the green forest or the marsh alive with wild fowl or the noble orchard and garden or even the salty dune of the chesapeake shore my one complaint be that the land be desperate flat to a hill-bred soul like mine but one evening away north in stafford county i cast my eye to the west and see blue and sharp against the sunset a great line of mountain it be all i seek somewhere in the west virginium have she high land and one day i promise myself i would ride the road of the sun and find they secret in these month my thought be chiefly of trade and i see enough to prove the truth of what the man frew have tell I this richest land on earth be hold prisoner in the bond of a foolish tyranny the rich be less rich than they estate warrant and the poor be ground down by bitter poverty there be little corn in the land tobacco be the sole means of payment and this mean no trade in the common meaning of the word the place be slowly bleed to death and i have a mind to try and stanch its wound the firm of andrew sempill be look on jealously in spite of all the bowing and protestation of mr lambie if we be to increase we trade it must be at the englishman 's expense and that could only be do by offer the people a better way of business when the harvest come and the tobacco fleet arrive i could see how the thing work out we two ship the _ blackcock _ of ayr and the _ duncan davidson _ of glasgow have some trouble get they cargo we could only deal with the smaller planter who be not thirl to the big merchant and it take we three weary week up and down the river-side wharf to get we hold fill there be a madness in the place for thing from england and unless a man could label he wares london-made he could not hope to catch a buyer 's fancy why i have see a fellow at a fair at henricus selling common virginian mocking-bird as the best english mocking-bird my uncle have send out a quantity of ayrshire cheese mutton ham pickle salmon dunfermline linen paisley dimity alloa worst sweet ale from tranent kilmarnock cowl and a lot of fine feather-bed from the clydeside there be nothing common or trashy in the whole consignment but the planter prefer some gewgaw from cheapside or some worthless london fur which they could have better any day by take a gun and hunting they own wood when my own business be over i would look on at some of the other lading there on the wharf would be the planter with he wife and family and every servant about the place and there be the merchant skipper show off he goods and quote for each a weight of tobacco the planter want to get rid of he crop and know that this be he only chance while the merchant could very well sell he leavings elsewhere so the dice be cogg from the start and i have see a plain kitchen chair sell for fifty pound of sweet-scented or something like the price at which a joiner in glasgow would make a score and leave himself a handsome profit \* \* \* \* \* the upshot be that i pay a visit to the governor mr franci nicholson whom my lord howard have leave as he deputy governor nicholson have come from new york not many month before with a great repute for ill-temper and harsh dealing but i like the look of he hard-set face and soldierly bearing and i never mind choler in a man if he have also honesty and good sense so i wait upon he at he house close by middle plantation on the road between jame town and york river i have a very dusty reception he excellency sit in he long parlor among a mass of book and papers and saddle-bag and glare at I from beneath lower brow the man be sore harass by the king 's government on one side and the virginian council on the other and he treat every stranger as a foe what do you seek from I he shout if it be some merchant ' squabble you can save you breath for i be sick of the shylock i say very politely that i be a stranger not half a year arrive in the country but that i have be use my eye and wish to submit my view to he consideration go to the council he rasp go to that silken fool he majesty 's attorney my politics be not those of the leather-jaw that prate in this land that be why i come to you i say then without more ado i give he my notion on the defense of the colony for from what i have learn i judge that would interest he most he hear I with unexpected patience well now suppose you be right i do not deny it virginium be a treasure house with two of the side open to wind and weather i tell the council that and they would not believe I here be we at war with france and frontenac be hammer at the gate of new york if that fall it will soon be the turn of maryland and next of virginium england 's possession in the west be indivisible and what threaten one endanger all but think you we virginian can see it when i present my scheme for set fort along the northern line i could not screw a guinea out of the miscreant the colony be poor they cry and could not afford it and then the worshipful councillor ride home to swill madeira and loll on they london bed god 's truth be i not a patriot i would welcome m frontenac to teach they decency now i do not think much of the french danger be far more concerned with the peril in the west but i hold my peace on that subject it be not my cue to cross he excellency in he present humor what make the colony poor i ask the planter be rich enough but the richest man will grow tired of bear the whole burden of the government i submit that he majesty and the english law be chiefly to blame when the hollander be suffer to trade here they pay five shilling on every anker of brandy they bring hither and ten shilling on every hogshead of tobacco they carry hence now every penny that be raise must come out of the virginian and the englishman who bleed the land go scot free that be true say he and it be a damned disgrace but how be i to better it clap a tax on every ship that pass point comfort outward bind i say the merchant can well afford to pay it listen to he he laugh and what kind of answer would i get from my lord howard and he majesty every greasy member would be on he foot in parliament in defense of what he call english rights then there would come a dispatch from the government tell the poor deputy-governor of virginium to go to the devil he look at I curiously screw up he eye by the way mr garvald what be you trade i be a merchant like the other i say only my ship run from glasgow instead of bristol a very pretty merchant he say quizzically i have hear that hawk should not pick out hawk ' eye what do you propose to gain mr garvald better business i say to be honest with you sir i be suffer from the close monopoly of the englishman and i think the country be suffer worse i have a notion that thing can be remedy if you can not put on a levy good and well that be you business but i mean to make a effort on my own account then i tell he something of my scheme and he hear I out with a puzzle face of all the brazen scot -- he cry scot yourself i laugh for he face and speech betray he i 'll not deny that there be glimmering of sense in you mr garvald but how do you a lad with no backing propose to beat a strong monopoly buttress by the whole stupidity and idleness of virginium you 'll be strip of you last farthing and you 'll be lucky if it end there do not think i be against you i be with you in you principle but the job be too big for you we will see say i but i can take it that provide i keep within the law he majesty 's governor will not stand in my way i can promise you that i 'll do more for i 'll drink success to you enterprise he fill I a great silver tankard of spiced sack and i empty it to the toast of honest man \* \* \* \* \* all the time at the back of my head be other thought than merchandise the picture which frew have draw of virginium as a smile garden on the edge of a burning pit be stamp on my memory i have see on my travels the indian that dwell in the tidewater remnant of the old great clan of doeg and powhatan and pamunkey they be civil enough fellow follow they own way and not molest they scanty white neighbor for the country be wide enough for all but so far as i could learn these clanlet of the algonquin house be no more comparable to the fight tribe of the west than a highland caddie in a edinburgh close be to a hill macdonald with a claymore but the common virginian would admit no peril though now and then some rough landward fellow would lay down he spade spit moodily and tell I a grim tale i have ever the notion to visit frew and finish my education it be not till the tobacco ship have go and the autumn have grow late that i get the chance the tree be flame scarlet and saffron as i ride west through the forest to he house on the south fork river there by a wood fire in the October dusk he feed I on wild turkey and barley bread and listen silently to my tale he say nothing when i speak of my scheme for get the better of the englishman and win virginium to my side profit interested he little for he grow he patch of corn and pumpkin and hunt the deer for he own slender need once he break in on my rigmarole with a piece of news that flutter I you mind the big man you be chase that night you and I first forgather well i have see he where i cry all else forget here in this very place six week syne he stalk in about ten o ' the night and lift half my plenishing when i get up in my bed to face he he fell I see there be the mark of it and he show a long scar on he forehead he go off with my best axe a gill of brandy and a good coat he be look for my gun too but that be in a hidy-hole i get up next morning with a dizzy head and follow he nigh ten mile i have a shot at he but i miss and he leg be too long for I yon be the dangerous lad where do he go think you i ask to the hill to the refuge of every ne'er - do-weel belike the indian have get he scalp and i be not regret it i spend three day with frew and each day i have the notion that he be put I to the test the first day he take I over the river into a great tangle of meadow and woodland beyond which rise the hazy shape of the western mountain the man be twenty year my elder but my youth be of no avail against he iron strength though i be hard and spare from my travels in the summer heat 'twa all i could do to keep up with he and only my pride keep I from cry halt often when he stop i could have weep with fatigue and have no breath for a word but he taciturnity save I from shame in a hollow among the wood we come to a place which send he on he knee peer and sniff like a wild-cat what make you of that he ask i see nothing but a bare patch in the grass some broken twig and a few ash it be a old camp i say ay say he nothing more use you wit man i use they but they give I no help this be the way i read it then he say three man camp here before midday they be cherokee of the matabaw tribe and one be a maker of arrow they be not hunting and they be in a mighty hurry just now they be maybe ten mile off or maybe they be watch we this be no healthy country for you and I he take I homeward at a speed which well-nigh founder I and when i question he he tell I where he get he knowledge they be three man for there be three different footmark in the ash ' edge and they be cherokee because they make they fire in the cherokee way so that the smoke run in a tunnel into the scrub they be matabaw from the pattern of they moccasin they be in a hurry for they do not wait to scatter the ash and clear up the place and they be not hunting for they cook no flesh one be a arrow-maker for he have be harden arrow-point in the fire and leave behind he the arrow-maker 's thong but how could you know how long back this have happen i ask the sap be still wet in the twig so it could not have be much above a hour since they leave besides the smoke have blow south for the grass smell of it that side now the wind be more to the east when we leave and if you remember it change to the north about midday i say it be a marvel and he grunt the marvel be what they have be do in the tidewater for from the tidewater i 'll swear they come next day he lead I eastward away back in the direction of the manor this be a easier day for he go slow as if seek for something he pick up some kind of a trail which we follow through the long afternoon then he find something which he pocket with a cry of satisfaction we be then on the edge of a ridge whence we look south to the orchard of henricus that be my arrow-maker he cry show I a round stone whorl he be a careless lad and he 'll lose half he belongings ere he win to the hill i be prepare for the wild cherokee on we journey of yesterday but it amaze I that the savage should come scout into the tidewater itself he smile grimly when i say this and take from he pocket a crumpled feather that be a cherokee badge he say i find that a fortnight back on the river-side a hour 's ride out of jame town and it wasna there when i have pass the same place the day before the tidewater think it have put the fear of god on the hill tribe and here be a red cherokee snowk about its back door the last day he take I north up a stream call the north fork which join with he own river i have leave my musket behind for this heavy travel make I crave to go light and i have no use for it but that day it seem we be to go hunting he carry a old gun and slew with it a deer in a marshy hollow -- a pretty shoot for the animal be ill-placed we broil a steak for we midday meal and presently clamber up a high woody ridge which look down on a stream and a piece of green meadow suddenly he stop a buck he whisper see what you can do you that be so ready with you pistol and he thrust he gun into my hand the beast be some thirty pace off in the dusk of the thicket it nettle I to have to shoot with a strange weapon and i think too lightly of the mark i fire and the bullet whistle over its back he laugh scornfully i hand it back to he it throw high and you do not warn I load quick and i 'll try again i hear the deer crash through the hill-side thicket and guess that presently it would come out in the meadow i be right and before the gun be in my hand again the beast be over the stream it be a long range and a difficult mark but i have to take the risk for i be on my trial i allow for the throw of the musket and the steepness of the hill and pull the trigger the shot might have be better for i have aim for the shoulder and hit the neck the buck leap into the air run three yard and topple over by the grace of god i have find the single chance in a hundred frew look at I with sincere respect that be braw shooting he say i can not say i ever see its equal that night in the smoky cabin he talk freely for once i never have a wife or bairn and i lean on no man i can fend for myself and cook my dinner and mend my coat when it be want it when bacon die i see what be come to this land and i come here to await it i have have some sudden call from the red gentry but they havena get I yet and they 'll no get I before my time i be in the lord 's hand and he have a job for simon frew go back to you money-bag mr garvald beat the english merchant my lad and take my blessing with you but keep that gun of yours by you bedside for the time be come when a man 's hand will have to keep he head chapter vii i become a unpopular character i do not waste time in get to work i have already write to my uncle tell he my plan and presently i receive he consent i arrange that cargo of such goods as i think most suitable for virginian sale should arrive at regular season independent of the tobacco harvest then i set about equip a store on the high land north of jame town by the road to middle plantation i buy some acre of clear soil and have build for I a modest dwelling beside it stand a large brick building one half fit as a tobacco shed where the leaf could lie for month if need be without take harm and the other arrange as a merchant 's store with roomy cellar and wide garret i relinquish the warehouse by the jame town quay and to my joy i be able to relinquish mr lambie that timid soul have be on thorn ever since i mooted my new project he implore I to put they from I he draw such picture of the power of the english trader you would have think they the prince merchant of venice he see all he hard-won gentility go at a blow and himself a outcast preclude for ever from great man 's recognition he could not bear it and though he be loyal to my uncle 's firm in he own way he seek a change one day he announce that he have be offer a post as steward to a big planter at henricus and when i warmly bid he accept it he smile wanly and say he have do so a week agone we part very civilly and i choose as manager my servant john faulkner this be not a history of my trading venture or i would tell at length the step i take to find a new way of business i go among the planter offer to buy tobacco from the come harvest and to pay for it in bond which could be exchange for goods at my store i also offer to provide shipment in the autumn for tobacco and other wares and i fix the charge for freight -- a very moderate one -- in advance my plan be to clear out my store before the return of the ship and to have thereby a large quantity of tobacco mortgage to I i hope that thus i would win the friendship and custom of the planter since i offer they a more convenient way of sale and higher profit i hope by break down the english monopoly to induce a continual and wholesome commerce in the land for this purpose it be necessary to get coin into the people 's hand so use my uncle 's credit i have a parcel of english money from the new york goldsmith in a week i find myself the most-talked-of man in the dominion and soon i see the trouble that credit bring i have pick up a very correct notion of the fortune of most of the planter and the man who be most eager to sell to I be just those i could least trust some fellow who be near bankrupt from dice and cock-fighting would offer I five hundred hogshead when i know that he ill-guided estate could scarce produce half i be not a merchant out of charity and i have to decline many offer and so make many foe still one way and another i be not long in clear out my store and i find myself with some three time the amount of tobacco in prospect that i have send home at the last harvest that be very well but there be the devil to pay besides every wastrel i send off empty-handed be my enemy the agent of the englishman look sourly at I and many a man who be swindle grossly by the bristol buyer see I as a marauder instead of a benefactor for this i be prepared but what stagger I be the way that some of the better sort of the gentry come to regard I it be not that they do not give I they custom that i do not expect for gunpowder alone would change the habit of a virginian tory but my new business seem to they such a downcome that they pass I by with a cock of the chin before they have treat I hospitably and make I welcome at they house i have hunt the fox with they -- very little to my credit and shot wildfowl in they company with better success i have dine with they and dance in they hall at christmas then i have be a gentleman now i be a shopkeeper a creature about the level of a redemptioner the thing be so childish that it make I angry it be right for one of they to sell he tobacco on he own wharf to a tarry skipper who cheat he grossly but wrong for I to sell kebbuck and linsey-woolsey at a even bargain i give up the puzzle some folk ' notion of gentility be beyond my wit i have take to go to the church in jame town first at mr lambie 's desire and then because i like the sermon there on a Sunday you would see the fashion of the neighborhood for the planter ' lady ride in on pillion and the planter themselves in gold-embroidered waistcoat and plush breeches and new-powdered wig lean on the tombstone and exchange snuffmull and gossip in the old ramshackle graveyard you would see such a parade of satin bodice and tabby petticoat and lace headgear as make it blossom like the rose i go to church one Sunday in my second summer and be late go up the aisle look for a place the man at the seat-end would not stir to accommodate I and i have to find rest in the cock-loft i think nothing of it but the close of the service be to enlighten I as i go down the churchyard not a man or woman give I greet and when i speak to any i be not answer these be man with whom i have be on the friendliest term woman too who only a week before have chaffer with I at the store it be clear that the little society have maroon I to a isle by myself i be a leper unfit for gentlefolk ' company because forsooth i have sell goods which every one of they do also and have try to sell they fair the thing make I very bitter i sit in my house during the hot noon when no one stir and black anger fill my heart i grow as peevish as a slight girl and would no doubt have fret myself into some signal folly have not a event occur which brace my soul again this be the arrival of the english convoy when i hear that the ship be sight i make certain of trouble i have meantime add to my staff two other young man who like faulkner live with I at the store also i have get four stalwart negro slave who sleep in a hut in my garden 'twa a strong enough force to repel a drunken posse from the plantation and i have a fancy that it would be need in the come week two day later go down the street of jame town i meet one of the english skipper a redfaced bottle-nosed old ruffian call bullivant he be full of apple-jack and strut across the way to accost I what be this i hear sawney he cry you be set up as a pedlar and try to cut in on we trade od twist I but we 'll put a end to that my bully-boy d'you think the king god bless he make the law for a red-haired flea-bitten sawney to diddle true-born englishman what 'll the king 's bench say to that think ye he be very abusive but very uncertain on he leg i say good-humouredly that i welcome process of law and would defend my action he shake he head and say something about law not be everything and england be a long road off he have clearly some great threat to be deliver of but just then he sit down so heavily that he have no breath for anything but curse but the drunkard have give I a notion i hurry home and give instruction to my man to keep a special guard on the store then i set off in a pinnace to find my three ship which be now lade up and down among the creek that be the beginning of a fortnight 's struggle when every man 's hand be against I and i enjoy myself surprisingly i be never at rest by land or water the ship be the least of the business for the dour scot seaman be a match for all comer i make they anchor at twilight in mid-stream for safety 's sake for in that drouthy clime a firebrand might play havoc with they the worst that happen be that one moonless night a band of rascal rig out as indian brave come yell down to the quay where some tobacco be wait to be ship and before my man be warn have tip a couple of hogshead into the water they get no further for we fall upon they with marling-spike and hatchet strip they of they feather and send they to cool they head in the muddy river the ring-leader i hale to jame town and have the pleasure of see he grin through a collar in the common stock then i hie I back to my store which be my worst anxiety i be follow by ill name as i go down the street and one day in a tavern a young fool draw he shabble on I but i would quarrel with no man for that be a luxury beyond a trader there have be a attack on my tobacco shed by some of the english seaman and in the mellay one of my black get a ugly wound from a cutlass it be only a foretaste and i set my house in order one afternoon john faulkner bring I word that mischief would be afoot at the darkening i put each man to he station and i have the sense to picket they a little distance from the house the englishman be clumsy conspirator we watch they arrive let they pass and follow silently on they heel they business be wreckage and they fix a charge of powder by the tobacco shed lay and light a fuse and retire discreetly into the bush to watch they handiwork then we fall upon they and the hindquarter of all bear witness to we greet i catch the fellow who have lay the fuse tie the whole thing round he neck clap a pistol to he ear and march he before I into the town if you be mind to bolt i say remember you have a charge of gunpowder lobbing below you chin i have but to flash my pistol into it and they will be pick the bit of you off the high tree i take the rascal he knee knock under he straight to the ordinary where the english merchant chiefly forgather a dozen of they sit over a bowl of punch when the door be open and i kick my guy fawke inside i may have misjudge they but i think every eye look furtive as they see my prisoner gentleman say i i restore you you property this be a penitent thief who desire to make a confession my pistol be at he temple the powder be round he neck and he must have see a certain resolution in my face anyhow sweating and quake he blurt out he story and when he offer to halt i make ring with the barrel on the flesh of he neck it be a damned lie cry one of they a handsome over-dressed fellow who have be conspicuous for he public insolence towards I nay say i we penitent 's tale have the note of truth one word to you gentleman i be hospitably inclined and if any one of you will so far honor I as to come himself instead of dispatch he servant he welcome will be the warmer i bid you good-night and leave you this fellow in proof of my goodwill keep he away from the candle i pray you or you will all go to hell before you time that be the end of my worst trouble and presently my lading be finish and my store replenish then come the time for the return sailing and the last enterprise of my friend be to go off without my three vessel but i get a order from the governor deliver readily but with much profanity to the commander of the frigate to delay till the convoy be complete i breathe more freely as i see the last hull grow small in the estuary for now as i reason it out the planter must begin to compare my price with the englishman 's and must come to see where they advantage lay but i have count my chicken too soon and be to be woefully disappoint at that time all the coast of america from new england to the main be infested by pirate vessel some sail under english letter of marque and prey only on the shipping of france with whom we be at war some who have form themselves into a company call the brethren of the coast rob the spanish treasure-ship and merchantman in the south water and rarely come north to we part save to careen or provision they be mostly english and welsh with a few frenchman and though i have little to say for they doings they leave british ship in the main unmolested and be welcome as a godsend by we coast dweller since they smuggle goods to they which would have be twice the cost if buy at the convoy market lastly there be one or two horrid desperado who ravage the sea like tiger such a one be the man cosh and that teach surname blackbeard of whom we hear too much to-day but on the whole we of virginium suffer not at all from these gentleman of fortune and piracy though the common peril of the sea enter but little into the estimation of the merchant judge then of my disgust when i get news a week later that one of my ship the ayr brig have straggle from the convoy and be seize rifle and burn to the water by pirate almost in sight of cape charle the loss be grievous but what anger I be the mystery of such a happen i know the brig be a slow sailer but how in the name of honesty could she be suffer in broad daylight to fall into such a fate i remember the hostility of the englishman and fear she have have foul play just after christmas-tide i expect two ship to replenish the stock in my store they arrive safe but only by the skin of they tooth for both have be chase from they first entrance into american water and only they big topsail and a favor wind bring they off i examine the captain closely on the matter and they be positive that they assailant be not cosh or any one of he kidney but a ship of the brethren who ordinarily be on the best of term with we merchantman my suspicion now grow into a fever i have long believe that there be some connivance between the pirate of the coast and the english trader and small blame to they for it 'twa a sensible way to avoid trouble and i for one would rather pay a modest blackmail every month or two than run the risk of lose a good ship and a twelve-month 's cargo but when it come to use this connivance for private spite the thing be not to be endure in march my doubt become certainty i have a parcel of gold coin come to I from new york in one of the coast vessel -- no great sum but more than i care to lose presently i have news that the ship be aground on a sandspit on accomac and have be plunder by a pirate brigantine i get a sloop and go down the river and sure enough i find the vessel newly refloat and the captain a old new hampshire fellow in a great take piracy there have be but of a queer kind for not a farthing 's worth have be touch except my packet of gold the skipper be honesty itself and it be plain that the pirate who have chase the ship aground and then come aboard to plunder have do it to do I hurt and I alone all this make I feel pretty solemn my uncle be a rich man but no firm could afford these repeat loss i be the most unpopular figure in virginium hate by many despise by the genteel whose only friend be my own servant and a few poverty-stricken landward folk i have find out a good way of trade but i have set a hornet 's nest buzz about my ear and be on the fair way to be extinguish this alliance between my rival and the free companion be the last straw to my burden if the sea be to be shut to he then a merchant might as well put up he shutter it make I solemn but also most mightily angry if the star in they course be go to fight against andrew garvald they should find he ready i go to the governor but he give I no comfort indeed he laugh at I and bid I try the same weapon as my adversary i leave he very wrathful and after a night 's sleep i begin to see reason in he word clearly the law of virginium or of england would give I no redress i be a alien from the genteel world why should i not get the benefit of my ungentility if my rival go for they weapon into dark place i could surely do likewise a line of virgil come into my head which seem to I to contain very good counsel : _ flectere si nequeo supero acheronta movebo _ which mean that if you can not get heaven on you side you have better try for the devil but how be i to get into touch with the devil and then i remember in a flash my meeting with the sea-captain on the glasgow stairhead and he promise to help I i have no notion who he be or how he could aid but i have a vague memory of he power and briskness he have look like the kind of lad who might conduct I into the wild world of the free companion i seek mercer 's tavern by the water-side a melancholy place grow up with weed with a yard of dark tree at the back of it old mercer be a elder in the little wooden presbyterian kirk which i have take to attend since my quarrel with the gentry he know I and greet I with he doleful smile shake he foolish old beard what be you errand this e ` en mr garvald he say in broad scot will you drink a rummer o ' toddy or try some fine auld usquebaugh i hae get frae my cousin in buchan i sit down on the settle outside the tavern door this be my errand i want you to bring I to a man or bring that man to I he name be ninian campbell mercer look at I dully there be a lad o ' that name be hang at inveraray i ' '68 for stealin ' twae hen and a wether the man i mean be long and lean and he head be as red as fire he give I you name so you must know he he eye show no recognition he repeat the name to himself mumble it toothlessly it stick i ' my memory he say but when and where i canna tell certe there be no man o ' the name in virginium i be begin to think that my memory have play I false when suddenly the whole scene in the saltmarket leap vividly to my brain then i remember the something else i have be enjoin to say ninian campbell i go on bid I ask for he here and i be to tell you that the lymphad be on the loch and the horn of diarmaid have sound in a twinkle he face change from vacancy to shrewdness and from senility to purpose he glance uneasily round for god 's sake speak soft he whisper come inside man we 'll steek the door and then i 'll hear you business chapter viii red ringan once at edinburgh college i have read the latin tale of apuleius and the begin stick in my memory : _ thraciam ex negotio petebam _ -- i be start off for thrace on business that be my case now i be about to plunge into a wild world for no more startling cause than that i be a trader who want to save my pocket it be to those who seek only peace and a quiet life that adventure fall the homely merchant jogging with he pack train find the enchanted forest and the sleep princess and saul busily search for he father 's ass stumble upon a kingdom what seek ye with ringan mercer ask when we have sit down inside with lock door the man 's name be ninian campbell i say somewhat puzzle well it be the same thing what do they teach you at lesmahagow if ye do not know that ringan be the scot for ninian lord bless I laddie do not tell I ye have never hear of red ringan to be sure i have i have hear of little else for a twelvemonth in every tavern in virginium when man talk of the free companion it be the name of red ringan that come first to they tongue i have be too occupy by my own affair to listen just then to fireside tale but i could not help hearing of this man 's exploit he be a kind of leader of the buccaneer and by all account no miscreant like cosh but a mirthful fellow striking hard when need be but at other time merciful and jovial now i set little store by you pirate hero they be for lad and silly girl and sot in a ale-house and a merchant can have no kindness for those who be the foe of he trade so when i hear that the man i seek be this notorious buccaneer i show my alarm by drop my jaw mercer laugh i 'll not conceal from you that you take a certain risk in go to ringan ye need not tell I you business but it should be a grave one to take you down to the carolina key there be time to draw back if ye want but you have bring I the master word and i be bind to set you on the road just one word to ye mr garvald keep a stout face whatever you see for ringan have a weakness for a bold man be here the morn at sunrise and if ye be wise bring no weapon i 'll see to the boat and the provision i be at the water-side next day at cock-crow while the mist be still low on the river mercer be busy put food and a keg of water into a light sloop and a tall indian be aboard redding out the sail my travels have give I some knowledge of the red tribe and i speak a little of they language but this man be of a type not often see in the virginian lowland he be very tall with a skin clear and polish like bronze and unlike the ordinary savage he breast be unmarked and he hair unadorned he be naked to the waist and below wear long leather breeches dye red and fringed with squirrel ' tail in he wampum belt be stick a brace of knife and a tomahawk it seem he know I for as i approach he stand up to he full height and put he hand on he forehead brother he say and he grave eye look steadily into mine then i remember some month before i have be ride back the road from green spring and in a dark woody place have come across a indian sore beset by three of the white scum which infested the river-side what the quarrel be i know not but i like little the villainous look of the three and i like much the clean lithe figure of they opponent so i ride my horse among they and lay on to they with the butt of my whip they have they knife out but i manage to disarm the one who attack I and my horse upset a second while the indian who have no weapon but a stave crack the head of the last i get nothing worse than a black eye but the man i have rescue bleed from some ugly cut which i have much ado stanch he shake hand with I gravely when i have do and vanish into the thicket he be a seneca indian and i wonder what one of that house be do in the tidewater mercer tell I he name shalah will take you to the man you ken do whatever he tell you mr garvald for this be a job in which you be nothing but a bairn we push off the indian take the oar and in five minute jame town be lose in the haze on the surrey shore we pick up a breeze and with the ebbing tide make good speed down the estuary shalah the indian have the tiller and i sit luxuriously in the bow smoking my cob pipe and wonder what the next week hold in store for I the night before i have have qualm about the whole business but the air of morning have a trick of firing my blood and i believe i have forget the errand which be take I to the carolina shore it be enough that i be go into a new land and new company last night i have think with disfavor of red ringan the buccaneer that morning i think only of ninian campbell with whom i have forgather on a glasgow landing my own thought keep I silent and the indian never open he mouth like a statue he crouch by the tiller with he sombre eye look to the sea that night when we have round cape henry in fine weather we run the sloop into a little bay below a headland and make camp for the night beside a stream of cold water next morning it blow hard from the north and in a driving rain we creep down the carolina coast one incident of the day i remember i take in a reef or two and adjust the sheet for this be a game i know and love the indian watch I closely and make a sign to I to take the helm he have guess that i know more than himself about the handling of a boat in wind and since we be in a open sea where he guidance be not need he prefer to trust the thing to I i like the trait in he for i take it to be a mark of a wise man that he know what he can do and be not ashamed to admit what he can not that evening we have a cold bed but the storm blow out in the night and the next day the sun be as hot as summer and the wind a point to the east shalah once again be steersman for we be inside some very ugly reef which i take to be the beginning of the carolina key on shore forest straggle down to the sea so that sometimes they almost have they foot in the surf but now and then would come a open grassy space run far inland these be the great savannah where herd of wild cattle and deer roam and where the free companion come to fill they larder it be a wilder land than the tidewater for only once do we see a human dwelling far remote on the savannah i could pick out twirl of smoke rise into the blue weather the sign of indian hunting fire shalah begin now to look for landmark and to take bearing of a sort among the maze of creek and shallow bay which open on the land side it need a indian to pick out a track the sun have all but set when with a grunt of satisfaction he swing round the tiller and head shoreward before I in the twilight i see only a wooded bluff which as we approach divide itself into two presently a channel appear a narrow thing about as broad as a cable 's length into which the wind carry we here it be very dark the high side with they gloomy tree show at the top a thin line of redden sky shalah hug the starboard shore and as the screen of the forest catch the wind it weaken and weaken till it die away and we move only with the ingoing tide i have never be in so eery a place it be full of the sharp smell of pine tree and as i sniff the air i catch the savor of wood smoke man be somewhere ahead of we in the gloom shalah run the sloop into a little creek so overgrown with vine that we have to lie flat on the thwart to enter then put he mouth to my ear he speak for the first time since we have leave jame town it be hard to approach the master and my brother must follow I close as the panther follow the deer where shalah put he foot let my brother put he also come he step from the boat to the hill-side and with incredible speed and stillness begin to ascend he long soft stride be make without noise or effort whether the ground be moss or a tangle of vine or loose stone or the trunk of fall tree i have pride myself on my hill-craft but beside the indian i be a blunder child i might have make shift to travel as fast but it be the silence of he progress that stagger I i plunge and slip and sprawl and my heart be burst before the ascent cease and we steal to the leave along the hill shoulder presently come a gap in the tree and i look down in the last greyness of dusk on a strange and beautiful sight the channel lead to a landlocked pool maybe a mile around and this be as full of shipping as a town 's harbor the water be but a pit of darkness but i could make out the mast rise into the half light and i count more than twenty vessel in that port no light be show and the whole place be quiet as a grave we enter a wood of small hemlock and i feel rather than see the ground slope in front of we about two hundred foot above the water the glen of a little stream shape itself into a flat cup which be invisible from below and girdle on three side by dark forest here we walk more freely till we come to the lip of the cup and there not twenty pace below I i see a wonderful sight the hollow be light with the glow of a dozen fire round which man cluster some be busy boucann meat for ship 's food some be cooking supper some sprawl in idleness and smoke or dice the night have now grow very black around we and we be well protect for the man in the glow have they eye daze and could not spy into the darkness we come very close above they so that i could hear they talk the smell of roast meat prick my hunger and i realize that the salt air have give I a noble thirst they be common seaman from the pirate vessel and as far as i could judge they have no officer among they i remark they fierce dark face and the long knife with which they slash and trim the flesh for they boucanning shalah touch my hand and i follow he into the wood we climb again and from the tinkle of the stream on my left i judge that we be ascend to a higher shelf in the glen the indian move very carefully as noiseless as the flight of a owl and i marvelled at the gift in after day i be to become something of a woodsman and track as swiftly and silently as any man of my upbringing but i never master the indian art by which the foot descend in the darkness on something that will crackle check before the noise be make i could do it by day when i could see what be on the ground but in the dark the thing be beyond I it be a instinct like a wild thing 's and possible only to those who have go all they day light-shod in the forest suddenly the slope and the tree cease and a new glare burst on we eye this second shelf be smaller than the first and as i blink at the light i see that it hold about a score of man torch make of pine bough dip in tar blaze at the four corner of the assembly and in the middle on a boulder a man be sit he be speak loudly and with passion but i could not make he out once more shalah put he mouth to my ear with a swift motion like a snake and whisper the master we crawl flat on we belly round the edge of the cup the tree have go and the only cover be the long grass and the low sumach bush we move a foot at a time and once the indian turn in he track and crawl to the leave almost into the open my sense of smell as sharp almost as a dog 's tell I that horse be picket in the grass in front of we we road take we within hearing of the speaker and though i dare not raise my head i could hear the soft highland voice of my friend he seem now to be speak humorously for a laugh come from the hearer once at the cross of a little brook i pull a stone into the water and we instantly lay as still as death but man preoccupy with they own concern do not keep anxious watch and we precaution be needless presently we have come to the far side of the shelf abreast of the boulder on which he sit who seem to be the chief figure now i could raise my head and what i see make my eye dazzle red ringan sit on a stone with a naked cutlass across he knee in front stand a man the most evil-looking figure that i have ever behold he be short but very sturdily build and wear a fine lace coat not make for he which hang to he knee and be stretch tight at the armpit he have a heavy pale face without hair on it he tooth have go all but two buck-tooth which stick out at each corner of he mouth give he the look of a tusker i could see he lip move uneasily in the glare of the pine bough and he eye dart about the company as if seek countenance ringan be speak very gravely with he eye shine like sword point the other be every make and manner of fellow from well-shaped and well-clad gentleman to loutish seaman in leather jerkin some of the face be stain dark with passion and crime some have the air of wild boy and some the hard sobriety of trader but one and all be hold by the dancing eye of the man that speak what be the judgment he be say of the free companion by the old custom of the western sea i call upon you gentleman all for you decision then i gather that the evil-faced fellow have offend against some one of they lawless law and be on he trial no one speak for a moment and then one grizzled seaman raise he hand the dice must judge he say he must throw for he life against the six another exclaim against this old wife ' folly he cry with a oath let cosh go he way and swear to amend they the brethren of the coast can not be too nice in these little matter we be not pursy justice or moon girl but he have no support the verdict be for the dice and a seaman bring ringan a little ivory box which he hold out to the prisoner the latter take it with shake hand as if he do not know how to use it you will cast thrice say ringan two even throw and you be free the man fumble a little and then cast it fall a four a second time he throw and the dice lay five in that wild place in the black heart of night the terror of the thing fall on my soul the savage face the deadly purpose in ringan 's eye the fumble miscreant before he be all heavy with horror i have no doubt that cosh be worthy of death but this cold and merciless treatment freeze my reason i watch with start eye the last throw and i could not hear ringan declare it but i see by the look on cosh 's face what it have be it be you privilege to choose you manner of death and to name you successor i hear ringan say but cosh do not need the invitation now that he case be desperate the courage in he revive he be fully arm and in a second he have draw a knife and leap for ringan 's throat perhaps he expect it perhaps he have learn the art of the wild beast so that he body be answerable to he swiftest wish i do not know but i see cosh 's knife crash on the stone and splinter while ringan stand by he side you have answer my question he say quietly draw you cutlass man you have maybe one chance in ten thousand for you life i shut my eye as i hear the steel clash then very soon come silence i look again and see ringan wipe he blade on a bunch of grass and a body lie before he he be speak -- speak i suppose about the successor to the dead man whom two negro have promptly remove suddenly at my shoulder shalah give the hoot of a owl follow at a second 's interval by a second and a third i suppose it be some signal agree with ringan but at the time i think the man have go mad i be not very sane myself what i have see have send a cold grue through I for i have never before see a man die violently and the circumstance of the place and hour make the thing a thousandfold more awful i have a black fright on I at that whole company of merciless man and especially at ringan whose word be law to they now the worst effect of fear be that it obscure good judgment and make a man in desperation do deed of a foolhardiness from which at other time he would shrink all i remember in that moment be that i have to reach ringan and that mercer have tell I that the safest plan be to show a bold front i never remember that i have also be bid to follow shalah nor do i reflect that a secret conclave of pirate be no occasion to choose for my meeting with a sudden impulse i force myself to my foot and stalk or rather shamble into the light ninian i cry ninian campbell i be here to claim you promise the whole company turn on I and i be grip by a dozen hand and fling on the ground ringan come forward to look but there be no recognition in he eye some one cry out a spy and there be a fierce murmur of voice which be meaningless to I for fear have get I again and i have neither ear nor voice dimly it seem that he give some order and i be truss up with rope then i be conscious of be carry out of the glare of torch into the cool darkness presently i be lay in some kind of log-house carpet with fir bough for the needle tickle my face bit by bit my sens come back to I and i catch hold of my vagrant courage a big negro in seaman 's clothes with a scarlet sash round he middle be squat on the floor watch I by the light of a ship 's lantern he have a friendly foolish face and i remember yet how he roll he eyeball i will not run away i say so you might slacken these rope and let I breathe easy apparently he be a accommodate gaoler for he do as i wish and give I a drink i say for my tongue 's like a stick he mix I a pannikin of rum and water perhaps he hocus it or maybe 'twa only the effect of spirit on a weary body but three minute after i have drunk i be in a heavy sleep chapter ix various doings in the savannah i awake in broad daylight and when my wit come back to I i see i be in a tent of skin with my limb unbound and a pitcher of water beside I place by some provident hand through the tent door i look over a wide space of green savannah how i have get there i know not but as my memory repeat the event of the night i know i have travel far for the sea show mile away at a great distance beneath I on the water i see a ship in full sail diminish to a toy size career northward with the wind outside a man be seat whistle a cheerful tune i get to my foot and stagger out to clear my head in the air and find the smile face of ringan good-morning andrew he cry as i sit down beside he have you sleep well i rub my eye and take long draught of the morning breeze be you a warlock mr campbell that you can spirit folk about the country at you pleasure i have sleep sound but my dream have be bad yes he say what sort of dream maybe i dream i be in a wild

free companion from make as honest law as any cackle council in the town do you see the man cosh have you hear anything of he doings and will you deny that the world be well quit of he there be a decency in all trade and cosh fair stank to heaven but i be glad the thing end as it do i never get to like a cold execution 'twa better for everybody that he should fly at my face and get six inch of kindly steel in he throat he have a gentleman 's death which be more than he crime warrant i be only half convinced here be i a law-abiding merchant pitchfork suddenly into a world of lawlessness i could not be expect to adjust my view in the short space of a night you give I a rough handling i say where be the need of it and you show very little sense in burst in on we the way you do could you not have bide quietly till shalah give the word i have to be harsh with you or they would have suspect something and cut you throat yon gentry be not to take liberty with what make you do it andrew just that i be black afraid that make I more fear of be a coward so i force myself to yon folly a very honorable reason he say be you the leader of those man i ask they look a scurvy lot do you call that a proper occupation for the best blood in breadalbane it be a silly speech and i could have bite my tongue out when i have utter it but i be in a vile temper for the dregs of the negro 's rum still hum in my blood he face grow dark till he look like the man i have see the night before i allow no man to slight my race he say in a harsh voice it be the truth whether you like it or not and you that claim to be a gentleman what be it they say about the highland and i quote a ribald glasgow proverb what move I to this insolence i can not say i be in the wrong and i know it but i be too much of a child to let go my silly pride ringan get up very quickly and walk three step the blackness have go from he face and it be puzzle and melancholy there be a precious lot of the bairn in you mr garvald he say and a ugly spice of the whiggamore i would have kill another man for half you word and i have get to make you pay for they somehow and he knit he brow and ponder i be ready say i with the best bravado i could muster though the truth be i be sick at heart i have force a quarrel like a ill-mannered boy on the very man whose help i have come to seek and i see too that i have go just that bit too far for which no recantation would win pardon what sort of way be you ready he ask politely you would fight I with you pistol but you have not get they and this be no a matter that will wait i could spit you in a jiffy with my sword but it wouldna be fair it strike I that you and I be ill match we be like a shark and a wolf that can not meet to fight in the same element then he run he finger down the button of he coat and he eye be smile we 'll try the old way that laddie use on the village green man andrew i be go to skelp you as you mother skelp you when you be a breechless bairn and he toss he coat on the grass i could only follow suit though i be black ashamed at the whole business i feel the disgrace of my conduct and most bitterly the disgrace of the penalty my arm be too short to make a fighter of I and i could only strive to close that i might get the use of my weight and my great strength of neck and shoulder ringan dance round I tap I lightly on nose and cheek but hard enough to make the blood flow i defend myself as best i could while my temper rise rapidly and make I forget my penitence time and again i look for a chance to slip in but he be as wary as a fox and be a yard off before i could get my arm round he at last in extreme vexation i lower my head and rush blindly for he chest something like the sail of a windmill smite I on the jaw and i feel myself fall into a pit of great darkness where little light twinkle the next i know i be sit prop against the tent-pole with a cold bandage round my forehead and ringan with a napkin bathing my face cheer up man he cry you have get off light for there be no a scratch on you lily-white cheek and the blood-letting from the nose will clear out the dregs of moro 's hocus i blink a little and try to recall what have happen all my ill-humour have go and i be now in a hurry to set myself right with my conscience he hear my apology with a embarrassed face say no more andrew i be as muckle to blame as you and i have be give myself some ill name for that last trick it be ower hard but man the temptation be sore he elbow I to the open air now for the question you have a right to ask we of the brethren have not precisely a chief as you call it but there be not many of they would gainsay my word why you ask well it be not for a modest man to be sound he own trumpet maybe it be because i be a gentleman and there be that in good blood which awe the commonalty maybe it be because i have no fish of my own to fry i do not rob for greed like calvert and william or kill for lust like the depart cosh to I it be a game which i play by honest rule i never lay finger on a bodle 's worth of english stuff and if now and then i ease the don of a pickle silver or send a frenchman or two to purgatory what worse be i do than he majesty 's troops in flander or you black frigate that lie off port royal if i have a clear conscience i can more easily take order with those that be less single-minded but maybe the chief reason be that i have some little skill of arm so that the lad that question I be apt to fare like cosh there be a kind of boastful sincerity about the man which convince I but he word put I in mind of my own business i come seek you to ask help you friend have be make too free with my belongings i would never complain if it be the common risk of my trade but i have a notion that there be some sort of design behind it then i tell he of my strife with the english merchant what be you loss he ask the ayr brig be take off cape charle and burn to the water god help the poor soul in she for i fear they perish he nod i know that be one of cosh 's exploit he have pay by now for that and other thing two of my ship be chase through the cape and far up the tidewater of the jame not two month back i go on he laugh i do that myself he say astonishment and wrath fill I but i finish my tale a week ago there be a ship ashore on accomac pirate board she but they take nothing away save a sum of gold that be mine be that you do also mr campbell yes he say but the money 's safe i 'll give you a line to mercer and he 'll pay it you i be much oblige to you mr campbell i say choke with anger but who in heaven 's name ask you to manage my business i think you be my friend and i come to you as such and here i find you the chief among my enemy patience andrew he say and i 'll explain everything for i grant you it need some explain first you be right about the english merchant they and the free companion have long have a understanding and word be send by they to play trick on you ship i be absent at the time and though the thing be dirty work as any one could see some of the fool think it a fair ploy and cosh be suffer to do he will when i get back i hear the story and be black angry so i take the matter into my own keep i have way and means of get the news of virginium and i know pretty well what you have be do young one there be spirit in you and some wise notion but you want help in the game besides there be a bigger thing before you so i take step to bring you here you take a roundabout road say i by no means appease it have to be d'you think i could come march into jame town and collogue with you in you counting-house now that you be here you have my swear word that the free companion will never lay hand again on you venture will that content you it will i say but you speak of a bigger thing before I yes and that be the price you be go to pay I for my goodwill it be what the lawyer call _ consideratio _ for we bargain and it be the reason i bring you here tell I andrew d'you ken a man frew who live on the south fork river a north ireland fellow with a hatchet face and a big scar i see he a year ago it stick in my mind that you have and d'you mind the advice he give you i remember it very well for it be frew who have clinch my view on the defencelessness of we west he speak god 's truth i say but i can not get a virginian to believe it they 'll believe in time he say though maybe too late to save some of they scalp come to this hillock and i will show you something from the low swell of ground we look west to some little hill and in the hollow of they a spire of smoke rise into the blue i be go to take you there that you may hear and see something to you profit quick moro he cry to a servant bring food and have the horse saddle we breakfast on some very good beefsteak and start at a canter for the hill my headache have go and i be now in a contented frame of mind for i see the purpose of my errand accomplish and i have a young man 's eagerness to know what lay before I as we ride ringan talk you 'll have hear tell of bacon 's rise in '76 governor berkeley have ride the dominion with too harsh a hand and in the matter of its defense against the indian he be slack when he should have be tight the upshot be that nathaniel bacon take up the job himself and after give the indian they lesson turn he mind to the government of virginium he drive berkeley into accomac and would have turn the whole place tapsalteery if he have not suddenly die of a bowel complaint after that berkeley and he tame planter get the upper hand and there be some pretty homing and hanging there be two man that be lieutenant to bacon and maybe put the notion into he head one be jame drummond a cousin of my own mother 's and he get the gallows for he trouble the other be a man richard lawrence a fine scholar and a grand hand at plan though a little slow in a fight he keep the ordinary at jame town and be the one that collect the powder and kindle the fuse governor berkeley have a long score to settle with he but he never get he for when the thing be past hope mr richard ride west one snowy night to the hill and virginium see he no more they think he starve in the wilderness or get into the hand of the wild indian and be long ago dead i know all about dick lawrence for i have hear the tale twenty time but surely they be right i say it be fifteen year since any man have word of he well you 'll see he within a hour say ringan it be a queer story but it seem he fall in with a monacan war party and since he and bacon have be fight they deadly foe the susquehannock they treat he well and bring he south into carolina you must know andrew that all this land hereaways except for the little algonquin village on the shore be sioux country with as many tribe as there be house in clan campbell but cheek by jowl be a long strip hold by the tuscaroras a murder lot of devil of whom you and i 'll get news sooner than we want the tuscarora be bad enough in themselves but the worst part be that all the back country in the hill belong to they cousin the cherokee and god know how far north they sway hold the long house of the iroquois control everything west of the coast land from carolina away up through virginium to new york and the canada that mean that virginium have on two side the most powerful tribe of savage in the world and if ever the iroquois find a general and make a common attack thing would go ill with the tidewater i tell you that so that you can understand lawrence 's doings he hate the iroquois like hell and so he like they enemy he have live for fifteen year among the sioux while with the catawba while with the manahoac but mostly with the monacan we of the free companion see he pretty often and bring he the news and little comfort like good tobacco and _ eau de vie _ that he can not get among savage and we carry message between he and the tidewater for he have many friend still alive there there be no man ever have he knowledge of indian and i be take you to he for he have something to tell you by this time we have come to a place where a fair-sized burn issue from a shallow glen in the savannah there be a peel wand stick in a burnt tree above the water and this ringan take and break very carefully into two equal piece and put they back in the hole from this point onward i have the feeling that the long grass and the clump of bush hold watcher they make no noise but i could have swear to the truth of my notion ringan whose sens be keener than mine would stop every now and again and raise he hand as if in signal at one place we halt dead for five minute and at another he dismount and cut a tuft of sumach which he lay over he saddle then at the edge of a thicket he stop again and hold up both hand above he head instantly a tall indian step from the cover salute and walk by we side in five minute more we round a creek of the burn and be at the encampment 'twa the first time i have ever see a indian village the tent or teepee be of skin stretch over pole and not of bark like those of the woodland tribe at a great fire in the center woman be grill deer 's flesh while little brown child strive and quarrel for scrap i see few man for the brave be out hunting or keep watch at the approach one young lad take the horse and lead we to a teepee bigger than the other outside of which stand a finely-made savage with heron 's feather in he hair and a necklace of polished shell on he iron face there be no flicker of welcome or recognition but he shake hand silently with the two of we and strike a blow on a dry gourd instantly three warrior appear and take they place by he side then all of we sit down and a pipe be light and hand by the chief to ringan he take a puff and give it to one of the other indian who hand it to I with that ceremony over the tongue of the chief seem to be unloose the sachem come he say and a old man sit himself down beside we he be a strange figure to meet in a indian camp a long white beard hang down to he middle and he unshorn hair drape he shoulder like a fleece he clothing be of tan skin save that he have a belt of spanish leather and on he foot he wear country shoe and not the indian moccasin the eye in he head be keen and youthful and though he could not have be less than sixty he carry himself with the vigor of a man in he prime below he shaggy lock be a high broad forehead such as some college professor might have bear who have give all he day to the philosophy he seem to have be disturb in read for he carry in he hand a little book with a finger mark he place i catch a glimpse of the title and see that it be mr locke 's new essay on the human understanding ringan speak to the chief in he own tongue but the sioux language be beyond I mr lawrence join in and i see the indian 's eye kindle he shake he head and seem to deny something then he pour forth a flood of talk and when he have finish ringan speak to I he say that the tuscarora be stir word have come down from the hill to be ready for a great ride between the moon of stag and the corngather lawrence nod that be a old tuscarora habit but somehow these riding never happen he say something in sioux to one of the warrior and get a emphatic answer which he translate to I he think that the cherokee have have word from farther north it look like a general stir of the long house be it the fighting in canada i ask god know he say but i do not think so if that be the cause we should have the iroquois push down on the top of the cherokee but my information be that the cherokee be to move north themselves and then down to the tidewater it be not likely that the five nation have any plan of conquer the lowland they be a hill people and they know the white man 's mettle too well my notion be that some devilry be go on in the west and i might guess that there be a white man in it he speak to the chief who speak again to he companion and lawrence listen with contracting brow while ringan whistle between he tooth they have get a queer story say lawrence at last they say that when last they hunt on the roanoke they young man bring a tale that a tribe of cherokee who live six day ' journey into the hill have find a great sachem who have the white man 's magic and that god be move he to drive out the paleface and hold he hunting lodge in they dwelling that be not like a ordinary indian lie what do you make of it mr campbell ringan look grave it be possible enough there be a heap of renegade among the tribe man that have make the tidewater and even the free company too warm for they there be no know the mischief a strong-minded rascal might work i mind a man at norfolk a scot redemptioner who have the tongue of a devil and the strength of a wolf he break out one night and get clear into the wilderness lawrence turn to I briskly you see the case sir there be trouble brewing in the hill black trouble for virginium but we have some month ' breathing space for nat bacon 's sake i be loath to see the war paint at jame town the question be be you willing to do you share i be willing enough i say but what can i do i be not exactly a popular character in the tidewater if you want I to hammer sense into the planter you could not get a worse man for the job i have tell governor nicholson my fear and he be of my opinion but he hand be tie by a penurious council if he can not screw money for troops out of the virginian it be not likely that i could do much lawrence nod he wise head all you say be true but i want a different kind of service from you you may have notice in you travels mr garvald -- for they tell I you be not often out of the saddle -- that up and down the land there be a good few folk that be not very easy in they mind many of these be former trooper of bacon some be new man who have eye in they head some be old settler who have be sour by the folly of the government with such poor means as i possess i keep in touch with these gentleman and in they we have the rudiment of a frontier army i do not say they be many but five hundred resolute fellow well horse and well armed and lead by some man who know the indian way might be a stumbling-block in the way of a iroquois raid but to perfect this force need time and above all it need a man on the spot for virginium be not a healthy place for I and these savannah be a trifle distant i want a man in jame town who will receive word when i send it and pass it onto those who should hear it i want a discreet man whose trade take he about the country mr campbell tell I you be such a one will you accept the charge i be greatly flatter but a little perplexed i be a law-abiding citizen i say and i can have no hand in rebellion i have no ambition to play bacon 's part lawrence smile a proof of you discretion sir but believe I there be no thought of rebellion we have no quarrel with the council and less with he majesty 's governor we but seek to set the house in order against peril which we alone know fully i approve of you scruple and i give you my word they shall not be violate so be it i say i will do what i can god be praise say mr lawrence i have here certain secret papers which will give you the name of the man we can trust message will come to you which i trust you to find the means of send on mercer have we confidence and will arrange with you certain matter of arm he will also supply you with what money be need there be many in the tidewater who would look askance at this business so it must be do in desperate secrecy but if there should be trouble i counsel you to play a bold hand with the governor they tell I that you and he be friendly and unless i mistake the man he can see reason if he be wisely handle if the worst come to the worst you can take nicholson into you confidence how long have we to prepare i ask the summer month accord to my forecast it may be shorter or longer but i will know better when i get nearer the hill and what about the carolina tribe i ask if we be to hold the western march of virginium we can not risk be catch on the flank that can be arrange he say we friend the sioux be not over-fond of the long house if the tuscarora ride i do not think they will ever reach the jame the afternoon be now end and we be give a meal of corn-cake and roast deer 's flesh then we take we leave and mr lawrence 's last word to I be to send he any english book of a serious cast which come under my eye this request he make with so much hesitation but with so hungry a desire in he face that i be move to pity this ill-fated scholar wander in indian lodge and famish for lack of the society of he kind ringan take I by a new way which bear north of that we have ride and though the dusk begin soon to fall he never falter in he guide presently we leave the savannah for the wood of the coast and drop down hill by a very meager path we come in three hour to a creek of the sea there by a little fire we find shalah and the sloop ride at anchor below a thick covert of tree good-bye to you andrew cry ringan you 'll be get news of I soon and maybe see I in the flesh on the tidewater remember the word i tell you in the saltmarket for i never mention name when i take the road chapter x i hear a old song when we sail at daybreak next morning i have the glow of satisfaction with my own doings which be a safe precursor of misfortune i have settle my business with the free companion and need look for no more trouble on that score but what tickle my vanity be my talk with ringan and lawrence at the monacan lodge and the momentous trust they have lay on I with a young man 's vanity i see myself the savior of virginium and hail as such by the proud folk who now scorn I my only merit as i be to learn in time be a certain grasp of simple truth that elude cleverer man and a desperate obstinacy which be reluctant to admit defeat but it be the fashion of youth to glory in what it lack and i flatter myself that i have a natural gift for finesse and subtlety and be a bear deviser of war again and again i tell myself how i and lawrence 's virginian -- grow under my hand to a potent army -- should roll back the invader to the hill and beyond while the sioux of the carolina guard one flank and the stream of the potomac the other in those day the star of the great marlborough have not rise but john churchill the victor of blenheim do not esteem himself a wiser strategist than the raw lad andrew garvald now sail north in the long wash of the atlantic sea the weather grow spiteful and we be much buffet about by the contrary spring wind so that it be late in the afternoon of the third day that we turn cape henry and come into the bay of chesapeake here a perfect hurricane fall upon we and we seek refuge in a creek on the shore of norfolk county the place be marshy and it be hard to find dry land for we night 's lodge we provision have run low and there seem little enough for two hungry man who have all day be strive with salt wind so know that this be a neighborhood stud with great manor and remember the hospitality i have so often find i leave shalah by the fire with such food as remain and set out with we lantern through the wood to look for a human habitation i find one quicker than i have hope almost at once i come on a track which lead I into a carriage-road and out of the thicket to a big clear the daylight have not yet wholly go and it guide I to two gate-post from which a avenue of chestnut tree lead up to a great house there be light glimmer in the window and when i reach the yard and see the size of the barn and outbuilding i wish i have happen on a place of less pretension but hunger make I bold and i tramp over the mown grass of the yard which in the dusk i could see to be set with flower-bed till i stand before the door of as fine a mansion as i have find in the dominion from within come a sound of speech and laughter and i be in half a mind to turn back to my cold quarter by the shore i have no sooner strike the knocker than i want to run away the door be open instantly by a tall negro in a scarlet livery he ask no question but motion I to enter as if i have be a invite guest i follow he wonder dolefully what sort of figure i must cut in my plain clothes soak and stain by travel for it be clear that i have light on the mansion of some rich planter who be even now entertain he friend the servant lead I through a outer hall into a great room full of people a few candle in tall candlestick burn down the length of a table round which sit a score of gentleman the scarlet negro go to the tablehead and say something to the master who rise and come to meet I i be storm-stayed i say humbly and i leave my boat on the shore and come inland to look for a supper you shall get it he say heartily sit down and my servant will bring you what you need but i be not fit to intrude sir a weary traveller be no guest for such a table tush man he cry when do a virginian think the worse of a man for he clothes sit down and say no more you be heartily welcome he push I into a vacant chair at the bottom of the table and give some order to the negro now i know where i be for i have see before the noble figure of my host this be colonel beverley who in he youth have ride with prince rupert and have come to virginia long ago in the commonwealth time he sit on the council and be the most respect of all the magnate of the dominion for he have restrain the folly of successive governor and have ever teen ready to stand forth alike on behalf of the liberty of the settler and they duty to the crown he name be highly esteem at whitehall and more than once he have occupy the governor 's place when he majesty be slow in fill it he riches be large but he be above all thing a great gentleman who have graft on a old proud stock the tolerance and vigor of a new land the company have finish dine for the table be cover with fruit and comfit and wine in silver goblet there be sack and madeira and french claret and white rhenish and ale and cider for those with homelier palate i see dimly around I the face of the guest for the few candle scarcely illumine the dusk of the great panelled hall hang with dark portrait one man give I good-evening but as i sit at the extreme end of the table i be out of the circle of the company they talk and laugh and it seem to I that i could hear woman 's voice at the other end meantime i be busy with my viand and no man ever punish a venison pie more heartily as i eat and drink i smile at the strangeness of my fortune -- to come thus straight from the wild sea and the company of outlaw into a place of silver and damask and satin coat and lace cravat and orderly wig the soft hum of gentlefolk ' speech be all around I those smooth virginian voice compare with which my scot tongue be as strident as a raven 's but as i listen i remembered ringan and lawrence and ah my silken friend think i little you know the judgment that be prepare some day soon unless god be kind there will be blood on the lace and the war-whoop in these pleasant chamber then a voice say louder than the rest dulcinea will sing to we she promise this morning in the garden at this there be a ripple of brava and presently i hear the tuning of a lute the low twanging go on for a little and suddenly i be seize with a presentiment i set down my tankard and wait with my heart in my mouth very clear and pure the voice rise as fresh as the morning song of bird there be youth in it and joy and pride -- joy of the fairness of the earth pride of beauty and race and strength _ my dear and only love _ it sing as it have sing before but then it have be a girl 's hope and now it be a woman 's certainty at the first note the past come back to I like yesterday i see the moorland gable in the rain i hear the swirl of the tempest i see the elfin face in the hood which have cheer the traveller on he way in that dim light i could not see the singer but i need no vision the strangeness of the thing clutch at my heart for here be the voice which have never be out of my ear singing again in a land far from the wet heather and the drive mist of home as i sit daze and dream i know that a great thing have befall I for I andrew garvald the prosaic trader come out of the darkness into this strange company the foundation of the world have be upset all my care and hope my gain and loss seem in that moment no better than dust love have come to I like a hurricane from now i have but the one ambition to hear that voice say to I and to mean it truly my dear and only love i know it be folly and a madman 's dream for i feel most deeply my common clay what have i to offer for the heart of that proud lady a dingy and battered merchant might as well enter a court of steel-clad hero and contend for the love of a queen but i be not downcast i do not think i even want to hope it be enough to know that so bright a thing be in the world for at one stroke my drab horizon seem to have broaden into the infinite heaven the song end in another chorus of brava bring twenty candle pompey my host call out and the great punch-bowl we will pledge my lady in the old beverley brew servant set on the table a massive silver dish into which sundry bottle of wine and spirit be pour a mass of cut fruit and sugar be add and the whole be set alight and leap almost to the ceiling in a blue flame colonel beverley with a long ladle fill the array of glass on a salver which the servant carry round to the guest large branch candelabrum have meantime be place on the table and in a glow of light we stand to we foot and honor the toast as i stand up and look to the table 's end i see the dark restless eye and the heavy blue jowl of governor nicholson he see I for i be alone at the bottom end and when we be seat he cry out to I -- what news of trade mr garvald you be a active packman for they tell I you be never off the road at the mention of my name every eye turn towards I and i feel rather than see the disfavor of the look no doubt they resent a storekeeper 's intrusion into well-bred company and some be there who have publicly curse I for a meddlesome upstart but i be not look they way but at the girl who sit on my host 's right hand and in whose dark eye i think i see a spark of recognition she be clothe in white satin and in she hair and bosom spring flower have be set she little hand play with the slim glass and she eye have all the happy freedom of childhood but now she be a grown woman with a woman 's pride and knowledge of power she exquisite slimness and grace amid the glow of silk and silver give she the air of a fairy-tale princess there be a grave man in black sit next she to whom she bent to speak then she look towards I again and smile with that witching mockery which have prick my temper in the canongate tolbooth the governor 's voice recall I from my dream how go the indian menace mr garvald he cry you must know and he turn to the company that we friend combine commerce with high policy and share my apprehension as to the safety of the dominion i could not tell whether he be mock at I or not i think he be for franci nicholson 's mood be as mutable as the tide in every word of he there lurk some sour irony the company take the speech for satire and many laugh one young gentleman who wear a purple coat and a splendid brocaded vest laugh very loud a merchant 's nerve be delicate thing he say as he finger he cravat i would have say ` like a woman 's ' have i not see this very day miss elspeth 's horsemanship and he bow to she very neatly now i be never fond of be quiz and in that company i could not endure it we have a say sir i say that the farmyard fowl do not fear the eagle the man who look grave just now be not those who live snugly in coast manor but the outland folk who have to keep they door with they own hand it be a rude speech and my hard voice and common clothes make it ruder the gentleman fire in a second and with blaze eye ask I if i intend a insult i be about to say that he could take what meaning he please when a older man break in with tush charle let the fellow alone you can not quarrel with a shopman i thank you george for a timely reminder say my gentleman and he turn away he head with a motion of sovereign contempt come come sir colonel beverley cry remember the sacred law of hospitality you be all my guest and you have a lady here whose bright eye should be a balm for controversy the governor have sit with he lip close and he eye rove the table he dearly love a quarrel and be mind to use I to bait those whom he like little what be all this talk about gentility he say a man be as good as he brain and he right arm and no better i be of the creed of the leveller who would have a man stand stark before he maker he could not have speak word better calculate to set the company against I my host look glum and disapprove and all the silken gentleman murmur the virginian cavalier have as pretty a notion of the worth of descent as any highland land-louper indeed to be honest i would have controvert the governor myself for i have ever hold that good blood be a mighty advantage to its possessor suddenly the grave man who sit by miss elspeth 's side speak up by this time i have remember that he be doctor jame blair the lately come commissary of the diocese of london who represent all that virginium have in the way of a bishop he have a shrewd kind face like a scot dominie and a mouth that shut as tight as the governor 's you tongue proclaim you my countryman sir he say do i hear right that you name be garvald of auchencairn he ask when i have assent of auchencairn or what be leave of it i say then gentleman he say address the company i can settle the dispute on the fact without question he excellency 's dogma mr garvald be of as good blood as any in scotland and that say he firmly mean that in the matter of birth he can hold up he head in any company in any christian land i do not think this speech make any man there look on I with greater favor but it enormously increase my own comfort i have never feel such a glow of gratitude as then fill my heart to the staid cleric that he be of near kin to miss elspeth make it tenfold sweeter i forget my old clothes and my uncouth look i forget too my irritation with the brocaded gentleman if she kin think I worthy i care not a bodle for the rest of mankind presently we rise from table and colonel beverley summon we to the green parlor where miss elspeth be brew a dish of chocolate then a newfangled luxury in the dominion i would fain have make my escape for if my appearance be unfit for a dining-hall it be a outrage in a lady 's withdrawing-room but doctor blair come forward to I and shake I warmly by the hand and be full of gossip about clydesdale from which apparently he have be absent these twenty year my niece bid I bring you to she he say she poor child be a happy exile but she have now and then a exile 's longing a scot tongue be pleasant in she ear so i perforce have to follow he into a fine room with a oaken floor whereon lay rich smyrna rug and the skin of wild beast from the wood there be a prodigious number of soft couch of flowered damask and little table inlay with foreign wood and jeweller 's work 'twas well enough for you fine gentleman in he buckled shoe and silk stocking to enter such a place but for myself in my coarse boot i seem like a colt in a flower garden the girl sit by a brazier of charcoal with the scarlet-coated negro at hand do she command she be so busy at the chocolate make that when she uncle say elspeth i have bring you mr garvald she have no hand to give I she look up and smile and go on with the business while i stand awkwardly by the scorn of the assure gentleman around I by and by she speak : you and i seem fate to meet in odd place first it be at carnwath in the rain and then at the cauldstaneslap in a motley company then i think it be in the tolbooth mr garvald when you be very gruff to you deliverer and now we be both exile and once more you step in like a bogle out of the night will you taste my chocolate she serve I first and i could see how little the favor be to the liking of she little retinue of courtier my silken gentleman whose name be gray break in on we abruptly what be this story sir of indian danger you be new to the country or you would know that it be the old cry of the landless and the lawless every out-at-elbows republican make it a stick to beat he majesty be you a republican mr garvald she ask now that i remember i have see you in whiggamore company why no i say i do not meddle with politics i be a merchant and be well content with any government that will protect my trade and my person a sudden perversity have take I to show myself at my most prosaic and unromantic i think it be the contrast with the glamour of those fine gentleman i have neither claim nor desire to be of they company and to she i could make no pretence he laugh scornfully yours be a noble cause he say but you may sleep peacefully in you bed sir be assure that there be a thousand gentleman of virginium whose sword will leap from they scabbard at a breath of peril on behalf of they woman and they home and these he add take snuff from a gold box be perhaps as potent spur to action as the whim of a busybody or the gain of a house-keeping trader i be determine not to be provoke so i answer nothing but miss elspeth open she eye and smile sweetly upon the speaker la mr gray i protest you be too severe busybody -- well it may be i have find mr garvald very busy in other folk ' affair but i do assure you he be no house-keeper i have see he in desperate conflict with savage man and even with he majesty 's redcoat if trouble ever come to virginia you will find he i doubt not a very bold moss-trooper it be the light laughing tone i remember well but now it do not vex I nothing that she could say or do could break the spell that have fall on my heart i pray it may be so say mr gray as he turn aside by this time the governor have come forward and i see that my presence be no longer desire i want to get back to shalah and solitude the cold bed on the shore would be warm for I by happy dream so i find my host and thank he for my entertainment he give I good-evening hastily as if he be glad to be rid of I at the hall door some one tap I on the shoulder and i turn to find my silken cavalier it seem you be a gentleman sir he say so i desire a word with you you manners at table deserve a whipping but i will condescend to forget they but a second offence shall be duly punish he speak in a high lisping voice which be the latest london importation i look he square in the eye he be maybe a inch taller than I a handsome fellow with a flush petulant face and a overweening pride in he arched brow by all mean let we understand each other i say i have no wish to quarrel with you go you way and i will go mine and there need be no trouble that be precisely the point say he i do not choose that you way should take you again to the side of miss elspeth blair if it do we shall quarrel it be the height of flattery at last i have find a fine gentleman who do I the honor to regard I with jealous eye i laugh loudly with delight he turn and stroll back to the company still laugh i pass from the house light my lantern and plunge into the sombre wood chapter xi gravity out of bed a week later i have a visit from old mercer he come to my house in the evening just after the closing of the store first of all he pay out to I the gold i have lose from my ship at accomac with all the gravity in the world as if it have be a ordinary merchant 's bargain then he produce some papers and put on big horn spectacles proceed to instruct I in they they be list fuller than those i have already get of man up and down the country whom lawrence trust some i have meet many i know of but two or three give I a start there be a planter in henricus who have treat I like dirt and some name from essex county that i do not expect especially there be several in jame town itself -- one a lawyer body i have think the obedient serf of the london merchant one the schoolmaster and another a drunken skipper of a river boat but what strike I most be the name of colonel beverley be you sure of all these i ask sure as death he say i be not say that they be all friend of yours mr garvald ye have trample on a good wheen toe since you come to these part but they be all man to ride the ford with if that should come which we ken of some of the man on the list be poor settler and it be we business to equip they with horse and gun that be to be my special duty -- that and the establish of means by which they could be summon quickly with the first mercer could help I for he have he hand on all the line of the smuggling business and there be a dozen port on the coast where he could land arm horse be a easy matter require only the dole out of money but the summon business be to be my particular care i could go about the country in my ordinary way of trade without exciting suspicion and my house be to be the rendezvous of every man on the list who want news or guidance can ye trust you man mercer ask and i reply that faulkner be as staunch as cold steel and that he have pick the other well let 's see you accommodation and the old fellow hop to he foot and be out of door before i could get the lantern mercer on a matter of this sort be a different be from the decayed landlord of the water-side tavern he spectacled eye peer everywhere and he shrewd sense judge instantly of a thing 's value he approve of the tobacco-shed as a store for arm for he could reach it from the river by a little-used road through the wood it be easy so to arrange the contents that a pass visitor could guess nothing and no one ever penetrate to its recess but faulkner and myself i summon faulkner to the conference and tell he he duty which he undertake with sober interest he be a dry stick from fife who speak seldom and work mightily faulkner attend to mercer 's consignment and i take once more to the road i have to arrange that arm from the coast or the river-side could be send inland and for this purpose i have a regiment of pack horse that deliver my own store as well i have to visit all the man on the list whom i do not know and a weary job it be i repeat again my toil of the first year and in the hot virginian summer ride the length and breadth of the land my own business prosper hugely and i buy on credit such a stock of tobacco as make I write my uncle for a fourth ship at the harvest sailing it seem a strange thing i remember to be bargaining for stuff which might never be deliver for by the autumn the dominion might be at death grip in those week i discover what kind of force lawrence lean on he who only know jame town and the rich planter know little of the true virginium there be old man who have long memory of indian fight and man in they prime who have rise with bacon and young man who have they eye turn to the unknown west there be new-comer from scotland and north ireland and a stout band of french protestant most of they gently bear who have seek freedom for they faith beyond the sway of king loui you can not picture a hardier or more spirited race than the fellow i thus recruit the forest settler who swing a axe all day for he livelihood could have fell the ordinary fine gentleman with one blow of he fist and they could shoot too with they rusty matchlock or clumsy snaphance in some few the motive be fear for they have see or hear of the tender mercy of the savage but in most i think it be a love of bold adventure and especially the craving to push the white man 's province beyond the narrow border of the tidewater if you say that this be something more than defense i claim that the only way to protect a country be to make sure of its environs what hope be there of peace if you frontier be the rim of a unknown forest my hardest task be to establish some method of send news to the outland dweller for this purpose i have to consort with queer folk shalah who have become my second shadow find here and there little indian camp from which he choose young man as messenger in one place i would get a settler with a canoe in another a woodman with a fast horse and in a third some lad who pride himself on he leg the rare country tavern be a help for most of they owner be in the secret the tidewater be a flat forest region so we could not light beacon as in a hilly land but by the aid of shalah 's woodcraft i concoct a set of mark on tree and dwelling which would speak a language to any initiate traveller the indian too have they own silent tongue by which they could send message over many league in a short space i never learn the trick of it though i try hard with shalah as interpreter for that you must have be suckle in a wigwam when i get back to jame town faulkner would report on he visitor and he seem to have have many rough fellow would ride up at the darken bring a line from mercer or more often a agree password and he have to satisfy they want and remember they news so far i have have no word from lawrence though mercer report that ringan be still send arm that tobacco-shed of mine would have make a brave explosion if some one have kindle it and indeed the thing more than once be near happen through a negro 's foolishness i spend all my evening when at home in make a map of the country i have get a rough chart from the surveyor-general and fill up such part as i know and over all i spread a network of line which mean my way of send news for instance to get to a man in essex county the word would be pass by middle plantation to york ferry thence in a indian 's canoe it would be carry to aird 's store on the mattaponey from which a woodman would take it across the swamp to a clump of hemlock there he would make certain mark and a long-legged lad from the rappahannock ride by daily to school would carry the tiding to the man i want and so forth over the habitable dominion i calculate that there be not more than a dozen of lawrence 's man who within three day could not get the summons and within five be at the proper rendezvous one evening i be surprise by a visit from colonel beverley he come openly on a fine bay horse with two mount negro as attendant i have part from he dryly and have be surprise to find that he be one of we but when i have talk with he a little it appear that he have have a big share in plan the whole business we mention no name but i gather that he know lawrence and be at least aware of ringan he warn I i remember to be on my guard against some of the young blood who might visit I to make mischief it be not that they know anything of we affair he say but that they have get a prejudice against yourself mr garvald they be foolish hot-headed lad very puff up by they pride of gentrice and i do not like the notion of they playing prank in that tobacco-shed i ask he a question which have long puzzle I why the natural defense of a country should be keep so secret the governor at any rate i say would approve and we be not ask the burgess for a single guinea yes but the governor would play a wild hand be the answer he would never permit the thing to go on quietly but would want to ride at the head of the man and the whole fat would be in the fire you must know mr garvald that politics run high in we virginium there be score of man who would see in we enterprise a second attempt like bacon 's and though they might approve of we aim would never hear of one of bacon 's folk serve with we i be never a bacon 's man for i be with berkeley in accomac and at the taking of jame town but i know the quality of the rough fellow that bacon lead and i want they all for this adventure besides who can deny that there be more in we plan than a defense against indian there be many who feel with I that virginium can never grow to the fullness of a nation so long as she be coop up in the tidewater new-comer arrive by every ship from england and press on into the wilderness but there can be no conquest of the wilderness till we have break the indian menace and push we frontier up to the hill -- ay and beyond they but tell that to the ordinary planter and he will assign you to the devil he fear these new-comer who be simple fellow that do not respect he grandeur he fear that some day they may control the assembly by they vote he want the tidewater to be he castle with porter and guard to hound away stranger man alive if you have try to put reason into some of they head you would despair of human nature let they get a hint of we preparation and there will be petition to council and a howl about treason and in a week you will be in gaol mr garvald so we must move cannily as you scot say that conversation make I wary and i get faulkner to keep a special guard on the place when i be absent at the worst he could summon mercer who would bring a rough crew from the water-side to he aid then once more i disappear into the wood in these day a new shalah reveal himself i think he have be watch I closely for the past month and slowly i have win he approval he show it by begin to talk as he lope by my side in we forest wanderings the man be like no indian i have ever see he be a senecan and so should have be on the side of the long house but it be plain that he be a outcast from he tribe and indeed from the whole indian brotherhood i could not fathom he for he seem among savage to be hold in deep respect and yet here he be the ally of the white man against he race he lean supple figure he passionless face and he high masterful air have a singular nobility in they to I he be never the servant scarcely even the companion for he seem like a be from another world who have a knowledge of thing hide from human ken in woodcraft he be a master beyond all thought of rivalry often when time do not press he would lead I clumsy as i be so that i could almost touch the muzzle of a crouching deer or lay a hand on a yellow panther before it slip like a live streak of light into the gloom he be a eery fellow too once i find he on a high river bank at sunset watch the red glow behind the blue shadowy forest there be blood in the west he say point like a prophet with he long arm there be blood in the hill which be flow to the water at the moon of stag it will flow and by the moon of wildfowl it will have stain the sea he have always the hill at the back of he head once when we catch a glimpse of they from a place far up the jame river he stand like a statue gaze at the thin line which hang like a cloud in the west i be upland breed and to I too the sight be a comfort as i stand beside he the _ manitou _ in the hill be call he say abruptly i wait a little but not long you too will follow brother to where the hawk wheel and the stream fall in vapor there we shall find death or love i know not which but it will be a great find the god have write it on my heart then he turn and stride away and i do not dare to question he there be that about he which stir my prosaic soul into a wild poetry till for the moment i see with he eye and hear strange voice in the tree apart from these uncanny mood he be the most faithful helper in my task without he i must have be a mere child i could not read the lore of the forest i could not have find my way as he find it through pathless place from he too i learn that we be not to make we preparation unwatched once as we be come from the rappahannock to the york he dart suddenly into the undergrowth below the chestnut my eye could see no clue on the path and suspect nothing i wait on he to return presently he come and beckon I to follow thirty yard into the coppice we find a man lie dead with a sharp stake hold he to the ground and a raw red mass where have be once he head that be you messenger brother he whisper the one who be to carry word from the mattaponey to the north see he have be dead for two sun he be one of the tame algonquin who dwell by aird 's store who do it i ask with a very sick stomach a cherokee some cunning one and he leave a sign to guide we he show I a fir-cone he have pick up from the path with the sharp end cut short and a thorn stick in the middle the thing disquiet I horribly for we have hear no word yet of any movement from the west and yet it seem that we enemy 's scout have come far down into the tidewater and know enough to single out for death a man we have enrol for service shalah slip off without a word and i be leave to continue my journey alone i will not pretend that i like the business i see a indian in every patch of shadow and look pretty often to my pistol before i reach the security of aird 's house four day later shalah appear at jame town they be three he say simply they come from the hill a moon ago and have be make bad trouble on the rappahannock i find they at the place above the beaver trap of the ooniche they return no more to they people after that we send out warning and keep a close eye on the different lodge of the algonquin but nothing happen till week later when the tragedy on the rapidan fall on we like a thunderclap \* \* \* \* \* all this time i have be too busy to go near the town or the horse-racing and holiday meeting where i might have see elspeth but i do not think she be ever many minute out of my mind indeed i be almost afraid of a meeting lest it should shatter the bright picture which comfort my solitude but one evening in June as i jogged home from middle plantation through the grove of walnut i come suddenly at the turn of the road on a party doctor jame blair mount on a stout flander cob hold the middle of the path and at he side ride the girl while two servant follow with travel valise i be upon they before i could rein up and the doctor cry a hearty good-day so i take my place by elspeth and with my heart beat wildly accompany they through the leafy avenue and by the green melon-bed in the clearing till we come out on the prospect of the river the doctor have a kindness for I and be eager to talk of he doings he be almost as great a moss-trooper as myself and with elspeth for company have visit near every settlement in the dominion education and christian privilege be he care and he deplore the backward state of the land i remember that even then he be full of he scheme for a virginian college to be establish at middle plantation and he write weekly letter to he english friend solicit countenance and fund of the happy issue of these hope and the great college which now stand at williamsburg there be no need to remind this generation but in that hour i think little of education the doctor boom away in he deep voice and i give he heedless answer my eye be ever wander to the slim figure at my side she wear a broad hat of straw i remember and she skirt and kirtle be of green the fairy ' color i think she be wearied with the sun for she speak little but she eye when they meet mine be kind that day i be not ashamed of my plain clothes or my homely face for they suit well with the road my great boot of untanned buckskin be red with dust i be bronze like a indian and the sun have take the color out of my old blue coat but i smack of travel and enterprise which to a honest heart be dearer than brocade also i have a notion that my very homeliness revive in she the memory of we common motherland i have nothing to say have acquire the woodland habit of silence and perhaps it be well my clumsy tongue would have only break the spell which the sunlit forest have weave around we as we reach my house a cavalier ride up with a bow and a splendid sweep of he hat 'twa my acquaintance mr gray come to greet the traveller elspeth give I she hand at parting and i have from the cavalier the finest glance of hate and jealousy which ever comfort the heart of a backward lover chapter xii a word at the harbour-side the next Sunday i be fool enough to go to church for doctor blair be announce to preach the sermon now i know very well what treatment i should get and that it take a stout fellow to front a conspiracy of scorn but i have get new courage from my travels so i put on my best suit of murrey-coloured cloth my stocking of cherry silk the gold buckle which have be my father 's my silk-embroidered waistcoat freshly-ironed ruffle and a new hat which have cost forty shilling in london town i wear my own hair for i never see the sense of a wig save for a bald man but i have it deftly tie i would have cut a great figure have there not be my bronzed and rugged face to give the lie to my finery it be a day of blistering heat the river lay still as a lagoon and the dusty red road of the town blaze like a furnace before i have get to the church door i be in a great sweat and stop in the porch to fan myself inside 'twa cool enough with a pleasant smell from the cedar pew but there be such a press of a congregation that many be leave stand i have a good place just below the choir where i see the governor 's carve chair with the governor 's self before it on he kneeling-cushion make pretence to pray round the choir rail and below the pulpit cluster many young exquisite for this be a sovereign place from which to show off they finery i could not get a sight of elspeth doctor blair preach we a fine sermon from the text _ my people shall dwell in a pleasant habitation and in sure dwelling and in quiet resting-place _ but he hearer be much disturb by the continual chatter of the fool about the choir rail before he have get to the prayer of chrysostom the exquisite be whisper like pigeon in a dovecot exchange snuff-box and ogle the woman so intolerable it grow that the doctor pause in he discourse and sternly rebuke they speaking of the laughter of fool which be as the crackling of thorn under a pot this silence they for a little but the noise break out during the last prayer and with the final word of the benediction my gentleman thrust they way through the congregation that they might be the first at the church door i have never see so unseemly a sight and for a moment i think that governor nicholson would call the halberdier and set they in the pillory he refrain though he face be dark with wrath and i judge that there would be some hard word say before the matter be finish i must tell you that during the last week i have be come more into favor with the prosperous family of the colony some one may have speak well of I perhaps the doctor or they may have see the justice of my way of trading anyhow i have a civil greet from several of the planter and a bow from they dame but no sooner be i in the porch than i see that trouble be afoot with the young blood they be draw up on both side the path bent on quiz I i sternly resolve to keep my temper but i foresaw that it would not be easy behold the shopman in he Sunday best say one i think that sawney wear bare knee on he dirty hill say another one point to my buckle pinchbeck out of the store he say ho ho such finery cry another see how he strut like a gamecock there be much ado when beggar ride say a third quote the proverb it be all so pitifully childish that it fail to provoke I i march down the path with a smile on my face which succeed in anger they one young fool a norton from malreward would have hustle I but i see mr gray hold he back no brawling here austin say my rival they be not all so discreet one of the kent of gracedieu try to trip I by thrust he cane between my leg but be ready for he and pull up quick and brace my knee i snap the thing short so that he be leave to dangle the ivory top then he do a wild thing he fling the remnant at my face so that the ragged end scratch my cheek when i turn wrathfully i find a circle of grin face it be queer how a wound however slight break a man 's temper and upset he calm resolve i think that then and there i would have be involve in a mellay have not a voice speak behind I mr garvald it say will you give I the favor of you arm we dine to-day with he excellency i turn to find elspeth and close behind she doctor blair and governor nicholson all my heat leave I and i have not another think for my tormentor in that torrid noon she look as cool and fragrant as a flower she clothes be simple compare with the planter ' dame but of a far more dainty fashion she wear i remember a gown of pale sprigged muslin with a blue kerchief about she shoulder and blue ribbon in she wide hat as she hand lay lightly on my arm i do not think of my triumph be wholly take up with the admiration of she grace the walk be all too short for the governor 's lodging be but a stone 's - throw distant when we part at the door i hope to find some of my mocker still linger for in that hour i think i could have fling any three of they into the river none be leave however and as i walk homewards i reflect very seriously that the baiting of andrew garvald could not endure for long pretty soon i must read these young gentry a lesson little though i want to embroil myself in quarrel i call they young in scorn but few of they i fancy be younger than myself next day as it happen i have business with mercer at the water-side and as i return along the harbor front i fall in with the receiver of custom who be generally call the captain of the castle from he station at point comfort he be a elderly fellow who have once be a puritan and still cherish a trace of the puritan mode of speech i have often have dealings with he and have find he honest though a thought truculent in manner he have a passion against all smuggler and buccaneer and in day to come be to do good service in rid accomac of these scourge he fear god and do not greatly fear much else he be sit on the low wall smoking a pipe and have by he a very singular gentleman never have i set eye on a more decorous merchant he be habit neatly and soberly in black with a fine white cravat and starched shirt-band he wear a plain bob-wig below a huge flat-brimmed hat and big blue spectacles shaded he eye he mouth be as precise as a lawyer 's and altogether he be a very whimsical dry fellow to find at a virginian port the receiver call I to he and ask after a matter which we have speak of before then he make I know to he companion who be a mr fairweather a merchant out of boston the lord have give thee a pleasant dwelling friend say the stranger snuffle a little through he nose from he speech i know that mr fairweather be of the sect of the quaker a peaceable race that virginia have long ill-treated the land be none so bad say the receiver but the people be a perverse generation they heart be set on vanity and puff up with pride i could wish mr fairweather that my line have fall among you folk in the north where i be tell true religion yet flourisheth here we have nothing but the cold harangue of the commissary who seeketh after the knowledge that perisheth rather than the wisdom which be eternal life patience friend say the stranger thee be not alone in thy cross the lord have many people up boston way but they be sore beset by the tribulation of zion on land there be war and rumor of war and on the sea the ship of the godly be snatch by every manner of ocean thief likewise we have dissension among ourselves and a constant strife with the froward human heart still be jerusalem troubled and there be no peace within she bulwark do the pirate afflict you much in the north ask the receiver with keen interest the stranger turn he large spectacles upon he and then look blandly at I suddenly i have a notion that i have see that turn of the neck and poise of the head before woe be I he cry in a stricken voice the french have two fair vessel of mine since march and a third be miss some say it run for a virginian port and i be here to seek it hear thee ever friend of a strange ship in the jame or the potomac there be many strange ship say the receiver for this dominion be the goal for all the wander merchantman of the earth what be the name of yours a square-rigged schooner out of bristol paint green with a white figurehead of a winged heathen god and the name the name be a strange one it be call _ the horn of diarmaid _ but i seek to prevail on the captain to change it to _ the horn of mercy _ no such name be know to I and the receiver shake he head but i will remember it and send you news i hope i do not betray my surprise but for all that it be stagger of all disguise and of all company this be the most comic and the most hazardous i stare across the river till i have master my countenance and when i look again at the two they be soberly discuss the harbor due of boston presently the receiver 's sloop arrive to carry he to point comfort he nod to I and take a affectionate farewell of the boston man i hear some good mouth-filling text exchange between they then when we be alone the quaker turn to I man andrew he say it be a good thing that i have a bible upbringe i can manage the part fine but i flounder among the ` thee ' and ` thous ' i would be the better of a drink to wash my mouth of the accursed pronoun will you be alone to-night about the darkening then i 'll call in to see you for i have much to tell you \* \* \* \* \* that evening about nine the quaker slip into my room how about that tobacco-shed he ask be it well guard faulkner and one of the man sleep above it and there be a couple of fierce dog chained at the door unless they know the stranger he will be apt to lose the seat of he breeches the quaker nod well pleased that be well for i hear word in the town that to-night you might have a visitor or two then he walk to a stand of arm on the wall and take down a small sword which he handle lovingly a fair weapon andrew say he my new sect forbid I to wear a blade but i think i 'll keep this handy beside I in the chimney corner then he give I the news lawrence have be far inland with the monacan and have bring back disquieting tale the whole nation of the cherokee along the line of the mountain be unquiet old family feud have be patch up and there be a come and go of messenger from chickamauga to the potomac well we be ready for they i say and i tell he the full story of we preparation ay but that be not all i would not give much for what the cherokee and the tuscarora could do there might be some blood shed and a good few blaze roof-tree in the back country but no indian raid would stand against we lad but i have a notion -- maybe it be only a notion though lawrence be half inclined to it himself -- that there be more in this business than a raid from the hill there be something stir in the west away in the part that no white man have ever travel from what i learn there be a bigger brain than a indian 's behind it the french i ask maybe but maybe not what be to hinder a blackguard like cosh with ten time cosh 's mind from get into the indian council and turn the whole west loose on the tidewater have you any proof i ask much alarmed little at present but one thing i know there be a man among the tribe that speak english great god what a villain i cry but how do you know just this way the monacan put a arrow through the neck of a young brave and they find this in he belt he lay before I a bit of a print bible leaf about half be blank paper for it come at the end of the book of revelation on the blank part some sign have be make in rude ink which i could not understand but this be no proof i say it be only a relic from some plunder settlement can you read those mark i can not nor could the monacan but look at the print part i look again and see that some one have very carefully underline certain word these make a sentence and read _ john servant of the prophecy be at hand _ the underline may have be do long ago i hazard no the ink be not a month old he say and i could do nothing but gape well what be you plan i say at last none but i would give my right hand to know what be behind the hill that be we weakness andrew we have to wait here and since we do not know the full peril we can not fully prepare there may be mischief afoot which would rouse every sleepy planter out of bed and turn the tidewater into a armed camp but we know nothing if we have only a scout -- what about shalah i ask can you spare he he reply and i know i could not i see nothing for it i say but to wait till we be ready and then to make a reconnaissance trust to be in time this be the first week of July in another fortnight every man on we list will be arm and every line of communication lay then be we chance to make a bid for news he nod and at that moment come the growl of dog from the shed instantly he face lose its heavy preoccupation and under he quaker 's mask become the mischievous countenance of a boy that be you friend he say now for a merry meeting in the sultry weather i have leave open window and door and every sound come clear from the outside i hear the scuffling of foot and some confused talk and presently there stumble into my house half a dozen wild-looking figure they blink in the lamplight and one beg to know if mr garbled be at home all have deck themselves for this play in what they fancy be the dress of pirate -- scarlet sash and napkin or turban round they head big boot and mask over they eye i do not recognize a face but i be pretty clear that mr gray be not of the number and i be glad for the matter between he and I be too serious for this tomfoolery all have be drink and one at least be very drunk he stumble across the floor and all but fall on ringan in he chair hullo old square-toe he hiccup what the devil be you friend thee be shaky on thy leg say ringan in a mild voice it be well for thee to be in bed bed cry the roysterer no bed for I this night where be that damnable scot packman i rise very quietly and light another lamp then i shut the window and close the shutter here i be i say very much at you service gentleman one or two of the sober one look a little embarrassed but the leader who i guess be the youth from gracedieu be brave enough the gentleman of virginium he say loudly be resolve that the man garvald be a offence to the dominion have summon the free companion to give he a lesson if he will sign a bond to leave the country within a month we be instruct to be merciful if not we have here tar and feather and sundry other adornment and to-morrow 's morn will behold a pretty sight choose you scot swine in the excess of he zeal he smash with the handle of he sword a clock i have but lately get from glasgow ringan sign to I to keep my temper he

desire effect of anger they curse you money one cry you damned trader think that you can buy a gentleman take that for you insult and he aim a blow with the flat of he sword which ringan easily parry i have think thee a pirate say the mild quaker but thee tell I thee be a gentleman hold you peace square-toe cry the leader and let 's get to business but if ye be gentlefolk plead ringan ye will grant a fair field i be no fighter but i will stand by my friend i who have say nothing now break in it be a warm evening for sword-play but if it be you humor so be it this seem to they hugely comic la cry one sawney with a sword and he pluck forth he own blade and bent it on the floor ringan smile gently thee must grant I the first favor he say for i be the challenger if that be the right word of the carnally mind and stand up he pick up the blade from beside he and bow to the leader from gracedieu nothing loath he engage and the other stand back expect a high fiasco they see it ringan 's sword play like lightning round the wretched youth it twitch the blade from he grasp and force he back with a very white face to the door in less than a minute it seem he be there and as he yield so do the door and he disappear into the night he do not return so i know that ringan must have speak a word to faulkner now for the next bloody-minded pirate cry ringan and the next with a very wry face stand up one of the other would have join in but cry for shame a fair field i beat down he sword the next take about the same time to reach the door and disappear into the darkness and the third about half as long of the remain three one sulkily decline to draw and the other two be over drunk for anything they sit on the floor and sing a loose song it seem friend say the quaker that ye be more ready with word than with deed i pray thee -- this to the sober one -- take off these garment of sin we be peaceful trader and can not abide the thought of pirate he take they off sash breeches jerkin turban and all and stand up in he shirt the other two i strip myself and so drunk be they that they enter into the spirit of the thing and themselves tear at the button then with ringan 's sword behind they the three march out of door there we find they companion strip and sullen with faulkner and the man to guard they we make up neat parcel of they clothes and i extort they name all except one who be too far go in drink to-morrow gentleman i say i will send back you belongings together with the tar and feather which you may find useful some other day the night be mild and a gentle trot will keep you from take chill i should recommend hurry for in five minute the dog will be loose a pleasant journey to you they move off and then halt and apparently be for return but they think better of it and presently they be all six of they race and stumble down the hill in they shift the quaker stretch he leg and light a pipe be it not a scurvy trick of fate he observe to the ceiling that these poor lad should come here for a night 's fooling and find the best sword in the five sea chapter xiii i stumble into a great folly i never breathe a word about the night 's doings nor for diver reason do ringan but the story get about and the young fool be the laughing-stock of the place but there be a good deal of wrath too that a trader should have presume so far and i feel that thing be gather to a crisis with I unless i be to suffer endlessly these petty vexation i must find a bold stroke to end they it annoy I that when so many grave issue be in the balance i should have these trouble as if a man should be devour by midge when wait on a desperate combat the crisis come sooner than i look for there be to be a great horse-racing at middle plantation the next Monday which i have half a mind to attend for though i care nothing for the sport it would give I a chance of see some of we fellow from the york river one morning i meet elspeth in the street of jame town and she cry laughingly that she look to see I at the race after that i have no choice but go so on the Monday morning i dress myself with care mount my best horse and ride to the gathering 'twa a pretty sight to see the spacious green meadow now a little yellowing with the summer heat set in the girdle of dark and leafy forest i count over forty chariot which have bring the rank of the countryside each with its liveried servant and its complement of outrider the fringe of the course blaze with lady ' finery and a tent have be set up with a wide awning from which the fashionable could watch the sport on the edge of the wood a multitude of horse be picket and there be booth that sell food and drink merry-go-round and fiddler and a immense concourse of every condition of folk black slave and water-side indian squatter from the wood farmer from all the valley and the scum and ruck of the plantation i find some of my friend and settle my business with they but my eye be always stray to the green awning where i know that elspeth sit i be no judge of racing but i love the aspect of sleek slim horse and i could applaud a skill in which i have no share i can keep my seat on most four-legged beast but my horsemanship be a clumsy rough-and-ready affair very different from the effortless grace of you true cavalier mr gray 's prowess especially fill I with awe he would leap a ugly fence without move a inch in he saddle and both in skill and the quality of he mount he be a easy victor the sight of such accomplishment depress my pride and i do not think i would have venture near the tent have it not be for the governor he see I on the fringe of the crowd and call I to he what bashfulness have take you to-day sir he cry that be not like you usual there be twenty pretty dame here who pine for a word from you i see he purpose well enough he love to make mischief and know that the sight of I among the virginian gentry would infuriate my unfriend but i take he at he word and elbow my way into the enclosure then i wish to heaven i have stay at home i get insolent glance from the youth and the cold shoulder from the lady elspeth smile when she see I but turn the next second to gossip with she little court she be a devout lover of horse and have eye for nothing but the race she cheek be flush and it be pretty to watch she excitement how she hang breathless on the movement of the field and clap she hand at a brave finish pretty indeed but exasperate to one who have no part in that pleasant company i stand gloomily by the rail at the edge of the lady ' awning acutely conscious of my loneliness presently mr gray whose racing be over come to we and have a favor pin in he coat by elspeth 's finger he be evidently high in she good grace for he sit down by she and talk gleefully i could not but admire he handsome eager face and admit with a bitter grudge that you would look long to find a comelier pair all this do not soothe my temper and after a hour of it i be in desperate ill-humour with the world i have just reach the conclusion that i have have as much as i want when i hear elspeth 's voice call I come hither mr garvald she say we have a dispute which a third must settle i favor the cherry and mr gray fancy the blue but i maintain that blue crowd cherry unfairly at the corner use you eye sir at the next turn i use my eye which be very sharp and have no doubt of it that be a matter for the master of the course say mr gray will you uphold you view before he sir i say that i know too little of the sport to be of much weight as a witness to this he say nothing but offer to wager with I on the result of the race which be now all but end or no say he i should not ask you that a trader be careful of he guinea elspeth do not hear be intent on other thing and i merely shrug my shoulder though my finger itch for the gentleman 's ear in a little the racing cease and the lady make ready to leave doctor blair appear protest that the place be not for he cloth and give elspeth he arm to escort she to he coach she cry a merry good-day to we and remind mr gray that he have promise to sup with they on the morrow when she have go i spy a lace scarf which she have forget and pick it up to restore it this do not please the other he snatch it from I and when i propose to follow trip I deftly and send I sprawl among the stool as i pick myself up i see he run to overtake the blair this time there be no discreet girl to turn the edge of my fury all the gibe and annoyance of the past month rush into my mind and set my head throb i be angry but very cool with it all for i see that the matter have now go too far for tolerance unless i be to be the butt of virginium i must assert my manhood i nick the dust from my coat and walk quietly to where mr gray be stand amid a knot of he friend who talk of the race and they loss and gain he see I come and say something which make they form a stare alley down which i stroll he keep regard I with bright watchful eye i have be very patient sir i say but there be a limit to what a man may endure from a mannerless fool and i give he a hearty slap on the face instantly there be a dead silence in which the sound seem to linger intolerably he have grow very white and he eye be wicked i be oblige to you sir he say you be some kind of ragged gentleman so no doubt you will give I satisfaction when and where you please i say sedately will you name you friend now he ask these matter demand quick settlement to whom be i to turn i know nobody of the better class who would act for I for a moment i thought of colonel beverley but he age and dignity be too great to bring he into this squabble of youth then a notion strike I if you will send you friend to my man john faulkner he will make all arrangement he be to be find any day in my shop with this defiance i walk nonchalantly out of the dumbfoundered group find my horse and ride homewards my coolness do not last many minute and long ere i have reach jame town i be a prey to dark foreboding here be i a peaceful trader who desire nothing more than to live in amity with all man involve in a bloody strife i have seek it and yet it have be none of my seek i have graver thought to occupy my mind than the punctilio of idle youth and yet i do not see how the thing could have be shun it be my hard fate to come athwart a obstacle which could not be circumvent but must be break no friend could help I in the business not ringan nor the governor nor colonel beverley it be my own affair which i must go through with alone i feel as solitary as a pelican remember i be not fight for any whimsy about honor nor even for the love of elspeth i have openly provoke gray because the hostility of the young gentry have become a intolerable nuisance in my daily life so with such pedestrian reason in my mind i could have none of the heady enthusiasm of passion i want he and he kind clear out of my way like a noisome insect but i have no flaming hatred of he to give I heart the consequence be that i become a prey to dismal fear that bravery which know no ebb be never mine indeed i be by nature timorous for my fancy be quick and i see with horrid clearness the incident of a peril only a shamefaced conscience hold I true so that though i have often do temerarious deed it have always be because i fear shame more than the risk and my knee have ever be knock together and my lip dry with fright i try to think soberly over the future but could get no conclusion save that i would not do murder my conscience be pretty bad about the whole business i be engage in the kind of silly conflict which i have be breed to abhor i have none of the common gentleman 's notion about honor and i know that if by any miracle i slew gray i should be guilty in my own eye of murder i would not risk the guilt if god have determine that i should perish before my time then perish i must this despair bring I a miserable kind of comfort when i reach home i go straight to faulkner i have quarrel to-day with a gentleman john and have promise he satisfaction you must act for I in the affair some one will come to see you this evening and the meeting have better be at dawn to-morrow he open he eye very wide who be it then he ask mr charles gray of gray 's hundred i reply this make he whistle low he be a fine swordsman he say i never hear there be any better in the dominion you 'll be to fight with sword i think hard for a minute i be the challenge and so have the choice of weapon no say i you be to appoint pistol for it be my right at this faulkner slowly grin it be a new weapon for these affair what if they 'll not accept but it be no business of mine and i 'll remember you wish and the strange fellow turn again to he account i spend the evening look over my papers and make various appointment in case i do not survive the morrow happily the work i have undertake for lawrence be all but finish and of my ordinary business faulkner know as much as myself i write a letter to uncle andrew tell he frankly the situation that he might know how little choice i have it be a cold-blooded job make these disposition and i hope never to have the like to do again presently i hear voice outside and faulkner come to the door with mr george mason the younger of thornby who pass for the chief buck in virginium he give I a cold bow i have settle everything with this gentleman but i would beg of you sir to reconsider you choice of arm my friend will doubtless be ready enough to humor you but you have pick a barbarous weapon for christian use it be my only means of defense i say then you stick to you decision assuredly say i and with a shrug of the shoulder he depart i do not attempt to sleep faulkner tell I that we be to meet the next morning half a hour after sunrise at a place in the forest a mile distant each man be to fire one shot but two pistol be allow in case of a misfire all that night by the light of a lamp i get my weapon ready i summon to my recollection all the knowledge i have acquire and make sure that nothing should be lack so far as human skill would go i have another pistol besides the one i call elspeth also make in glasgow but a thought longer in the barrel for this occasion i neglect cartouch and load in the old way i test my bullet time and again and weigh out the powder as if it have be gold dust it be short range so i make my charge small i try my old device of wrap each bullet in soft wool smear with beeswax all this pass the midnight hour and then i lay down for a little rest but not for sleep i be glad when faulkner summon I half a hour before sunrise i remember that i bathed head and shoulder in cold water and very carefully dress myself in my best clothes my pistol lay in the box which faulkner carry i drink a glass of wine and as we leave i take a long look at the place i have create and the river now light with the first shaft of morning i wonder incuriously if i should ever see it again my tremor have all go by now and i be in a mood of cold thoughtless despair the earth have never look so bright as we ride through the green aisle all fill with the happy song of bird often on such a morning i have start on a journey with my heart grateful for the goodness of the world could i but keep the road i should come in time to the swampy bank of the york and then would follow the chestnut forest : and the wide marsh towards the rappahannock and everywhere i should meet friendly human face and then at night i should eat a hunter 's meal below the star but that be all past and i be move towards death in a foolish strife in which i have no heart and where i could find no honor i think i laugh aloud at my exceed folly we turn from the path into a alley which lead to a open space on the edge of a derelict clearing there to my surprise i find a considerable company assemble gray be there with he second and a dozen or more of he companion stand back in the shadow of the tree the young blood of virginium have come out to see the trader punish during the few minute while the seconds be busy pacing the course and arrange for the signal i have no cognizance of the world around I i stand with abstracted eye watch a gray squirrel in one of the branch and try to recall a line i have forget in a song there seem to be two andrew garvald that morning one fill with a immense careless peace and the other a weak creature who have live so long ago as to be forget i start when faulkner come to place I and follow he without a word but as i stand up and see gray twenty pace off turn up he wristband and toss he coat to a friend i realize the business i have come on a great flood of light be roll down the forest aisle but it be so clear and pure that it do not dazzle i remember think in that moment how intolerable have become the singing of bird i deadened my heart to memory take my courage in both hand and force myself to the ordeal for it be a ordeal to face powder if you have not a dreg of passion in you and be resolve to make no return i be left-handed and so in front my opponent i expose my heart if gray be the marksman i think he now be he chance for revenge my wit be calm now and my sens very clear i hear a man say slowly that he would count three and then drop he kerchief and at the drop we should fire we eye be on he as he lift he hand and slowly begin -- one -- two -- then i look away for the signal matter nothing to I i suddenly catch gray 's eye and something whistle past my ear cut the lobe and shear off a lock of hair i do not heed it what fill my mind be the sight of my enemy very white and draw in the face hold a smoking pistol and stare at I i empty my pistol among the tree-top no one move gray continue to stare lean a little forward with he lip work then i take from faulkner my second pistol my voice come out of my throat funnily crack as if from long disuse mr gray i cry i would not have you think that i can not shoot forty yard from I on the edge of the covert a turkey stand with its foolish inquisitive head the sound of the shot have bring the bird out to see what be go on it stand motionless blinking its eye the very mark i desire i point to it with my right hand fling forward my pistol and fire it roll over as dead as stone and faulkner walk to pick it up he put back my pistol in the box and we turn to seek the horse then gray come up to I he mouth be hard-set but the line be not of pride i see that he too have be desperately afraid and i rejoice that other beside I have be at breaking-point we quarrel be at a end sir he say and he voice be hesitate why yes i say it be never my seek though i give the offence i have behave like a cub sir and he speak loud so that all could hear you have teach I a lesson in gentility will you give I you hand i could find no word and dumbly hold out my right hand nay sir he say the other the one that hold the trigger i count it a privilege to hold the hand of a brave man i have be try too hard and be all but prove my bravery by weep like a bairn chapter xiv a wild wager that July morning in the forest give I if not popularity at any rate peace i have make good my position henceforth the word go out that i be to be let alone some of the young man indeed show sign of affect my society include that mr kent of gracedieu who have be strip by ringan the other treat I with courtesy and i reply with my best manners most of they be of a different world to mine and we could not mix so 'twas right that we deportment should be that of two dissimilar but amiable nation bow to each other across a frontier all this be a great ease but it bring one rueful consequence elspeth grow cold to I woman i suppose have to condescend and protect and pity when i be a outcast she be ready to shelter I but now that i be in some degree of favor with other the need for this be go and she see I without illusion in all my angularity and roughness she must have hear of the duel and jump to the conclusion that the quarrel have be about herself which be not the truth the notion irk she pride that she name should ever be bring into the brawl of man when i pass she in the street she greet I coldly and all friendliness have go out of she eye \* \* \* \* \* my day be so busy that i have little leisure for brooding but at odd moment i would fall into a deep melancholy she have live so constantly in my thought that without she no project charm I what matter wealth or fame i think if she do not approve what avail my strive if she be not to share in the reward i be in this mood when i be bid by doctor blair to sup at he house i go thither in much trepidation for i fear a great company in which i might have no chance of a word from she but i find only the governor who be in a black humor and dispute every word that fall from the doctor 's mouth this turn the meal into one long wrangle in which the high fundamental of government in church and state be debate by two choleric gentleman the girl and i have no share in the conversation indeed we be clearly out of place : so she could not refuse when i propose a walk in the garden the place be all cool and dewy after the scorching day and the bell of the flower make the air heavy with fragrance somewhere near a man be play on the flageolet a light pretty tune which set she foot trip i ask she bluntly wherein i have offend offended she cry why should i take offence i see you once in a blue moon you flatter yourself strangely mr garvald if you think you be ever in my thought you be never out of mine i say dismally at this she laugh something of the old elfin laughter which i have hear on the wet moor a compliment she cry to be mix up eternally with the weight of tobacco and the price of flemish lace you be grow a very pretty courtier sir i be no courtier i say i think brave thing of you though i have not the word to fit they but one thing i will say to you since ever you sing to the boy that once be I you spell have be on my soul and when i see you again three month back that spell be change from the whim of youth to what man call love oh i know well there be no hope for I i be not fit to tie you shoe-latch but you have make a fire in my cold life and you will pardon I if i dare warm my hand the sun be brighter because of you and the flower fairer and the bird ' song sweeter grant I this little boon that i may think of you have no fear that i will pester you with attention no priest ever serve he goddess with a remoter reverence than mine for you she stop in a alley of rose and look I in the face in the dusk i could not see she eye fine word she say yet i hear that you have be wrangle over I with mr charle gray and exchange pistol shot be that you reverence in a sentence i tell she the truth they force my back to the wall i say and there be no other way i have never utter you name to a living soul be it my fancy that when she speak again there be a faint accent of disappointment you be a uncomfortable be mr garvald it seem you be predestine to keep virginium from sloth for myself i be for the rose and the old quiet way she pluck two flower one white and one of deepest crimson i pardon you she say and for token i will give you a rise it be red for that be you turbulent color the white flower of peace shall be mine i take the gift and lay it in my bosom \* \* \* \* \* two day later it be a Monday i dine with he excellency at the governor 's house at middle plantation the place have be build new for my lord culpepper since the old mansion at jame town have be burn in bacon 's rise the company be mainly of young man but three lady -- the mistress of arlington and cobwell manor and elspeth in a new saffron gown -- vary with they lace the rich coat of the man i be pleasantly welcome by everybody gray come forward and greet I very quiet and civil and i sit by he throughout the meal the governor be in high good humor and presently have the whole company in the same mood of they all elspeth be the merriest she have the quickest wit and the deftest skill in mimicry and there be that in she laughter which would infect the glummest that very day i have finish my preparation the train be now lay and the man be ready and a word from lawrence would line the west with musket but i have none of the satisfaction of a complete work it be bear in upon I that we task be scarcely begin and that the peril that threaten we be far darker than we have dream ringan 's tale of a white leader among the tribe be always in my head the hall where we sit be line with portrait of man who have bear rule in virginium there be captain john smith trim-bearded and bronzed and argall and dale grave and soldierly there be franci wyat with the scar get in indian war there hang the mean and sallow countenance of sir john harvey there too be berkeley with he high complexion and he love-lock the great gentleman of a vanish age and the gross rotundity of culpepper and the furtive eye of my lord howard who be even now the reign governor there be a noble picture of king charle the second who alone of monarch be represent soft-footed lackey carry viand and wine and the table be a mingling of silver and rose the afternoon light come soft through the trellis and you could not have look for a fairer picture of settle ease yet i have that in my mind which shatter the picture we be feast like the old citizen of bury pompeius with the lava even now perhaps flow hot from the mountain i look at the paint face on the wall and wonder which i would summon to we aid if i could call man from the dead smith i think would be best but i reflect uneasily that smith would never have let thing come to such a pass at the first hint of danger he would have be off to the west to scotch it in the egg i be so fill with sober reflection that i talk little but there be no need of I youth and beauty reign and the governor be as gay as the youngest many ask I to take wine with they and the compliment pleased I there be singing likewise -- sir william davenant 's song to he mistress and a cavalier rant or two and a throat ditty of the sea and elspeth sing very sweetly the old air of greensleeve we drink all the toast of fashion -- he majesty of england confusion to the french the health of virginium rich harvest full cellar and pretty dame presently when we have wax very cheerful and wine have rise to several young head the governor call on we to brim we glass be it known gentleman and you fair lady he cry that to-day be a more auspicious occasion than any royal festival or christian holy day to-day be dulcinea 's birthday i summon you to drink to the flower of the west the brightest gem in virginium 's coronal at that we be all on we foot the gentleman snap the stem of they glass to honor the sacredness of the toast and there be such a shouting and pledge as might well have turn a girl 's head elspeth sit still and smile the mockery have go out of she eye and i think they be wet no queen have ever a nobler salutation and my heart warm to the generous company whatever its fault it do due homage to beauty and youth governor franci be again on he foot i have a birthday gift for the fair one you must know that once at whitehall i play at carte with my lord culpepper and the stake on he part be one-sixth portion of that virginian territory which be he freehold i win and my lord convey the grant to I in a deed properly attest by the attorney we call the place the northern neck and ` tis all the land between the rappahannock and the potomac as far west as the sunset it be undivided but my lord stipulate that my portion should lie from the mountain westward what good be such a estate to a aging bachelor like I who can never visit it but ` tis a fine inheritance for youth and i propose to convey it to dulcinea as a birthday gift some day i doubt not ` twill be the eden of america at this there be a great cry out and some laughter which die away when it appear that the governor speak in all seriousness i make one condition he go on twenty year back there be a old hunter call studd who penetrate the mountain he travel to the head-water of the rapidan and pierce the hill by a pass which he christen clearwater gap he climb the highest mountain in those part and build a cairn on the summit in which he hide a powder-horn with a write within he be the first to make the journey and none have follow he the man be dead now but he tell I the tale and i will pledge my honor that it be true it be for dulcinea to choose a champion to follow studd 's path and bring back he powder-horn on the day i receive it she take sasine of she heritage which of you gallant offer for the venture to this day i do not know what be franci nicholson 's motive he wish the mountain cross but he can not have expect to meet a pathfinder among the youth of the tidewater i think it be the whim of the moment he would endow elspeth and at the same time test she cavalier to the ordinary man it seem the craziest folly studd have be a wild fellow half indian in blood and wholly indian in habit and for another to travel fifty mile into the heart of the desert be to embrace destruction the company sit very silent elspeth with a blush cheek turn troubled eye on the speaker as for I i have find the chance i want i be on my foot in a second i will go i say and i have hardly speak when gray be beside I cry and i still the company sit silent 'twa as if the shadow of a sterner life have come over they young gaiety elspeth do not look at I but sit with cast-down eye pluck feverishly at a rise the governor laugh out loud brave heart he cry will you travel together i look at gray that can hardly be he say well we must spin for it say nicholson take a guinea from he pocket royal for mr garvald quarter for mr gray he cry as he spin it it fall royal we have both be stand and gray now bow to I and sit down he face be very pale and he lip tightly shut the governor give a last toast let we drink he call to dulcinea 's champion and the fortune of he journey at that there be such applause you might have think I the best-liked man in the dominion i look at elspeth but she avert she eye as we leave the table i step beside gray you must come with I i whisper nay do not refuse when you know all you will come gladly and i appoint a meeting on the next day at the half-way tavern i get to my house at the darken and find ringan wait for I this time he have not seek a disguise but he keep he fiery head cover with a broad hat and the collar of he seaman 's coat envelop he lower face to a passer-by in the dusk he must have seem a ordinary ship 's captain stretch he leg on land he ask for food and drink and i observe that he manner be very grave be thing in train andrew he ask i tell he to the last stirrup buckle it be as well say he for the trouble have begin then he tell I a horrid tale the rapidan be a stream in the north of the dominion flow into the rappahannock on its south bank two year past a family of french folk -- d'aubigny be they name -- have make a home in a meadow by that stream and build a house and a strong stockade for they be in dangerous nearness to the hill and have no neighbor within forty mile they be gentlefolk of some substance and have carve out of the wilderness a very pretty manor with orchard and flower garden i have never be to the place but i have hear the praise of it from dweller on the rappahannock no indian come near they and there they abide happy in they solitude -- a husband and wife three little child two french servant and a dozen negro a week ago tragedy have come like a thunderbolt at night the stockade be break and the family wake from sleep to hear the war-whoop and see by the light of they blaze byre a band of paint savage it seem that no resistance be possible and they be butcher like sheep the babe be pierce with stake the grown folk be scalp and tortured and by sunrise in that peaceful clearing there be nothing but blood-stained ash word have come down the rappahannock ringan say he have hear it in accomac and have sail to sabine to make sure man have ride out from stafford county and find no more than a child 's toy and some bloody garment who do it i ask with fury rise in my heart it be cherokee work there be nothing strange in it except that such a deed should have be dare but it mean the beginning of we business d'you think the stafford folk will sleep in they bed after that and that be precisely what perplex I the governor will be bind to send a expedition against the murderer and they 'll not be easy find but while the militia be route about on the rapidan what hinder the big invasion to come down the jame or the chickahominy or the pamunkey or the mattaponey and find a defenceless tidewater as i see it there be deep guile in this business a cherokee murder be nothing out of the way but these blackguard be not kill for mere pleasure as i

cherokee party in the north the enemy will be hammer at you gate what enemy he ask i do not know and that be what i go to find out then i tell he all i have gather about the unknown force in the hill and the apparent strategy of a campaign which be beyond a indian 's wit there be a white man at the back of it i say a white man who talk in bible word and be mad for devastation he face have grow very solemn he go to a bureau unlock it and take from a drawer a bit of paper which he toss to I i have that a week past to-morrow my servant get it from a indian in the wood it be a dirty scrap fold like a letter and bear the superscription _ to the man franci nicholson presently governor in virginia _ i open it and read : -- _ thou comest to I with a sword and with a spear and with a shield : but i come to thee in the name of the lord of host the god of the army of israel whom thou hast defy _ there i cry there be proof of my fear what kind of indian send a message like that trust I sir there be a far more hellish mischief brewing than any man wot of it look not unlike it he say grimly now let 's hear what you propose i can have my man at they post by the week end we will string they out along the frontier and hold especially the river valley if invasion come then at any rate the tidewater will get early news of it meantime i and my friend look for studd 's powder-horn with a mind to confirm you birthday gift to miss elspeth blair will push on to the hill and learn what be to be learn there you will never come back he say tartly a indian stake and a bloody head will be the end of all of you maybe i say though i have man with I that can play the indian game but if in ten day ' time from now you get no word then you can fear the worst and set you militia go i have a service of post which will carry news to you as quick as a carrier pigeon whatever we learn you shall hear of without delay and you can make you disposition accordingly if the devil find we first then get in touch with my man at frew 's homestead on the south fork river for that will be the headquarters of the frontier army who will be in command there when you be gallivant in the hill he ask one whose name have better not be speak he lie under sentence of death by virginian law but believe I he be a honest soul and a good patriot and he be the one man bear to lead these outland troops he smile he christian name be richard maybe i think i know you outlaw but let it pass i ask no name in these bad time we can not afford to despise any man 's aid he pull out a chart of virginium and i mark for he we post and indicate the line of my own journey have you ever be in the war mr garvald he ask i tell he no well you have a very pretty natural gift for the military art you man will screen the frontier line and behind that screen i will get we militia force in order while meantime you be reconnoitr the enemy it be a very fair piece of strategy but i be mortally certain you yourself will never come back the odd thing be that at that moment i do not fear for myself i have live so long with my scheme that i have come to look upon it almost like a trading venture in which one calculate risk and gain on paper and think no more of it i have none of the black fright which i have suffer before my meeting with gray happily though a young man 's thought may be long he fancy take short view i be far more concerned with what might happen in my absence in the tidewater than with we fate in the hill it be a gamble i say but the stake be noble and i have a private pride in its success also the goad of certain bright eye he say smile little i think when i make that offer last night i be set so desperate a business in train there be a good providence in that for now we can give out that you be go on a madcap ploy and there will be no sleepless night in the tidewater i must keep they soul easy for once they be scare there will be such a spate of letter to new york as will weaken the courage of we northern brethren for the militia i will give the excuse of the french menace the good folk will laugh at I for it but they will not take fright god 's truth but it be a devilish tangle i could wish i have you part sir and be free to ride out on a gallant venture here i have none of the zest of war but only a thousand care and the carking task of soothing fool we speak of many thing and i give he a full account of the composition and strength of we levy when i leave he pay I a compliment which come from so sardonic a soul give I peculiar comfort i have see something of man and city sir he say and i know well the foible and the strength of my countryman but i have never meet you equal for cold persistence you be a trader and have turn war into a trading venture i do believe that when you be at you last gasp you will be find calmly cast up you account with life and i think you will find a balance on the right side god speed you mr garvald i love you sober folly \* \* \* \* \* i have scarcely leave he when i meet a servant of the blair who hand I a letter 'twa from elspeth -- the first she have ever write I i tear it open and find a very disquieting epistle clearly she have write it in a white heat of feeling _ you speak finely of reverence _ she write _ and how you have never name my name to a mortal soul but to-night you have put I to open shame you have offer yourself for a service which i do not seek what care i for he excellency 's gift shall it be say that i be the means of send a man into deadly danger to secure I a foolish estate you have offend I grossly and i pray you spare I further offence i command you to give up this journey i will not have my name bandy about in this land as a wanton who set silly youth by the ear to gratify she pride if you desire to retain a shred of my friendship go to he excellency and tell he that by my order you withdraw from the wager _ this letter do not cloud my spirit as it should for one thing she sign it elspeth and for another i have the conceited notion that what move she most be the thought that i be run into danger i long to have speech with she but i find from the servant that doctor blair have leave that morning on a journey of pastoral visitation and have take she with he the man do not know they destination but believe it to be somewhere in the north the thought vaguely disquiet I in these perilous time i wish to think of she as safe in the coastland where a ship would give a sure refuge i meet gray that afternoon at the half-way tavern in the last week he seem to have age and grow graver there be now no hint of the light arrogance of old he regard I curiously but without hostility we have be enemy i say and now though there may be no friendship at any rate there be a truce to strife last night i begged of you to come with I on this matter of the governor 's wager but 'twa not the wager i thought of then i tell he the whole tale the stake be the safety of this land of which you be a notable citizen i ask you because i know you be a brave man will you leave you comfort and you game for a season and play for higher stake at a more desperate hazard i tell he everything even down to my talk with the governor i do not lessen the risk and hardship and i give he to know that he companion would be rough folk whom he may well have despise he hear I out with he eye fix on the ground then suddenly he raise a shine face you be a generous enemy mr garvald i behave to you like a peevish child and you retaliate by offer I the bravest venture that man ever conceive i be with you with all my heart by god sir i be sick of my cushion life this be what i have be longing for in my soul since i be bear that night i spend make ready i take no servant and in my saddle-bag be store the little i need of powder and shot i have plenty and my two pistol and my hunting musket i give faulkner instruction and write a letter to my uncle to be send if i do not return next morning at daybreak we take the road chapter xvi the ford of the rapidan 'twa the same high summer weather through which i have ride a fortnight ago with a dull heart on my way to the duel now gray ride by my side and my spirit be as light as a bird 's i have forget the grim part of the enterprise the fate that might await I the horror we should certainly witness i think only of the joy of movement into new land with try companion these last month i have bear a pretty heavy weight of care now that be past my disposition complete the thing be in the hand of god and i be free to go my own road mocking-bird and thrush cry in the thicket squirrel flirt across the path and now and then a shy deer flee before we there come moment to every man when he be thankful to be alive and every breath draw be a delight so at that hour i praise my maker for he good earth and for spare I to rejoice in it gray have meet I with a certain shyness but as the sun rise and the land grow bright he too lose he constraint and fall into the same happy mood soon we be smile at each other in the frankest comradeship we two who but the other day have carry ourselves like game-cock he have forget he fine manners and he mincing london voice and we speak of the outland country of which he know nothing and of the hunting of game of which he know much exchange we different knowledge and willing to learn from each other long ere we have reach york ferry i have find that there be much in common between the scot trader and the virginian cavalier and the chief thing we share be youth mine to be sure be more in the heart while gray wear he open and fearless he pluck the summer flower and set they in he hat he be full of catch and glee so that he wake the echo in the forest glade soon i too fall to singing in my tuneless voice and i answer he my lodging be on the cold ground with some scot ballad or a song of davie lindsay i remember how sweetly he sing colonel lovelace 's ode to lucasta writ when go to the war : -- true a new mistress now i chase the first foe in the field and with a stronger faith embrace a sword a horse a shield yet this inconstancy be such as thou too shalt adore : i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more i wonder if that be my case -- if i ride out for honor and not for the pure pleasure of the ride and i marvel more to see the two of we both lover of one lady and eager rival bury for the nonce we feud and with the same hope serve the same cause we sleep the night at aird 's store and early the next morning find ringan a new ringan indeed as unlike the buccaneer i know as he be unlike the quaker he be now the gentleman of breadalbane dress for the part with all the care of a exquisite he ride a noble roan in he spanish belt be stick silver-hafted pistol and a long sword swing at he side when i present gray to he he become at once the cavalier as precise in he speech and polite in he deportment as any whitehall courtier they talk high and disposedly of genteel matter and you would have think that that red-haired pirate have live he life among proud lord and high-heeled lady that be ever the way of the highlander he alter like a clear pool to every mood of the sky so that the shallow observer might forget how deep the water be presently when we have ride into the chestnut forest of the mattaponey he begin to forget he part gray it appear be a student of campaign and he and ringan be deep in a discussion of conde 's battle in which both show surprising knowledge but the glory of the weather and of the woodland new as they be to a seafarer set he thought wander and he fall to tale of he past which consort ill with he former decorum there be a madcap zest in he speech something so merry and wild that gray who have fall back into he tidewater manners become once more the careless boy we stop to eat in a glade by a slow stream and from he saddle-bags ringan bring out strange delicacy there be sugared fruit from the main and orange sirop from jamaica and a kind of sweet punch make by the hispaniolum indian as we eat and drink he would gossip about the way of the world and though he never mention he own doings there be such a air of mastery about he as make he seem the center figure of he tale i could see that gray be mightily captivate and all afternoon he ply he with question and laugh joyously at he answer as we camp that night while gray be mind he horse ringan speak of he to I i like the lad andrew he have the makings of a very proper gentleman and he have the sense to be young what i complain of in you be that you be desperate old i wonder while if you ever be a laddie for I though i be ten year the elder of the pair of you i have no more year than you friend and i be a century younger than you that be the highland way there be that in we blood that keep we eye young though we may be bent double with we the heart be aye leap till death grip we to my mind it be a lovable character that i fain would cherish if i could not sing on a spring morning or say a hearty grace over a good dinner i would be content to be put away in a graveyard and that i think be the truth but at the time i be feel pretty youthful too though my dour face and hard voice be a bad clue to my sentiment next day on the rappahannock we find shalah who have go on to warn the two man i propose to enlist one of they donaldson be a big slow-spoken middle-aged farmer the same who have be with bacon in the fight at occaneechee island he just cry to he wife to expect he back when she see he sling on he back a old musket cast a long leg over he little horse and be ready to follow the other the frenchman bertrand be a quiet slim gentleman who be some kin to the murder d'aubigny i have long have my eye on he for he be very wise in woodcraft and have learn campaigning under old turenne he kiss he two child again and again and he wife cling to he arm there be tear in the honest fellow 's eye as he leave and i think all the more of he for he be the bravest man who have most to risk i mind that ringan console the lady in the french tongue which i do not comprehend and would not be hinder from get out he saddle-bag and comforting the child with candied plum he have near as grave a face as bertrand when we ride off and be always look back to the homestead he speak long to the frenchman in he own speech and the sad face of the latter begin to lighten i ask he what he say just that he be the happy man to have kind heart to weep for he a fine thing for a landless childless fellow like I to say but it be gospel truth andrew i tell he that he bairn would be great folk some day and that they proudest boast would be that they father have ride on this errand oh and all the rest of the easy consolation if it have be I i would not have be muckle cheer it be well i never marry for i would not have have the courage to leave my fireside we be now get into a new and far lovelier country the heavy forest and swamp which line the jame and the york have go and instead we have roll space of green meadowland and little hill which stand out like sentinel of the great blue chain of mountain that hang in the west instead of the rich summer scent of the tidewater we have the clean sharp smell of upland and cool wind relieve the noontide heat by and by we strike the rapidan a water more like we scot river flow in pool and current very different from the stagnant reach of the pamunkey we be join for a little bit by two man from stafford county who show we the path that horse could travel it be late in the afternoon that we reach a broad meadow hem in by noble cedar i know without tell that we be come to the scene of the tragedy and with one accord we fall silent the place have be well look after for a road have be make through the wood and have be carry over marshy place on a platform of cedar pile presently we come to a log fence with a gate which hang idly open within be a paddock and beyond another fence and beyond that a great pile of blacken timber the place be so smile and homelike under the wester sun that one look to see a trim stead with the smoke of hearth fire ascend and to hear the cheerful sound of labor and of child 's voice instead there be this grim char heap with the light wind swirl the ash every man of we uncover he head as he ride towards the melancholy place i notice a little rosary which have be carefully tend but horse have ride through it and the blossom be trail crush on the ground there be a flower garden too much trample and in one corner a little stream of water have be lead into a pool fringe with forget-me-not a tiny water-wheel be turn in the fall a child 's toy and the wheel still turn though its owner have go the sight of that simple thing fairly bring my heart to my mouth that inspection be a gruesome business one of the doorpost of the house still stand and it be splash with blood on the edge of the ash be some char human bone no one could tell whose they be perhaps a negro 's perhaps the little mistress of the water-wheel i look at ringan and he be smile but he eye be terrible the frenchman bertrand be sob like a child we take the bone and make a shallow grave for they in the rosary we have no spade but a stake do well enough to dig a resting-place for those few poor remains i say over they the twenty-third psalm : _ yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with I thy rod and thy staff shall comfort I _ then suddenly we mood change nothing that we could do could help the poor soul whose bone lay among the ash but we could bring they murderer to book and save other from a like fate we move away from the shatter place to the ford in the river where the road run north there we look back a kind of fury seize I as i see that cruel defacement in a few hour we ourselves should be beyond the pale among those human wolf who be so much more relentless than any beast of the field as i look round we little company i note how deep the thing have bite into we soul ringan 's eye still dance with that unholy blue light gray be very pale and he jaw be set grimly bertrand have cease from sob and he face have the far-away wildness of the fanatic such a look as he forbear may have worn at the news of st bartholomew the big man donaldson look puzzle and sombre only shalah stand impassive and aloof with no trace of feeling on the bronze of he countenance this be the place for a oath i say we be six man against a army but we fight for a holy cause let we swear to wipe out this deed of blood in the blood of its perpetrator god have make we the executor of he judgment against horrid cruelty we swear hold we hand high that when we duty to the dominion be do we should hunt down the cherokee who have do this deed till no one of they be leave breathing at that moment of tense nerve no other purpose would have contented we how will we find they quoth ringan to sift a score of murderer out of a murderous nation will be like search the ocean for a wave then shalah speak the trail be ten sun old but i can follow it the man be of the meebaw tribe by this token and he hold up a goshawk 's feather the bird that drop that live beyond the peak of shubash the meebaw be quick hunter and gross eater and travel slow we will find they by the tewawha all in good time i say retribution must wait till we have finish we task can you find the meebaw man again yea say shalah though they take wing and fly over the sea i should find they then we hasten away from that glade none speak to the other we camp a hour 's ride up the river in a place secure against surprise in a crook of the stream with a great rock at we back we be outside the pale now and must need adopt the precaution of a campaign so we split the night into watch i do my two hour sentry duty at that dead moment of the dark just before the little breeze which be the precursor of dawn and i reflect very soberly on the slender chance of we return from this strange wild world and its cruel mystery chapter xvii i retrace my step next morning we pass through the foothill into a open meadow country as i lift up my eye i saw for the first time the mountain near at hand there they lay not more than ten mile distant woody almost to the summit but with here and there a bold finger of rock point skywards they look infinitely high and rugged far higher than any hill i have ever see before for my own tinto or cairntable would to these have be no more than a footstool i make out a clear breach in the range which i take to be old studd 's clearwater gap the whole sight intoxicate I i might dream of horror in the low coast forest among they swampy creek but in that clear high world of the hill i believe lay safety i could have gaze at they for hour but shalah would permit of no delay he hurry we across the open meadow and would not relax he pace till we be on a low wooded ridge with the young water of the rapidan run in a shallow vale beneath here we halt in a thick clump of cedar while he and ringan go forward to spy out the land in that green darkness save by folk travel along the ridge we could not be detect and i know enough of indian way to believe that any large party would keep the stream side we light a fire without fear for the smoke be hide in the cedar branch and some of we roasted corn-cake we food in the saddle-bag would not last long and i foresaw a ticklish business when it come to hunting for the pot a gunshot in these narrow glen would reverberate like a cannon we doze peacefully in the green shade and smoke we pipe wait for the return of we envoy they come towards sundown slip among we like ghost ringan signal to I and we put we coat over the horse ' head to prevent they whinnying he stamp out the last few ash of the fire and shalah motion we all flat on we face then i crawl to the edge of the ridge and look down through a tangle of vine on the little valley we precaution have be none too soon for a host be pass below as stealthily as if it have be a army of the sheeted dead most be mount and it be marvellous to see the way in which they manage they horse so that the beast seem part of the rider and partook of they vigilance some be on foot and move with the long lope in-toed indian stride i guess they number at three hundred but what awed I be they array this be no ordinary raid but a invade army my sight as i think i have say be as keen as a hawk 's and i could see that most of they carry musket as well as knife and tomahawk the war-paint glisten on each breast and forehead and in the oil hair stand the crested feather dye scarlet for battle my spirit sink as i reflect that now we be cut off from the tidewater when the last man have go we crawl back to the clump now gloomy with the dusk of evening i see that ringan be very weary but shalah after stretch he long limb seem fresh as ever will you come with I brother he say we must warn the rappahannock who be they i ask cherokee more follow they the assault be dearly by the line of the rappahannock if we hasten we may yet be in time i know what shalah 's hasten mean i suppose i be the one of we best fit for a hot-foot march and that that be the reason why the indian choose I all the same my heart misgave I he eat a little food while i strip off the garment i do not need carry only the one pistol i bade the other travel slowly towards the mountain scout carefully ahead and promise that we should join they before the next sundown then shalah beckon I and i plunge after he into the forest on we first visit to ringan at the land-locked carolina harbor i have think shalah 's pace killing but that be but a saunter to what he now show I we seem to be move at right angle to the indian march once out of the wood of the ridge we cross the meadow mostly on we belly take advantage of every howe and crinkle i follow he as obediently as a child when he run so do i when he crawl my forehead be next he heel after the grass-land come broken hillock with little stream in the bottom through these we twist move with less care and presently we have leave the hill and be look over a wide shadowy plain the moon be three-quarter full and be just begin to climb the sky shalah sniff the wind which blow from the south-west and set off at a sharp angle towards the north we be now among the wood again and the tangled undergrowth try I sore we have be go for about three hour and though i be hard and spare from much travel in the sun my leg be not use to this furious foot march my foot grow leaden and to make matter worse we dip presently into a big swamp where we mire to the knee and often to the middle it would have be no light labor at any time to cross such a place pull oneself by the tangled shrub on to the rare patch of solid ground but now when i be pretty weary the toil be about the limit of my strength when we emerge on hard land i be sob like a stricken deer but shalah have no mercy he take I through the dark cedar at the same tireless pace and in the gloom i could see he flit ahead of I he shoulder square and he limb as supple as a race-horse 's i remember i say over in my head all the song and verse i know to keep my mind from my condition i have long ago get and lose my second wind and whatever other wind there be and be move less by bodily strength than by sheer doggedness of spirit weak tear be run down my cheek my breath rasp in my throat but i be in the frame of mind that if death have find I next moment my leg would still have twitch in a effort to run at a open bit of the forest shalah stop and look at the sky i blunder into he and then from sheer weakness roll on the ground he grunt and turn to I i feel he cool hand pass over my brow and cheek and he finger knead the muscle of my forlorn leg 'twa some indian device doubtless but its power be miraculous under he hand my body seem to be rest and revive new strength steal into my sinew new vigor into my blood the thing take maybe five minute -- not more but i scramble to my foot a man again indeed i be a better man than when i start for this indian wizardry have give I a odd lightness of head and heart when we take up the run my body instead of a leaden clog seem to be a thing of air and feather it be now hard on midnight and the moon be high in the heaven we bear somewhat to the right and i judge that we circuit be complete and that the time have come to steal in front of the indian route the forest thin and we traverse a marshy piece of country with many single great tree often shalah would halt for a second strain he ear and sniff the light wind like a dog he seem to find guidance but i get none only the hoot of a owl or the rooty smell of the woodland at last we strike a little stream and follow its course between high bank of pine suddenly shalah 's movement become stealthy crouching in every patch of shade and cross open space on we belly we turn from the stream surmount a knoll and come down on a wooded valley shalah look westwards hold up he hand and stand poise for a minute like a graven image then he grunt and speak we be safe he say they be behind we and be camp for the night how he know that i can not tell but i seem to catch on the breeze a whiff of the rancid odour of indian war-paint for another mile we continue we precaution and then move more freely in the open now that the chief peril be past my fatigue come back to I worse than ever i think i be grow leg-weary as i have see happen to horse and from that ailment there be no relief my head buzz like a beehive and when the moon set i have no power to pick my step and stumble and sprawl in the darkness i have to ask shalah for help though it be a sore hurt to my pride and lean on he arm i make the rest of the journey i find myself splash in a strong river we cross by a ford so we have no need to swim which be well for I for i must have drown the chill of the water revive I somewhat and i have the strength to climb the other bank and then suddenly before I i see a light and a challenge ring out into the night the voice be a white man 's and bring I to my bearing weak as i be i have the fierce satisfaction that we errand have not be idle i reply with the password and a big fellow stride out from a stockade mr garvald he say stare what bring you here where be the rest of you he look at shalah and then at I and finally take my arm and draw I inside there be a score in the place -- rappahannock farmer a lean watchful breed each man with he musket one of they i mind wear a rusty cuirass of chain armor which must have be one of those send out by the king in the first day of the dominion they give I a drink of rum and water and in a little i have get over my worst weariness and could speak the cherokee be on we i say and i tell they of the army we have follow how many they ask three hundred for a vanguard but more follow one man laugh as if well pleased i be in the humor for cherokee just now there be a score of scalp hang outside if you could see they mr garvald what scalp i ask dumbfounder the rapidan murderer we get word of they in the wood yesterday and six of we go hunting it be pretty shooting two get away with some lead in they the rest be in the tewawha pool all but they topknot i have very little notion of cherokee somehow the news give I intense joy i think nothing of the barbarity of it or that white man should demean themselves to the indian level i remember only the meadow by the rapidan and the little lonely water-wheel we vow be needless for other have do we work would i have be with you be all i say but now you have more than a gang of meebaw raider to deal with there be a invasion come down from the hill and this be the first wave of it i want word send to governor nicholson at jame town i be to tell he where the trouble be to be fear and in a week you 'll have a regiment at you back who have the best horse simpson well let simpson carry the word down the valley if my plan be work well the news should be at jame town by dawn to-morrow the man call simpson get up saddle he beast and wait my bidding this be the word to send say i say that the cherokee be attack by the line of the rappahannock say that i be go into the hill to find if my fear be justified never mind what that mean just pass on the word they will understand they at jame town so much for the governor now i want word send to frew 's homestead on the south fork who be to carry it one old fellow who chew tobacco without intermission spat out the leaf and ask I what news i want to send just that we be attack i say that be a simple job he say cheerfully all down the border post we have a signal only yesterday we get word of it from the place you speak of a mile from here be a hillock within hearing of the stockade at robertson 's ford one shot fire there will tell they what you want they to know robertson 's will fire twice for appleby 's to hear and appleby 's will send on the message to dopple 's there be six post between here and the south fork so when the folk at frew 's hear seven shot they will know that the war be on the rappahannock i recognize old lawrence 's hand in this it be just the kind of device that he would contrive i hope it would not miscarry for i would have prefer a messenger but after all the border line be he concern then i speak aside to shalah in he view the cherokee would not attack at dawn they be more likely to wait till they support overtake they and then to make a dash for the rappahannock farm plunder be more in the line of these gentry than honest fighting i speak to the leader of the post and he be for fall upon they in the narrow of the rapidan they victory over the meebaw have fire the blood of the borderer and make they contemptuous of the enemy still in such a predicament when we have to hold a frontier with a handful the boldest course be likely to be the safest i could only pray that nicholson 's levy would turn up in time to protect the valley time pass brother say shalah we come by swiftness but we return by guile in three hour it will be dawn sleep till then for there be much toil before thee i see the wisdom of he word and go promptly to bed in a corner of the stockade as i be lie down a man speak to I one rycroft at whose cabin i have once sojourn for a day what bring the parson hereaways in these time he ask what parson i ask the man they call doctor blair great god i cry what about he he be in stafford county when i leave hunting for schoolmaster ay and he have a girl with he i sit upright with a start where be he now i ask i see he last at middleton 's ford i think he be go down the river i warn he this be no place for parson and woman but he just laugh at I it be time he be back in the tidewater so long as they be homeward-bound i do not care but it give I a queer fluttering of the heart to think that elspeth but yesterday should have be near this perilous border i soon fall asleep for i be mighty tired but i dream evilly i seem to see doctor blair hunt by cherokee with he coat-tail fly and he wig blow away and what vex I be that i could not find elspeth anywhere in the landscape chapter xviii we adventure receive a recruit at earliest light with the dew heavy on the willow and the river line a coil of mist shalah wake I for the road we breakfast off fried bacon some of which i save for the journey for the indian be content with one meal a day as we leave the stockade i note the row of meebaw scalp hang grim and bloody from the pole the borderer be up and stir for they look to take the indian in the river narrow before the morning be old no two indian war party ever take the same path so it be shalah 's plan to work back to the route we have just travel by which the cherokee have come yesterday this sound simple enough but the danger lay in the second party by strike to right or leave we might walk into it and then good-bye to we hope of the hill but the whole thing be easier to I than the cruel toil of yesterday there be need of stealth and woodcraft but not of yon kill speed for the first hour we go up a northern fork of the rappahannock then cross the water at a ford and strike into a thick pine forest i be feel wonderfully rest and find no discomfort in shalah 's long stride my mind be very busy on the defense of the border and i keep wonder how long the governor 's militia would take to reach the rappahannock and whether lawrence could reinforce the northern post in time to prevent mischief in stafford county i cast back to my memory of the tale of indian war and could not believe but that the white man if warn and arm would roll back the cherokee 'twa not they i fear but that other force now screen behind the mountain who have for they leader some white madman with a fire in he head and bible word on he lip be we of virginium destine to fight with such fanatic as have distract scotland -- fanatic name the name of god but lead in we case the army of hell it be about eleven in the forenoon i think that shalah drop he easy swing and grow circumspect the sun be very hot and the noon silence lay dead on the woodland scarcely a leaf stir and the only sound be the twitter grasshopper and the drone of fly but shalah find food for thought again and again he become rigid and then lay a ear to the ground he nostril dilate like a horse 's and he eye be restless we be now in a shallow vale through which a little stream flow among broad reed-bed at one point he kneel on the ground and search diligently see he say a horse 's print not two hour old -- a horse go west presently i myself find a clue i pick up from a clump of wild onion a thread of color wool this be my own trade where i know more than shalah i test the thing in my mouth and between my finger this be london stuff i say the man who have this on he person buy he clothes from the bristol merchant and pay sweetly for they he be no rappahannock farmer shalah trail like a bloodhound follow the hoof-mark out of the valley meadow to a ridge of sparse cedar where they show clear on the bare earth and then to a thicker covert where they be hide among strong grass suddenly he catch my shoulder and pull I to the ground we crawl through a briery place to where a gap open to the vale on we leave a party of indian be pass they be young man with the fantastic marking of young brave all be mount on the little indian horse they move at leisure scanning the distance with hand shade eye we worm we way back to the darkness of the covert the advance guard of the second party shalah whisper with good fortune we shall soon see the rest pass and then have a clear road for the hill i see no fresh scalp i say so they seem to have miss we man on the horse i be proud of my simple logic all that shalah reply be the rider be a woman ' how in heaven 's name can you tell i ask he hold out a long hair i find it among the vine at the level of a rider 's head this be bad news indeed what folly have induce a woman to ride so far across the border it could be no settler 's wife but some dame from the coast country who have not the sense to be timid 'twa a grievous affliction for two man on a arduous quest to have to protect a foolish female with the cherokee all about they there be no help for it and as swiftly as possible and with all circumspection shalah trail the horse 's print they keep the high ground in very broken country which be the reason why the rider have escape the indian ' notice clearly they be move slowly and from the frequent halt and turning i gather that the rider have not much purpose about the road then we come on a glade where the rider have dismount and let the beast go the horse have wander down the ridge to the right in search of grazing and the print of a woman 's foot lead to the summit of a knoll which raise itself above the tree there knee-deep in a patch of fern i see what i have never dream of what send the blood from my heart in a cold shudder of fear : a girl pale and dishevelled be try to part some vine a twig crackle and she look round show a face draw with weariness and eye large with terror it be elspeth at the sight of shalah she make to scream but check herself it be well for a scream would have bring all of we to instant death for shalah at that moment drop to earth and wriggle into a covert overlook the vale i have the sense to catch the girl and pull she after he he stop dead and we two lay also like mouse my heart be go pretty fast and i could feel the heaving of she bosom the shallow glen be full of folk most of they go on foot i recognize the cherokee head-dress and the long hickory bow which those carry who have no musket 'twa by far the biggest party we have see and though in that moment i have no wit to count they shalah tell I afterwards they must have number little short of a thousand some very old fellow be there with lean hollow cheek and scanty lock but the most be warrior in they prime i could see it be a big war they be out for since some of the horse carry heavy load of corn and it be never the indian fashion to take much provender for a common raid in all virginium 's history there have be no such invasion for the war of opechancanough and berkeley and the fight of bacon against the susquehannock be mere bicker compare with this deliberate downpour from the hill as we lay there scarce daring to breathe i see that we be in deadly peril the host be so great that some march on the very edge of we thicket i could see through the leave the brown skin not a yard away the slightest noise would bring the sharp indian eye peer into the gloom and we must be betray in that moment which be one of the gravest of my life i have happily no leisure to think of myself my whole soul sicken with anxiety for the girl i know enough of indian way to guess she fate for shalah and myself there might be torture and at the best a arrow in we heart but for she there would be thing unspeakable i remember the little meadow on the rapidan and the tale tell by the gray ash there be only one shot in my pistol but i determine that it should be save for she in such a crisis the memory work wildly and i remember feeling glad that i have stand up before gray 's fire the thought give I a comforting assurance of manhood those be nightmare minute the girl be very quiet in a stupor of fatigue and fear shalah be a graven image and i be too tensely string to have any of the itch and fervor which use to vex I in hunting the deer when stillness be needful through the fret greenery i see the dim shadow of man pass swiftly the thought of the horse worry I if the confound beast graze peaceably down the other side of the hill all might be well so long as he be out of sight any movement he make would be set down by the indian to some forest beast for animal ' noise be all alike in a wood but if he return to we there would be the devil to pay for at a glimpse of he we thicket would be alive with the enemy in the end i find it best to shut my eye and commend we case to we maker then i count very slowly to myself up to four hundred and look again the vale be empty we lay still hardly believe in we deliverance for the matter of a quarter of a hour and then shalah make a sign to I to remain turn and glide up lull i put my hand behind I find elspeth 's cheek and pat it she stretch out a hand and clutch mine feverishly and thus we remain till after what seem a age shalah return he be on he foot and walk freely he have find the horse too and have it by the bridle the danger be past he say gravely let we go back to the glade and rest i help elspeth to she foot and on my arm she clamber to the grassy place in the wood i search my pocket and give she the remnant of the bread and bacon i have bring from the rappahannock post better still i remember that i have in my breast a little flask of eau-de-vie and a mouthful of it revive she greatly she put she hand to she head and begin to tidy she dishevelled hair which be a sure sign in a woman that she be recover she composure what bring you here i ask gently she have forget that i be in she black book and that in she letter she forbid my journey indeed she look at I as a child in a pickle may look at a upbraid parent i be lose she cry i do not mean to go far but the night come down and i could not find the way back oh it have be a hideous nightmare i have be almost mad in the dark wood but how do you get here i ask still hopelessly puzzle i be with uncle jame on the rappahannock he hear something that make he anxious and he be go back to the tidewater yesterday but a message come for he suddenly and he leave I at morrison 's farm and say he would be back by the evening i do not want to go home before i have see the mountain where my estate be -- you know the land that governor franci say he would give I for my birthday they tell I one could see the hill from near at hand and a boy that i ask say i would get a rare view if i go to the rise beyond the river so i have paladin saddle and cross the ford mean to be back long ere sunset but the tree be so thick that i could see nothing from the first rise and i try to reach a green hill that look near then it begin to grow dark and i lose my head and oh i do not know where i wandered i think every rustle in the bush be a bear or a panther i fear the indian too for they tell I they be unsafe in this country all night long i try to find a valley run east but the moonlight deceive I and i must have come farther away every hour when day come i tie paladin to a tree and sleep a little and then i ride on to find a hill which would show I the lie of the land but it be very hot and i be very weary and then you come and those dreadful wild man and -- and -- she break down and weep piteously i comfort she as best i could tell she that she trouble be over now and that i should look after she you might have meet with we in the wood last night i say so you see you be not far from friend but the truth be that she trouble be only begin and i be wretchedly anxious my impulse be to try to get she back to the rappahannock but on put this to shalah he shake he head it be too late he say if you seek certain death go towards the rappahannock she must come with we to the mountain the only safety be in the hill-top this seem a mad say to be safe from indian we be to go into the heart of indian country but shalah expound it the tribe he say dwelt only in the lower glen of the range and never venture to the summit believe they to be holy land where a great _ manitou _ dwell the cherokee especially shun the peak if we could find a way clear to the top we might stay there in some security till we learn the issue of the war and could get word to we friend moreover he say we have yet to penetrate the secret of the hill that be the object of we quest brother shalah be right and i have forget all about it i could not suffer my care for elspeth to prevent a work whose issue might mean the salvation of virginium we have still to learn the truth about the massing of indian in the mountain of which the cherokee raid be but scout venture the verse of gray 's song come into my head : -- i could not love thee dear so much loved i not honor more besides -- and this be the best reason -- there be no other way we have go too far to turn back and as we proverb say it be idle to swallow the cow and choke on the tail i put it all to elspeth she look very scared but my uncle will go mad if he do not find I it will be worse for he if he be never to find you again shalah say it would be as easy to get you back over the rappahannock as for a child to cross a winter torrent i do not say it be pleasant either way but there be a good hope of safety in the hill and there be none anywhere else she sit for a little with she eye downcast i be in you hand she say at last oh the foolish girl i have be i will be a drag and a danger to you all then i take she hand elspeth i say it be I will be the proud man if i can save you i would rather be the salvation of you than the king of the tidewater and so say shalah and so will say all of we but i do not think she hear I she have check she tear but she wit be far away grieve for she uncle 's pain and envisage the desperate future at the first water we reach she bath she face and eye and use the pool as a mirror adjust she hair then she smile bravely i will try to be a true comrade like a man she say i think i will be stronger when i have sleep a little all that afternoon we steal from covert to covert it be hot and oppressive in the dense wood where the breeze could not penetrate shalah 's eagle eye search every open space before we cross but we see nothing to alarm we in time we come to the place where we have leave we party and it be easy enough to pick up they road they have travel slowly keep to the thickest tree and they have take no pain to cover they track for they have argue that if trouble come it would come from the front and that it be little likely that any indian would be return thus soon and could take up they back trail presently we come to a place where the bold spur of the hill overhang we and the gap we have see open up into a deep valley shalah go in advance and suddenly we hear a word pass we enter a cedar glade to find we four companion unsaddle the horse and make camp the sight of the girl hold they stare gray grow pale and then flush scarlet he come forward and ask I abruptly what it mean when i tell he he bite he lip there be only one thing to be do he say we must take miss blair back to the tidewater i insist sir i will go myself we can not involve she in we danger he be once again the man i have wrangle with he eye blaze and he speak in a high tone of command but i could not be wroth with he indeed i like he for he peremptoriness it comfort I to think that elspeth have so warm a defender i nod to shalah tell he i say and shalah speak with he he take long to convince but at the end he say no more and go to speak to elspeth i could see that she lighten he troubled mind a little for have accept she fate she be resolute to make the best of it i even hear she laugh that night we make she a bower of green branch and as we eat we supper round we modest fire she sit like a queen among we it be odd to see the way in which she presence affect each of we with she gray be the courtly cavalier ready with a neat phrase and a line from the poet donaldson and shalah be unmoved no woman could make any difference to they wilderness silence the frenchman bertrand grow almost gay she speak to he in he own tongue and he tell she all about the little family he have leave and he day in far-away france but in ringan be the oddest change she presence keep he tongue-tied and when she speak to he he be embarrass into stutter he be eager to serve she in everything but he could not look she in the face or answer readily when she speak this man so debonair and masterful among he fellow be put all out of countenance by a wearied girl i do not suppose he have speak to a gentlewoman for ten year chapter xix clearwater glen next morning we come into clearwater glen shalah speak to I of it before we start he do not fear the cherokee who have come from the far south of the range and have never be settle in these part but he think that there might be other from the back of the hill who would have cross by this gap and might be lie in the lower part of the glen it behove we therefore to go very warily once on the higher ridge he think we might be safe for a time a invade army have no leisure to explore the rugged summit of a mountain the first sight of the place give I a strong emotion of dislike a little river brawl in a deep gorge fall in pool and linn like one of my native burn all its course be thickly shaded with bush and knotted tree on either bank lay stretch of rough hill pasture line with dark and tangled forest which run up the hill-side till the steepness of the slope break they into copse of stunt pine among great bluff of rock and raw red scaur the glen be very narrow and the mountain seem to beetle above it so as to shut out half the sunlight the air be grow cooler with the queer acrid smell in it that high hill bring i be a great lover of upland and the sourest peat-moss have a charm for I but to that strange glen i conceive at once a determine hate it be the way of some place with some man the sens perceive a hostility for which the mind have no proof and in my experience the sens be right part of my discomfort be due to my bodily health i have proudly think myself seasoned by those hot virginian summer in which i have escape all common ailment but i have forget what old hunter have tell I that the hill will bring out a fever which be dormant in the plain anyhow i now find that my head be dizzy and ache and my limb have a strange tremble the fatigue of the past day have drag I to the limit of my strength and make I a easy victim my heart too be full of care the sight of elspeth remind I how heavy be my charge 'twa difficult enough to scout well in this tangled place but forbye my duty to the dominion i have the business of take one who be the light of my life into this dark land of bloody secret the youth and gaiety be go out of my quest i could only plod along dismally attentive to every movement of shalah pray incessantly that we might get well out of it all to make matter worse the travel become desperate hard in the tidewater there be bridle path and in the vale of the foothill the go have be good with hard dry soil in the wood and no hindrance save a thicket of vine or a rare windfall but in this glen where the hill rain beat there be no end to obstacle the open space be marshy where we horse sink to the hock the wood be one medley of fall tree rot into touchwood hide boulder and mat brier often we could not move till donaldson and bertrand with they hatchet have hew some sort of road all this mean slow progress and by midday we have not go half-way up the glen to the neck which mean the ridge of the pass this be a occasion when ringan show at he best he have lose he awe of elspeth and devoted himself to make the road easy for she gray who would fain have do the same be no match for the seafarer and have much ado to keep go himself ringan 's cheery face be better than medicine he eye never lose they dancing light and he be ready ever with some quip or whimsy to tide over the worst trouble we keep very still but now and again elspeth 's laugh ring out at he fooling and it do my heart good to hear it after midday the glen seem to grow darker and i see that the blue sky which i have think changeless be become overcast as i look upward i see the high ridge blot out and a white mist creep down i have notice for some time that shalah be grow uneasy he would halt we often while he go a little way on and now he turn with so grim a look that we stop without bidding he slip into the undergrowth while we wait in that dark lonesome place even ringan be sober now elspeth ask in a low voice what be wrong and i tell she that the indian be uncertain of the best road best road she laugh then pray show I what you call the worst ringan grin at I ruefully where do you wish yourself at this moment andrew on the top of this damned mountain i grunt not for I he say give I the dry tortuga on a moonlight night when the bream fire burn along the shore and the lad be sing ` spanish lady ' or better still the little isle of st john the baptist with the fine yellow sand for careen and mother darium brewing bobadillo and the trade blow fresh in the top of the palm this land be a gloomy sort of business give I the bright changeful sea and i say elspeth would be thread rowan berry for a necklace in the heather of medwyn glen it must be about four o'clock of a midsummer afternoon and a cloudless sky except for white streamer over tinto ah my own kind countryside ringan 's face change you be right my lady no tortuga or spanish isle for ninian campbell give he the steep of glenorchy on a October morn when the deer have begin to bell my sorrow but we be far enough from we desire -- all but andrew who be a prosaic soul and here come shalah with ugly news the indian speak rapidly to I the wood be full of man i do not think we be discover but we can not stay here we one hope be to gain the cover of the mist there be a open space beyond this thicket and we must ride we swiftest quick brother the man i gasp cherokee nay he say not cherokee i think they be those you seek from beyond the mountain the next half-hour be a mad recollection wild and confused and distraught with anxiety the thought of elspeth among savage madden I the more so as she have just speak of medwyn glen and have send my memory back to fragrant hour of youth we scramble out of the thicket and put we weary beast to a gallop happily it be harder ground albeit much stud with clump of fern and though we all slip and stumble often the horse keep they foot i be grow so dizzy in the head that i fear every moment i would fall off the mist have now come low down the hill and lay before we a line of gray vapor draw from edge to edge of the vale it seem a infinite long way off shalah on foot keep in the rear and i gather from he that the danger he fear be behind suddenly as i stare ahead something fall ten yard in advance of we in a long curve and stick quiver in the soil it be a indian arrow we would have rein up if shalah have not cry on we to keep on i do not think the arrow be mean to strike we 'twa a warn a grim jest of the savage in the wood then another fall at the same distance before we first rider still shalah cry we on i fall back to the rear for if we be to escape i think there might be need of fight there i feel in my belt for my loaded pistol we be now in a coppice again where the tree be short and sparse beyond that lay another meadow and then not a quarter-mile distant the welcome line of the mist every second draw down on we a third time a arrow fall its flight be shorter and drop almost under the nose of elspeth 's horse which swerve violently and would have unseated a less skilled horsewoman on on i cry for we be past the need for silence and when i look again the kindly fog have swallow up the van of the party i turn and gaze back and there i see a strange sight a dozen man or more have come to the edge of the tree on the hill-side they be quite near not two hundred yard distant and i see they clearly they carry bow or musket but none offer to use they they be tall fellow but lighter in the color than any indian i have see indeed they be as fair as many a englishman and they slim golden-brown body be not paint in the maniac fashion of the cherokee they stand stock still watch we with a dreadful impassivity which be more frightening to I than violence then i too be overtake by the gray screen will they follow i ask shalah i do not think so they be not hill-men and fear the high place where the god smoke further-more there be no need we have escape then i ask with a great relief in my voice say rather we have be shepherd by they into a fold they will find we when they desire we it be a perturb thought but at any rate we be safe for the moment and i resolve to say nothing to alarm the other we overtake they presently and shalah become we guide not that more guide be need than ringan or i could have give for the lift of the ground give we we direction and there be the sound of a fall stream to a upland-bred man mist be little of a hindrance unless on a featureless moor ever as we jog upward the air grow colder rain be blow in we tooth and the ferny grass and juniper clump drip with wet almost it might have be the pentland or the high moss between douglas water and clyde to we come fresh from the torrid plain it be bitter weather and i fear for elspeth who be thinly clothe for the hill-tops ringan seem to feel the cold the worst of we for he have spend he day in the hot sea of the south he put he horse-blanket over he shoulder and cut a comical figure with he red face peeping from its fold lord he would cry i wish i be in the dry tortuga or snug in the beach-house at the isle o ' pine this mind I painfully of my young day when i run in a ragged kilt in the cold heather of cruachan i must be get a old man andrew for i never think the hill could freeze my blood suddenly the fog lighten a little the slope cease and we have that gust of freer air which mean the top of the pass my head be less dizzy now and i have a momentary gladness that at any rate we have do part of what we set out to do clearwater gap i cry except for old studd we be the first christian to stand on this watershed below we lay a swimming hollow of white mist hiding i know not what strange country from the vale below i have mark the lie of the land on each side of the gap the highest ground be to the right so we turn up the ridge which be easier than the glen and better travel presently we be among pine again and get a shelter from the driving rain my plan be to find some hollow far up the mountain side and there to make we encampment after a hour 's ride we come to the very place i have seek a pocket of flat land lay between two rocky knoll with a ring of good-sized tree around it the spot be dry and hidden and what especially take my fancy be a spring of water which well up in the center and from which a tiny stream run down the hill 'twa a fine site for a stockade and so think shalah and the two borderer there be much to do to get the place ready and donaldson and bertrand fall to with they axis to fall tree for the fort now that we have reach the first stage in we venture my mind be unreasonably comfort with the buoyancy of youth i argue that since we have get so far we must get farther also the fever seem to be leave my bone and my head clear elspeth be almost merry like a child playing at make house she order the man about on diver errand she be a fine sight with the wind ruffle she hair and she cheek redden from the rain ringan come up to I there be three hour of daylight in front of we what say you to make for the top of the hill and find studd 's cairn i need some effort to keep my blood run i would gladly have stay behind for the fever have tire I but i could not be dare by ringan and not respond so we set off at a great pace up the ridge which soon grow very steep and force we to a crawl there be place where we have to scramble up loose cliff amid a tangle of vine and then we would dip into a little glade and then once again breast a precipice by and by the tree drop away and there be nothing but low bush and boulder and rank mountain grass in clear air we must have have a wonderful prospect but the mist hang close around we the drizzle blur we eye and the most we see be a yard or two of gray vapor it be easy enough to find the road for the ridge run upwards as narrow as a hog 's back presently it cease and with labor breath we walk a step or two in flat ground ringan who be in front stumble over a little heap of stone about a foot high studd have a poor notion of a cairn he say as he kick they down there be nothing beneath but bare soil but the hunter have speak the truth a little digging in the earth reveal the green metal of a old powder-flask with a wooden stopper i force it open and shake from its inside a twist of very dirty paper there be some rude scratching on it with charcoal which i read with difficulty _ salut to adventr _ _ robbin studd on ye sumit of mountaine ye 3rd _ _ dy of June yr _ 1672 _ hathe sene ye _ _ promissd lande _ somehow in that bleak place this scrap of a human message wonderfully uplift we heart before we have think only of we danger and care but now we have a vision of the reward down in the mist lay a new world studd have see it and we should see it and some day the virginian people would drive a road through clearwater gap and enter into possession it be a subtle joy that which fill the heart of the pioneer and mighty unselfish too he do not think of payment for the finding be payment enough he do not even seek praise for it be the unborn generation that will call he bless he be content like mose to leave he bone in the wilderness if he people may pass over jordan ringan turn he flask in he hand a good man this old studd he say i like he word _ salute to adventurer _ he be think of the folk that should come after he which be the mark of a big mind andrew you common fellow would have writ some glorification of he own doings but studd be think of the thing he have do and not of himself you say he be dead these ten year maybe he be look down at we and nod he old head well pleased i would like fine to drink he health we run down the hill and come to the encampment at the darkening ringan who have retain the flask present it to elspeth with a bow there mistress he say there be the key of you new estate chapter xx the stockade among the pine it take we a heavy day 's work to get the stockade finish there be only the two axis in the party besides shalah 's tomahawk and no one can know the labor of felling and trim tree tin he have try it we find the horse useful for drag trunk and but for they should have make a poor job of it gray 's white hand be all cut and blister and though i boast of my hardiness mine be little better ringan be the surprise for you would not think that sail a ship be a good apprenticeship to forestry but he be as skilful as bertrand and as strong as donaldson and he have a better idea of fortification than we all put together the palisade which run round the camp be six foot high make of log lash to upright stake there be a gate which could be bar heavily and loophole be make every yard or so for musket fire on one side -- that face the uplift of the ridge -- the wall rise to nine foot inside we make a division in one half the horse be picket at night and the other be we dwelling for elspeth we make a bower in one corner which we thatch with pine branch but the rest of we sleep in the open round the fire it be a rough place but a strong one for we water could not be cut off and as we have plenty of ball and powder a few man could hold it against a host to each be allot he proper station in case of attack and we keep watch in succession like soldier in war ringan who have fight in many place up and down the world be we general in these matter and a rigid martinet we find he shalah be we scout and we lean on he for all woodland work but inside the palisade ringan 's word be law we plan be to make this stockade the center for explore the hill and ascertain the strength and purpose of the indian army we hope and so do shalah that we enemy would have no leisure to follow we to the high ridge that what risk there be would be run by the man on they spy journey but that the stockade would be reasonably safe it be my intention as soon as i have sufficient news to send word to lawrence and we think that presently the rappahannock force would have drive the cherokee southward and the way would be open to get elspeth back to the tidewater the worst trouble as i soon saw be to be the matter of food the supplies we have carry be all but finish by what we eat after the stockade be complete after that there remain only a single bag of flour another bag of indian meal and a pound or two of boucann beef besides three flask of eau-de-vie which ringan have bring in a leather casket the forest berry be not yet ripe and the only food to be procure be the flesh of the wild game happily in donaldson and bertrand we have two practice trapper but they be doubtful about success for they have no knowledge of what beast live in the hill i have say that we have plenty of powder and ball but i do not relish the idea of shooting in the wood for the noise would be a signal to we foe still food we must have and i think i might find a secluded place where the echo of a shot would be muffle the next morning i parcel up the company accord to they duty for while ringan be captain of the stockade i be the leader of the venture i send out bertrand and donaldson to trap in the wood ringan with gray and shalah stay at home to strengthen still further the stockade and protect elspeth while i take my musket and some pack-thong and go up the hill-side to look for game we be tryst to be back a hour before sundown and if some one of we do not find food we should go supperless that day be a memory which will never pass from I the weather be gray and lowering and though the rain have cease the air be still heavy with it and every bush and branch drip with moisture it be a poor day for hunting for the eye could not see forty yard but it suit my purpose since the dull air would deaden the noise of my musket i be hunting alone in a strange land among imminent peril and my aim be not to glorify my skill but to find the means of life the thought string I up to a mood where delight be more notable than care i be adventure with only my hand to guard I in those ancient haunted wood where no white man have ever before travel to experience such moment be to live with the high fervor which god give to mortal before town and law lay they dreary spell upon they early in the day i meet a bear -- the second i have see in my life i do not want he and he disregard I and shuffle grumpily down the hill-side i have to be very careful i remember to mark my path so that i could retrace it and i follow the border device of make a chip here and there in the bark of tree and often look backward to remember the look of the place when see from the contrary side trail be easy to find on the soft ground but besides the bear i see none but those of squirrel and rabbit and a rare opossum but at last in a marshy glen i find the fresh slot of a great stag for two hour and more i follow he far north along the ridge till i come up with he in a patch of scrub oak i have to wait long for a shot but when at last he rise i plant a bullet fairly behind he shoulder and he drop within ten pace he size amaze I for he be as big as a cart-horse in body and carry a spread of branch antler like a forest tree to I accustom to the little deer of the tidewater this great creature seem a portent and i guess that he be that elk which i have hear of from the border hunter anyhow he give I wealth of food i hide some in a cool place and take the rest with I pack in bark in a great bundle on my shoulder the road back be easier than i have fear for i have the slope of the hill to guide I but i be mortally weary of my load before i plumped it down inside the stockade presently bertrand and donaldson return they bring only a few rabbit but they have set many trap and in a hill burn they have catch some fine golden-bellied trout soon venison steak and fish be grill in the ember and elspeth set to bake cake on a griddle those leave behind have work well and the palisade be as perfect as could be contrived a runlet of water have be lead through a hollow trunk into a trough -- also hew from a log -- close by elspeth 's bower where she could make she toilet unperplexed by other eye also they have lead a stream into the horse ' enclosure so that they could be water with ease the weather clear in the evening as it often do in a hill country from the stockade we have no prospect save the reddening western sky but i like to think that in a little walk i could see old studd 's promised land that be a joy i reserve for myself on the morrow i look back on that late afternoon with delight as a curious interlude of peace we have forget that we be fugitive in a treacherous land i for one have forget the grim purpose of we quest and we cook supper as if we be a band of careless folk take we pleasure in the wild wood-smoke be always for I a intoxication like strong drink it seem the incense of nature 's altar call up the shades of the old forest god smack of rest and comfort in the heart of solitude and what odour can vie for hungry folk with that of roast meat in the clear hush of twilight the sight of that little camp be still in my memory elspeth flit about busy with she cookery the glow of the sunset lighting up she dark hair bertrand do the roast crouch like a gnome by the edge of the fire gray fetch and carry for the cook a docile and cheerful servant with nothing in he look to recall the proud gentleman of the tidewater donaldson sit on a log contentedly smoke he pipe while ringan whistle a strathspey attend to the horse only shalah stand aloof he eye fix vacantly on the western sky and he ear intent on the multitudinous voice of the twilit wood presently food be ready and we rude meal in that darkle place be a merry one elspeth sit enthrone on a couch of pine branch -- i can see she yet shield she face from the blaze with one little hand and divide she cake with the other then we light we pipe and fall to the long tale of the camp-fire ringan have a story of a black-haired princess of spain and how for love of she two gentleman do marvel on the sea the chief one never return to claim she but die in a fight off cartagena and write a fine ballad about he mistress which ringan say be still sing in the tavern of the main he give a verse of it a wild sad thing with tear in it and the joy of battle after that we all sing all but I who have no voice bertrand have a lay of normandy about a lady who walk in the apple-orchard and fall in love with a wander minstrel and donaldson sing a rough ballad of virginium in which a man weigh the worth of he wife against a tankard of apple-jack gray sing a english song about the north-country maid who come to london and a bit of the chanty of the devon man who sack santa fe and steal the almirante 's daughter as for elspeth she sing to a soft scot tune the tale of the lady of cassili who follow the gipsy 's piping in it the gipsy tell of what he can offer the lady and lo it be we own case -- and ye shall wear no silken gown no maid shall bind you hair the yellow broom shall be you gem you braid the heather rare athwart the moor adown the hill across the world away the path be long for happy heart that sing to greet the day my love that sing to greet the day i remember too the last verse of it : -- and at the last no solemn steal shall on thy breast be lay no mumble priest shall speed thy soul no charnel vault thee shade but by the shadowed hazel copse aneath the greenwood tree where air be soft and water sing thou ` lt ever sleep by I my love thou ` lt ever sleep by I then we fall to talk about the thing in the west that no man have yet discover and shalah to whom we song be nothing now lend a ear the first virginian say gray thought that over the hill lay the western ocean and the road to cathay i do not know but i be confident that but a little way west we should come to water a great river or else the ocean ringan differ he hold that the land of america be very wide in those part as wide as south of the isthmus where no man have yet cross it then he tell we of a sea-captain who have travel inland in mexico for five week and come to a land where gold be as common as chuckiestone and a great people dwell who worship a god who live in a mountain and he speak of the holy city of manoa which sir walter raleigh seek and which many have see from far hill-tops likewise of the wonderful king who once dwell in peru and the little isle in the pacific where all the bird be nightingale and the tree of life flourish and the mountain north of the main which be all one emerald i think he say that though no man have ever have the fruition of these marvel they be likely to be more true than false i hold that god have keep this land of america to the last to be the loadstone of adventurer and that there be greater wonder to be see than any that man have imagine the pity be that i have spend my best year scratch like a hen at its doorstep instead of enter i have a notion some day to travel straight west to the sunset i think i should find death but i might see some queer thing first then shalah speak : -- there be once a man of my own people who when he come to man 's strength journey westward with a wife he travel all he day and when he eye be dim with age he see a great water he spirit leave he on its shore but on he road he have beget a son and that son journey back towards the rise sun and come after many year to he people again i have speak with he of what he have see and what be that ask ringan with eager eye he tell of plain so great that it be a lifetime to travel over they and of desert where the eagle fly from the dawn die of drought by midday and of mountain so high that bird can not cross they but be change by cold into stone and of river to which we little water be as reed to a forest cedar but especially he speak of the fierce warrior that ride like the wind on horse it seem brother that he who would reach that land must reach also the hereafter that be the place for I ringan cry what say you andrew when this affair be over shall we make a bid for these marvel i can cull some pretty adventurer from the free companion nay i be for move a step at a time say i i be a trader and want one venture well do before i begin on another i shall be content if we safely cross these mountain on which we be now perch ringan shake he head that be never the way of the highland ` better a bone on the far-away hill than a fat sheep in the meadow ' say the gael what say you mistress and he turn to elspeth i think you be the bear poet say she smile and that mr garvald be the sober man of affair you will leap for the top of the wall and get a prospect while mr garvald will patiently pull it down oh i grant that andrew have the wisdom say ringan that be why he and I be so well agree it be because we differ much and so fit together like opposite half of a apple be you traveller still in the land of the living he ask shalah but the indian have slip away from the fireside circle and i see he without in the moonlight standing rigid on a knoll and gaze at the sky \* \* \* \* \* next day dawn cloudless and shalah and i spend it in a long journey along the range we keep to the highest part and at every vantage-ground we scan the glen for human trace by this time i have find my hill leg and could keep pace even with the indian 's swift stride the ridge of mountain you must know be not a single backbone but break up here and there by valley into two and even three range this make we scout more laborious and prevent we from get the full value out of we high station mostly we keep in cover and never show on a skyline but we see nothing to prove the need of this stealth only the hawk wheel and the wild pigeon croon the squirrel frisk among the branch and now and then a great deer would leap from its couch and hasten into the covert but though we get no news that journey bring to I a revelation for i have my glimpse of studd 's promised land it come to I early in the day as we halt in a little glade gay with willowherb and goldenrod which hang on a shelf of the hill look westwards the first streamer of morn have go the mist have dry up from the valley and i find myself look into a deep cleft and across at a steep pine-clad mountain clearly the valley be split by this mountain into two fork and i could see only the cool depth of it and catch a gleam of broken water a mile or two below but look more to the north i see where the vale open and then i have a vision worthy of the name by which studd have baptize it a immense green pasture land run out to the dim horizon there be forest scatter athwart it and single great tree and little ridge too but at the height where we stand it seem to the eye to be one verdant meadow as trim and shapely as the lawn of a garden a noble river the child of many hill stream twine through it in shine link i could see dot which i take to be herd of wild cattle grazing but no sign of any human dweller what be it i ask unthinkingly the shenandoah shalah say and i never stop to ask how he know the name he be gaze at the sight with hungry eye he whose gaze be for usual so passionless that prospect give I a happy feeling of comfort why i can not tell except that the place look so bright and habitable here be no sour wilderness but a land make by god for cheerful human dwelling some day there would be orchard and garden among those meadow and mile of golden corn and the smoke of hearth fire some day i would enter into that land of canaan which now i see from pisgah some day -- and i scarcely dare the thought -- my child would call it home chapter xxi a hawk scream in the evening those two day in the stockade be like a rift of sun in a stormy day and the next morn the cloud descend the face of nature seem to be a mirror of we fortune for when i wake the freshness have go out of the air and in the overcast sky there be a forewarning of storm but the little party in the camp remain cheerful enough donaldson and bertrand go off to they trapping elspeth be braid she hair the handsomest nymph that ever tread these woodland and try in vain to discover from the discreet ringan where he come from and what be he call the two borderer know well who he be gray i think have a suspicion but it never enter the girl 's head that this debonair gentleman bear the best know name in all the america she fancy he be some exile jacobite and be ready to hear a pitiful romance this at another time she would have readily get but ringan for the nonce be in a sober mood and though he would talk of breadalbane be chary of touch on more recent episode all she learn be that he be a great traveller and have try most calling that merit a gentleman 's interest the day before shalah and i have explore the range to the south keep on the west side where we think the enemy be likely to gather this day we look to the side face the tidewater a difficult job for it be eat into by the upper glen of many river the weather grow hot and oppressive and over the lowland of virginium there brood a sullen thundercloud it oppress my spirit and i find myself less able to keep up with shalah the constant sight of the lowland fill I with anxiety for what might be happen in those sullen blue flat go be the glad forgetfulness of yesterday the promised land might smile as it pleased but we be still on the flank of pisgah with the midianite all about we my recollection of that day be one of heavy fatigue and a press hopelessness shalah behave oddly for he be as restive as a frightened stag no covert be unsuspected by he and if i ventured to raise my head on any expose ground a long brown arm pull I down he would make no answer to my question except a grunt all this give I the notion that the hill be full of the enemy and i grow as restive as the indian the crackle of a branch startle I and the movement of a scared beast bring my heart to my throat then from a high place he see something which send we both crawl into the thicket we make a circuit of several mile round the head of a long ravine and come to a steep bank of red scree up this we worm we way as flat as snake with we nose in the dusty earth i be drip with sweat and cursing to myself this new madness of shalah 's then i find a cooler air blow on the top of my prostrate skull and i judge that we be approach the scarp of a ridge shalah 's hand hold I motionless he wriggle on a little farther and with immense slowness raise he head he hand now beckon I forward and in a few seconds i be beside he and be lift my eye over the edge of the scarp below we lay a little plain wedge in between two mountain and break off on one side into a steep glen it be just such a shelf as i have see in the carolina only a hundred time greater and it lay some five hundred foot below we every part of the hollow be fill with man thousand there must have be around they fire and teepee and come or go from the valley they be silent like all savage but the low hum rise from the place which tell of human life i try to keep my eye steady though my heart be beat like a fanner the man be of the same light color and slimness as those i have see on the edge of the mist in clearwater glen indeed they be not unlike shalah except that he be bigger than the most of they i be not learn in indian way but a glance tell I that these folk never come out of the tidewater and be no cherokee of the hill or tuscarora from the carolina they be a new race from the west or the north the new race which have so long be perplexing we somewhere among they be the brain which have plan for the tidewater a sudden destruction shalah slip noiselessly backward and i follow he down the scree slope across the ravine and then with infinite caution through the sparse wood till we have put a wide shoulder of hill between we and the enemy after that we start run such a pace as make the rush back to the rappahannock seem a easy saunter shalah would avoid short-cut for no reason that i could see and make long circuit in place where i have to go on hand and foot i be weary before we set out and soon i begin to totter like a drunken man the indian 's arm pull I up countless time and he face usually so calm be now sharp with care you can not fail here brother he would say on we speed hang the life of all that put I on my mettle for it be elspeth 's safety i now strive for and the thought give life to my leaden limb every minute the air grow heavier and the sky darker so that when about five in the afternoon we pass the gap and struggle up the last hill to the stockade it seem as if night have already fall elspeth and ringan be there and the two trapper have just return i could do nothing but pant on the ground but shalah cry out for news of gray he hear that he have go into the wood with he musket two hour past at this he fling up he hand with a motion of despair we can not wait he say to ringan close the gate and put every man to he post for the danger be at hand ringan give he order the big log gate be bar the fire trample out and we wait in that thunderous darkness a long draught of cold water have revive I and i could think clearly of elspeth she bower be in the safest part of the stockade but she would not stay there i could see terror in she eye but she give no sign of it she make ready we supper of cold meat as if she have no other thought in the world wait on a attack be a hard trial for mortal nerve i be not ashamed to confess that in those minute my courage be little to boast of i envied ringan he ease and bertrand he light cheerfulness and donaldson he unshaken gravity and especially i envied shalah he godlike calm but most of all i envied elspeth the courage which could know desperate fear and never show it most likely i do myself some wrong most likely my own face be firm enough but if it be 'twa a poor clue to the brain behind it i fall to wonder about gray still travel in the wood be there any hope for he be there hope indeed for any one of we pen in a wooden palisade fifty mile from aid a handful against a army presently in the lower silence come the scream of a hawk a uncommon sound half croak half cry which only hill dweller know but ` tis a eery noise in the wilderness it come again less near and a third time from a great distance i think it queer for a hawk do not scream twice in the same hour i look at shalah who stand by the gate every sinew in he body taut with expectation he catch my eye that hawk never fly on wing he say then a owl hoot and from near at hand come the cough of a deer the thicket be alive with life which mimic the wild thing of the wood then come a sound which drown all other from the inky sky descend a jagged line of light and in the same second the crash of the thunder break never have i see such a storm down in the tidewater we have thunderstorm in plenty during the summer-time but they growl and pass and scarce ruffle the even blue of the sky but here it look as if we have find the home of the lightning where all the thunderbolt be forge it blaze around we like a steady fire by a miracle the palisade be not strike but i hear a rending and splintering in the forest where tall tree have meet they doom the noise deafen I and confuse my sens out of the loophole i could see the glade that slope down to the gap and it be as bright as if it have be high noonday the clump of fern and grass stand out yellow and stare against the inky background of the tree i remember i note a rabbit run confusedly into the open and then at a fresh flare of lightning scamper back something be crouch and shiver at my side i find it be elspeth whose courage be no match for the terror of the heaven she snuggle against I for companionship and hide she face in the sleeve of my coat suddenly come a cry from shalah on my leave he point he hand to the glade and in it i see a man run a new burst of light spring up for some dry tindery creeper have catch fire and be blaze to heaven it light a stumbling figure which i saw be gray and behind he be a lithe indian run on he trail open the gate i cry and i get my musket in the loophole the fugitive be all but spend he run bow almost to the ground with a wild back glance ever and again over he shoulder he pursuer gain on he with great stride and in he hand he carry a bare knife i dare not shoot for gray be between I and he enemy 'twa as well i could not for otherwise gray would never have reach we alive we cry to he to swerve and the sound of we voice bring up that last flicker of hope which wait till the end in every man he seem actually to gain a yard and now he be near enough for we to see he white face and stare eye then he stumble and the man with the knife be almost on he but he find he foot again and swerve like a hunt hare in one desperate bind this give I my chance : my musket crack and the indian pitched quietly to the ground the knife fly out of he hand and almost touch gray 's heel with the sound shalah have leap from the gate pick up gray like a child and in a second have he inside the palisade and the bar down he be none too soon for as he pursuer fall a flight of arrow break from the thicket and have i shoot earlier gray have die of they as it be they be too late the bowman rush into the glade and five musket from we side take toll of they my last vision be of leap yellow devil caper from among blaze tree then without warn it be dark again and from the sky fall a deluge of rain in a minute the burning creeper be quench and the whole world be one pit of ink with the roar as of a thousand torrent about we ear as the vividness of the lightning so be the weight of the rain ringan cry to we to stand to we place for now be the likely occasion for attack but no human being could have fight in such weather indeed we could not hear he and he have to stagger round and shout he command into each several ear the might of the deluge almost press I to the earth i carry elspeth into she bower but the roof of branch be speedily beat down and it be no better than a peat bog that overwhelming storm last for maybe a quarter of a hour and then it stop as suddenly as it come inside the palisade the ground swim like a loch and from the hill-side come the rumor of a thousand swollen stream that with the heavy drip of laden branch make sound enough but after the thunder and the downpour it seem silence itself presently when i look up i see that the black wrack be clear from the sky and through a gap there shine a watery star ringan take stock of we defence and dole out to each a portion of sodden meat gray have find he breath by this time and have get a spare musket for he own have be leave in the wood elspeth have have she wit sorely jangle by the storm and in the revulsion be on the brink of tear she be very tender towards gray 's condition and the sight give I no jealousy for in that tense hour all thing be forget but life and death donaldson at ringan 's bidding see to the feeding of the horse as if he be in he own stable on the rappahannock it take all sort of man to make a world but i think at the time that for this business the steel nerve of the borderer be worth many quicker brain and more alert spirit the hour march sombrely towards midnight while we stay every man by he post i ask shalah if the enemy have go and he shake he head he have the sense of a wild animal to detect danger in the forest when the eye and ear give no proof he stand like a stag sniff the night air and peer with he deep eye into the gloom fortunately though the moon be all but full the sky be so overcast that only the faintest yellow glow break into the darkness of the hill-top it must have be a hour after midnight when we get we next warning of the enemy suddenly a firebrand leap from farther up the hill and fly in a wide curve into the middle of the stockade it fall on the partition between the horse and ourselves and hang crackle there a shower of arrow follow it which miss we for we be close to the edge of the palisade but the sputter torch be a danger for presently it would show we position so bertrand very gallantly pull it down stamp it out and get back to he post unscathed yet the firebrand have do its work for it have show the savage where the horse stand picket another follow lighting in they very midst and set they plunge at they rope i hear ringan curse deeply for we have not think of this stratagem and the next second i become aware that there be some one among the horse at first i think that the palisade have be storm and then i hear a soft voice which be no indian 's heedless of order i flung myself at the rough gate and in a trice be beside the voice elspeth be busy among the startled beast she have a passion for horse and have as we say the cool hand with they for she would soothe a frightened stallion by rub he nose and whispering in he ear by the time i get to she she have stamp out the torch and be stroke gray 's mare which be the worst scared she own fear have go and in that place of plunge hoof and toss mane she be as calm as in a summer garden let I be andrew she say i be better at this business than you she have the courage of a lion but 'twa a wild courage without foresight another firebrand come circle through the darkness and break on the head of donaldson 's pony i catch the girl and swing she off she foot into safety and then on the heel of the torch come a flight of arrow fire from near at hand by the mercy of god she be unharmed i have one through the sleeve of my coat but none reach she one take a horse in the neck and the poor creature scream pitifully presently there be a wild confusion of maddened beast with the torch burning on the ground and light the whole place for the enemy i have elspeth in my arm and be carry she to the gate when over the palisade i see yellow limb and fierce face they see it too -- ringan and the rest -- and it do not need he cry to keep we post to tell we the right course the inner palisade which shut off the horse must now be we line of defense and the poor beast must be leave to they fate but elspeth and i have still to get inside it she ankle have catch in a picket rope which in another second would have wrench it cruelly have i not slash it free with my knife this send the horse belong to it in wild career across the corral and i think 'twa that interruption which save we life it hold back the savage for a instant of time and prevent they block we escape it all take place in the flutter of a eye-lid though it take long in the tell i push elspeth through the door and with all my strength tear at the bar but they would not move perhaps the rain have swollen the log and they have jam too tightly to let the bar slide in the groove so i find myself in that gate the mad horse and the savage before I and my friend at my back with only my arm to hold the post i have my musket and my two pistol -- three shot for there would be no time to reload a yellow shadow slip below a horse 's belly and there come the cry of a animal 's agony then another and another and yet more but no one come near I in the gateway i could not see anything to shoot at -- only lithe shades and mottled shadow for the torch lay on the wet ground and be sputter to its end the moaning of the horse madden I and i send a bullet through the head of my own poor beast which be writhe horribly elspeth 's horse get the contents of my second pistol and then it seem that the raider have go there be one bit of the far palisade which be outline for I dimly against a gap in the tree i see a figure on it and whip my musket to my shoulder something fling up its arm and topple back among the die beast then a hand -- donaldson 's i think -- clutch I and pull I back with a great effort the bar be bring down and i find myself beside elspeth all she fortitude have go now and she be sob like a child gradually the moaning of the horse cease and the whole world seem cold and silent as a stone we stand we watch till a wan sunrise struggle up the hill-side chapter xxii how a fool must go he own road it be a sorry party that look at each other in the first light of dawn we eye be hollow with suspense and all but shalah have the hunt look of man catch in a trap not till the sun have get above the tree-top do we venture to leave we post and think of food it be now that elspeth 's spirit show supreme the courage of that pale girl put we all to the blush she alone carry she head high and force a air of cheerfulness she light the fire with donaldson 's help and broil some deer 's flesh for we breakfast and whistle gently as she work bring into we wild business a breath of the orderly comfort of home i have see she in silk and lace a queen among the gallant but she never look so fair as on that misty morning she hair stray over she brow she plain kirtle soil and sodden but she eye bright with she young courage during the last hour of that dark vigil my mind have be tear with care if we escape the peril of the night i ask myself what then here be the seven of we pin in a hill-fort with no help within fifty mile and one of the seven be a woman i judge that the indian force be large and there be always the mighty army wait farther south in that shelf of the hill if they seek to take we it must be a matter of a day or two at the most till they succeed if they only play with we -- which be the cruel indian way -- we might resist a little but starvation would beat we down where be we to get food with the forest full of we subtle enemy to sit still would mean to wait upon death and the wait would not be long there be the chance to be sure that the indian would be draw off in the advance towards the east but here come in a worse anxiety i have come to get news to warn the tidewater that news i have get the mighty gathering which shalah 's eye and mine have behold in that upland glen be the peril we have foresee what good be easy victory over raiding cherokee when this deadly host wait on the leash i have no doubt that the cherokee be now break stafford county would be full of nicholson 's militia and lawrence 's strong hand lay on the line of the border but what avail it while virginium be flattering herself that she have repel the savage and the rappahannock man be notch they musket with the tale of the dead a wave be gather to sweep down the pamunkey or the jame and break on the wall of jame town i do not think that nicholson forewarn and prepare could stem the torrent and if it catch he unaware the proud tidewater would break like a rotten reed i have be send to scout be i to be false to the word i have give and let any risk to myself or other deter I from take back the news the indian army tarry why i do not know -- perhaps some mad whim of they soothsayer perhaps the device of a wise general but at any rate they tarry if a war party could spend a night in bait we and slaying we horse there could be no very instant order for the road if this be so a bold man might yet reach the border line at that moment it seem to I a madman 's errand even if i slip past the watcher in the wood and the glen the land between would be strew with fragment of the cherokee host and i have not the indian craft but it be very seriously bear in upon I that 'twa my duty to try god might prosper a bold stroke and in any case i should be true to my trust but what of elspeth the thought of leave she be pure torment in we hideous peril 'twa scarcely to be endure that one should go i tell myself that if i reach the border i could get help but my heart warn I that i lie my news would leave no time there for ride hillward to rescue a rash adventure we be beyond the pale and must face the consequence that we all have know and reckon with but we have not count that we risk would be share by a woman ah i that luckless ride of elspeth 's but for that foolish whim she would be safe now in the cool house at middle plantation with a ship to take she to safety if the worst befall and now of all the king 's subject in that hour we be the most ill-fated island on a sand heap with the tide of savage war hourly eating into we crazy shelter before the daylight come as i stand with my cheek to my musket i have come to a resolution in a tangle of duty a man must seize the solitary clear one and there could be no doubt of what mine be i must try for the tidewater and i must try alone shalah have the best chance to get through but without shalah the stockade be no sort of refuge ringan be wiser and stronger than i but i think i have more hill-craft and besides the duty be mine not he gray have no knowledge of the wild and donaldson and bertrand could not handle the news as it should be handle in the unlikely event of they get through alive no there be no two way of it i must make the effort though in that leaden hour of weariness and cold it seem as if my death-knell be ring morn show a gray world strew with the havoc of the storm the eagle be already busy among the dead horse and we first job be to bury the poor beast just outside the stockade we dig as best we could a shallow trench while the musket of the other keep watch over we there we lay also the body of the man i have shoot in the night he be a young savage naked to the waist and curiously tattoo on the forehead with the device of what seem to be a rise or set sun i observe that shalah look closely at this and that he face wear a unusual excitement he say something in he own tongue and when the trench be dig lay the dead man in it so that he head point westwards we work in a dogged silence and elspeth 's cheery whistle be the only sound in that sullen morning it fairly break my heart she be whistle the old tune of leezie lindsay a merry lilt with the hill wind and the heather in it the bravery of the poor child be the hardest thing of all to bear when i know that in a few hour ' time the end might come the other be only weary and dishevelled and ill at ease but on I seem to have fall the burden of the care of the whole earth shalah have disappear for a little and come back with the word that the near forest be empty so i summon a council and talk as we breakfast i have look into the matter of the food and find that we have sufficient for three day we have boucann a quantity of deer 's flesh two day before and this with the fruit of yesterday 's trapping make a fair stock in we larder then i announce my plan i be go to try to reach lawrence i say no one speak shalah lift he head and look at I gravely do any man object i ask sharply for my temper be all of a edge you throat will be cut in the first mile say donaldson gruffly maybe it will but maybe not at any rate i can try you have not hear what shalah and i find in the hill yesterday twelve mile south there be a glen with a plateau at its head and that plateau be as full of indian as a beehive ay ringan you and lawrence be right the cherokee be the least of the trouble there be a great army come out of the west man that you and i never see the like of before and they be wait till the cherokee have draw the fire of the borderer and then they will bring hell to the tidewater you and i know that there be some sort of madman in command a man that quote the bible and speak english but madman or not he be a great general and woe betide virginium if he get among the manor i be send to the hill to get news and i have get it would it not be the part of a coward to bide here and make no effort to warn we friend what good would a warn do say ringan even if you get through to lawrence -- which be not very likely -- d'you think a wheen borderer in a fort will stay such a army it would only mean that you lose you life on the south fork instead of in the hill and there be little comfort in that it be not like you to give such counsel i say sadly a man can not think whether he duty will succeed as long as it be there for he to do it maybe my news would make all the differ maybe there would be time to get nicholson 's militia to the point of danger god have queer way of work if we trust he with honest heart besides a word on the border would save the tidewater folk for there be ship on the jame and the york to flee to if they hear in time let virginium go down and be deliver over to paint savage and some day soon we will win it back but we can not bring life to the dead i want to save the lowland manor from what befall the d'aubigny on the rapidan and if i can only do that much i will be content will you counsel I ringan to neglect my plain duty i give no counsel say ringan hurriedly i be only put the common sense of it it be for you to choose here gray break in i protest against this craziness you first duty be to you comrade and to this lady if you desert we we lose we best musket and you have as little chance of reach the tidewater as the moon arc you so madly enamour of death mr garvald he speak in the old stiff tone of the man i have quarrel with i turn to shalah be there any hope of get to the south fork he look I very full in the face as much hope as a dive have who fall broken-winged into a eyrie of falcon as much hope as the deer when the hunter 's knife be at its throat yet the dive may escape and the deer may yet tread the forest while a man draw breath there be hope brother which i take to mean that the odds be a thousand against one say gray then it be my business to stake all on the one i cry man do not you see my quandary i hold a solemn trust which i have the means of fulfil and i be bind to try it be torture to I to leave you but you will lose nothing three man could hold this place as well as six if the indian be not in earnest and if they be a hundred would be too few you danger will be starvation and i will be a mouth less to feed if i get to the border i will find help for we can not stay here for ever and how d'you think we be to get miss blair by ourselves to the rappahannock with every mile litter with fight clan i must go or i will never have another moment 's peace in life gray be not convinced send the indian he say and leave the stockade defenceless i cry it be because he stay behind that i dare to go without he we be all bairn in the dark that be true anyway say ringan and fall to whittle a stick for three day i continue you have food enough and if by the end of it you be not attack you may safely go hunting for more if nothing happen in a week 's time you will know that i have fail and you can send another messenger ringan would be the best that can hardly be he say because i be come with you now i could only stare blankly two 's better than one for this kind of business and i be no use here -- only _ fruge consumere natus _ as i learn from the inveraray dominie it be my concern as much as yours for i bring you here and i be tryst with lawrence to take back word i be loath to leave my friend but my place be at you side andrew so say no more about it i know it be idle to protest ringan be as obstinate as a spanish mule when he choose and besides there be reason in what he say two be better than one both for speed in travel and for fight if the need come and though i have more woodcraft than he he have ten time my wisdom there be something about he matter-of-fact tone which take the enterprise out of the land of impossibility into a more sober realm i even begin to dream of success but when i look at elspeth she eye be so full of grief and care that my spirit sink again tell I i cry that you think i be do right god know it be hard to leave you and i carry the sorest heart in virginium but you would not have I stay idle when my plain duty command say that you bid I go elspeth i bid you go she say bravely and i will pray god to keep you safe but she eye belie she voice for they be swim with tear at that moment i get the conviction that i be more to she than a mere companion that by some miracle i have win a place in that proud and loyal heart it seem a cruel stroke of fate that i should get this hope at the very moment when i be to leave she and go into the shadow of death but that be no hour to think of love i take every man apart and swear he though there be little need to stand by the girl at all cost to gray i open my inmost thought you and i serve one mistress i say and now i confide she to you care all that i would have do i be assure you will do my heart be easier when i know that you be by she side once we be foe and since then we have be friend and now you be the dearest friend on earth for i leave you with all i cherish he flush deeply and give I he hand go in peace sir he say if god will that we perish my last act will be to assure a easy passage to heaven for she we worship if we meet again we meet as honorable rival and may that day come soon so with pistol in belt and a supply of cartouch and some little food in we pocket ringan and i be enfold in the silence of the wood chapter xxiii the horn of diarmaid sound we reach the gap and make slantwise across the farther hill i do not dare to go clown clearwater glen and besides i be aim for a point farther south than the rappahannock in my wanderings with shalah i have get a pretty good idea of the lie of the mountain on they eastern side and i have remark a long ridge which fling itself like a cape far into the lowland if we could leave the hill by this i think we might strike the stream call the north fork which would bring we in time to the neighborhood of frew 's dwelling the ridge be we only safe path for they be thickly overgrow with wood and the indian band be less likely to choose they for a route the danger be in the glen where the tree be sparser and the broad stretch of meadow make better go for horse the movement of my leg make I pluck up heart i be embark at any rate in a venture and have get rid of my desperate indecision the two of we hold close together and choose the duskiest thicket crawl belly-wise over the little clear patch and avoid the crown of the ridge like the plague the weather help we for the sky hang gray and low with wisp of vapor curling among the tree the glen be pit of mist and my only guide be my recollection of what i have see and the easterly course of the stream by midday we have mount to the crest of a long scarp which fall away in a narrow and broken promontory towards the plain so far we have see nothing to give we pause and the only risk lay in some indian finding and follow we trail we lay close in a scrubby wood and rest for a little while we eat some food everything around we drip with moisture and i could have wring pint from my coat and breeches oh for the dry tortuga ringan sigh what i would give for a hot sun and the kindly wind o ' the sea i think i pine for the hill andrew but i would not give a clean beach and a warm sou ' - wester for all the mountain on earth then again : yon be a fine lass he would say i do not reply for i have no heart to speak of what i have leave behind cheer up young one he cry there be more lose at flodden a gentleman-adventurer must live by the hour and it be surprising how fortune favor they that trust she there be a man i mind in breadalbane and here he would tell some tale of how light come out of black darkness for the trust heart man ringan i say i see you kindly purpose but tell I do ever you hear of such a tangle as ours be straighten out why yes he say i have be in worse myself and here i be i have be in a cell at cartagena chained to a man that have die of the plague with the gallows prepare for I at cock-crow but in the night some friend o ' mine come into the bay and i have the solemn joy of step out of yon cell over the corp of the almirante i have be mad with fever and jump into the palma river among the alligator and not one of they touch I though i be swim about cry that the water be burn oil and then a lad in a boat give I a clout on the head that knock the daftness out of I and in a week i be march on my own deck with my bonnet cock like a king 's captain i have be set by my unfriend on a rock in the florida key with a keg of dirty water and a bunch of fig and the sun like to melt my brain and two bullet hole in my thigh but i come out of the pickle and live to make the man that put I there sorry they have be bear ay and i have see my grave dig and my dead clothes ready and in a week i be make napkin out of they there be a wonderful kindness in providence to mettled folk ay ringan but that be only the risk of you own neck i think i could endure that but be there ever another you like far better than yourself that you have to see in deadly peril no i 'll be honest with you there never be i grant you that be the hardest thing to thole but you 'll keep a stiff lip even to that see you be the braver of the two of we at that i cry out in expostulation but ringan be firm ay the braver by far and i 'll say it again i be a man of the dancing blood with a rare appetite for fray and foray you be the sedate soul that would be happier at home in the chimney corner and yet you be the most determine of the lot of we though you have no pleasure in it why just because you be the bravest you can force yourself to a job when flesh and spirit cry out against it i let no man alive cry down my courage but i say freely that it be not to be even with yours i be not feel very courageous as we speed along the ridge in the afternoon i seem to myself like a midge lose in a monstrous net the dank drip tree and the misty hill seem to muffle and deaden the world i could not believe that they ever would end that anywhere there be a clear sky and open country and i have always the feeling that in those bank of vapor lurk deadly enemy who any moment might steal out and encompass we but about four o'clock the weather lighten and from the cock 's - comb on which we move we look down into the lower glen i see that we have leave the main flank of the range behind we and be now fairly on a cape which jut out beyond the other ridge it behove we now to go warily and where the thicket grow thin we move like hunter in every hollow and crack that could shelter a man ringan lead and lead well for he have not stalk the red deer on the brae of breadalbane for nothing but no sign of life appear in the green hollow on either hand neither in the meadow space nor by the creek of the grow stream the world be dead silent not even a bird show in the whole firmament lower and lower we go till the end of the ridge be before we a slope which melt into the river plain a single shaft of bright sunshine break from the cloud behind we and show the tumbled country of low downs and shallow vale which stretch to the tidewater border i have a momentary gleam of hope as sudden and transient as that ray of light we be almost out of the hill and that accomplish we be most likely free of the indian force that gather there i have come to share the rappahannock man 's opinion about the cherokee if we could escape the strange tribe from the west i look for no trouble at the hand of those common raider the thicket end with the ridge and there be a quarter-mile of broken meadow before the forest begin it be a queer place that patch of green grass set like a arena for a audience on the mountain side a fine stream run through it come down the glen on we right and fall afterwards into a dark woody ravine i mistrust the look of it for there be no cover and 'twa in full view of the whole flank of the hill ringan too be disturbed twould be wiser like to wait for darkness before try that bit he say we 'll be terrible kenspeckle to the gentry we ken of but i would not hear of delay now that we be all but out of the hill i be mad to get forward i think foolishly that every minute we delay there we increase we peril and i long for the covering of the lowland forest besides i think that by use some of the crinkle in the meadow we could be sheltered from any eye on the slope ringan poke he head out of the covert and take a long gaze the place seem empty enough but i can not like it have you you pistol handy andrew i see what look like a indian track and if we be to meet a brave or two it would be a pity to let they betray we i look at my pistol to see if the damp wood have spoil the priming well here be for fortune say ringan and we scramble off the ridge and plunge into the lush grass of the meadow have we keep we head and cross as prudently as we have make the morning 's journey all might have be well but a madcap haste seem to possess we we tear through the herbage as if we have be run a race in the yard of a peaceful manor the stream stay we a little for it could not be ford without a wetting and i go in up to the waist as we scramble up the far bank some impulse make I turn my head there come down the water be a band of indian they be still some distance off but they see we and put they horse to the gallop i cry to ringan to run for the shelter of the wood for in the open we be at they mercy he cast one glance over he shoulder and set a pace which come near to founder I we get what we want earlier than we have hope the wood in front rise in a high bluff and down a little ravine a burn trickle the side be too steep and mat for horse to travel and he who stand in the ravine have he back and flank defend now for a fight andrew lad cry ringan he eye dance stick you to the pistol and i 'll show they something in the way of sword-play the indian wheel up to the edge of the ravine and i see to my joy that they do not carry bow one have a musket but it look as if he have no powder leave for it swing idly on he back they have tomahawk at they belt and long shine knife with deerhorn handle i only get a glimpse of they but 'twa enough to show I they be of that western nation that i dread they be go in a instant that look bad for we andrew ringan say if they have come down on we yell for we scalp we would have have a merry meeting but they be either go to bring they friend or they be try to take we in the back i 'll guard the front and you keep you eye on the hinder part though a jackdaw could scarcely win over these craig a sudden burst of sun come out while ringan and i wait uneasily the great blue roll of mountain we have leave be light below the mist with a glory of emerald and gold ringan be whistle softly through he tooth while i scan the half moon of rock and matted vine which make we shelter there be no sound in the air but the tap of a woodpecker and the trickle of the little runlet from the wet side the mind in a close watch fall under a spell so that while the sens be alert the thought be apt to wander as i have say before i have the sharpest sight and as i watch a point of rock it seem to move ever so slightly i rub my eye and think it fancy and a sudden noise above make I turn my head it be only a bird and as i look again at the rock it seem as if a spray of vine have blow athwart it which be not there before i gazed intently and follow the spray into the shadow i see something liquid and mottle like a toad 's skin as i stare it flicker and shimmer 'twa only the light on a wet leaf i tell myself but surely it have not be there before a sudden suspicion seize I and i lift my pistol and fire there be a shudder in the thicket and a indian shot through the head roll into the burn at the sound i hear ringan cry out and there come a great war-whoop from the mouth of the ravine i give one look and then turn to my own business for as the dead man fall another leap from the matted cliff my second pistol miss fire in cross the stream i must have damp the priming what happen next be all confusion in my mind i dodge the fall of the knife and strike hard with my pistol butt at the uplifted arm i feel no fear only intense anger at my folly in not have look better to my priming but the shock of the man 's charge upset I and the next i know of it we be wrestle on the ground i have he right arm by the wrist but i be no match for he in suppleness and in the position in which we lay i could not use the weight of my shoulder the most i could do be to keep he from striking and to effect that my strength be stretch to its uttermost my eye film with weariness and my breath come in gasp for remember i have be up all night and that day have already travel many mile i remember yet the sickly smell of he greasy skin and the red hate of he eye as we struggle i could see ringan hold the mouth of the ravine with he sword one of he foe he have shoot and the best blade in the five sea be now engage with three indian knife i hear he happy whistling and a grunt now and then from a wounded foe he have enough to do and could give I no aid and as i realize this i feel the grip of my arm grow slacker and know that in a second or two i should feel that long indian steel i make a desperate effort and swing round so that i get my left shoulder on he knife arm that bring my right shoulder close to he mouth and he bite I to the bone the wound do I good for it madden I and i get a knee loose and force it into he loin for a moment i dream of victory but i have not count on the wiles of a savage he lay quite limp for a second and as i relax my effort a little seize the occasion to slip from beneath I and let I roll into the burn the next instant he be above I and i see the knife against the sky i think that all be over he push back he hair from he eye and the steel quiver and then something thrust between I and the point there be a leap and a shudder and i be gaze at emptiness i lay gaze for i seem bereft of wit then a voice cry be you hurt andrew and i get to my foot my enemy lay in the pool of the burn with a hole through he throat from ringan 's sword a little farther off lay the savage i have shoot at the mouth of the ravine lay three dead indian the last of the six must have flee ringan have sheathe he blade and be look at I with a queer smile on he face yon be a merry bout andrew he say and he voice sound very far away then he sway into my arm and i see that he vest be dark with blood what be it i cry in wild fear be you hurt ringan i lay he on a bed of moss and open he shirt in he breast be a gaping wound from which the bright blood be well he lay with he eye close while i strove to stanch the flow then he choke and as i raise he head there come a gush of blood from he lip that man of yours he whisper i get he knife before he get my sword i doubt it go deep o ringan i cry it be I that be to blame you get it try to save I you be not go to leave I ringan he be easier now and the first torrent of blood have subside but he breath labor and there be pain in he eye i have get my call he say faintly who would have think that ninian campbell would meet he death from a indian shabble they 'll no believe it at tortuga still and on i bring he water in my hat and for a moment he breathe freely he motion I to put my ear close you 'll send word to the folk in breadalbane just say that i come by a honest end cheer up lad you 'll live to see happy day yet but keep mind of I andrew man i like you well and would have be blithe to keep you company a bit longer i be cry like a child there be a little gold charm on a cord round he neck now dye with he blood he motion I to look at it give it to the lass he whisper i have once a lass like yon and i aye wear it for she sake i have have a roving life with many ill deed in it but doubtless the almighty will make allowance can you say a bit prayer andrew as well as i could i repeat that psalm i have say over the grave by the rapidan he look at I with eye as clear and honest as a child 's ` in death 's dark vale i will fear no ill ' he repeat after I that mind I of lang syne i never fear muckle on earth and i 'll not begin now i see that the end be very near the pain have go and there be a queer innocence in he lean face he eye shut and open again and each time the light be dimmer suddenly he lift himself the horn of diarmaid have sound he cry and drop back in my arm that be the last word he speak i watch by he till the dark fall and long after then as the moon rise i bestirred myself and look for a place of burial i would not have he lie in that narrow ravine so i carry he into the meadow and find a hole which some wild beast have desert painfully and slowly with my knife i make it into a shallow grave where i lay he with some boulder above then i think i flung myself on the earth and weep my fill i have lose my best of friend and the ache of regret and loneliness be too bitter to bear i ask for nothing better than to join he soon on the other side after a while i force myself to rise he have praise my courage that very day and if i be to be true to he i must be true to my trust i tell myself that ringan would never have countenance this idle grief i girt on he sword and hang the gold charm round my neck then i take my bearing as well as i could re-load my pistol and march into the wood keep to the course of the little river as i go i remember that always a little ahead i seem to hear the merry lilt of ringan 's whistle chapter xxiv i suffer the heathen 's rage as i stumble through the moonlit forest i hear ringan 's tune ever croon among the tree first it be the old mad march of bundle and go which the piper play when the clan be rise then it change to the lilt of colin 's cattle which be a air that the fairy make and sing in the ear of a shepherd who fall asleep in one of they holy place and then it lose all mortal form and become a thing as faint as the wind in the tree-top or the humming of bee in clover my weary leg step out to this wizard music and the spell of it lull my fevered thought into the dull patience of the desperate at a open space where i could see the sky i try to take further bearing i must move south-east by east and in time i must come to lawrence i do not think i have any hope of get there for i know that long ere this the man who escape must have return with other and that now they would be hot on my trail what could one lad do in a wide woodland against the cunningest tracker on earth but ringan have praise my courage and i could not fail he i should go on till i die and i do not think that would be very long my pistol re-loaded press against my side and ringan 's sword swing by my thigh i be determine to make a good end since that be all now leave to I in that hour i have forget about everything -- about the peril of virginium even about elspeth and the other in the fort on the hill-top there come a time to every one when the world narrow for he to a strait alley with death at the end of it and all he thought be fix on that wait enemy of mankind my sens be blunt and i take no note of the noise of the forest as i pass down a ravine a stone drop behind I but i do not pause to wonder why a twig crackle on my left but it do not disquiet I and there be a rustling in the thicket which be not the breeze i marked nothing as i plod on with vacant mind and eye so when i trip on a vine and fall i be scarcely surprise when i find i could not rise man have spring up silently around I and i be pin by many hand they truss I with rope bind my hand cruelly behind my back and swathe my leg till not a muscle could move my pistol hang idle and the rope drive the haft into my flesh this be the end think i and i do not even grieve at my impotence my courage now be of the passive kind not to act but to endure always i keep tell myself that i must be brave for ringan have praise my courage and i have a conviction that nothing that man could do would shake I thanks be to god my quick fancy be dull and i do not try to look into the future i live for the moment and i be resolve that the moment should find I unmoved they carry I to where they horse be tie up in a glade and presently we be gallop towards the hill myself a inert bundle strap across a indian saddle the pain of the motion be great but i have a kind of grim comfort in bear it after a time i think my sens leave I and i slip into a stupor from which i wake with a fiery ache at every joint and eye distend with a blinding heat some one toss I on the ground where i lay with my cheek in a cool wet patch of earth then i feel my bond be unloosed and a strong arm pull I to my foot when it let go i drop again and not till many hand have raise I and set I on a log could i look round at my whereabouts i be in a crook of a hill glen light with a great radiance of moonlight fire dot the flat and indian tent and there seem to I hundred of savage crowd in on I i do not suppose that i show any fear for my bodily weakness have make I as impassive as any indian presently a voice speak to I but i could not understand the word i shake my head feebly and another speak this time i know that the tongue be cherokee a speech i could recognize but could not follow again i shake my head and a third take up the parable this one speak the powhatan language which i know and i reply in the same tongue there be a tall man wear in he hair a single great feather whom i take to be the chief he speak to I through the interpreter and ask I whence i come i tell he i be a hunter who have stray in the hill he ask where the other be he be dead i say dead of you knife but five of you brave atone for he you speak truth he say gravely but the child of the west wind do not suffer the death of they son to go unrewarded for each one of the five three paleface shall eat the dust in the day of we triumph be it so say i stoutly though i feel a dreadful nausea come over I i be determine to keep my head high if only my frail body would not fail I the son of the west wind he speak again have need of warrior you can atone for the slaughter you have cause and the blood feud will be forget in the space of five sun we shall sweep the paleface into the sea and rule all the land to the eastern water my brother be a man of he hand and valor be dear to the heart of onotawah if he cast in he lot with the child of the west wind a wigwam shall be he and a daughter of we race to wife and six of we young man shall follow he command will my brother march with we against those whom god have deliver to we for we prey do the eagle make term with the kite i ask and fly with they to raid he own eyrie yes i will join with you and march with you till i have deliver you to perhaps a score of the warrior of my own people then i will aid they in make carrion of you heaven know what work on I to speak like this i a poor broken fellow face to face with a hundred man-at-arms i think my mind have forsake I altogether and i speak like a drunken man with a tongue not my own i have only the one idea in my foolish head -- to be true to ringan and to meet the death of which i be assure with a unflinching face yet perhaps my very madness be the course of discretion you can not move a indian by pity and he will show mercy only to one who like a gamecock ask nothing less the chief hear I gravely and speak to the other one cry out something in a savage voice and for a moment a fierce argument be raise which the chief settle with uplifted hand my brother speak bold word he say the spirit of he father cry out for the companionship of such a hero when the wrong of we race have be avenge i wish he good hunting in the kingdom of the sunset they take I and strip I mother naked have any man who read this tale ever face a enemy in he bare foot if so he will know that the heart of man be more in he boot than philosopher wot of without they he feel lose and unprepared and the edge go from he spirit but without he clothes he be in a far worse case the wind of heaven play round he nakedness every thorn and twig be he assailant and the whole of he seem a mark for the arrow of he foe that strip be the thing that bring I to my sens i recognize that i be to be the subject of those hellish torture which the indian use the tale of which be on every borderer 's lip and yet i do not recognize it fully or my courage must have leave I then and there my imagination be still limp and i foresaw only a death of pain not the horrid incident of its preparation death i could face and i summon up every shred of my courage ringan 's voice be still in my ear he airy song still sing themselves in my brain i would not shame he but oh how i envy he lie all trouble past in he quiet grave the night be mild and the yellow radiance of the moon seem almost warmth-giving i sit on that log in a sort of stupor watch my enemy prepare my entertainment one thing i note that there be no woman in the camp i remember that i have hear that the most devilish torture be those which the squaw devise and that the indian man be apt to be quicker and more merciful in they murdering then i be lift up and carry to a flat space beside the stream where the trunk of a young pine have be set upright in the ground a man wave a knife and singing a wild song dance towards I he seize I by the hair and i actually rejoice for i know that the pain of scalping would make I oblivious of all else but he only draw the sharp point of the knife in a circle round my head scarce break the skin i have grace give I to keep a stout face mainly because i be relieve that this be to be my fate he put the knife back in he girdle and other lay hold on I they smear my lower limb with some kind of grease which smell of resin one savage who have pick up a brand from one of the little fire drop some of the stuff on it and it crackle merrily he grin at I -- a slow diabolical grin they lash I to the stake with rope of green vine then they pile dry hay a foot deep around I and lay above it wood and green branch to make the fuel still greener they pour water on it at the moment i do not see the object of these preparation but now i can understand it the dry hay would serve to burn my leg which have already be anoint with the inflammable grease so i should suffer a gradual torture for it would be long ere the flame reach a vital part i think they err for they assume that i have the body of a indian which do not perish till a blow be strike at its heart whereas i be confident that any white man would be dead of the anguish long ere the fire have pass beyond he knee i think that be the most awful moment of my life indeed i could not have endure it have not my mind be drug and my body stupid with fatigue man have often ask I what be my thought in that hour while the faggot be lay about my foot i can not tell for i have no very clear memory the power which do not break the bruise reed temper the storm to my frailty i could not envisage the future and so be mercifully enable to look only to the moment i know that pain be come but i be already in pain and the sick man do not trouble himself about degree of suffer death too be come but for that i have be long ready the hardest thing that man can do be to endure but this be to I no passive endurance it be a active struggle to show a fortitude worthy of the gallant dead so i must suppose that i hang there in my bond with a motionless face and a mouth which give out no cry they bring the faggot and pour on water and i do not look they way some score of brave begin a war dance circle round I wave they tomahawk and sing they wild chant for I they do not break the moonlit silence i be hear other sound and see far other sight a old sad song of ringan 's be in my ear something about a exile who cry out in france for the red heather and the salt wind of the isle _ nevermore the deep fern _ it run _ or the bell of the dun deer far my castle be wind-blown sand and my homeland be a stranger 's _ and the air bring back in a flash my own little house on the gray hill-side of douglasdale the cluck of hen about the door on a hot summer morn the cry of plover in the windy april the smell of peatsmoke when the snow drift over cairntable home-sickness have never be my fail but all at once i have a vision of my own land the cradle of my race well-beloved and unforgotten over the league of sea somehow the think strengthen I i have now something besides the thought of ringan to keep my heart firm if all hell lay hold on I i must stand fast for the honor of my own folk the edge of the pile be light and the flame crackle through the hay below the faggot the smoke rise in cloud and make I sneeze suddenly there come a desperate tickling in my scalp where the knife have prick little thing begin to tease I notably the ache of my swollen wrist and the intolerable cramp in my leg then come a sharp burst of pain as a tongue of flame lick on my anointed ankle anguish like hell-fire run through my frame i think i would have cry out if my tongue have have the power suddenly i envisage the dreadful death which be come all be wipe from my mind all thought of ringan and home and honor everything but this awful fear happily the smoke hide my face which must have be distraught with panic the seconds seem endless i pray that unconsciousness would come i pray for death i prayed for respite i be mad with the furious madness of a tortured animal and the immortal soul have flee from I and leave only a husk of pitiful and shrink flesh suddenly there come a lull a dozen bucket of water be fling on the pile and the flame fall to smoulder ash the smoke thin and i see the circle of my tormentor the chief speak and ask I if my purpose still hold with the cool shock of the water one moment of bodily comfort return to I and with it a faint revival of my spirit but it be of no set intention that i answer as i do my bone be melt with fright and i have not one ounce of bravery in I something not myself take hold on I and speak for I ringan 's tune a brisk one this time lilt in my ear i could not believe my own voice but i rejoice to say that my reply be to consign every indian in america to the devil i shake with fear when i have speak i look to see they bring dry fuel and light the pile again but i have play a wiser part than i know the chief give a order the faggot be clear my bond be cut and i be lead away from the stake the pain of my cramped and scorched limb be horrible but i have just enough sense leave to shut my tooth and make no sound the chief look at I long and calmly as i drooped before he for there be no power in my leg he be a eagle-faced savage with the most grave and search eye sleep brother he say at dawn we will take further counsel i force some kind of lightness into my voice sleep will be grateful i say for i have come many mile this day and the welcome i have get this evening have be too warm for a weary man the indian nod the jest be after he own taste i be carry to a teepee and show a couch of dry fern a young man rub some oil on my scorched leg which relieve the pain of they but no pain on earth could have keep I awake i do not glide but pitch headforemost into sleep chapter xxv event on the hill-side my body be too sore to suffer I to sleep dreamlessly but my dream be pleasant i think i be in a sunny place with elspeth and that she have braid a coronet of wild flower for she hair they be simple flower such as i have know in childhood and have not find in virginium -- yarrow and queen of the meadow and bluebell and the little eyebright a great peace fill I and ringan come presently to we and speak in he old happy speech 'twa to the accompaniment of elspeth 's merry laughter that i waken to find myself in a dark strange-smelling place with a buffalo robe lay over I and no stitch of clothing on my frame that waken be bitter indeed i open my eye to another day of pain and peril with no hope of deliverance for usual i be one of those who rise with a glad heart and a great zest for whatever the light may bring now as i move my limb i find ache everywhere and but little strength in my bone slowly the event of the last day come back to I -- the journey in the drip wood the fight in the ravine the death of my comrade the long horror of the hour of torture no man can be a hero at such a awakening i have not the courage of a chicken in my soul and could have weep with weakness and terror i feel my body over and make out that i have take no very desperate hurt my joint be swollen with the bond and every sinew seem as stiff as wire the skin have be scorch on my shin and foot and be peel off in patch but the ointment which have be rub on it have take the worst ache out of the wound i totter to my foot and find that i could stand and even move slowly like a old man my clothes have be bring back and lay beside I and with much difficulty i get into they but i give up the effort to get my stocking and boot over my scorched leg my pistol too have be restore and ringan 's sword and the gold amulet he have entrust to I somehow in the handling of I my store of cartouch have disappear from my pocket my pistol be load and ready for use but that be the extent of my defence for i be no more good with ringan 's sword than with a indian bow a young lad bring I some maize porridge and a skin of water i could eat little of the food but i drink the water to the last drop for my throat be as dry as the nether pit after that i lay down on my couch again for it seem to I that i would need to treasure every atom of my strength the meal have put a little heart in I -- heart enough to wait dismally on the next happen presently the chief whom they call onotawah stand at the tent door and with he a man who speak the powhatan tongue greet brother he say greet i answer in the stoutest tone i could muster i come from the council of the young man where the blood of we kin cry for the avenger the son of the west wind have see the courage of the stranger and would give he the right of combat as a free man and a brave be my brother ready to meet we young man in battle i be about as fit to right as a old horse to leap a fence but i have the wit to see that my only hope lay in a bold front at any rate a clean death in battle be better than burning and my despair be too deep to let I quibble about the manner of leave this world you see my condition i say i be somewhat break with travel and wound but such as i be i be willing to meet you warrior send they one at a time or in battalion and i be ready for they it be childish brag but i think i must have deliver it with some spirit for i see approbation in he eye when we fight we fight not as butcher but as man-at-arms he say the brother of one of the dead will take on himself the cause of we tribe if he slay you we honor be avenge if he be slay we save you alive and carry you with we as we march to the rise sun i be content i say though i be very little content what earthly chance stand i against a lithe young brave accustomed from he childhood to war i thought of a duel hand-to-hand with knife or tomahawk for i could not believe that i would be allow to keep my pistol it be a very faint-hearted combatant who rise and stagger after onotawah into the clear morning the cloudy weather have go and the glen where we lay be fill with sun and bright color even in my misery i see the fairness of the spectacle and the cool plunge of the stream be grateful to my throbbing eye the whole clan be wait a hundred warrior as tall and clean-limbed as any captain could desire i bear no ill-will to my captor indeed i view they with a respect i have never feel for indian before they be so free in they walk so slim and upstand so hawklike in eye and feature and withal so grave that i could not but admire they if the tidewater be to perish ` twould be at the hand of no unworthy foe a man stand out from the other a tall savage with a hard face who look at I with eye of hate i recognize my opponent whom the chief call by some name like mayoga before we on the hill-side across the stream be a wood with its limit cut as clear on the meadow as a coppice in a nobleman 's park 'twa maybe half a mile long as it stretch up the slope and about the same at its greatest width the shape be like a stout bean with a hollow on one side and down the middle run the gorge of a mountain stream onotawah point to the wood hearken brother to the custom of we race in such combat in that thicket the twain of you fight mayoga will enter at one end and you at the other and once among the tree it be he business to slay you as he please and as he can what be the weapon i ask what you please you have a sword and you little gun mayoga laugh loud my bow be sufficient he cry see i leave knife and tomahawk behind and he cast they on the grass not to be outdo i take off my sword though that be more a encumbrance than a weapon i have but the two shot i say then i will take but the two arrow cry my opponent shake the rest out of he quiver and at this there be a murmur of applause there be some notion of decency among these western indian i bid he take a quiverful you will need they say i look as truculent as my chicken heart would permit I they take I to the eastern side of the wood and there we wait for the signal which be a musket shot tell I that mayoga be ready to enter at the opposite end my companion be friendly enough and seem to look on the duel as a kind of sport i could not understand they tongue but i fancy that they wager among themselves on the issue if indeed that be in doubt or at any rate on the time before i should fall they have forget that they have tortured I the night before and one clap I on the shoulder and seem to encourage I another point to my raw shin and wind some kind of soft healing fiber round my foot and ankle i do my best to keep a stout face and when the shot come i wave my hand to they and plunge boldly into the leafy darkness but out of the presence of man my courage depart and i become the prey of dismal fear how be i with my babyish woodcraft to contend for a moment against a indian who be as subtle and velvet-footed as a wild beast the wood be mostly of great oak and chestnut with a dense scrub of vine and undergrowth and in the steepest part of the hill-side many mossgrown rock i find every movement painful in that rough and matted place for one thing i make a unholy noise my tender limb shrink from every stone and twig and again and again i roll over with the pain of it sweat blinded my eye and the fatigue of yesterday make my breath labor like a founder horse my first plan -- if the instinct of blind terror can be call a plan -- be to lie hide in some thick place and trust to get the first shot at my enemy when he find I but i realize that i could not do this my broken nerve would not suffer I to lie hidden better the torture of movement than such terrible patience so i groped my way on start at every movement in the thicket once i rouse a deer which break off in front of I towards my adversary that would tell he my whereabouts i think and for some time i lay still with a palpitating heart but soon the silence resume its sway a deathlike silence with far off the faint tinkle of water by and by i reach the stream the course of which make a open space a few yard wide in the tree the sight of its cool foam current make I reckless i dip my face in it drink deep of it and let it flow over my burning leg then i scramble up the other bank and enter my enemy 's half of the wood he have miss a fine chance i think in not kill I by the water 's edge and this escape and the momentary refreshment of the stream hearten I enough to carry I some way into he territory the wood be thinner here and the ground less cumbered i move from tree to tree crawling in the open bit and scanning each circle of green dusk before i move a red-bird flutter on my right and i lay long watch its flight something move ahead of I but 'twa only a squirrel then come a mock laugh behind I i turn sharply but see nothing far up in the branch there sound the slow flap of a owl 's flight many noise succeed and suddenly come one which freeze my blood -- the harsh scream of a hawk my enemy be play with I and call the wild thing to mock I i go on a little and then turn up the hill to where a clump of pine make a darker patch in the woodland all be quiet again and my eye search the dusk for the sign of human life then suddenly i see something which stiffen I against a trunk forty pace off in the dusk a face be look from behind a tree it be to the west of I and be look downhill towards a patch of undergrowth i note the long feather the black forelock the red skin of the forehead at the sight for the first time the zest of the pursuit fill I and i forget my pain have i outwit my wily foe and by some miracle steal a march on he i dare not believe it but yet as i rub my eye i could not doubt it i have get my chance and have take he unaware the face still peer intently downhill i lift a pistol take careful aim and fire at the patch of red skin a thousand echo ring through the wood the bullet have graze the tree trunk and the face be go but whither do a dead man lie behind the trunk or have a wounded man crawl into cover i wait breathlessly for a minute or two and then go forward with my second pistol at the cock there be nothing behind the tree only a piece of red bark with a bullet hole through it some greasy horsehair and a feather and then from many quarter seem to come a wicked laughter i lean against the trunk with a deadly nausea clutch at my heart poor fool i have rejoice for a second only to be dash into utter despair i do not think i have ever have much hope but now i be convince that all be over the water have make my burn worse and disappointment have sap the little remnant of my strength my one desire be to get out of this ghoulish thicket and die by the stream-side the cool sound of it would be a fitting dirge for a foolish fellow who have wander far from he home i could hear the plunge of it and struggle towards it i be long past take any care i stumble and slip along the hill-side my breath labor and a moan at my lip from sheer agony and weakness if a arrow speed between my rib i would still reach the water for i be determine to die with my leg in its flow suddenly it be before I i come out on a mossy rock above a deep clear pool into which a cascade tumble i knelt feebly on the stone gaze at the blue depths and then i lift my eye there on a rock on the other side stand my enemy he have a arrow fit to he bow and as i look he shoot it strike I on the right arm pin it just above the elbow the pistol which i have be carry aimlessly slip from my nerveless hand to the moss on which i kneel that sudden shock clear my wit i be at he mercy and he know it i could see every detail of he twenty yard off across the water he stand there as calm and light as if he have just arise from rest he polished limb shine in the glow of the sun the muscle on he right arm ripple as he move he bow madman that i be ever to hope to contend with such dauntless youth such tireless vigor there be a cruel thin-lipped smile on he face he have I in he clutch like a cat with a mouse and he be go to get the full zest of it i kneel before he with my strength go my right arm cripple he could choose he target at he leisure for i could not resist i see the gloat joy in he eye he know he power and mean to miss nothing of its savor yet in that fall predicament god give I back my courage but i take a queer way of show it i begin to whimper as if in abject fear every limb be relax in terror and i grovel on my knee before he i make feeble pluck at the arrow in my right arm and my shoulder droop almost to the sod but all the time my other hand be behind my back edge its way to the pistol my finger clutch at the butt and slowly i begin to withdraw it till i have it safe in the shadow of my pocket my enemy do not know that i be left-handed he fit a second arrow to he bow while he lip curve maliciously all the demoniac pantherlike cruelty of he race look at I out of he deep eye he be take he time about it unwilling to lose the slightest flavor of he vengeance i play up to he nobly squirm as if in a agony of terror but by this time i have get a comfortable posture on the rock and my left shoulder be towards he at last he make he choice and so do i i never think that i could miss for if i have have any doubt i should have fail i be as confident in my sureness as any saint in the mercy of god he raise he bow but it never reach he shoulder my left arm shoot out and my last bullet go through he brain he topple forward and plunge into the pool the grease from he body float up and make a scum on the surface then i break off the arrow and pull it out of my arm put the piece in my pocket the water clear and i could see he lie in the cool blue depths he eye stare he mouth open and a little dark eddy about he forehead chapter xxvi shalah i come out of the wood a new be my wounded arm and my tear and inflamed limb be forget i hold my head high and walk like a free man it be not that i have slay my enemy and be deliver from deadly peril nor have i any clearer light on my next step but i have suddenly get the conviction that god be on my side and that i need not fear what man could do unto I you may call it the madness of a lad whose body and spirit have be try to breaking-point but madness or no it give I infinite courage and in that hour i would have dare every savage on earth i find some indian at the edge of the wood and tell one who speak powhatan the issue of the fight i flung the broken arrow on the ground that be my token i say you will find the other in the pool below the cascade then i stride towards the tent look every man i pass squarely in the eye no one speak no one hinder I every face be like a graven image i reach the teepee in which i have spend the night and fling myself down on the rude couch in a minute i be sink in a heavy sleep i wake to see two man stand in the tent door one be the chief onotawah and the other a tall indian who wear no war paint they come towards I and the light fall on the face of the second to my amazement i recognize shalah he put a finger on he lip and though my heart clamour for news i hold my peace they squat on a heap of skin and speak in they own tongue then shalah address I in english the maiden be safe brother there will be no more fight at the stockade those who assault we be of my own tribe and yesterday i reason with they then he speak to the chief and translate for I he say that you have endure the ordeal of the stake and have slay you enemy in fight and that now you will go before the great sachem for he judgment that be the custom of we people he turn to onotawah again and he tone be high and scornful he speak as if he be the chief and the other be the minion and what be strangest of all onotawah reply meekly shalah rise to he foot and stride to the door point down the glen with he hand he seem to menace the other he nostril quiver with contempt and he voice be barb with passion onotawah bow he head and say nothing then he seem to dismiss he and the proud chief walk out of the teepee like a disconsolate schoolboy instantly shalah turn to I and inquire about my wound he look at the hole in my arm and at my scorched leg and from he belt take a phial of ointment which he rub on the former he pass he cool hand over my brow and feel the beating of my heart you be weary brother and somewhat scar but there be no grave hurt what of the master i tell he of ringan 's end he bent he head and then spring up and hold he hand high speaking in a strange tongue i look at he eye and they be ablaze with fire my people slew he he cry by the shades of my father a score shall keep he company as slave in the great hunting-ground talk no more of blood i say he be amply avenge 'twa i who slew he for he die to save I he make a christian end and i will not have he memory stain by more murder but oh shalah what a man die yonder he make I tell every incident of the story and he cry out impassive though he be at the sword-play in the neck of the gorge i have see it he cry i have see he bright steel flash and man go down like ripe fruit tell I brother do he sing all the while as be he custom would i have be by he side then he tell I of what have befall at the stockade the dead man tell I a tale for by the mark on he forehead i know that he be of my own house when you and the master have go i go into the wood and pick up the trail of we foe i find they in a crook of the hill and go among they in peace they know I and my word be law unto they no living thing will come near the stockade save the wild beast of the forest be at ease in thy mind brother the news be a mighty consolation but i be still deeply mystified you speak of you tribe but these man be no seneca he smile gravely listen brother he say the white man of the tidewater call I seneca and i suffer the name but i be of a greater and princelier house than the son of the cat some little while ago i speak to you of the man who travel to the western sea and of he son who return to he own people i be the son of he who return i speak of the doings of my own kin but what be you nation then i cry one so great that these little clanlet of cherokee and monacan and even the multitude of the long house be but slave and horseboy by they side we dwell far beyond these mountain towards the setting sun in a plain where the river be like sea and the cornland wider than all the virginian manor but there come trouble in we royal house and my father return to find a generation which have forget the deed of they forefather so he take he own tribe who still remember the house of the sun and because he heart be unquiet with longing for that which be forbid to man he journey eastward and find a new home in a valley of these hill thine eye have see it they call it the shenandoah i remember that smile eden i have see from that hill-top and how shalah have speak that very name we dwell there he continue while i grow to manhood living happily in peace hunting the buffalo and deer and till we cornland then the time come when the great spirit call for my father and i be leave with the kingship of the tribe strange thing meantime have befall we nation in the west broken clan have come down from the north and there have be many battle and there have be blight and storm and sickness so that they be grow poor and harass likewise man have arise who preach to they discontent and other race of a lesser breed have join themselves to they my own tribe have become fewer for the young man do not stay in we valley but drift back to the west to that nation we have come from or go north to the war with the white man or become lonely hunter in the hill then from the south along the mountain crest come another people a squat and murderous people who watch we from the ridge and bide they chance the cherokee i ask even so i speak of a hundred moon back when i be yet a striple with little experience in war i see the peril but i could not think that such a race could vie with the child of the sun but one black night in the moon of wildfowl the raider descend in a torrent and take we unprepared what have be a happy people dwelling with full barn and populous wigwam become in a night a desolation we wife and child be slay or carry captive and on every cherokee belt hang the scalp of my warrior some flee westwards to we nation but they be few that live and the tribe of shalah go out like a torch in a roar river i slew many man that night for the god of my father guide my arm death i seek but could not find it and by and by i be alone in the wood with twenty scar and a heart as empty as a gourd then i turn my step to the rise sun and the land of the white man for there be no more any place for I in the council of my own people all this be many moon ago and since then i have be a wanderer among stranger while i reign in my valley i hear of the white man 's magic and of the power of he god and i long to prove they now i have learn many thing which be hide from the eye of we oldest man i have learn that a man may be a great brave and yet gentle and merciful as be the master i have learn that a man may be a lover of peace and quiet way and have no lust of battle in he heart and yet when the need come be more valiant than the best even as you brother i have learn that the god of the white man be himself a man who endure the ordeal of the stake for the welfare of he enemy i have see cruelty and cowardice and folly among he worshipper but i have also see that he faith can put spirit into a coward 's heart and make hero of mean man i do not grudge my year of wander they have teach I such knowledge as the sachem of my nation never dream of and they have give I two comrade after my own heart one be he who die yesterday and the other be now by my side these word of shalah do not make I proud for thing be too serious for vanity but they serve to confirm in I my strange exaltation i feel as one dedicate to a mighty task tell I what be the invasion which threaten the tidewater the whole truth be not know to I but from the speech of my tribesman it seem that the child of the west wind twelve moon ago strike they tent and resolve to seek a new country there be a restlessness come upon all indian people once in every five generation it fall upon my grandfather and he travel towards the sunset and now it have fall upon the whole race of the sun as they be on the eve of journey there come to they a prophet who tell they that god would lead they not towards the west as be the tradition of the elder but eastward to the sea and the dwelling of the paleface be that the crazy white man we have hear of he be of you race brother what he spell be i know not but it work mightily among my people they tell I that he have bodily converse with devil and that god whisper he secret to he in the night-watch he god have tell he -- so run the tale -- that he have choose the child of the sun for he peculiar people and lay on they the charge of sweep the white man off the earth and reign in they stead from the hill to the great water do you believe in this madman shalah i ask i know not he say with a troubled face i fear one possess of god but of this i be sure that the road of the child of the west wind lie not eastward but westward and that no good can come of war with the white man this sachem have lay he magic on other than we people for the cherokee nation and all the broken clan of the hill acknowledge he and do he bidding he be a soldier as well as a prophet for he have drill and dispose he army like a master of war will you tribe ally themselves with cherokee murderer i ask that question of this man onotawah and he like it little he say that he people distrust this alliance with a race they scorn and i do not think they pine for the white man 's war but they be under the magic of this prophet and presently when blood begin to flow they will warm to they work in time they will be break but that time will not be soon and meanwhile there will be nothing left alive between the hill and the bay of chesapeake do you know they plan i ask the cherokee have serve they purpose he say you forecast be right brother they have draw the fire of the border and be drive in a rabble far south to the roanoke and the carolina mountain that be as the prophet plan and now while the white man hang up they musket and rejoice heedlessly in they triumph my nation prepare to strike to-night the moon be full and the prophet make intercession with he god to-morrow at dawn they march and by twilight they will have swarm across the border have you no power over you own people but little he answer i have be too long absent from they and my name be half forget yet be they free of this prophet i think i might sway they for i know they way and i be the son of they ancient king but for the present he magic hold they in thrall they listen in fear to one who have the ear of god i arise stretch my arm and yawn they carry I to this sachem i say well and good i will outface this blasphemous liar whoever he may be if he make big magic i will make bigger the only course be the bold course if i can humble this prophet man will you dissuade you nation from war and send they back to the sunset assuredly he say wonderingly but what be you plan brother none i answer god will show I the way honesty may trust in he as well as madness by my father 's shade you be a man brother and he give I the indian salute a very weary feckless cripple of a man i say smile but the army of heaven be on my side shalah take my pistol and ringan 's sword i be go into this business with no human weapon and as they set I on a indian horse and the whole tribe turn they eye to the higher glen i actually rejoice light-hearted or light-headed i know not which i be but i know that i have no fear chapter xxvii how i strove all night with the devil it be late in the evening ere we reach the shelf in the high glen which be the headquarters of the indian host i ride on a horse between onotawah and shalah as if i be a chief and no prisoner on the road we meet many band of indian hasten to the trysting-place for the leader have fling he outpost along the whole base of the range and the chief warrior return to the plateau for the last ritual no man speak a word and when we meet other company the only greet be by uplifted hand the shelf be light with fire and there be a flare of torch in the center i see a immense multitude of lean dark face -- how many i can not tell but ten thousand at the least it take all my faith to withstand the awe of the sight for these man be not the common indian breed but a race nurture and arm for great war discipline to follow one man and sharpen to a needle-point in spirit perhaps if i have be myself a campaigner i should have be less awed by the spectacle but have nothing with which to compare it i judge this a host before which the scatter border stockade and nicholson 's scanty militia would go down like stubble before fire at the head of the plateau just under the brow of the hill and face the half-circle of level land stand a big tent of skin before it be a square pile of boulder about the height of a man 's waist heap on the top with brushwood so that it look like a rude altar around this the host have gather sit mostly on the ground with knee draw to the chin but some few standing like sentry under arm i be take to the middle of the half-circle and shalah motion I to dismount while a stripling lead off the horse my leg give under I for they be still very feeble and i sit hunker up on the sward like the other i look for shalah and onotawah but they have disappear and i be leave alone among those line of dark unknown face i wait with a awe on my spirit against which i struggle in vain the silence of so vast a multitude the sputter torch light the wild amphitheatre of the hill the strange clearing with its altar the mystery of the immense dusky sky and the memory of what i have already endure -- all weigh on I with the sense of impend doom i summon all my fortitude to my aid i tell myself that ringan believe in I and that i have the assurance that god would not see I cast down but such courage as i have be now a resolve rather than any exhilaration of spirit a brooding darkness lay on I like a cloud presently the hush grow deeper and from the tent a man come i could not see he clearly but the flickering light tell I that he be very tall and that like the indian he be naked to the middle he stand behind the altar and begin some incantation it be in the indian tongue which i could not understand the voice be harsh and discordant but powerful enough to fill that whole circle of hill it seem to rouse the passion of the hearer for grave face around I begin to work and long-drawn sigh come from they lip then at a word from the figure four man advance bear something between they which they lay on the altar to my amazement i see that it be a great yellow panther so truss up that it be impotent to hurt how such a beast have ever be catch alive i know not i could see its green cat 's eye glowing in the dark and the strive of its muscle and hear the breath hiss from its muzzled jaw the figure raise a knife and plunge it into the throat of the great cat the slow lapping of blood break in on the stillness then the voice shrill high and wild i could see that the man have mark he forehead with blood and that he hand be red and drip he seem to be declaim some savage chant to which my neighbor begin to keep time with they body wilder and wilder it grow till it end in a scream like a seamew 's whoever the madman be he know the mystery of indian soul for in a little he would have have that host lust blindly for death i feel the spell myself pierce through my awe and hatred of the spell-weaver and i will not say but that my weary head keep time with the other to that weird singing a man bring a torch and light the brushwood on the altar instantly a flame rise to heaven through which the figure of the magician show fitfully like a mountain in mist that act break the wizardry for I to sacrifice a cat be monstrous and horrible but it be also uncouthly silly i see the magic for what it be a maniac 's trickery in the revulsion i grow angry and my anger hearten I wonderfully be this stupendous quackery to bring ruin to the tidewater though i have to choke the life with my own hand out of that warlock 's throat i should prevent it then from behind the fire the voice begin again but this time i understand it the word be english i be amaze for i have forget that i know the wizard to be a white man _ thus saith the lord god _ it cry _ woe to the bloody city i will make the pile great for fire heap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice it well and let the bone be burn _ he poke the beast on the altar and a bit of burn yellow fur fall off and frizzle on the ground it be horrid beyond word lewd and savage and impious and desperately cruel and the strange thing be that the voice be familiar _ o thou that dwellest upon many water _ it go on again _ abundant in treasure thine end be come and the measure of thy covetousness the lord of host have swear by himself say surely i will fill thee with man as with caterpillar _ with that last word there come over I a flood of recollection it be speak not in the common english way but in the broad manner of my own folk i saw in my mind 's eye a wet moorland and hear a voice inveigh against the wickedness of those in high place i smell the foul air of the canongate tolbooth and hear this same man testify against the vanity of the world _ cawterpillar _ it be the voice that have once bid I sing jenny nettle harsh and strident and horrible it be yet the voice i have know now blaspheme scripture word behind that gruesome sacrifice i think i laugh aloud i remember the man i have pursue my first night in virginium the man who have raid frew 's cabin i remember ringan 's tale of the scot redemptioner that have escape from norfolk county and the various strange writings which have descend from the hill be it not the queerest fate that one whom i have meet in my boyish scrape should return after six year and many thousand mile to play once more a major part in my life the nameless general in the hill be muckle john gib once a mariner of borrowstoneness and some time leader of the sweet-singer i feel the smell of wet heather and the fishy odour of the forth i hear the tang of we country speech and the swirl of the gusty wind of home but in a second all thought of mirth be go and a deep solemnity fall upon I god have assuredly direct my path for he have bring the two of we together over the widest space of earth i have no fear of the issue i should master muckle john as i have master he before my awe be all for god 's mysterious deal not for that poor fool posturing behind he obscene sacrifice he voice rise and fall in eldritch scream and hollow moan he be mouth

time i have ever see he in a state approach fear what fortune brother he ask and he tooth chatter the tidewater be safe this day they march westwards to look for they new country thy magic be as the magic of heaven he say reverently my heart all night have be like water for i know no charm which have prevail against the mystery of the panther 'twa no magic of mine say i god speak to he through my lip in the night watch we take we way unchallenged through the sleep host till we have climb the scarp of the hill what bring you to the tent door i ask i abode there through the night i hear the strife with the devil and my joint be loosen also i hear thy voice brother but i know not thy word but what do you mean to do i ask again it be in my mind to do my little best to see that no harm befall thee and if harm come i have the thought of try my knife on the rib of yonder magician chapter xxviii how three soul find they heritage in that hour i have none of the exhilaration of success so strangely be we mortal make that though i have win safety for myself and my people i could not get the savor of it i have pass too far beyond the limit of my strength now that the tension of peril be go my leg be like touchwood which a stroke would shatter and my foolish head swam like a merry-go-round shalah 's arm be round I and he lift I up the steep bit till we come to the crown of the ridge there we halt and he feed I with sop of bread dip in eau-de-vie for he have bring ringan 's flask with he the only result be to make I deadly sick i see he eye look gravely at I and the next i know i be on he back i begged he to set I down and leave I and i think i must have weep like a bairn all pride of manhood have fly in that sharp revulsion and i have the mind of a lose child as the light grow some strength come back to I and presently i be able to hobble a little on my rickety shank we keep the very crest of the range and come by and by to a promontory of clear ground the same i fancy from which i have first see the vale of the shenandoah there we rest in a nook of rock while the early sun warm we and the little vapor show we in glimpse the green depths and the far-shining meadow shalah nudged my shoulder and point to the south where a glen debouch from the hill a stream of mount figure be pour out of it head for the upper water of the river where the valley broaden again for all my sickness my eye be sharp enough to perceive what manner of procession it be all be on horseback ride in cloud and company without the discipline of a march but move as swift as a flight of wildfowl at twilight before the other ride a little cluster of pathfinder and among they i think i could recognize one taller than the rest you magic have prevail brother shalah say in a hour 's time they will have cross the shenandoah and at nightfall they will camp on the farther mountain that sight give I my first assurance of success at any rate i have fulfil my trust and if i die in the hill virginium would yet bless she deliverer and yet my strongest feeling be a wild regret these folk be make for the untravelled land of the sunset you would have say i have get my bellyful of adventure and should now have seek only a quiet life but in that moment of bodily weakness and mental confusion i be shake with a longing to follow they to find what lay beyond the farthest cloud-topped mountain to cross the wide river and haply to come to the infinite and mystic ocean of the west would to god i be with they i sigh will you come brother shalah whisper a strange light in he eye if we twain join the venture i think we should not be the last in it shalah would make you a king what be you life in the muddy tidewater but a thing of little rivalry and petty wrangle and mope over paper the hearth will soon grow cold and the bright eye of the fairest woman will dull with age and the year will find you heavy and slow with a coward 's shrink from death what say you brother while the blood be strong in the vein shall we ride westward on the path of a king he eye be stare like a hawk 's over the hill and light-headed as i be i catch the infection of he ardor for remember i be so low in spirit that all my hope and memory be forget and i be in that blank apathy which be master by another 's passion for a little the life of virginium seem unspeakably barren and i quicken at the wild vista which shalah offer i might be a king over a proud people carve a fair kingdom out of the wilderness and ruling it justly in the fear of god these western indian be the stuff of a great nation i andrew garvald might yet find that empire of which the old adventurer dream with shame i set down my boyish folly it do not last long for to my dizzy brain there come the air which elspeth have sing that song of montrose 's which have be as it be the star of all my wanderings for if confusion have a part which virtuous soul abhor -- surely it be confusion that have now overtake I elspeth 's clear voice she dark kind eye she young and joyous grace fill again my memory be not such a lady better than any savage kingdom be not the service of my own folk nobler than any principate among stranger could the river of damascus vie with the water of israel nay shalah i say mine be a quieter destiny i go back to the tidewater but i shall not stay there we have find the road to the hill and in time i will plant the flag of my race on the shenandoah he bow he head so be it each man to he own path but i would ours have run together you way be the way of the white man you conquer slowly but the line of you conquest go not back slowly it eat its way through the forest and field and manor appear in the waste place and cattle graze in the covert of the deer listen brother shalah have have he vision when he eye be unsealed in the night watch he have see the white man press up from the sea and spreading over the land of he father he have see the glen of the hill parcel out like the meadow of henricus and a great multitude surge ever on to the west he race be doom by god to perish before the stranger but not yet awhile for the white man come slowly it have be tell that the child of the west wind must seek they cradle and while there be time he would join they in that quest the white man follow upon they heel but in he day and in that of he son 's son they will lead they life accord to the ancient way he have see the wisdom of the stranger and find among they man after he own heart but the spirit of he father call and now he return to he own people what will you do there i ask i know not i be still a prince among they and will sway they council it may be fate that i slay yonder magician and reign in he stead he get to he foot and look proudly westward in a little i shall overtake they but i would my brother have be of my company slowly we travel north along the crest for though my mind be now saner i have no strength in my body the hill mist come down on we and the rain drive up from the glen i be happy now for all my weakness for i be lap in a great peace the raw weather which have once be a horror of darkness to I be now something kindly and homelike the wet smell mind I of my own land and the cool buffet of the squall be a tonic to my spirit i wander into pleasant dream and scarce feel the roughness of the ground on my bare foot and the ache in every limb long ere we get to the gap i be clean wear out i remember that i fall constantly and could scarcely rise then i stumble and the last power go out of will and sinew i have a glimpse of shalah 's grave face as i slip into unconsciousness i wake in a glow of firelight face surround I dim wraith-like figure still entangled in the mesh of my dream slowly the scene clear and i recognize gray 's feature draw and constrain and yet welcome bertrand be weep after he excitable fashion but there be a face nearer to I and with that face in my memory i go off into pleasant dream somewhere in they mingle the word of the old spaewife that i should miss love and fortune in the sunshine and find they in the rain the strength of youth be like a branch of yew for if it be bent it soon straighten by the third day i be on my foot again with only the stiffness of healing wound to remind I of those desperate passage when i could look about I i find that man have arrive from the rappahannock and among they elspeth 's uncle who have gird on a great claymore and look for all he worn face and sober habit a mighty man of war with they come news of the rout of the cherokee who have be beat by nicholson 's militia in stafford county and drive down the long line of the border pay toll to every stockade midway lawrence have fall upon they and drive the remnant into the hill above the head water of the jame it would be many a day i think before these gentry would bring war again to the tidewater the rappahannock man be in high feather convince that they have bear the brunt of the invasion 'twa no business of mine to enlighten they the more since of the three who know the full peril shalah be go and ringan be dead my tale should be for the ear of lawrence and the governor and for none else the peace of mind of virginium should not be break by I gray come to I on the third morning to say good-bye he be go back to the tidewater with some of the borderer for to stay longer with we have become a torture to he there be no ill feeling in he proud soul and he bear defeat as a gentleman should you have fairly win mr garvald he say three night ago i see clearly reveal the inclination of the lady and i be not one to strive with a unwilling maid i wish you joy of a great prize you stake high for it and you deserve you fortune as for I you have teach I much for which i owe you gratitude presently when my heart be less sore i desire that we should meet in friendship but till then i need a little solitude to mend broken thread there be the true gentleman for you and i sorrow that i should ever have misjudge he he shake my hand in all brotherliness and go down the glen with bertrand who long to see he child again elspeth remain and concern she i fall into my old doubt mood the return of my strength have revive in I the passion which have dwell somewhere in my soul from the hour she first sing to I in the rain she have greet I as girl greet she lover but be that any more than the revulsion from fear and the pity of a tender heart doubt oppress I the more as she seem constrain and uneasy she eye fall when she meet mine and she voice full no longer of its frank comradeship one afternoon we go to a place in the hill where the vale of the shenandoah could be see the rain have go and have leave behind it a taste of autumn the hill berry be ripening and a touch of flame have fall on the thicket soon the great valley lay below we run out in a golden haze to the far blue mountain ah she sigh like one who come from a winter night into a firelit room she be silent while she eye drink in its spacious comfort that be you heritage elspeth that be the birthday gift to which old studd 's powder-flask be the key nay yours she say for you win it the word die on she lip for she eye be abstracted my leg be still feeble and i have lean a little on she strong young arm as we come up the hill but now she leave I and climb on a rock where she sit like a pixie the hardship of the past have thin she face and deepen she eye but she grace be the more manifest fresh and dewy as morning yet with a soul of steel and fire -- surely no lovelier nymph ever grace a woodland i feel how rough and common be my own clay in contrast with she bright spirit elspeth i say hoarsely once i tell you what be in my heart she face grow grave and have you not see what be in mine she ask i have see and rejoice and yet i doubt but why she ask again my life be yours for you have preserve it i would be graceless indeed if i do not give my best to you who have give all for I it be not gratitude i want if you be only grateful put I out of you thought and i will go away and strive to forget you there be twenty in the tidewater who would have do the like she look down on I from the rock with the old quiz humor in she eye if gratitude irk you sir what would you have all i cry and yet heaven know i be not worth it i be no man to capture a fair girl 's heart my face be rude and my speech harsh and i be damnably prosaic i have not ringan 's fancy or gray 's gallantry i be sober and tongue-tied and uncouth and my mind run terribly on fact and figure o elspeth i know i be no hero of romance but a plain body whom fate have force into a month of wildness i shall go back to virginium and be set once more at my accompt and lading think well my dear for i will have nothing less than all can you endure to spend you day with a homely fellow like I what do a woman desire she ask as if from herself and she voice be very soft as she gaze over the valley man think it be a handsome face or a brisk air or a smooth tongue and some will have it that it be a deep purse or a high station but i think it be the honest heart that go all the way with a woman 's love we be not so blind as to believe that the glitter be the gold we love romance but we seek it in its true home do you think i would marry you for gratitude andrew no i say or for admiration no say i or for love yes i say with a sudden joy she slip from the rock she eye soft and misty she arm be about my neck and i hear from she the word i have dream of and yet scarce hope for the word of the song sing long ago to a boy 's ear and speak now with the pure fervor of the heart -- my dear and only love year have fly since that day on the hill and much have befall but the prologue be the kernel of my play and the curtain which rise after that hour reveal thing less worthy of chronicle why should i tell of how my trade prosper mightily and of the great house we build at middle plantation of my quarrel with nicholson which be many of how we carve a fair estate out of elspeth 's inheritance and lead the tide of settlement to the edge of the hill these thing would seem a pedestrian end to a high beginning nor would i weary the reader with my doings in the assembly how i bearded more governor than one and dispute stoutly with he majesty 's privy council in london the historian of virginium -- now by god 's grace a notable land -- may perhaps take note of these thing but it be well for I to keep silent it be of youth alone that i be concern to write for it be a comfort to my soul to know that once in my decorous progress through life i could kick my heel and forget to count the cost and as youth cry farewell so i end my story and turn to my account elspeth and i have twice voyage to scotland the first time my uncle and mother be still in the land of the living but they die in the same year and on we second journey i have much ado in settle they estate my riches be now considerable i turn my attention to the little house of auchencairn which i enlarged and beautify so that if we have the wish we may take up we dwelling there we have find in the west a goodly heritage but there be that in a man 's birth place which keep tight finger on he soul and i think that we desire to draw we last breath and lay we bone in we own gray country-side so if god grant we length of day we may haply return to douglasdale in the even and instead of we noble forest and rich meadow look upon the bleak moss and the rainy upland which be we childhood 's memory that be the fancy at the back of both we head but i be very sure that we son will be virginian the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of salute to adventurer by john buchan
