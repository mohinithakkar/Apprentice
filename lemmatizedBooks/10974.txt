barely discernible by the window loom through the dusk the shadowy shape of a enormous stuff tiger crouch as if about to spring upon a spare white-haired man in neat dark green uniform who seat at a writing-table cover with papers and official document have just settle himself more comfortably in a roomy armchair with a pleasant smile and a long pull at a freshly light papirosh he give vent to he feeling with the remark that head this chapter there be silence for a while unbroken save by the crackle of blaze log and occasional rattle of drive sleet against the window-pane it be the 5th of January -lrb- os -rrb- i be at tifli in the palace of prince dondoukoff korsákoff governor of the caucasus and at the present moment in that August personage 's presence cecus non repeat the prince a second time in answer to my request add impatiently they should know better in london than to send you to I the war minister in st petersburg alone have power to grant foreigner permission to visit central asia you must apply to he but let I first warn you that it be a long business no -- after a pause -- no be i in you place i would go to persia it be a country replete with interest i know from bitter experience of russian official that further parley be useless make my bow with as good a grace as possible under the circumstance i take leave of the governor and be escort by a aide-de-camp resplendent in white and gold through innumerable vestibule and down the great marble staircase to where my sleigh await I in the cut north-easter and whirling snow glide swiftly homewards along the now brilliantly light boulevard i realize for the first time that mine have be but a wild-goose chase after all that if indium be to be reach by land it be not _ viâ _ merv and cábul but by way of persium and baluchistán the original scheme be a bold one and i derive some consolation in the thought that the journey would most probably have end in defeat this be the idea from tifli to baku and across the caspian to ouzoun da the western terminus of the trans-caspian railway thence by rail to merv and bokhára and from the latter city direct to india _ viâ _ balkh and cábul afghanistán a more interesting journey can scarcely be conceive but fate and the russian government decree that it be not to be not only be i forbid to use the railway but -lrb- notwithstanding the highest recommendation from the russian ambassador in london -rrb- even to set foot in trans-caspium the old adage delay be dangerous be never so true as when apply to travel the evening of my interview with the governor i have resolve ere retire to rest to make for indium _ viâ _ teherán my route beyond that city be perforce leave to chance and the information i hope to gain in the shah 's capital tifli capital of the caucasus be about midway between the black and caspian sea and lie in a valley between two range of low but precipitous hill the river kúr a narrow but swift and picturesque stream span by three bridge bisect the city which be divide in three part : the russian town european colony and asiatic quarter the population of over a hundred thousand be indeed a mixed one although georgian form its bulk persium contribute nearly a quarter the rest be compose of russian german french armenian greek tartar circassian jew turk and heaven know what besides -lrb- b -rrb- tifli be a city of contrast the principal boulevard with its handsome stone building and shop tramway gay cafés and electric light would compare favourably with the nevskus prospect in st petersburg or almost any first-class european thoroughfare and yet almost within a stone 's throw be the asiatic quarter where the traveller be apparently as far remove from western civilization as in the most remote part of persium or turkestán the armenian and persian bazaar be perhaps the most interesting i doubt whether the street of yèzd or bokhára present so strange and picturesque a sight such vivid effect of movement and color every race every nationality be represent from the stalwart ruddy-faced russian soldier in flat white cap and olive-green tunic to the grave stately arab merchant with huge turban and white drapery fresh from bagdad or bussorah georgian and circassian in scarlet tunic and silver cartridge-belt turk in fez and frock-coat greek and albanian in snowy petticoat and black gaiter khivan in fur and quaint conical lamb 's - wool hat tartar from the steppe turkoman from merv parsee from bombay african negro -- all may be see in the tifli bazaar during the busy part of the day but woe to the luckless european who tempt by the beauty of they wares have dealings with the wily persian merchant there be a proverb in tifli that it take two jew to rob a armenian two armenian to rob a persian and the accursed faringus be mercilessly swindle whenever he venture upon a bargain with the exception of the aforesaid boulevard the european quarter of tifli present the same mixture of squalor and grandeur find in most russian town st petersburg not except there be the same dead drab look about the street and house the same absence of color the same indescribable smell of mud leather and drainage familiar to all who have visit asiatic russium i have intend remain a couple of day at most in tifli but my stay be now indefinitely prolonged such a severe winter have not be know for year the mountain pass into persium be report impassable and the line to baku have for some day be block with snow my russian christmas -lrb- which fall os on we 6th of January -rrb- be not a cheerful one a prisoner in a stuffy bedroom of the hôtel de londres i sit at the window most of the day consume innumerable glass of tea and cigarette watch the steadily fall snow and wonder whether the weather would ever clear and allow I to escape from a place so full of unpleasant association and which have bring I so much disappointment and vexation the loud laughter and burst of song that ascend every now and then from the crowded _ salle-á-manger _ -lrb- for the hôtel de londre be the maison dorée of tifli -rrb- only serve to increase my depression and melancholy have there be a train available i verily believe i should have take a ticket then and there and return to england but morning bring consolation in the shape of blue sky and dazzling sunshine the snow have cease apparently for good descend to breakfast full of plan for the future i find await I a individual destine to play a important part in these page -- one gerôme realinus a levantine russian subject well acquaint with the persian language -- who offer to accompany I to india as interpreter he term be moderate and credentials first-rate the latter include one from baker pasha with whom he serve on the turkoman frontier expedition more for the sake of a companion than anything else i close with gerôme who though he do not understand one word of english speak french fluently there be a very natural prejudice against the levantine race but my new acquaintance form a exception to the rule i never have reason to regret my bargain a better servant pluckier traveller or cheerier companion no man could wish for gerôme have just return from a visit to bokhára and he account of central asia be certainly not invite the trans-caspian railway be so badly lay that train frequently run off the line there be no arrangement for water traveller be frequently delay three or four hour while block of ice be melt for the boiler while the so-called first-class carriage be filthy and crowd with vermin the advance of holy russium have apparently not improve merv which have become since its annexation a kind of inferior port say a refuge for the scum male and female of st petersburg moscow and odessa drunkenness and debauchery reign paramount low gambling-house _ café chantant _ and less reputable establishment flourish under the liberal patronage of the russian officer who out of sheer _ ennui _ ruin they pocket and constitution with drunken orgy night and day there be no order of any kind no organize police-force and robbery and assassination take place almost nightly small-pox be rage in the place when gerôme leave it also a loathsome disease call the bouton d'alep -- a painful boil which oddly enough always make its appearance upon the body in odd number never in even it be cause by drinking or wash in unboiled water though seldom fatal there be no cure for the complaint but complete change of climate we now set about make preparation for the journey provision saddlery both have to be think of and have lay in a small stock of liebig tea biscuit chocolate and cigarette -lrb- for space be limit -rrb- i proceed under gerôme 's guidance to purchase a saddle seventy-five rouble buy a capital one include bridle here let I advise those visit persium to follow my example and buy they saddlery in tifli there be a heavy duty payable on foreign saddle in russium and they be not one whit better or indeed so well suit to the purpose as those make in the caucasus one hear a deal in europe of the beauty of the circassian and georgian woman although i remain in tifli over a week i do not see a single pretty woman among the native as in every russian town however the moushtaïd or bois de boulogne of tifli be daily the theater nightly crowd with pretty face of the dark-eyed oval-faced russian type the new opera-house a handsome building near the governor 's palace be not yet complete the hôtel de londre be the favorite _ rendezvous _ after the play here till the small hour assemble nightly the _ élite _ of european tifli russian and georgian officer in gorgeous uniform of dark green gold lace and astrachan french and german merchant with they wife and daughter with a sprinkle _ demi-mondaine _ from odessa or kharkoff sip tea or drinking kummel and kakèti at the little marble table and discuss the latest scandal kakèti a wine not unlike carlowitz be grow in considerable quantity in the caucasus there be two kind red and white but the former be consider the best though sound and good it be cheap enough -- one rouble the quart tobacco be also grow in small quantity in part of georgium and make into cigarette which be sell in tifli at three kopek per hundred but it be poor rank stuff and only smoke by the peasantry and droshki-driver -lrb- illustration : tifli -rrb- tifli have a large and important garrison but be not fortify its topographical depôt be one of the best in russium and i manage not without some difficulty to obtain from it map of afghanistán and baluchistán the latter i subsequently find better and far more accurate than any obtainable in england the most insignificant hamlet and unimportant camel-track and well be set down with extraordinary precision especially those in the district around kelát there be plenty of sport to be have round tifli the shooting be free excepting over certain tract of country lease by the tifli shooting-club partridge snipe and woodcock abound and there be plenty of deer and wild boar within easy distance of the capital ibex be also find in the higher mountain range for this -lrb- if for no other reason -rrb- tifli seem to be increase in popularity every year for european tourist it be now a easy journey of little over a week from england with the advantage that one may travel by land the whole way from calais this route be _ viâ _ berlin cracow kharkoff and vladikavka and from the latter place by coach -lrb- through the dariel gorge -rrb- to tifli the purchase of a warm astrachan bonnet a bourka -lrb- c -rrb- and bashlik -lrb- d -rrb- complete my outfit it now consist of two small portmanteau -lrb- to be change at teherán for saddle-bag -rrb- a common canvas sack for sleep purpose and a brace of revolver gerôme be similarly accoutr with the exception of the portmanteau my interpreter be evidently not luxuriously incline for he _ impediment _ be all contain in a small black leather hand-bag all be ready eleven o'clock on the night of the 12th of January find we stand on the platform of the tifli railway station await the arrival of the baku train which have be delay by a violent storm down the line i receive a letter from the governor a few hour before my departure wish I _ bon voyage _ and enclose a document to ensure help and civility from the official throughout he dominion it may seem ungrateful but i feel that i could well have dispense with this especially as i be leave he excellency 's government at baku a distance of only ten hour by rail it be again snow hard and the east wind cut through my bourka as if it have be a thin linen jacket seek shelter in the crowded stuffy waiting-room we solace ourselves with cigarette and vodka till past 2 be when the train arrive another delay of two hour now occur the engine have break down but the carriage like those of most russian railway be beautifully warm and we sleep soundly undisturbed by the howling of the wind and shouting of railway official when i awake we be swiftly rattle through the dreary monotonous steppe country that separate tifli from the caspian sea the russian may accord to english idea be uncivilize in many way but they be undoubtedly far ahead of other european nation with the exception perhaps of france as regard railway travel although the speed be slow nothing be leave undo on the most isolate line to ensure comfort not to say luxury even in this remote district the refreshment-room be far above the average in england at akstafá for instance a station surround by a howling wilderness of steppe and marsh well-cooked viand game pastry and other delicacy gladden the eye instead of the fly-blown bun and petrified sandwich only too familiar to the english railway traveller the best railway buffet i have ever see be at tiuman the terminus of the oural railway and actually in siberium railway travel have however one drawback in this part of russium which though it do not upset the arrangement of a casual traveller must seriously inconvenience the native -- the distance of station from town we drink tea a couple of hour or so before arrive at baku at a station situate more than one hundred verst -lrb- e -rrb- from the town of its name the inhabitant of the latter seldom avail themselves of the railway but find it easier except in very bad weather to drive or ride to the caspian port the dull wintry day wear slowly away as we crawl along past league upon league of wild steppe land the _ coup d'oeil _ from we carriage-window be not inspirit it rest upon a bare bleak landscape roll away to the horizon of wave of drab and dirty-green land unbroken save for here and there a pool of stagnant water rot in a fringe of sedge and rush or a occasional flock of wild-fowl at rare interval we pass close to the line a tartar encampment half a dozen dirty brown tent surround by horse camel and thin shiver cattle the latter cover with coarse sack-clothing tie round they belly to protect they from the cut blast that sweep from the coast across this land of desolation none of the human population be visible and no wonder it must be cold enough outside even in this well-warmed compartment one can barely keep foot and finger from get numb it be almost dark when towards six o'clock there appear far ahead a thin streak of silver separate the dreary brown landscape from the cold gray sky we have nearly arrive monsieur say gerôme there be the caspian sea -lrb- footnote a : the sacred image of the savior or holy virgin -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : the name tifli be derive from _ tbili kalaki _ or hot town so call from the hot mineral spring near which it stand -rrb- -lrb- footnote c : _ bourka _ a long sleeveless coat make of goatskin -rrb- -lrb- footnote d : _ bashlik _ the soft camel-hair hood and neckerchief in one worn by russian soldier -rrb- -lrb- footnote e : a _ verst _ be about three-quarter of a mile -rrb- chapter ii the caspian -- astar -- résht i arrive in baku on -lrb- the russian -rrb- new year 's eve and find railway official porter and droshki-driver all more or less fuddle with drink in consequence with some difficulty we persuade one of the latter to drive we to the hotel a clean and well-appointed house a stone 's throw from the quay we isvostchik -lrb- a -rrb- be very drunk he horse luckily for we be quiet for he fall off he box on the way and smilingly but firmly decline to remount gerôme then pilot the troika safely to we destination leave jehu prone in the mud baku a clean well laid-out city of sixty thousand inhabitant be the most important town on the shore of the caspian its name be say to be derive from the persian word _ bad _ the wind and _ kubeda _ beat signify wind-beaten and this seem credible for violent storm be prevalent along the coast the town be essentially european in character one can scarcely realize that only fifty year ago a tumble-down persian settlement stand on the spot now occupy by broad well-paved gas-lit street handsome stone building warehouse and shop baku have like tifli a mixed population although russian and tartar form its bulk france germany italy greece turkey and persium be all represent most of the european be employ in the manufacture of petroleum the naphtha spring be say to yield over 170000 ton of oil yearly a french engineer mr b -- whose acquaintance i make at the hotel describe baku as terribly monotonous and depressing to live in after a time there be not a tree or sign of vegetation for mile round the town -- nothing but bleak desolate steppe and marsh unproductive of sport and cultivation or indeed of anything save miasma and fever in summer the heat dust and fly be intolerable in winter the sun be seldom see there be no amusement of any kind -- no _ café _ no band no theater to go to after the day 's work this seem to distress the poor parisian exile more than anything more even than the smell of oil which from the moment you enter until you leave baku there be no get away from although the well be fully three mile away the table-cloth and napkin be saturate with it and the very food one eat have a faint sickly flavor of naphtha i bathed in the caspian once last summer say mr b ------ despairingly and do not get the smell out of my skin for a week during which time my friend forbid I they house mon dieu quel pay the steamer for enzellus be to leave at eleven have wish my french friend farewell and a speedy return to he native country we set out for the quay the night be fine but away to we left dense cloud of thick black smoke obscure the light of the town and starlit sky while the furnace of the tchornigorod -lrb- b -rrb- blaze out of the darkness they flame reflect in the dark water of the caspian turn the little harbor into a lake of fire the landing stage be crowd with passenger -- a motley crowd of russian official soldier peasant and tartar with difficulty we struggle through the noisy drunken rabble for the most part engage in singing cursing fighting and embrace by turn and succeed at last in find we ship the _ kaspia _ a small steamer of about a hundred and fifty ton burthen the captain be fortunately for we sober which be more than can be say of the crew alongside we lie the _ bariatinsky _ a large paddle-steamer bind for ouzounada the terminus of the trans-caspian railway she also be on the point of departure and i notice with relief that most of the crowd be make they way on board she the passenger-steamer on the caspian be the property of the caucase-mercure company a russian firm they be with few exception as unseaworthy as they be comfortless which say a great deal all be of iron and be build in england and sweden send to st petersburg by sea there take to piece and despatch overland to nijni-novgorod on the volga at nijnus they be repiece and take down the volga to the caspian the _ bariatinsky _ be first away she deck cram with soldier bind for central asia they treat we to a vocal concert as the ship leave port and i pace the moonlit deck for some time listen to the sweet sad air sing with the pathos and harmony that seem bear in every russian high or low i retire to rest with the matoushka volga a boat-song popular the length and breadth of russium ringing in my ear there be no private cabin on board the _ kaspia _ i share the stuffy saloon with a greasy german jew -lrb- who insist on shut all the porthole -rrb- a armenian gentleman he wife and two squalling child a persian merchant and gerôme the captain 's cabin a box-like retreat about eight foot square lead out of we sleeping-place which be also use as a drawing and dining-room as the latter it be hardly desirable for the german and persian be both suffer violently from _ mal-de-mer _ before we have be two hour out and no wonder though there be hardly a perceptible swell on the tiny cock-boat roll like a log to make matter worse the _ kaspium 's _ engine be work by petroleum and the smell pursue one everywhere the passage from baku to enzellus -lrb- the port of résht -rrb- be usually make in a little over two day in _ fine weather _ all depend upon the latter for no vessel can enter if it be blow hard there be a dangerous bar with a depth of barely five foot of water across the mouth of the harbor and several european impatient of wait have be drown when attempt to land in small boat i frequently have to take my passenger back to baku say captain z -- at the meal he be please to call breakfast but i think we shall have fine weather to-morrow i devoutly hope so little do i know what be in store for we for the glass at midday be falling-fast and at 2 pm when we anchor off lenkorán it be snow hard and blow half a gale the western coast of the caspian be flat and monotonous there be two port of call between baku and enzellus -- lenkorán a dismal-looking fishing-village of mud hut back by stunt poplar and a range of low hill and astará the russo-persian frontier trade do not seem very brisk at either port we neither land nor take in cargo at either a few small boat come out to the ship with fish to sell the latter be bad and tasteless in the caspian with the exception of the sturgeon which abound during certain season of the year the fishery be nearly all lease by russian who extract and export the caviar there be good shooting in the forest around lenkorán and tiger be occasionally meet with the large one in the possession of prince dondoukoff korsákoff mention in the first chapter be shoot within a few mile of the place we arrive off astará about 630 that evening it be too dark to see anything of the place but i have unfortunately for myself plenty of opportunity of examine it minutely a couple of day later we weigh anchor again at nine o'clock hope all be well to reach enzellus at daybreak the sea have now go down and thing look more promising my spirit rise at the thought of be able to land on the morrow i be even able to do justice to the abominable food set before we at dinner -- greasy sausage and a leathery beefsteak serve on dirty plate and a ragged table-cloth that look as if it have be use to clean the boiler but the german jew have recover from he temporary indisposition the cadaverous persian have disappear on deck and the armenian child have squalle themselves to sleep so there be something at least to be thankful for captain z -- a tall fair-haired swede who speak english fluently have be on this line for many year and tell we that for dangerous navigation violent squall and thick fog the caspian have no equal many vessel be lose yearly and never hear of again he also tell we of a submarine city some mile out of baku call by the native tchortorgorod or city of the devil in calm sunny weather say z -- one can distinctly make out the street and house the german jew of a facetious disposition ask he whether he have not also see people walk about but z -- treat the question with contemptuous silence man be doom to disappointment i wake at daylight next morning to find the _ kaspia _ at anchor pitching rolling and tug at she mooring as if at any moment the cable might part every now and again a sea would crash upon the deck and the wind howl through the rigging sound like the yell of a thousand fiend hurry on deck i learn the worst a terrific sea be run and the glass fall every hour one could scarcely discern through the drive mist the long low shore and white line of breaker that mark the entrance to enzelli to land be out of the question no boat would live in such a sea i will lay-to till this evening say captain z -- if it do not then abate i fear you must make up you mind to return to baku and try again another day a pleasant prospect indeed -lrb- illustration : a dirty night in the caspian -rrb- i have seldom pass a more miserable twenty-four hour the weather get worse as the day wear on towards midday it commence snow but this instead of diminish the violence of the gale seem only to increase it even the captain 's cheery ruddy face cloud over as he own that he do not like the look of thing have i another anchor i should not mind he say calmly add if this one part we be lose i think at the time he might have keep this piece of information to himself meanwhile nothing be visible from the cabin-window but great roller top with crest of foam which look as if every moment they would engulf the little vessel but she behave splendidly although green sea be come in over the bow flood she deck from stem to stern and pour down the gangway into the saloon the _ kaspia _ ride through the gale like a duck to venture on deck be impossible one could barely sit much less stand and the atmosphere of the saloon may be better imagine than describe every aperture tightly close every one with the exception of the captain gerôme and myself sea-sick no food no fire though we certainly do not miss the former much about ten o'clock z -- weigh anchor and stand out to sea it would not be safe he say to trust to we slender cable another night about midnight i struggle on deck to get a breath of fresh air before turn in the night be fine and clear but the sea around black as ink with great foam white roller the deck a foot deep in snow be desert save by z -- and the steersman whose silhouette stand out black and distinct against the starlit sky as they pace the rickety-looking little bridge flank by red and green light the enzelli lighthouse be no longer visible the latter be under the care of persian who light it or not as the humor take they this be on dark night a source of considerable danger to shipping but though frequently remonstrate with by the russian government the shah do not trouble he head about the matter three route to teherán be now open to we : back to baku thence to tifli and over the mountain to talriz -- very dubious on account of the snow the second from baku to astrabad and thence _ viâ _ mount demavend -- still more dubious on account of bad landing as well as block pass there remain to we astará and along the sea-beach -lrb- no road -rrb- to enzelli with swollen river and no post-horse all thing consider we resolve to land at astará even at the risk of a duck daylight find we there anchor a mile from the shore and a heavy swell run but there be no bar here only a shelve sandy beach on which even in rough weather there be little danger some good-sized boat come out to the _ kaspia _ with fish and vegetable and we at once resolve to land anything sooner than return to baku there be no road from astará say z -- and deep river to cross you will be rob and murder like the italian who travel this way three year ago he be the last european to do so gerôme remember the incident in fact he say the murder man be a friend of he travel to teherán with a large sum of money unable to land at résht and impatient to reach he destination he take the unfrequented route be waylay rob tie to a tree and leave to starve he be alone and unarmed though say my companion add with a wink let they try it on with we see remonstrance be useless z -- wish we god-speed the good-natured swede press a box of russian cigarette into my hand as i descend the ladder -- a gift he can ill afford -- and twenty minute later we boat glide safely and smoothly on persian soil it be a lovely day and the blue sky and sunshine singing of bird and green of plain and forest a pleasant relief to the eye and sens after the cold and misery of the past two day astará -lrb- though the port of tabriz -rrb- be a insignificant place its sole importance lie in the fact that it be a frontier town on one side of the narrow river a collection of ramshackle mud hut neglect garden foul smell beggar and dog -- persium on the other a score of neat stone house well-kept road and path flower-gardens orchard a pretty church and white fort surround by the inevitable black-and-white sentry-box guard by a company of white-capped cossack -- russium i could not help realize on landing at astará the huge area of this vast empire how many thousand mile now separate I from the last border town of the great white czar that i visit -- kiakhta on the russo-chinese frontier surround by a ragged mob we walk to the village to see about horse and a lodging for the night the latter be soon find -- a flat-roofed mud hut about thirty foot square devoid of chimney or furniture of any kind the floor crack in several place be crawl with vermin and the wall undermine with rat-hole but in persium one must not be particular leave we baggage in the care of one hassan a bright-eyed intelligent-looking lad and instruct he to prepare a meal we make for the bazaar a hundred yard away through a morass knee deep in mud and abomination of all kind to procure food a row of thirty or forty mud hut compose the bazaar where have succeed in purchase tea bread egg and caviar we turn we attention to horseflesh a old jew have previously agree to convert at exorbitant interest we rouble note into shei and keráns negotiation for horse be then open by gerôme and as the _ patois _ speak in astará be a mixture of turkish and persian with a little tartar throw in he task be no easy one especially as every one speak at once and at the top of they voice we discover at last that but few of the villager own a horse and those who do be very unwilling to let the animal for such a uncertain journey who be go to guarantee that the ` farangi ' will not steal it ask one ragged wild-looking fellow in sheepskin and a huge lamb 's - wool cap or get it steal from they add another with a grin they can have my old gray mare for two hundred keráns but you will not catch I let she for hire add a third with the aid of we friend the jew however we finally persuade the sheepskin gentleman -lrb- a native of khiva -rrb- to change he mind after considerable haggle as to price he disappear to return with two of the sorriest steed i ever set eye on we ought to reach enzellus in about three day if we do not get we throat cut say the khivan who be to accompany we encouragingly hassan have be busy in we absence he have prepare a excellent pilaff and send to russian astará for some kakèti wine which be bring over in a goatskin this with we own provision buy in the morning furnish a substantial and much-needed meal persian native bread be somewhat try at first to a weak digestion it be unleavened baked in long thin strip and be of suet-like consistency the hut like most native house in persium have no chimney the only outlet for the smoke be through the narrow doorway this necessitate lie flat on one 's back in the clear narrow space between smoke and flooring or be suffocate -- a minor inconvenience as compare with other in persian travel the khivan arrive with the horse at six next morning by seven o'clock we be well on the road which for the first ten mile or so lead by the sea-shore through dense thicket of brushwood alternate with patch of loose drift sand i be agreeably disappoint in the pony for though it be deep heavy go they step out well and freely the clear sunshine keen air and lovely scenery seem to have the same inspiriting effect on they as on ourselves the _ coup d'oeil _ be indeed a lovely one to we right a glorious panorama of palm forest and river stretch away for mile bound on the horizon by a chain of lofty precipitous mountain they snowy peak white and dazzling against the deep cloudless blue they grassy slope and rocky ravine hide here and there by gray mist float lazily over depths of dark green forest at they foot to we left broad yellow sand streak with seaweed and dark driftwood and cold gray water of the caspian sea -- colourless and dead even under this mediterranean sky and bring one back so to speak from a beautiful dream to stern reality about midday we come to a broad but fordable river which the khivan call the chulàmak we all cross in safety notwithstanding the deep hole we guide warn we against and which as the water be thick and muddy give gerôme and myself some anxiety the stream be about fifty yard across and much swollen by the snow landing on the other side ahead of my companion i ride on alone and presently find myself flounder about girth-deep in a quicksand it be only with great difficulty that we extricate the pony these quicksand be common on the shore of the caspian and native when travel alone have perish from this cause nothing occur worthy of notice till about 3 pm when we reach the river djemnil a arm of the sea more accurately describe this stream which be -lrb- or be at the time of which i write -rrb- over three hundred yard across here we have some difficulty with the khivan who be for encamp till morning i however strongly object to sleep _ a la belle étoile _ especially as the sky have now cloud over and it be begin to snow partly by conciliation partly by threat we at last persuade he to make the attempt follow closely in he wake it be nasty work twice we horse be carry off they foot by the strong current run out to sea -lrb- we be only a quarter of a mile from the mouth -rrb- and once we or rather the horse have to swim for it but we reach the opposite shore in under half a hour wet and numbed to the waist but safe at seven we be snugly house for the night at katvesera a so-called village of three or four mud hovel select the best -lrb- outwardly -rrb- for we night 's lodging we be badly receive by the native neither money nor threat would induce they to produce provision of any kind so we fall back on stick of chocolate and valentine 's meat-juice the latter i never travel without -- it be invaluable in uncivilized and desert country the inhabitant of katvesera be under a score in number and live chiefly on fish though i notice in the morning that a considerable quantity of land be under cultivation -- apparently rice and barley they be a sullen sulky lot and we have almost to take the hut by force the khivan gerôme and myself take it in turn to watch through the night it be near here that the italian be assassinate a start be make at daybreak the weather have now change a cut north-easter be blow accompany with snow and sleet we ford about 11 be the kokajerus river a mountain stream about thirty yard wide unfordable except upon the sea-beach at midday we halt at tchergári a fishing-village on the shore of the caspian tchergári contain about two hundred inhabitant mostly fisherman employ by a russian firm the house build of tree-trunk plaster with mud have roof of thatched reed and be far more substantial and better build than any i have yet see in persium fear a reception like that of the previous evening we have intend ride straight through the place to we destination for the night when a european advance to meet we through the snow mr v -- a russian and overseer of the fishery have make he hut as comfortable as circumstance would admit and we be soon seat before a blaze fire -lrb- with a chimney -rrb- discuss a plate of steam shtchus -lrb- c -rrb- wash down by a bottle of kakèti roast mutton and pastry follow succeed by coffee and vodka -lrb- for we have the good luck to arrive at we host 's dinner-hour -rrb- by the time cigarette be under way we feel fully equal to the long cold ride of fifteen mile that separate we from we night 's halting-place alalá résht itself seem at least thirty mile nearer than it have before dinner you be bold say mr v -- in french to attempt this journey at this time of year i do not mean as regard footpad and robber report concern they be always greatly exaggerated but the river be in a terrible state there be one just beyond alalá that i know you can not cross on horseback i will send a man on at once to try and get a boat for you and you can pull the horse after you there be a armenian at alalá who will give you a lodge to-night mr v -- 's good fare and several glass of vodka considerably shorten we ride and we arrive at alalá before dark where a hearty welcome await we turn in after a pipe and two or three glass of tea we sleep soundly till time to start in the morning the outlook from we snug resting-place be not invite -- the sky of a dirty gray blow hard and snow harder than ever alalá contain about eight hundred inhabitant the land surround it be thickly cultivate with rice and tobacco neither be however export in any quantity the difficulty of transport to astará or enzellus be so great it be somewhat puzzling to a stranger to get at the name of place on the southern shore of the caspian most of the village be know by more than one but alalá rejoice in as many _ alias _ as a old gaol-bird viz alalá asalim and navarim thanks to we russian friend a boat and a couple of man be await we at the big river -lrb- i could not ascertain its name -rrb- enter it ourselves we swim the horse over one by one it take we the best part of two hour though only two hundred yard wide they be off they leg nearly the whole way what we should have do without mr v -- 's aid i know not towards sundown the high tower of the shah 's palace at enzellus come in sight at last the neck of this weary journey be break and to-morrow all be well we should be at résht the road be wind and it be not till past ten o'clock that we ride through the silent desert street to the caravanserai a filthier lodging than any we have yet occupy but though devour by vermin i sleep soundly tire out with cold and fatigue we dismiss the khivan with a substantial _ pour-boire _ he have certainly behave extremely well for one of he race enzellus be a uninteresting place it have but two object of interest -lrb- in persian eye -rrb- -- the lighthouse -lrb- occasionally light -rrb- and a palace of the shah build a few year since as a _ pied-à-terre _ for he majesty on the occasion of he visit to europe it be a tawdry gimcrack edifice paint bright blue red and green in the worst possible taste the shah on return from europe last time be say to have remark to he minister on landing at enzelli i have not see a single building in all europe to compare with this probably not -- from one point of view the caspian may indeed be call a russian lake for although the whole of its southern coast be persian the only persian vessel tolerate upon it by russium be the yacht of the shah a small steamer the gift of the caucase-mercure company which lie off enzellus even this vessel be only permit to navigate in and about the water of the mourdab -lrb- dead water -rrb- a large lake a kind of encroachment of the sea eighteen to twenty mile broad which separate enzellus from peri-bazar the landing-place for résht four mile distant the imperial yacht do once get as far as astará -lrb- presumably by mistake -rrb- but be immediately escort back to enzelli by a russian cruiser there be however a so-called persian fleet -- the steamship _ persepoli _ anchor off bushire in the persian gulf and the _ susa _ which lie off mohammerah the former be about six hundred ton and carry four krupp gun but the latter be little better than a steam-launch both have be at anchor for about four year and be practically unseaworthy and useless we embark at nine o'clock in a boat pull by eight man the cross of the mourdab be at time impossible owe to the heavy sea but this time luck be with we and midday see we at peri-bazar where there be no difficulty in procure riding-horse to take one into résht the country between the two place be formerly morass and jungle but on the occasion of the shah 's visit to europe about twenty year ago a carriage-road be make -- not a good one for such a thing do not exist in persium -- but a very fair riding-track -lrb- in dry weather -rrb- we reach résht wet to the skin the snow have cease and give way to a steady downpour of rain résht bear the unpleasant reputation of be the most unhealthy city in persium its very name say the native be derive from the word _ rishta _ death if you wish to die say a proverb of irak go to résht the city which have at the beginning of the century a population of over sixty thousand inhabitant now have barely thirty thousand this certainly look as if there be some truth in the foregoing remark and there be no doubt that on the visitation of the plague about ten year ago the mortality be something frightful a great percentage of death be ascribe to résht fever -- a terrible disease due to the water and the exhalation from the marsh surround the city it be certainly the dampest place in the world the sun be seldom see and one 's clothes even on a dry rainless day become saturated with moisture the town be nevertheless prettily situate in a well-wooded country it would almost be impose be it not for the heavy rain and dew which cause a rapid decay of the building the latter be mostly of red brick and glazed tile résht be the depôt for goods to and from persium -- chiefly silk tobacco be also grow in yearly increase quantity several russian firm have open here for the manufacture of cigarette which though they may find favor among the native be too hot and coarse for european taste they be well make and cheap enough -- sevenpence a hundred in addition to the native population résht contain about five hundred armenian and a score or so of european among the latter be a russian and a british vice-consul to the residence of the latter we repair colonel stewart 's kindness and hospitality be a byword in persium and the Sunday of we arrival at résht be truly a day of rest after the discomfort and privation we have undergo since leave baku -lrb- footnote a : _ isvostchik _ a cab-driver -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : tchornigorod or black town so call from the smoke that hang night and day over the oil-factory -rrb- -lrb- footnote c : russian cabbage-soup -rrb- chapter iii résht -- patchinar day break gloomily enough the morning follow the day of we arrival at résht the snow still fall fast lay over two foot deep in the garden beneath my window while great white drift bar the entrance-gate of the consulate about eight o'clock we host make he appearance and wake I from pleasant dream of sunnier clime try to dissuade I from make a start under such unfavourable circumstance a imperial courier have just arrive from teherán and he report be anything but reassure the road be in a terrible state the kharzán a long and difficult pass be block with snow and the village on either side of it crowd with weather-bound caravan the prospect view from a warm and comfortable bed be not invite anxiety however to reach teherán and definitely map out my route to indium overcome everything even the temptation to defer a journey fraught with cold hunger and privation and take it easy for a few day with plenty of food and drink to say nothing of cigar book and newspaper in the snug cosy room of the consulate you will be sorry for it to-morrow say the colonel as he leave the room to give the necessary order for we departure add with a smile i suppose a wilful man must have he way there be two mode of travel in persium : march with a caravan a slow and tedious process and ride post or chapar the latter be the quickest be usually adopt by european but can only be do on the government post-road of which there be five : from teherán to résht tabriz meshéd kermán and the persian gulf port bushire these so-called road be however often mere caravan-track sometimes totally hide by drift sand or snow in the interior of the country the hard sun-baked soil be usually trackless so that the aid of a shagird chapar or post-boy become essential the distance between the chapar khaneh as the tumble-down shed do duty for post-house be call be generally five farsakh or about twenty english mile but the persian farsakh be elastic and we often ride more at other time less than we pay for travel be cheap : one kerán per farsakh -lrb- 2-1\/2 _ d _ a mile -rrb- per horse with a _ pour-boire _ of a couple of keráns to the shagird at the end of the stage give a good horse and fine weather persian travel would be delightful but the former be unfortunately very rarely meet with most of the post-horse have be sell for some vice which nothing but constant hard work will keep under kicker rearer jibber shyer and stumbler be but too common and fall of almost daily occurrence on a long journey goodness know how many gerôme and i have between résht and the persian gulf notwithstanding these drawback the speed attain by the wretched half-starved animal be little short of marvellous nothing seem to tire they we average fifty mile a day after leave teherán cover on one occasion over a hundred mile in a little over eleven hour this be good work consider the pony seldom exceed fourteen hand two inch and have to carry a couple of heavy saddle-bag in addition to they rider gerôme must have ridden quite fourteen stone about ten o'clock the horse arrive in charge of a miserable-looking shagird in rag and a huge lamb 's - wool cap the only warm thing about he it be pitiful to see the poor wretch with bare leg and foot shiver and shake in the cut wind and snow the pony too look tuck up and leg-weary as if they have just come off a long stage -lrb- which indeed they probably have -rrb- instead of go on one do not be alarm they be the proverbial rum ` un to look at say we host who would not hear of we set out without saddle-bag cram with good thing : cold meat sardine cigarette a couple of bottle of brandy and a flask of russian vodka but for these we must literally have starve _ en route _ good-bye good luck to you from the colonel en avant cry gerôme with a deafening crack of he heavy chapar whip we be both provide with this instrument of torture -- a thick plaited thong about five foot long attach to a short thick wooden handle and terminate in a flat leathern cracker of eight or ten inch a cut from this would make a english horse jump out of he skin but have little or no effect on the tough hide of we chapar pony the snow be almost up to the knee of the latter as we labor through the gateway and into the narrow street where will it be on the kharzán pass résht be picturesquely situate it must be a lovely place in summer-time when fertile plain of maize barley and tobacco stretch away on every side bound by belt of dark green forest and chain of low well-wooded hill while the post-road lead for mile through grove of mulberry tree apple orchard and garden-girt villa half hide by rose and jasmine but this be hardly a day for admire the beauty of nature once out of the suburb and in the open country nothing meet the eye but a dreary wilderness of white earth and sullen gray sky that bode ill for the future the cold be intense although dress in the thickest of tweeds and sheepskin jacket sable pelisse enormous bourka and high feel boot it be all i could do to keep warm even when go at a hand gallop vary every hundred yard or so by a desperate peck on the part of my pony the first stage koudoum five farsakh from résht be reach about three o'clock in the afternoon this be my first experience of a chapar khaneh the shagird inform we that it be consider a very good one and be much frequent by european in summer-time -- presumably judge from the hole in the roof for the sake of coolness let I here give the reader a brief description of the accommodation provide for traveller by he imperial majesty the shah the koudoum chapar khaneh be a very fair example of the average persian post-house imagine a small one-storied building whitewash save where wind and rain have disclose the brown mud beneath a wooden ladder -lrb- with half the rung miss -rrb- lead to the guest-chamber a large bare room devoid of furniture of any kind with smoke-blackened wall and rotten insecure flooring a number of rat scamper away at we approach i wonder what on earth they can find to eat until gerôme point out a large hole in the center of the apartment this afford a excellent view of the stable ten or twelve foot below admit at the same time a pungent and overpowering odour of manure and ammonia a smaller room a kind of ante-chamber lead out of this as it be partly roofless i seek but in vain for a door to shut out the icy cold blast further search in the guest-room reveal six large window or rather hole for there be no shutter much less window-panes it be colder here if anything than outside for the draught be always at once but we must in persium be thankful for small mercy there be a chimney in which a good log fire kindle by gerôme be soon blaze lunch and a nip of the colonel 's vodka work wonder and we be begin to think over a papirosh that persium be not such a bad place after all when the shagird 's head appear at the window there be only two horse available for the next stage but a third have be send for from a neighbouring village and will shortly arrive as night be fall fast i set out with the shagird for the next station rustemabad leave gerôme who have already travel the road and know it well to follow alone it be still snow fast but my mount be a great improvement on that of the morning luckily for the stage be a long one and we have a stiff mountain to climb before reach we destination for the night we ride for three hour slowly and silently over a plain knee-deep in snow about half-way across a tinkle of bell be hear clear and musical in the distance presently a large caravan loom out of the dusk -- fifty or sixty camel and half a dozen man the latter exchange a cheery good night with my guide slowly the ungainly heavily laden beast file past we gaunt and spectral in the twilight the bell die away on the still wintry air and we be again alone on the desolate plain -- not a sign of life not a sound to be hear but the crunching of snow under we horse ' foot and the occasional pistol-like crack of my guide 's heavy whip it be almost dark when we commence the ascent of the mountain on the far side of which lie rustemabad the path be rough and narrow and in place hew out of the solid rock towards the summit where a slip or false step would be fatal a dark shapeless mass appear completely bar the pathway on the white snow closer inspection reveal a dead camel abandon doubtless by the caravan we have just pass for the carcase be yet warm with considerable difficulty but aid by the hard slippery ground we drag it to the brink of the precipice and send it crash down through bush and briar to fall with a loud splash into a foam torrent far below during this performance one of the pony get loose and half a hour be lose in catch he again so the journey wear on half-way down on the other side of the mountain my pony stumble and shoot I head first into a pool of liquid mud from which i be with some difficulty extricate wet through and chill to the bone the discomfort be bad enough but worse still my sable pelisse the valuable gift of a russian friend be i fear utterly ruin it be nearly nine o'clock when we reach rustemabad to find rather worse quarter than we have leave at koudoum to make matter worse i have no change of clothes and the black ill-smelling mud have penetrate to the innermost recess of my saddle-bag which do not tend to improve the flavor of the biscuit and chocolate that constitute my evening meal no food of any kind be procurable at the post-house and all we own provision be behind with gerôme luckily i have stick to the flask of vodka with the help of the postmaster a decrepit half-witted old man and the sole inmate of the place i manage to kindle a good fire and set to work to dry my clothes a somewhat uncomfortable process as it entail my remain three-parts naked for half the night in a atmosphere very little above zero the sable be in a terrible state it be midnight before the mud on they be sufficiently dry to brush off as i fondly hope in the morning gerôme do not turn up till one o'clock be he horse not have arrive at koudoum till past seven he have lose he way twice and have almost give up all hope of reach rustemabad till daylight when my fire the only light in the place shine out of the darkness the poor fellow be so stiff and numbed with fatigue and cold that i have to lift he off he horse and carry he into the post-house he be a sorry object but i could not refrain from smile my companion 's usually comical ruddy face wear a woebegone look while long icicle hang from he hair eyebrow and moustache give he the appearance of a very melancholy old father christmas morning bring a cloudless blue sky and brilliant sunshine my first thought on awake be for the pelisse summon the old postmaster i confide the precious garment to he with strict injunction to take it outside beat it well with a stick and bring it back to I to brush in the mean time we busy ourselves with breakfast and a cup of steam cocoa for a long ride be before we it be still bitterly cold with a strong north-easter blow the thermometer marked -lrb- in the sun -rrb- only one degree above zero rustemabad a collection of straggle tumble-down hovel contain about four or five hundred inhabitant the post-house perch on the summit of a steep hill be situate some little distance from the village which stand in the center of a plateau bound on the south-west by a chain of precipitous mountain the country around be fertile and productive be well water by the sefid roud -lrb- white river -rrb- rice be largely grown but to-day not a trace of vegetation be visible nothing but the vast white plain smooth and unbroken save where here and there a brown village blurr its smooth surface a oasis of mud hut in this desert of dazzling snow a exclamation from gerôme suddenly draw my attention to the postmaster who stand at the open doorway my pelisse in hand i be then unused to the way and custom of the persian peasantry or should have know that it be but labor lose to make one spring at the old idiot and twine my finger in he throat shake he till he yell for mercy nothing but a thick stick have the slightest effect upon the shah 's subject and i be for a moment sorely tempt to use mine the reader must own that i should have be justified it be surely enough to try the patience of a saint for the old imbecile have deliberately walk down to the river make a hole in the ice and soak the garment in water to the waist reduce it to its former condition of liquid slime this be _ he _ method of get the mud off i may add that this intelligent official have _ assist I in the dry process up till midnight _ there be no help for it nothing to be do but cut off the damage portion from the waist to the heel -- no easy matter for it be freeze as stiff as a board it will make a better riding-jacket now say gerôme consolingly but this son of a pig shall not gain by it he add stamp the ruin remain into the now expire fire the village of patchinar at the foot of the dreaded kharzán pass be to be we halting-place for the night the post-road after leave rustemabad lead through the valley of the sefid roud river in which by the way there be excellent salmon-fishing about six mile from rustemabad be a spot call by the native the castle of the wind on account of the high wind that even in the calmest weather prevail there although out on the plain there be a scarcely perceptible breeze we have to literally fight we way against the terrific gust that sweep through this narrow gorge fortunately it be a fine day but the fine powdery snow whirl up and cut into we eye and face and make travel very unpleasant these violent wind-storm have never be satisfactorily account for they continue for a certain number of hour every day summer and winter increase in force till sunset when they abate to rise again the follow dawn on some occasion horse and even camel have be blow over and caravan be sometimes compel to halt until the fury of the storm have diminish cross a ridge of low hill we descend into the valley of roudbar a quiet and peaceful contrast to the one we have just leave the wind now cease as if by magic much of the snow have here disappear under the warm sunshine while before we nestle in a grove of olive tree lay the pretty village with its white picturesque house and narrow street shaded by gaily striped awning it be like a transformation-scene this sudden change from winter with its gray sky and cold icy blast to the sunny stillness and repose of a english summer 's day we ride through the bazaar a busy and crowd one for so small a place a large trade be do here in olive most of it be in the hand of two enterprising frenchman who start business some year ago and be do well we manage to get a mouthful of food at menjil while the horse be be change colonel s -- have especially warn we against sleep here the chapar khaneh be infested with the meana bug a species of camel tick which inflict a poisonous and sometimes dangerous wound it be only find in certain district and rarely meet with south of teherán the virus have be know in some case to bring on typhoid fever and one european be say to have die from its effect for the truth of this i can not vouch but there be no doubt that the bite be always follow by three or four day ' more or less serious indisposition chapter iv patchinar -- teher n we trouble commence in real earnest at patchinar a desolate-looking place and filthy post-house which be reach at sunset the post from teherán have just arrive in charge of a tall strap fellow arm to the tooth in dark blue uniform and astrachan cap bear the imperial badge the lion and sun in brass the mail be ten day late and have meet with terrible weather on the kharzán they have pass only that morning two man lie by the roadway freeze to death the poor fellow be on they way to teherán from menjil and have lie where they fall for two or three day you have far better have remain at résht add we informant unpleasantly recall to my mind the colonel 's prophecy you will be sorry for this to-morrow notwithstanding hunger and vermin we manage to enjoy a tolerable night 's rest the post-house be warm at any rate be windowless patchinar be evidently a favorite halting-place for the dingy wall of the guest-room be cover with write and pencil sketch the work of traveller try to kill time from the frenchman who warn one -lrb- in rhyme -rrb- to beware of the thieving propensity of the postmaster to the more practical englishman who in a bold hand have scrawl across the wall _ big bug here _ i may add that my countryman be not exaggerate there be no difficulty in get horse the next morning the post which leave for résht before we be stir have leave we seven sorry-looking steed wear out with they previous day 's journey through the deep snow-drift of the kharzán by nine o'clock we be ready to start notwithstanding the entreaty of the postmaster whose anxiety however be not on we account but on that of the horse i do not believe i shall ever see they again he mumble mournfully as we ride out of the yard and who be to repay I for they loss you will be dead too before sundown if the snow catch you in the mountain but there seem no probability of such a contingency the sky be blue and cloudless the sun so bright that the glare off the snow soon become unbearable without smoked goggles the promise of a extra kerán or two if we reach the end of the stage by daylight have a wonderful effect on the shagird though it be terribly heavy go and the snow in place up to we girth we cover the five mile lie between patchinar and the foot of the kharzán in a little over three hour -- good go consider the state of the road we be as often off the former as on it for there be nothing to guide one nothing but telegraph pole and wire be visible and these be occasionally lay straight across country away from the track we destination for the night be the village of kharzán which be situate near the summit of the mountain about six thousand foot high the ascent be continuous and precipitous a idea may be gain of the steepness by the fact that we now leave the valley of the shah roud barely one thousand foot above sea-level to ascend in a distance of about twelve mile over six thousand foot the kharzán pass be at all time dread by traveller native and european even in summer when there be no avalanche to fear snow-drift to bar the way or ice to render the narrow tortuous pathway even more insecure a serious inconvenience not to say danger be the meeting of two camel caravan travel in opposite direction on the narrow track which in many place be barely ten foot broad and barely sufficient to allow two horse to pass each other to say nothing of heavily laden camel but to-day we be safe so far as this be concern not a soul be to be see in the cleft and ravine around or on the great white expanse stretch out beneath we foot as we creep cautiously up the side of the mountain we guide halt every ten or fifteen yard to probe the snow with a long pole and make sure that we have not get off the path a stiff and tedious climb of nearly seven hour bring we to within a mile of the summit halt for a short time we refresh ourselves with a couple of biscuit and a nip of brandy and proceed on we journey we have now arrive at the most dangerous part of the pass the pathway hew out of the solid rock and about ten foot wide be cover with a solid layer of ice eight or ten inch thick over which we horse skate about in a most uncomfortable manner there be no guard-rail or protection of any sort on the precipice side all go well for a time and i be begin to congratulate myself on have reach the summit without-accident when gerdme 's horse just in front of I blunder and nearly light on he head ah son of a pig 's mother yell the little russian in true cossack vernacular as the poor old screw thoroughly do up make a desperate peck end in a slither that bring he to within a foot of the brink that be a close shave monsieur he continue as he pony struggle back into safety i shall get off and walk wet foot be better than a broken neck any day the word be scarcely out of he mouth when a loud cry from the shagird and a snort and struggle from the pack-horse behind attract my attention this time the beast have slip with a vengeance and be half-way over the edge make with he fore foot frantic effort to regain _ terra firma _ while he hind leg and quarter dangle in mid-air there be no time to dismount and render assistance the whole thing be over in less than ten seconds the shagird might indeed have save the fall have he keep he head instead of lose it all he could do be with a loud voice and outstretched arm to invoke the assistance of allah we be not long in suspense slowly inch by inch the poor brute lose he hold of the slippery ground and disappear with a shrill neigh of terror from sight for two or three seconds we hear he striking here and there against a jut rock or shrub till with a final thud he land on a small plateau of deep snow-drift at least three hundred foot below here he lay motionless and apparently dead while we could see through we glass a thin stream of crimson flow from under he gradually stain the white snow around -lrb- illustration : cross the khadz n -rrb- a cat be popularly suppose to have nine life after my experience of the persian post-horse i shall never believe that that rough and ill-shaped but useful animal have less than a dozen the fall i have describe would assuredly have kill a horse of any other nationality if i may use the word it seem on the contrary to have a tonic and exhilarating effect on this patchinar pony before we could reach he -lrb- a work of considerable difficulty and some risk -rrb- he have rise to he foot give himself a good shake and be nibble away at a bit of gorse that peep through the snow on which he have fall a deep cut on the shoulder be he only injury and curiously enough we portmanteau with the exception of a broken strap be unharmed there be luckily nothing breakable in either kharzán a miserable village under snow for six month of the year be reach without further mishap there be no post-house and the caravanserai be crowd with caravan before sundown however we be comfortably install in the house of the head-man of the place who spread carpet of soft texture and quaint design in we honor regale we with a excellent pilaff and produce a flask of persian wine the latter would hardly have pass muster in europe the cork consist of a plug of cotton-wool plaster with clay the contents be of a muddy-brown color it be pure hamadán say we host with pride as he place the bottle before we perhaps the sahib do not know that we country be famous for its wine it be not altogether unpalatable something like light but rather sweet hock very different however in its effect to that innocent beverage and one could not drink much with impunity its cheapness surprise I : one shill a quart bottle that at least be the price we host charge -- probably more than half again its real value the winegrower of hamadán have many difficulty to contend with among other the severe cold in winter the wine be keep in huge jar contain six or seven hundred bottle these be bury in the ground they neck be surround by hot bed of ferment horse-dung to keep the wine from freezing but even this plan sometimes fail and it have to be chop out in solid block and melt for drinking kharzán have a population of about a thousand inhabitant it be here that baker pasha be bring some year ago in a die condition after be catch in a wind-storm on the kharzán pass and lay for three day in the house we be lodge at we old friend show we a clasp-knife present he by the colonel who on that occasion nearly lose both he foot from frost-bite captain gill and clayton -lrb- a -rrb- of the royal engineer and ninth lancer be with he but escape unharmed stiff and worn out with the event of the day we soon stretch ourselves in front of the blaze fire in anticipation of a good night 's rest but sleep be not for we in the next room be a party of persian merchant from astrakhan on they way to bagdad _ viâ _ teherán who have be prisoner here for five day and be now carouse on the strength of get away on the morrow a woman be with they -- a brazen-faced shrill-voiced armenian who make more noise than all the rest put together singing dancing quarrel and drink go on without intermission till long past midnight we neighbor raise such a din that the good people of kharzán a quarter of a mile away must have turn uneasily in they slumber and wonder whether a army of fiend have not break loose towards 1 be the noise cease and we be just drop to sleep when at about half-past two in the morning we drunken friend head by the lady burst into we apartment with the information in bad russian that a gang of fifty man send that morning to clear a path through the deep snow have just return and the road to mazreh be now practicable the caravan would be start in a hour they add and you would better travel with they join in the lady contemptuously or you will be sure to get into trouble by yourselve a reply more forcible than polite from gerôme then clear the apartment and rekindle the now expire ember we prepare for the road we set out at dawn for the gate of the village where the caravan be to assemble it be still freezing hard and the narrow street like sheet of solid ice so that we horse keep they leg with difficulty we must have number fifty or sixty camel and as many mule and horse all heavily laden daybreak disclose a weird beautiful scene : a sea of snow over which the rise sun throw countless effect of light and color from the cold slate gray immediately around we gradually lighten to the faintest tint of rose and gold on the eastern horizon where star be pale in a cloudless sky portray on canvas the picture would have look unnatural so brilliant be the hue throw by the rise sun over the land - or rather snow-scape the cold though intense be not unbearable for there be fortunately no wind and the spirit rise with the crisp brace air brilliant sunshine and jangle of caravan bell as one realize that teherán be now well within reach and the dreaded kharzán a thing of the past gerôme give vent to he feeling with a succession of roulade and operatic air for my little friend have a very good opinion of he vocal power which i unfortunately do not share but he be a cheery indefatigable creature and of indomitable pluck and one gladly forgive he this he only fail it be terribly hard work all that morning and gerôme have four i three fall on one occasion wrenching my right ankle badly some of the drift through which we ride must have be at least ten or fifteen foot deep some tough faggot throw over these afford a footing or we should never have get over towards midday mazreh be sight and we push on ahead leave the caravan to its own device the going be now better and it be soon far behind we the only object visible from the low hill which we now ascend the camel and mule look from this distance like fly crawl over a huge white sheet lunch at mazreh consist of damp mouldy bread and some sweet sickly liquid the postmaster call tea procure fresh horse without difficulty we set out about 3 pm for kazvin it be not till 10 pm that we be ride through the great gate of that city which the soldier on guard consent with some demur to open kazvin boast a hotel and a boulevard the latter be light by a dozen oil-lamp the former though a palatial building of brick with verandah and good room be leave to darkness and the rat in the absence of traveller have grope we way for half a hour or so about a labyrinth of dark narrow street we presently emerge on the dimly light boulevard -lrb- three of the oil-lamp have go out -rrb- and ride up to the melancholy look hostelry at the end fail to obtain admission we burst open the door and make ourselves as comfortable as circumstance would allow food be out of the question drink save some villainous rakus of gerôme 's also but there be plenty of firewood and we soon have a good fire in the grate this hotel be originally build by the shah for the convenience of himself and minister when on he way to europe it be only on these rare occasion that the barn-like building be put in order vision of former luxury be still visible in we bedroom in the shape of a bedstead toilet-table and looking-glass but we can not eat _ they _ say gerôme mournfully kazvin which now have a population of 30000 have see better day it be once capital of persium with 120000 inhabitant stroll out in the morning before breakfast i find it well and regularly build and surround by a mud wall with several gate of beautiful mosaic now much chip and deface be the junction of the road from tabriz on the west and résht on the north to the capital be now kazvin 's sole importance the road to teherán be make some year ago at enormous expense by the shah but it have now in true persian style be leave to fall into decay it be only in the finest and driest weather that the journey can be make on wheel and this be naturally out of the question for we a railway be moot some time since along this the only respectable carriage-road in persium -- but the project be soon abandon the post-houses however be a great improvement on any in other part of the country at kishlak for instance we find a substantial brick building with a large guest-room down the center of which run a long table with spotless table-cloth spread out with plate of biscuit apple nut pear dry fruit and sweetmeat beautifully decorate with gold and silver paper and at interval decanter of water -- rather cold fare with the thermometer at a few degree above zero the fruit and biscuit be shrivel and tasteless have evidently be there some month it remind I of a child 's doll dinner-party with the exception of these barmecide feast and some straw-flavoured egg there be nothing substantial to be get in any of the post-houses till we reach we destination about four o'clock on the 27th we first sight the white peak of mount demavend and by three o'clock next day be within sight of the dingy brown wall mud house and white minaret of the city of the shah -- teherán -lrb-

ball-room pretty face smart gown good music and a excellent supper -- thus surround i pass my first evening in teherán a pleasant contrast indeed to the precede night of dirt cold and hunger but it be not without serious misgiving that i accept the courteous invitation of the german embassy the cross of the kharzán have not improve the appearance of dress-clothes and shirt to say nothing of my eye be in the condition describe by pugilist as bung up my face of the hue of a boil lobster the effect of sun and snow one be strike on enter teherán with the apparent cleanliness of the place as compare with other oriental town the absence of heap of refuse cess-pool open drain and bad smell be remarkable to one accustom to eastern city but this be perhaps at the time of my visit due to the pure rarified atmosphere the keen frosty air of winter teherán in January with its cold brace climate and teherán in June with the thermometer above ninety in the shade be two very different thing and the town be so unhealthy in summer that all european who can afford to do so live on the hill around the capital the environs be not picturesque they have be liken to those of madrid have the same brown calcined soil the same absence of tree and vegetation the city view from outside the wall be ugly and insignificant and on a dull day indistinguishable at no great distance in clear weather however the beehive-like dwelling and rumble rampart stand out in bold relief against a background of blue sky and dazzling snow-mountain over which tower in solitary grandeur the peak of mount demavend -lrb- a -rrb- a extinct volcano over 20000 foot high the summit of which be report by native to be haunt the ascent be gradual and easy and have frequently be make by european teherán be divide into two part -- the old city and the new in the former inhabit only by native the street be narrow dark and tortuous lead at interval into large square with deep tank of run water in the center the latter be characteristic of persium and have in summer a deliciously cool appearance the coping of the fountain be only a inch or so in height and the water almost flush with the ground the new or european quarter be bisect by a broad tree-lined thoroughfare aptly name the boulevard des ambassadeurs for here be the legation of england france and germany the russian embassy a poor building in comparison with the other stand in another part of the town hard by the english embassy be the hôtel prevôt keep by a frenchman of that name once confectioner-in-chief to he majesty the shah here we take up we quarter during we stay in the capital at the extremity of the boulevard des ambassadeurs be the place des canons so call from the old and useless cannon of various age that surround it the square be form by low barn-like barracks they whitewashed wall decorate with gaudy and rudely draw picture of persian soldier and horse beyond this again and approach by a avenue of poplar tree light by electric light be the palace of the shah with nothing to indicate the presence in town of the sovereign but a guard of ragged-looking unkempt persian in russian uniform lounge about the principal gateway the persian soldier be not a credit to he country although drill and command by european officer he be a slouch awkward fellow badly pay ill feed and not renown for bravery the ordinary infantry uniform consist of a dark-blue tunic and trousers with red facing and a high astrachan busby with the brass badge of the lion and sun to a stranger however the varied and grotesque costume in which these clown be put by they imperial master be somewhat confusing one may see for instance russian cossack french chasseur german uhlan and austrian cuirassier incongruously mix up together in the rank on parade he army be the shah 's favorite toy and nothing afford the eccentric monarch so much amusement as constant change of uniform as the latter be manufacture in and send out from the country they represent the expense to the state be considerable the first european to instruct this rabble be frenchman but england russium germany and austrium have all supply officer and instructor within the past fifty year without however any good result although the arsenal at teherán be full of the latest improvement in gun and magazine rifle these be keep lock up and only for show the old brown bess alone be use the cossack regiment always station at teherán ostensibly for the protection of the shah and officer by russian be the only one with any attempt at discipline or order and be arm with the berdán rifle the teherán bazaar be at first sight commonplace and uninteresting though of enormous extent -lrb- it contain in the daytime over thirty thousand soul -rrb- it lack the picturesque oriental appearance of those of cairo or constantinople where costly and beautiful wares be set out in tempting array before the eye of the unwary stranger here they be keep in the background and a european must remain in the place for a couple of month or so and make friend with the merchant before he be even permit to see they the position be reverse at stamboul the stranger be pester and worry to buy at teherán one must sometimes entreat before be allow even to inspect the contents of a silk or jewel stall even then the owner will probably remain supremely indifferent as to whether the farangus purchase or not this fact be curious it will probably disappear with the advance of civilization and mr cook -lrb- illustration : teher n -rrb- debouch from the principal street or alley of the bazaar which be of brick be large cover caravanserai or open space for the storage of goods where the wholesale merchant have they warehouse the architecture of some of these caravanserai be very fine the cool quiet hall they domed roof embellish with delicate stone carve and blue white and yellow tile dimly reflect in the inevitable marble tank of clear water below be a pleasant retreat from the stifle alley and sun-baked street talk of tank there seem to be no lack of water in teherán i be surprise at this for there be few country so deficient in this essential commodity as persium it be i find artificially supply by connaught or subterranean aqueduct flow from mountain stream which be practically inexhaustible in order to keep a straight line shaft be dig every fifty yard or so and the earth throw out of the shaft form a mound which be not remove thus a persian landscape dot with hundred of these hillock often resemble a field full of huge ant-hill the mouth of these shaft leave open and unprotected be a source of great danger to traveller by night teherán be provide with thirty or forty of these aqueduct which be construct by the government some year ago at enormous expense and labor as in most eastern city each trade have its separate alley or thoroughfare in the teherán bazaar thus of jeweller silk mercer tailor gunsmith saddler coppersmith and the rest each have they separate arcade the shop or stall be much alike in appearance though they vary considerably in size behind a brick platform about three foot wide and two foot in height be the shop a vaulted archway in the middle of which surround by he wares kalyan -lrb- b -rrb- or cigarette in mouth squat the shopkeeper there be no window at night a few rough board and a rough russian padlock be the sole protection save a smaller apartment at the back of each stall a kind of strong-room guard by massive iron-bound door in which the most valuable goods be keep there be no attempt at decoration a few only of the jeweller ' shop be whitewashed inside the best be hang with the cheapest and gaudiest of french or german color print the stall be usually open about 630 be and close at sunset a hour later the bazaar be untenanted save for the watchman and pariah dog the latter be see throughout the day sleep in hole and corner many of they almost tear to piece from nightly encounter and kick about even by child with impunity it be only at night that the brute become really dangerous and when in pack of from twenty to thirty they have be know to attack and kill man occasionally the dog of one quarter of the bazaar attack those of another and desperate fight ensue the kill and wound be afterwards eat by the victor it be therefore unsafe to venture out in the street of teherán after dark without a lantern and good stout cudgel from 11 to 12 be be perhaps the busiest part of the day in the bazaar then be one most strike with the varied and picturesque type of oriental humanity the continuously change kaleidoscope of native race from archangel to the persian gulf the baltic sea to afghanistán nor be contrast want here be ivanoff from odessa or tifli in the white

top of they voice woman scream beggar whine fruit and water seller jingle they cymbal while from the coppersmith ' quarter hard by come a deafening accompaniment in the shape of beaten metal occasionally a caravan of laden camel stalk gravely through the alley scatter the yell crowd right and leave only to reassemble the moment it have pass like water in the wake of a ship again it

-rrb- as the sedan swing by towards midday business be suspend for a while and the alley of the bazaar empty as if by magic for nearly a whole hour silence unbroken save by the snarl of some pariah dog the hiss of the samovar and gurgle of the kalyan fall over the place till 2 pm when the noise recommence as suddenly as it cease and continue unbroken till sunset on the whole the bazaar be disappointing the stall for the sale of persian and central asian carpet old brocade and tapestry and other wares dear to the lover of eastern art be in the minority and must be hunt out manchester goods cheap calico and print german cutlery and birmingham ware be find readily enough and form the stock of two-third of the shop in the carpet and silk-mercer ' arcade it be by no means easy to find one 's way about no one understand a word of english french or german and have it not be for my knowledge of russian -- which by the way be the one know european language among the lower order -- i should more than once have be hopelessly lose european in teherán lead a pleasant though somewhat monotonous life summer be as i have say intolerable and all who can seek refuge in the hill where there be two settlement or village present by the shah to england and russia winter be undoubtedly the pleasantest season scarcely a evening pass without a dance private theatricals or other festivity give by one or other of the embassy entertainment which he imperial majesty himself frequently grace with he presence there be probably no living sovereign of whom so little be really know in europe as nasr-oo-din shah of persium asylum of the universe and king of king to quote three of he more modest title although he have visit europe twice and be make much of in we own country most english people know absolutely nothing of the persian monarch 's character or private life that he eat _ entrées _ with he finger at buckingham palace express a desire to have the lord chamberlain bowstrung and conceive a violent and unholy passion for a amiable society lady somewhat inclined to _ embonpoint _ we be most of we aware but beyond this the shah 's _ vie intime _ remain to the majority of we at least a seal book this be perhaps a pity for like many other nasr-oo-din be not so black as he be paint and notwithstanding all report to the contrary be say by those who should know to be one of the kindest-hearted creature breathe the government of persium be that of a absolute monarchy the shah alone have power of life and death and even in the most remote district the assent of the sovereign be necessary before a execution can take place the shah appoint he own minister these be the sadr-azam or prime minister the sapar-sala commander-in-chief mustof-al-mamalak secretary of state and minister of foreign affair these be suppose to represent the privy council but they very seldom meet the shah prefer to manage affair independently the total revenue of the latter have be estimate at seven million pound sterling nasr-oo-din who be now sixty-five year of age ascend the throne in 1848 he reign commence inauspiciously with a determine attempt to assassinate he make by a gang of fanatic of the babus sect the plot though nearly successful be frustrated and the conspirator execute but it be say that the shah have live in constant dread of assassination ever since he be hypochondriacal and though in very fair health be constantly on the _ qui vive _ for some imaginary ailment the post of court physician fill for many year past by dr tholozan a frenchman be no sinecure the habit of the shah be simple he be unlike most persian of high class abstemious as regard both food and drink two meal a day serve at midday and 9 pm and those of the plainest diet wash down by a glass or two of claret or other light wine be all he allow himself when on a hunting-excursion he favorite occupation the shah be even more abstemious go sometimes a whole day without food of any kind he be a crack shot and be out nearly daily when the weather permit shooting over he splendid preserve around teherán there be no lack of sport tiger and bear abound also partridge woodcock snipe and many kind of water-fowl but the shah be better with the rifle than the fowling-piece the shah be passionately fond of music and have two or three string and brass band train and conduct by a frenchman when away on a long sporting-excursion he be invariably accompany by one of these band be it not for the run attendant in scarlet and gold and the crimson-dyed -lrb- d -rrb- tail of he horse no one would take the slim swarthy old gentleman in black frock-coat ride slowly through the street and beam benignly through a huge pair of spectacles for the great shah-in-shah himself yet he be stern and pitiless enough when necessary as many of the court official can vouch for but few have escape the bastinado at one time or another but in persium this be not consider a indignity even by the highest in the land the stick be painful certainly but not a disgrace in this strange country nasr-oo-din have three legal wife and a unlimited number of concubine of the former the head wife shuku-es-sultana be he own cousin and the great-granddaughter of the celebrated fatti-ali-shah whose family be so large that at the time of he death one hundred and twenty of he descendant be still live shuku-es-sultana be the mother of the valliad or crown prince now governor of tabriz the second wife be a granddaughter of fatti-ali-shah and the third -lrb- the shah 's favorite -rrb- be one anys-u-dowlet the latter be the best look of the three and certainly possess the greatest influence in state affair of the concubine the mother of the zil-i-sultan -lrb- shadow of the king -rrb- rank the first in seniority the zil-i-sultan be though illegitimate the shah 's eldest son and be with the exception of he father the most influential man in persium the heir-apparent -lrb- valliad -rrb- be a weak foolish individual easily lead and addict to drink and the lowest form of sensuality with the exception of eunuch no male person over the age of ten be permit in the seraglio or anderoon which be constantly receive fresh importation from the province persian deny that there be any european woman but this be doubtful the harem of constantinople and cairo be recruit from pari and vienna why not those of teherán the indoor costume of the persian lady must be somewhat try at first to those accustom to european toilette the skirt reach only to the knee be full and _ bouffé _ like a opera-dancer 's the foot and leg generally bare the only become part of the whole costume be the tightly fitting zouave jacket of light blue or scarlet satin thickly braid with gold and the gauze head-dress embroidered with the same material and fasten under the chin with a large turquoise ruby or other precious stone some of the woman -lrb- even among the concubine -rrb- be highly educate can play on the tar -lrb- e -rrb- or harmonica sing and read and write poetry but they recreation be necessarily somewhat limited picnic music story-telling kalyan and cigarette smoking sweetmeat-making and the bath together with somewhat less innocent pastime form the sum total of a persian concubine 's amusement outside the wall of the anderoon they be closely watch and guard for persian be jealous of they woman and even in the most formal social gathering there be a strict separation of the sex its imperial master occasionally join in the outdoor amusement of he harem indeed he himself invent a game a few year since which sound more original than amusing a slide of smooth alabaster about twenty foot long on a inclined plane be construct in one of he bath-house down this the shah would gravely slide into the water follow by he seraglio the sight must have be a strange one the costume on these occasion be to say the least of it scanty -lrb- illustration : persian dancing-girl -rrb- the shah 's greatest fail be perhaps vacillation he be constantly change he mind on trifling matter chiefly for he northern neighbor take care that he be more consistent in affair of state two or three time between he visit to europe in 1871 and 1889 he have start with great pomp and a large retinue for the land of the farangus but on arrival at résht have return to teherán without a word of warn to he minister or apparent reason for he sudden change of plan these false start become a recognize thing after a time and when in 1888 he majesty embark on he yacht and set sail for baku it come as a surprise pleasant or otherwise to he subject at teherán the final undertaking of the journey may have be advise by he astrologer for the shah be intensely superstitious and never travel without they nor will he on any account start on a journey on a Friday or the thirteenth day of the month the palace of teherán be see from the outside a shapeless ramshackle structure the outside wall be whitewashed and cover with gaudy red and blue picture of man and horse the former in modern military tunic and shako the latter paint a bright red the figure rudely draw remind one of a charity schoolboy 's artistic effort on a slate but be somewhat out of place on the wall of a royal residence the interior of the ark as it be call be a pleasant contrast to the outside although even here in the museum which contain some of the finest gem and _ objet d'art _ in the world the various object be place with singular disregard of order not to say good taste one see for instance a tawdrily dress mechanical doll from pari standing next to a case contain the daraus nor or sea of light a magnificent diamond obtain in indium and say to be the largest yet discover though somewhat inferior in quality to the koh-i-noor a cheap and somewhat dilapidated cuckoo-clock and toy velocipede flank the famous globe of the world in diamond and precious stone this the most costly and beautiful piece of workmanship in the place be about eighteen inch in diameter and be say to have cost eight million of franc the different country be mark out with surprising accuracy and detail -- persium be represent by turquoise england by diamond africa by ruby and so on the sea being of emerald the museum itself be about sixty foot in length by twenty-five foot broad its ceiling compose entirely of looking-glass its parquet flooring strew with priceless persian rug and carpet large oil-painting of queen victorium the czar of russium and other sovereign surround the wall include two portrait of she majesty the ex-empress eugenie it would weary the reader to wade through a description of the jade work and _ cloisonné _ the porcelain of all country the japanese work of art in bronze and gold and last but not least the cut and uncut diamond and precious stone temptingly lay out in open saucer like _ bonbon _ in a confectioner 's shop the diamond be perhaps the finest as regard quality but there be a roughly cut ruby surmount the imperial crown say to be the largest in the world though it be very cold and the snow lay deep upon the ground my stay at teherán be not unpleasant the keen brace air brilliant sunshine and cloudless blue sky somewhat make amends for the sorry lodging and execrable fare provide by mine host at the hôtel prevôt i have seldom in my travels come across a french inn where be the material ever so poor the landlord be not able to turn out a decent meal i have fare well and sumptuously at new caledonium saigon and even pekin under the auspices of a french innkeeper but at teherán -lrb- nearest of any to civilized europe -rrb- be compel to swallow food that would have disgrace a fifth-rate _ gargotte _ in the slum of pari perhaps monsieur prevôt have become persianized perhaps the dulcet tone of madame p whose voice incessantly rate she servant remind one of unoiled machinery and commence at sunrise only to be silence -lrb- by exhaustion -rrb- at sunset disturb he at he culinary labor the fact remain that the _ cuisine _ be to any but a starve man uneatable the bedroom which madame be kind enough to assign to I pitch dark and stuffy as a dog-kennel a long conference with general s -- a austrian in the persian service decide my future movement the general one of the highest geographical authority on persium strongly dissuade my attempt to reach indium _ viâ _ meshéd and afghanistán you will only be stop and send back say he what be the use of lose time i resolve therefore after mature deliberation to proceed direct to ispahán shiráz and bushire and from thence by steamer to sonmianus on the coast of baluchistán from the latter port i be to strike due north to kelát and quetta and that add the general will bring you across eighty or a hundred mile of totally unexplored country you will have have quite enough of it when you get to kelát -- if you ever _ do _ get there he add encouragingly the route now finally decide upon preparation be make for a start as soon as possible portmanteau be exchange for a pair of light leather saddle-bag artistically embellish with square of bright persian carpet let in at the side and purchase in the bazaar for twenty-two keráns or about seventeen shilling english money in these i be able to carry with ease a couple of tweed suit half a dozen flannel shirt three pair of boot and toilet necessaries to say nothing of a box of cigar and a small medicine-chest gerôme also carry a pair of bag contain in addition to he modest wardrobe we store for the voyage -- biscuit valentine 's meat juice sardine tea and a bottle of brandy for with the exception of egg and persian bread one can reckon upon nothing eatable at the chapar khaneh there be a excellent european store shop at teherán and have it not be for limited space we might have regale on turtle soup aspic jelly quail and _ pâté de foie gras _ galore throughout persium mr r n -- a _ attaché _ to the british legation at teherán be justly celebrate for he repast _ en voyage _ and assure I that he invariably sit down to a _ recherché _ dinner of soup three course and iced champagne even when journey to such remote

gate than down come the shagird 's horse as if he be shoot break he girth and rider 's thumb at the same moment luckily we be provide with rope and persian saddle be not complicate in ten minute we be off again but it be terribly hard go and all one can do to keep the horse on they leg towards midday the sun slightly thaw the surface of the frozen snow and make matter still worse up till now the pace have not be exhilarating two or three mile a hour at most it will take some time to reach indium at this rate four or five hour of this work and there be no longer a sign of life to be see on the white waste save about a mile ahead of we a thin wreath of gray smoke and half a dozen blacken tent -- a encampment of gypsy far behind we the tallest minaret of the capital be dip below the horizon while to the leave the white and glittering cone of demavend stand boldly out from a background of deep cloudless blue though the sun be powerful -- so much so indeed that face and hand be already swollen and blister -- the cold in the shade be intense a keen cutting north-easter sweep across the white waste and ride for a time under the shadow of a low ridge of snow i find my cigar freeze to my lip -- nor can i remove it without painfully tear the skin gerôme be in he element and as a natural consequence my spirit fall as he rise the slowness of we progress and constant stumble of my pony do not improve the temper and i be force at last to beg my faithful follower to desist for a time at least from a vocal rendering of la mascotte which have be go on unceasingly since we leave teherán he obey but -lrb- unabashed -rrb- proceed to carry on a long conversation with himself in the tartar language with which i be perhaps happily unacquainted truly he be a man of unfailing resource but even he angelic temper be try when shortly afterwards we ride past the gipsy encampment as he dismount to light a cigarette out of the wind one of the siren in a tent catch sight of the little russian and in less than half a minute he be surround by a mob of dishevelled half-naked female who throw they arm about he pull he hair and ear and try but in vain to secure he horse and drag he into a tent these gipsy be the terror of traveller in persium the man most of they gain a precarious living as tinker and leather-worker with a occasional highway robbery to keep they hand in the woman live entirely by thieve and prostitution the gentleman of the tribe be perhaps luckily for we away from home on this occasion one of the woman a good-looking black-eyed girl be the most persistent among this band of maenad and bolder than the rest utterly refuse to let gerôme get on he pony till white with passion the russian raise he whip this be a signal for a general howl of rage strike I if you dare say the girl she eye ablaze if you do you will never reach the next station but in the confusion gerôme have vault into he saddle and set spur to we horse we gallop or scramble off as quick as the deep snow would allow we crapule va shout the little man whose cheek and hair still bear trace of the struggle il n ' y a qu'en perse qu'on fait des chameaus comme cela ispahán be about seventy farsakh distant from teherán the journey have under favourable condition be ride in under two day but this be very unusual and have seldom be do except for a wager by european in we case speed be of course out of the question with the road in the state it be the ordinary pace be on a average six to eight mile a hour unless the horse be very bad it be nearly a week however before we ride through the gate of ispahán and even this be account a fair performance consider the difficulty we have to contend with towards sunset the wind rise -- a sharp north-easter that make face and ear feel as if they be be flog with stinging-nettle it be not until dusk that we reach rabat kerim a small mud village with a filthy windowless post-house but a pigstye would have be welcome after such a ride and the vermin which a flicker oil-lamp reveal in hundred on wall and flooring do not prevent we sleep soundly till morning my thermometer mark only one degree above zero when we retire to rest and the wood be too damp to light a fire but we be in persium it be only fair however to say that the road we be now travel be not the regular post-road which lie some distance to the eastward of rabat kerim but be now impassable on account of the snow the smaller track join the main road at koom by take the less frequented track we be unable to go through the malak al niote or valley of the angel of death which lie about half-way between the capital and koom the valley be so call from its desolate and sterile appearance though if this be so the greater part of persium might with reason bear the same name be this as it may the shagird and native have the greatest objection to pass through it after dark a legend aver that it be haunt by monster have the body of man and head of beast and bird surround by these apparition who lick he face and hand till he be unconscious the traveller be carry away -- where history do not state -- never to return if the first day 's work have be hard it be child 's play compare to the second the track lead over a vast plain have recently be traverse by a number of camel caravan which have transform it into a kind of jacob 's ladder form by hole a couple of foot deep in the snow as long as the horse tread into they all go well but a few inch to the right or leave generally bring they blunder on to they nose the reader may imagine what a day of this work mean the strain on mind and muscle be almost unbearable to say nothing of the blinding glare yet one could not but admire during we brief pause for rest the picture before we the boundless expanse of sapphire blue and dazzling white with not a speck to mar it save where occasionally the warm sun-ray have here and there lay bare chain of dark rock give they the appearance of island in this ocean of snow at pitché the midday station no horse be to be have so notwithstanding that deep snow-drift lay between we and kushku baïra the halt for the night we be compel after a couple of hour ' rest to set out on the pony that have bring we from rabat kerim more perhaps by good luck than anything else we reach the latter towards 9 pm a bright starlit night favor we and with the exception of a couple of fall apiece we be none the worse we find too to we great delight a blaze fire burning in the post-house kindle by some caravan-men but there be always a save clause in persium no water be to be have for love or money till the morning and know the rage thirst produce by melted snow we have to forget we thirst till next day -lrb- illustration : post-house at kushku baira -rrb- a pleasant surprise also be in store for we two or three mile beyond kushku baïra we be clear of snow altogether not a vestige of white be visible upon the bare stony plain nothing but dull drab desert stretch away on every side to a horizon of snow-capt hill recall by they very whiteness the misery of the past two day berik allah -lrb- b -rrb- cry gerôme we have do with the snow now inshallah -lrb- c -rrb- i reply though with a inward conviction that we should see it again further on and suffer accordingly the sacred city of koom -lrb- d -rrb- be one of the pleasantest recollection i retain of the ride between the capital and ispahán it be about two o'clock on the afternoon of the 6th of February that breast a chain of low sandy hill the huge golden dome of the tomb of fatima become visible we be then still four mile off but even with we jaded steed the ride become what it have not yet be -- a pleasure the green sunlit plain of wheat and barley intersperse with bar of white and red poppy the picturesque happy-looking peasantry the string of mule and camel caravan with they gaudy trappings and clash bell -- all this life color and movement help to give one new hope and energy and drown the dreary remembrance of past trouble bodily and mental even the caravan of corpse send to koom for interment which we pass every now and again fail to depress we though at time the effluvium be somewhat overpowering many of the body be bring to the sacred city from the most remote part of persium each mule bear two dead body sling on either side like saddle-bag and one could clearly trace the outline of the figure wrap in blue or gray cloth a few of the friend and relative of some of the deceased accompany this weird procession but the greater number of the dead have be consign to the care of the muleteer the latter in true chalvadar -lrb- e -rrb- fashion be stretch out flat on they stomach fast asleep they head loll over they animal arm and leg dangle helplessly while the caravan roam about the track unchecked bang they load against each other to the silent discomfiture of the unfortunate mourner -lrb- illustration : a corpse caravan -rrb- koom be say to cover nearly twice as much ground as shiráz but more than half the city be in ruin the afghan have destroy it in 1722 the principal building be mainly compose of mosque and sepulchre -lrb- for koom be second only to meshéd in sanctity -rrb- but most of they be in a state of decay and dilapidation the mosque contain the tomb of fatima be the finest its dome be cover with plate of silver-gilt -- the native say of pure gold the sacred character of this city be mainly derive from the fact that fatima surname el masouna -lrb- free from sin -rrb- die here many year ago the tradition be that fatima be on she way to the city of tus whither she be go to visit she brother imám riza on arrival at koom she hear of he death which cause she to delay she journey and take up she residence here for a time but she shortly afterwards sicken and die of a broken heart a mausoleum be originally build of a very humble nature but by order of shah abba it be enlarged and richly ornamented inside and out fatti-ali-shah and abba the second be both bury here also the wife of mahomet shah who die in 1873 have have the dome of the mosque cover with gold there be a legend among native that fatima 's body no longer lie in the mosque but be carry bodily to heaven shortly after death the population of koom which now amount to little more than between ten and twelve thousand be formerly much larger like many other persian city -- save perhaps teherán -- it retain but little of its greatness either as regard art or commerce the bazaar be notwithstanding extensive and well supply koom be note for the manufacture of a white porous earthenware which be make into flask and bottle some of beautiful design and workmanship the city be enter from the north by a substantial stone bridge span a swift but shallow river it present at first sight much more the appearance of a spanish or moorish town than a persian one the dirty brown mud hut be replace by picturesque white house with color dome gaily strip awning and carve wooden balcony overhang the stream ride through the city gate we plunge from dazzling sunshine into the cool semi-darkness of the bazaar through which we ride for at least a quarter of a hour when a sudden turn bring we once more into daylight in the yard of a huge caravanserai crowd with mule and camel caravan the apartment or cell allot to we be however so filthy that we decide to push on at once to pasingán the next stage four farsakh distant koom be note for the size and venom of its scorpion and the dim recess of the dark cobwebby chamber with its greasy wall and smoke-blackened ceiling look just the place for these undesirable bedfellow so we ride on again into the open country past crowd of beggar and dervish at the eastern gate as usual busily engage as soon as they see we come at they devotions clear of the city wall one see nothing on every side but huge stork they be hold sacred by the native be suppose to migrate to mecca every year i hear at ispahán that notwithstanding the outward austerity and piety of the people of koom there be no town in persium where so much secret depravity and licentiousness be carry on as in the holy city the stage from koom to pasingán be accomplish in a incredibly short time and i may here mention that this be the only occasion upon which in persium i be ever give a fairly good horse the word _ chapar _ signify in persian to gallop but it be extremely rare to find chapar post pony which have any notion of go out of he own pace -- something between a walk and a canter like the old gray horse that carry round the lady in pink and spangle in a travel circus but to-day i get hold of a wiry game little chestnut who be evidently new to the job and reach and tear away at he bridle as if he enjoy the fun see about half-way that he be bleed at the mouth i call gerôme 's attention to the fact and find that he horse be in the same plight -- as indeed be every animal we pass on the road between koom and pasingán this be on account of the water at and between the two place which be full of small leech invisible except through a microscope horse mule and cattle suffer much in consequence for nothing can be do to remedy the evil a pleasant gallop of under a hour bring we to pasingán it be hardly possible to realize ride through the warm evening air for all the world like a June evening in england that but two day before we have well-nigh be freeze to death have i know what be in store for we beyond kashán i might have marvel even more at this sudden and welcome change of climate the guest-chamber at pasingán be already take by a persian khan a rude blustering fellow who refuse we even a corner so we have perforce to make the best of it downstairs among the rat and vermin devour by the latter and unable to sleep we rise at the first streak of dawn saddle two of the khan 's horse and ride away to sin-sin before any one be astir the poor shagird whom we have to threaten with a severe chastisement if he do not accompany we be in a terrible state the bow-string be the least he could expect when the khan come to know of the trick we have play he a extra kerán at sin-sin however soon console we guide he probably never return to pasingán at all but seek he fortune elsewhere persian post-boy be not particular kashán be distant about fifty-two english mile from pasingán and lie south-east of the latter the caravan track pass a level tract of country sparsely cultivate by means of irrigation persian soil be evidently of the kind that tickle with a hoe laugh with a harvest even in this sterile desert cover for the most part with white salt deposit the little oasis of grain and garden look as fresh and green as though they have be on the bank of a lake or river but the green patch be very few and far between and half-way between the post-station cease altogether nothing be then visible but a waste of brown mud and yellow sand cut clear and distinct against the blue sky-line on the horizon it be strange when cross such tract of country to note how near to one everything seem object six or eight mile off look to-day as if you could gallop up to they in five minute and the peak of demavend on which we be now look we last seem about twenty mile off instead of over one hundred and fifty kashán be reach on the 7th of February at nasirabád a village a few mile out of the city there have be a earthquake that morning many of the mud house be in ruin and they late owner sit dejectedly on the remains earthquake be common enough in persium and this be by no mean we last experience in that line commiserate with the homeless one we divide a few keráns among they in return for which they bring we large water-melon -lrb- for which nasirabád be celebrate -rrb- deliciously flavored and as cold as ice kashán which stand on a vast plain about two thousand foot above sea-level be picturesque and unusually clean for a eastern town the bazaar be a long one and its numerous caravanserai finer even than those of the capital the manufacture of silk -lrb- f -rrb- and copperware be extensive but as usual one see little in the shop _ en evidence _ but shoddy cloth and manchester goods and look in vain for real oriental stuff and carpet i often wonder where on earth they _ be _ to be get for the most persistent effort fail to produce the real thing i often pass on the road camel and mule-cloth that make my mouth water so old be they texture and delicate they pattern and coloring but the owner invariably decline under any circumstance to part with they kashán will ever be associate in my mind with the fact that i there see the prettiest woman it be my luck to meet in persium the glimpse be but a momentary one but amply suffice to convince I that those who say that _ all _ persian woman be ugly -lrb- as many do -rrb- know nothing-whatever about it it be towards sunset in one of the caravanserai to which hot and tired with the long dusty ride i come for a quiet smoke and a cup of coffee the sensation of absolute repose be delicious after the heat and glare the stillness of the place unbroken save for the plash of a marble fountain and outside the far-off voice of the muezzim call the faithful to evening prayer from the blue dome with its golden star and white tracery the setting sun streaming in through color glass throw the softest shades of violet and ruby emerald and amber upon the marble pavement the stall around be close for the night all save one a manna -lrb- g -rrb- shop its owner a white-turbaned old turk and myself be the sole inmate of the caravanserai even my kafedji -lrb- h -rrb- have disappear though probably not without leave instruction to he neighbor to see that i do not make off with the quaint little silver coffee-cup and nargileh it be here that i see the belle of kashán and of persium for aught i know -- a tall slim girl dress not in the hideous bag-like garment usually affect by the persian female but soft white drapery from beneath which peep a pair of loose baggy trousers and tiny foot encase in gold-embroidered slipper invisible to she i make every effort from my hiding-place behind a project stall to catch a glimpse of she face but alas a yashmak be in the way -- not the thin gauzy wisp affect by the smart lady of cairo and constantinople but a thick impenetrable barrier of white linen such as the peasant woman of mohammedan country wear who could she be what be she doing-out unattended at this late hour i have almost give up all hope of see she feature when fortune favor I as the old turk dive into the recess of he shop to attend to the want of he fair customer the latter remove she veil reveal as she do so one of the sweetest and fairest face it have ever be my good fortune to look upon a perfectly oval face soft delicate complexion large dark eye full of expression a small aquiline nose but somewhat large mouth and the whitest and smallest of tooth such be the apparition before I she could not have be more than sixteen i could scarcely restrain from give vent to my admiration in speech when the old turk return in a instant the yashmak be in its place and with a hasty glance around my vision of beauty be scuttle away as fast as she leg could carry she a low musical laugh like a chime of silver bell come back to I from the dark desert alley of the bazaar and i see she no more the manna-seller be evidently irritated and intimate in dumb show that i must leave the caravanserai at once as he be shut up for the night i buy a pound or so of the sweetmeat to pacify he and if possible glean some information about the fair one but my advance be of no avail the history of kashán be closely ally to that of ispahán the former city be found by sultana zobeide wife of the celebrated haroun-al-raschid ransack and destroy by the afghan in the eighteenth century it be again restore or rather rebuild by hajus husein khan perhaps the most interesting thing the city contain be a lean minaret which date from the thirteenth century it be ascend by a rickety spiral staircase from here not so many year ago it be the custom to execute adulterous wife the husband accompany by he relation force he unfaithful spouse to the top of the tower and push she over the side -lrb- there be no balustrade -rrb- to be dash to piece on stone flag about a hundred and thirty foot below pas de chance monsieur be gerôme 's greet as i enter the caravanserai the koudoum pass be block with snow and almost impassable what be to be do mature deliberation bring but one solution to the question : start in the morning and risk it it can not be worse than the kharzán anyhow say gerôme cheerfully as we ride out of kashán next day past the moated mud wall forty foot high that at one time make this city almost impregnable i more than once during the morning however doubt whether we have do right in leave we comfortable quarter at the caravanserai to embark on this uncertain not to say dangerous journey twenty-nine farsakh still lay between we and ispahán but once past the khurood pass -lrb- which lie about seven farsakh from kashán -rrb- all would be plain sailing the summit of the pass be about seven thousand foot above sea-level its valley be in summer green and fertile but during the winter be frequently render impassable by the deep snow as be now the case khurood itself be a village of some size and importance build on the slope of the mountain and here by advice of the villager we rest for the night it will take you at least a day to get to bideshk say the postmaster -- that be if you be go to attempt it the ride from kashán have be pleasant enough no snow be yet visible save in the ravine and the extreme summit of a chain of low rocky hill of which we commence the ascent a couple of hour or so after leave kashán half-way up however it become more difficult the path be cover in place with a thick coating of ice -- a foretaste of the pleasure before we towards the summit of the mountain be a artificial lake form by a strong dyke or bank of stonework which intercept and collect the mountain-stream and melted snow -- a huge reservoir whence the water be let off to irrigate the distant low plain of kashán and indeed to supply the city itself the water of this lake about fifteen foot deep be clear as crystal the bottom and side be cement this reservoir be construct by order of shah abba who seem to have be one of the wisest and best ruler this unfortunate country have ever have for he have certainly do more for he country than nasr-oo-din or any of he stock be likely to pass a finer caravanserai than usual travel a better road cross a finer bridge and interrogate you shagird as to its history and you will invariably receive the answer shah abba at the village of khurood a huge caravanserai -lrb- he work -rrb- lie in ruin have be destroy seven or eight year ago by a earthquake several person be kill the shock occur at night-time when the inmate be asleep the post-house at khurood be cold filthy and swarm with rat -- a animal for which i have always have a especial aversion towards midnight a persian gentleman arrive from kashán -- a mild benign-looking individual with a gray moustache and large blue spectacles the new-comer who speak a little french beg to be allow to join we on the morrow as he be in a hurry to get to ispahán notwithstanding gerôme 's protestation i have not the heart to refuse he look so miserable and helpless and indeed be as i discover too late next day we new acquaintance then suggest send for wine to drink to the success of we journey at this suggestion gerôme wake up and see that in my case the rat have successfully murder sleep i gladly agree to anything that would make the time pass till daylight a couple of bottle be then produce by the postmaster but it be mawkish stuff as sweet as syrup and quite flavourless gerôme and the persian however do not leave a drop and before they have finish the second bottle be swear friend although wine be forbid by the mohammedan faith it be largely indulge in in secret by persian of the upper class i never meet however a follower of the prophet so open about it as we friend at khurood the wine here be from ispahán and cost the persian tell we about sixpence a quart bottle and be in my opinion dear at that shiráz wine be perhaps the best in persium it be white and though very sweet when new develop if keep for three or four year a dry nutty flavor like sherry this however do not last long but give place in a few month to a taste unpleasantly like sweet spirit of nitre which render the wine undrinkable with proper appliance the country would no doubt produce excellent vintage but at present the production of wine in persium be a distinct failure leave at 8 be we manage to reach the summit of the koudoum by two o'clock next day when we halt to give the horse a rest and get a mouthful of food we persian friend have return to koudoum after the first half-mile during which he manage to get three fall for the poor man have no notion of ride or keep a horse on its leg he remind one of the cockney who sit he horse with consummate ease grace and daring until it move when he generally fall off i be sorry for he he be so meek and unresentful even when mercilessly chaff by gerôme we greatest difficulty up till now have arise from ice which completely cover the steep narrow pathway up the side of the mountain and make the ascent slippery and insecure the snow have as yet be a couple of foot deep at most and we have come across no drift of any consequence arrive at the summit however we see what we have to expect below we lay a narrow valley or gorge about a mile broad separate we from the low range of hill on the far side of which lay bideshk the depth of the snow we be about to make a way through be easily calculate by the telegraph-post which in place be cover to within two or three foot of the top you see sahib say the shagird point with he whip to a huge drift some distance to the left of the wire two man lie under that the intelligence do not interest I in the least could we or not get over this valley of death be the only question my mind be at that moment capable of consider -lrb- illustration : a day in the snow -rrb- in less than a quarter of a hour we be in the thick of it up to we waist in the snow and pull rather than lead we horse after we it remind I of a bad channel passage from folkestone to boulogne and take about the same time -- two hour although the actual distance be under a mile and a half gerôme lead the way as long as he be able but about half-way across repeat and violent fall have so exhaust he horse that we be oblige to halt while i take he place by no mean a easy one during this stage of the proceedings we could scarcely see one another for the steam and vapor arise from the poor brute whose neigh of terror as they blunder into a deeper drift than usual be pitiful to hear more than once gerôme 's pony fall utterly exhaust and helpless and it take we unite effort to get he on he leg again while the shagird and i leave we pony prone on they side only too glad of a temporary respite from they labor if there be anything in the mohammedan religion the shagird be undoubtedly useful he never cease call upon allah for help for more than ten consecutive seconds the whole way across at four o'clock we ride into the post-house at bideshk thoroughly do up and wet through with snow and perspiration but safe and determine if horse be procurable to push on at once to murchakhar from whence two easy stage of six and three farsakh would land we next day at ispahán it be dusk and we have just secure the only horse available when two armenian bind for teherán ride into the yard when tell they be just too late for a relay the rage of one of they -- a short apoplectic-looking little man -- be awful to behold as i mount he companion come up and politely advise we not to attempt to ride to murchakhar by night the road swarm with footpad he say in a mysterious undertone you run a very great risk of be rob and murder if you go on to-night you would have run a far greater of be freeze to death if we have not save you by take these horse cry gerôme as we ride coolly out of the gateway bideshk be note for a great battle fight in its vicinity between the army of nadir shah and ashraf the afghan its post-house be also note as i can vouch for for the largest and most venomous bug between teherán and ispahán we only remain there three hour and feel the effect for day afterwards all trace of ice and snow disappear a few farsakh from here and we gallop gaily across a hard and level plain to we destination for the night the post-house be a blaze of light a couple of armed sentry stand in front of the doorway and a motley crowd of soldier shagird-chapar and peasant outside you can not come in say the postmaster full of importance the zil-i-sultan be here on a hunting expedition he will start away early in the morning and then you can have the guest-room but not before too tired to mind much -- indeed half asleep already -- we grope we way to the stable where on the cleanest bundle of straw i have ever see -- or smell for it be pitch dark -- in a persian post-stable -lrb- probably the property of he highness the governor of ispahán -rrb- we be soon in the land of dream have we know that we be calmly repose within a couple of foot of the royal charger 's heel we slumber might not have be so refreshing daylight disclose the fact the governor and he suite have apparently make a night of it although it be past eight o'clock when we make a start the prince he suite soldier and groom be none of they stir although he _ chef _ be busily engage with he staff of assistant prepare a sumptuous breakfast of kabab roast meat and poultry pastry and confectionery of various kind i could not help envy the man whose appetite and digestion would enable he to sit down to such a meal at such a hour sherbet the shagird from murchakhar inform we in confidence be the favorite drink of the zil-i-sultan i only once taste sherbet in persium and be somewhat surprised -- so lasting be one 's youthful association -- to find it utterly different to the refreshing but somewhat depressing beverage of my school-day sell if i remember rightly at twopence a packet the real sherbet i be give -lrb- in a native house at shiráz -rrb- consist simply of a glass of cold water with a lump of sugar in it -- _ eau sucré _ in fact but persian sherbet be of endless variety and flavor preserve syrup of raspberry and pineapple the juice of the fresh fruit of lemon orange and pomegranate be all use in the manufacture of sherbet which be however never effervesce the water in which it be mixed should be icy cold and have when serve in persium block of frozen snow float on the surface the sherbet-i-bidmishk or willow-flower sherbet make from flower of a particular kind of willow distil in water be perhaps the most popular of all among the higher class and be the most expensive the hunting-expedition -lrb- the shagird who be of a communicative disposition inform we -rrb- consist of three party located at village each within a couple of farsakh of murchakhar numbering altogether over six hundred man -lrb- all mount -rrb- they have be out from ispahán nearly ten day yesterday the prince 's party have be exceptionally lucky and have have splendid sport we pass on the road to géz a caravan of fifteen mule laden with the spoil -- ibex deer wild sheep and even a wild ass among the slay the latter have fall to the governor 's own rifle there be plenty of sport to be have in persium if you only take the trouble to look for it and in comparative comfort too with tent store cooking apparatus etc if time be no object the country swarm with wild animal -- tiger bear and leopard in the forest by the caspian sea wild ass jackal and wolf in the desert region deer and wild goat in the mountainous district and as we afterwards have uncomfortable proof lion in the southern province there be no permission need a european may shoot over any country he please with the exception of the shah 's private preserve around teherán he imperial majesty be very tetchy on this point we gallop nearly the whole of the short stage from géz to ispahán a couple of mile out of the city we overtake a donkey ridden by two peasant heavy man who challenge we to a trial of speed we only just beat they by a couple of length at the gate although we horse be fresh and by no means slow the persian donkey be unquestionably the best in the east and be not only speedy but as strong as a horse we frequently pass one of these useful beast carry a whole family -- monsieur madame and a unlimited number of bebés -- to say nothing of heavy baggage in one of the queer-looking arrangement -lrb- oblong box with a canvas cover stretch over a wooden framework -rrb- depict on the next page a ordinary animal cost from two to three pound -lrb-

cross also the great stone bridge span the zandarood or live river so call from the suppose excellence of its water for drinking purpose and its power of prolong life near the bridge we meet a large funeral evidently that of a person of high position from the costly shawl which cover the bier -lrb- illustration : a family party -rrb- as in many eastern country a man be never allow to die in peace in persium it be a ceremony like marriage or burial and as soon as the doctor have pronounce a case hopeless the friend and relation of the sick man crowd into he chamber and make themselves

ispahán be a city of ruin a persian will tell you with pride that it be nearly fifteen mile in circumference but a third of this consist of heap of stone with merely the foundation-line around to show that they be once palace or more modest habitation chardin the traveller write in ad 1667 give the population of ispahán at considerably over a million but it do not now exceed fifty thousand include the suburb of djulfa the madrassa or college the governor 's palace and chil situn or palace of the forty pillar be the only building that still retain some trace of they former glory pertain to the former be a dome of the most exquisite tile-work which partly break away disclose the mud underneath a pair of massive gate of solid silver beautifully carve and emboss a large shady and well-kept garden in the center of the madrassa with huge marble tank of water surround by a oblong arcade of student ' room -- sixty queer little box about ten foot by six they wall cover with arabesque of great beauty these be still to be see -- and remember with the exception of the maidan shah or square of the king -- a large open space in the center of the city surround by modern two-storied house -- the street of ispahán be narrow dirty and ill-paved and its bazaar which adjoin the maidan shah very inferior in every way to those of teherán or shiráz the palace of chil situn or the forty pillar be like most persian palace -- the same walled garden with straight walk the usual avenue of cypress tree and the inevitable tank of stone or marble in the center of the grounds it be owe to the

also make as well as quantity of a coarser kind of cotton stuff for wearing-apparel much use by the native the sword-blade manufacture here be in comparison with those of khorassan or damascus of little value genuine old blade from the latter city fetch enormous price everywhere but a large quantity of worthless imitation be in the market and unless a stranger be thoroughly experience in the

space be take up by the deep ditch or drain line with tree by which all be divide but the town or settlement be as clean and well-kept as ispahán itself be the reverse which be say a great deal djulfa be call after the armenian town of that name in georgium the population of which for commercial reason be remove to this place by shah abba in ad 1603 djulfa near ispahán be once a large and flourishing city with as many as twenty district parish and a population of sixty thousand soul now dwindle down to a little over two thousand the greater part of whom live in great want and poverty the city once possess as many as twenty church but most of these be now in ruin the cathedral however be still stand and in fair preservation it date from ad 1655 there be also a roman catholic colony and church the latter stand in a large garden celebrate for its quince and apricot lastly the english church missionary society have a establishment here under the direction of the rev dr bruce whose good deed during the famine be not likely to be forget by the people of ispahán and djulfa whatever they creed or religion the trade of djulfa be insignificant although there be a large amount of wine and arak manufacture there and sell under the rose to the ispahánis the production of the juice of the grape be somewhat primitive during the season -lrb- September and October -rrb- the grape be trodden out in a large earthenware pan and the whole crushed mass juice and all be stow away in a jar hold from twenty to thirty gallon a small quantity of water be add to it in a few day fermentation

construct that a person standing on the roof of the building between the two can by a slight movement of he foot cause they to vibrate i spend most of my time as usual stroll about the least-frequented part of the city or in the cool picturesque garden of the madrassa the people of teherán and other persian city be generally civil to stranger but at ispahán the prejudice against european be very strong and i more than once have to make a somewhat hasty exit from some of the lower quarter of the city mr s -- the wife of a telegraph official be stab by some miscreant while walk in broad daylight on the outskirts of the town a few month before my visit the offender be never catch probably as ispahán be under the jurisdiction of the zil-i-sultan be never mean to be the zil-i-sultan return to ispahán before i leave he be rightly name shadow of the king for save he somewhat more youthful appearance he be as like nasr-oo-din as two pea like he father in most of he taste he favorite occupation be ride the chase and shooting at a mark but he be perhaps more susceptible to the charm of the fair sex than he August parent the prince be now nearly forty year of age he wife daughter of a former prime minister of persium who be strangle by order of the present shah die a few year ago have bear he a son the jelal-u-dowleh a bright clever boy now about eighteen year old and three daughter the zil-i-sultan be adore by he people and have unquestionably very great influence over the district of which he be governor within the last two year however at least two-third of he possession have be take from he -- a proceeding that cause he considerable annoyance and draw forth the remark that the valliad would one day regret it there can be little doubt that at the death of nasr-oo-din the governor of ispahán will make a bold bid for the throne in fact the latter make no secret of he intention drink and debauch have already render he younger brother half-witted the task should not be a difficult one especially as half the people and the whole army side with the illegitimate though more popular prince it be perhaps under the circumstance to be regret that the latter be a ardent russophile ever since he majesty the czar send a special mission to ispahán to confer upon he the order of the black eagle should the zil-i-sultan succeed nasr-oo-din british influence in persium may become even less powerful than it be now if that be possible the zil-i-sultan be far more civilized in he habit and mode of life than the shah a fair french scholar he regularly peruse he _ temp gil bla _ and the latest work of the best french author it be strange that with all he common sense and sterling quality this prince should in some matter be a perfect child one of he whim be dress suit of clothes shirt sock hat and uniform be continually pour in from all part of europe many of the latter anything but become to the fat podgy figure of the king 's shadow a photograph of he royal highness the duke of connaught in rifle brigade uniform be show he a couple of year since the court tailor be at once send for i must have this make it at once be the command the humble request to be allow to take the measure be meet by son of a hell-burnt father what do you mean make it for a well-made man -- a man with a better figure than that and it will fit I popular as he be with the lower order the zil-i-sultan do not when offender be bring before he err on the side of mercy persian justice be short sharp and severe and a man who commit a crime in the morning may be minus he head before sunset although a persian would indignantly deny it some of they punishment be nearly as cruel as the chinese for instance not so very long ago a man in southern persium be convict of incest for which crime he eye be first tear out with pincers and he tooth then extract one by one sharpen to a point and hammer like nail through the top of he skull it should be say in justice that the present shah have do all he can to stop the torture system and confine the death-sentence to one of two method -- painless and instantaneous -- throat-cutting and blow from a gun notwithstanding execution such as the one i have mention be common enough in remote district and crucifixion wall up or bury and burn alive be although less common than formerly by no mean out of date woman be usually put to death by be strangle throw from a precipice or well or wrap up in a carpet and jump upon but the execution of a woman be now fortunately rare in persium a dreary desert surround ispahán on every side save to the southward where dark mass of rock a thousand foot high break the sky-line the environs of the city be well populated and as we ride out _ en route _ for shiráz we pass through a good deal of cultivate land this be irrigate by the zandarood whose blue water be visible for a long distance wind through the emerald-green plain with its gay patchwork of white and scarlet poppy-garden the cultivation of this plant be yearly increase in persium for there be a enormous demand for the drug in the country itself to say nothing of the export market the value of which in 1871 be 696000 rupee in 1881 it have progress to 8470000 rupee and be steadily increase every year opium be not smoke in persium but be take in the form of pill many among the upper class take it daily the dose be a grain to a grain and a half we cover the first day out from ispahán nearly a hundred mile between sunrise and 10 pm -- not bad work for persium a little after dark and before the moon have rise i be canter easily along in front of gerôme when a violent blow on the chest follow by another between the eye send I reel off my horse on to the sand my first thought on collect myself be robber -- this part of the road bear a unpleasant reputation cock my revolver i call to gerôme and be answer by a volley of oath while another riderless horse gallop past I and disappear in the darkness we foe be a harmless one the wind have blow down one of the telegraph-post and the wire have do the mischief by good luck and the aid of lucifer match we manage to trace we pony to a piece of cultivate ground hard by where we find they calmly feed in a field of stand corn the moon have rise by nine o'clock before half-past we be in sight of the rock on which stand the town of yezdi-ghazt towering shadowy and indistinct over the moonlit plain this be unquestionably the most curious and interesting village between résht and bushire the post-house stand at the foot as we ride to the latter through the semi-darkness cause by the shadow of the huge mass of boulder and mud on which the town be situate the effect be extraordinary it be like a picture by gustave doré and look up the dark perpendicular side of the rock at the weird city with its white house queer-shaped balcony and striped awning stand out clear and distinct against the starlit sky give one a uncomfortable uncanny feeling hard to shake off and heighten by the fact that although the hour be yet early not a light be visible not a sound to be hear it be like a city of the dead -lrb- illustration : yezdi-ghazt -rrb- daylight do not improve the appearance of yezdi-ghazt the city which look so weird and romantic by moonlight lose much of its beauty though not its interest when see by the broad light of day the system of drainage in yezdi-ghazt be simple the sewage be throw over to fall haphazard on the ground immediately below i nearly have a practical illustration during my examination which however do not last long for the side of the rock glisten with the filth of year and the stench and fly be unbearable early next morning i set out alone to explore the strange place and with much difficulty and some apprehension -- for i do not know how the native be dispose -- ascend a steep rocky path at the summit of which a wooden drawbridge lead over a deep abyss to the gate of the city this bridge be the only access to yezdi-ghazt which be so to speak a regular fortress-town the rock about half a mile long be intersect by one narrow street which cover from end to end with awning and wooden beam be almost in obscurity the sudden change from the glare outside almost blind one the appearance of a farangus be evidently rare in yezdi-ghazt for i be immediately surround by a crowd who however be evidently incline to be friendly and escort I to the house of the head-man under whose guidance i visit the city the house be of stone two-storied and mortise into the rock which give they the appearance from below as if a touch would send they topple over while a curious feature be that none of they window look inwards to the street -- all be in the outside wall face the desert i take coffee with the head-man on he balcony -- a wooden construction project over a dizzy height and support by a couple of rickety-looking beam it be nervous work for the flooring which be rotten and broken into great hole creak ominously i could see gerôme -lrb- who have evidently miss I -rrb- bustling about the post-house and reduce from this height to the size of a fly make this my excuse i quickly finish my coffee and bid my host farewell nor be i sorry to be once more safe on _ terra firma _ yezdi-ghazt which have a population of about five hundred be very old and be say to have exist long previous to the mohammedan conquest the present population be a continual source of dread to the neighbouring town and village on account of they lawlessness and thieve proclivity and mix very little with any of they neighbor who have give the unsavoury city the turkish nickname of pokloo kallum or filth castle yezdi-ghazt would not be a desirable residence during a earthquake the latter are of frequent occurrence round here many of the village have be lay in ruin but curiously enough the rock-city have up till now never even feel a shock a ride of under fifty mile through level and fertile country bring we to abadéh a pretty village standing in the midst of garden and vineyard enclose by high mud wall a european telegraph official mr g -- reside here as we pass he house -- a neat white stone building easily distinguishable among the brown mud hut -- a native servant stop we he master would not be back till sunset but have leave direction that we be to be well care for till he return the temptation of a bed and dinner be too much and as time be no object and snowy pass thing of the past we halt for the night a hour later comfortably settle on mr g -- 's sofa and doze over a cigar and a volume of _ punch _ my rest be suddenly disturb by a loud bang at the sitting-room door which fly open admit two enormous animal which i at first take for dog both make at once for my sofa and while the larger one curl comfortably round my foot and quietly compose itself for sleep the smaller evidently of a more affectionate disposition seat itself on the floor and commence lick my face and hand -- a operation which have i dare i should strongly have resent but the white gleaming tooth and cruel-looking green eye inspire I with respect to use no stronger term for i have by now discover that these domestic pet be -- panther to my great relief mr g -- enter at this juncture make friend with the panther i see he say pleasantly they be nice companionable beast they may have be at the time the fact remain that three month after my visit the affectionate one half devour a native child the neighborhood of abadéh mr g -- inform I swarm with these animal bear wolf and hyena be also common to say nothing of jackal which judge from the row they make that night must have be patrolling the street of the village in hundred a traveller start from teherán for bushire be expect at every european station on the telegraph-line i think you would have get here sooner say mr g -- p -- -lrb- at ispahán -rrb- tell I you be come through quick the dining-room of my host at abadéh adjoin the little instrument-chamber suddenly while we be at dinner a bell be hear and the half-caste clerk enter so-and-so of shiráz name a official want to speak to you all right reply g -- just tell he to wait till i have finish my cheese it be from f -- he say a few moment later to say he expect you to make he house you head-quarter at shiráz so the stranger be pass on through this desert but hospitable land persian travel would be hard indeed be it not for the ever-open door and hospitality of the telegraph official we continue we journey next day in summer weather -- almost too hot in the middle of the day to be pleasant sheepskin and bourka be dispense with as we ride lazily along under a blaze sun through pleasant green plain of maize and barley irrigate by babble brook of crystal-clear water a few mile from abadéh be a cave-village build into the side of a hill from this issue a number of repulsive-looking half-naked wretch man and woman with dark scowl face and dirty mass of coarse black hair most be cover with skin-disease so we push on ahead but be catch up for the loathsome creature get over the ground with extraordinary speed a handful of shei -lrb- a -rrb- stop they and we leave they swearing struggle and fight for the coin in a cloud of dust then on again past village nestle in grove of mulberry tree past more vineyard maize and barley and peasant in picturesque blue dress -lrb- save white no other color be worn in summer by the country-people -rrb- working in the field they implement be rude and primitive enough the plough be simply a sharpened stick cover with iron the sickle be use for reap threshing be do by means of a axle with thin iron wheel if such primitive means can attain such satisfactory result what could not modern agricultural science be make to do for persium sunset bring a cool breeze which before nightfall develop into a cut north-easter and we shiver again under a bourka and heavy fur pelisse cross a ridge of rock we descend upon a white plain dim and indistinct in the twilight the ground crackle under we horse ' foot it be frozen snow a light shine out before we however and by ten o'clock we be snug and safe for the night in the telegraph-station of deybid these sudden change of temperature make the persian climate very try at this time of year however balmy the air and bright the sunshine at midday one must always be prepare for a sudden and extreme change after sunset the plain of deybid be cover with snow at least two foot deep the temperature must have stand at very few degree above zero and yet not five hour before we be perspire in we shirt-sleeve mashallah exclaim gerôme next morning shade he eye and look across the dazzling white expanse be we then never to finish with this accursed snow by midday however we be out of it and as we subsequently discover for the last time we have up till now be singularly fortunate as regard accident or rather evil result from they to-day however luck desert we for a few mile out of deybid my right leg become so swollen that i could scarcely sit on my horse the pain be acute the sensation that of have be bite by some poisonous insect gerôme ever the job 's comforter suggest a centipede add if so you will probably have to lie up for four or five day the look-out be not cheerful certainly for at mourghab the first stage i have to be lift off my horse and carry into the post-house with some difficulty my boot be cut off and reveal the whole leg below the knee discolor and swollen to double its size but no sign of a wound or bite blood-poisoning say gerôme decidedly i have see hundred of case in central asia it generally prove fatal there he add consolingly but the russian soldier be so badly feed the little man seem rather disappoint at my diagnosis of my case -- the effect due to a new and tight boot which i have not be able to change since leave ispahán notwithstanding i can not put foot to ground without excruciate pain spread the rug out on the dirty earthen floor i make up my mind to twenty-four hour here at least it be perhaps the dirtiest post-house we have see since leave teherán but move under the present circumstance be out of the question the long summer day wear slowly away gerôme like a true russian hunt up a samovar in the village and console himself with innumerable glass of tea and cigarette while the medicine-chest be bring into requisition and i bathe the swollen limb unceasingly for three or four hour with goulard 's extract and water surround by a ring of admiring and very dirty native but my effort be in vain for the follow morning the pain be as severe the leg as swollen as ever gerôme be all for apply a blister which he say will bring the poison out another miserable day break and find I still helpless i do not think i ever realize before how slowly time can pass for i have not a single book with the exception of propo d'exil by pierre lotus and even that delightful work be apt to pall after three complete perusal in the space of as many week from sunrise to sunset i lay prone on my back stare up at the cobwebby smoke-blackened rafter while the shadow shorten and lengthen in the bright sunlit yard the monotonous silence break only by the deep regular snore of my companion whose capacity for sleep be something marvellous the clucking of poultry and the occasional stamp or snort of a horse in the stable below now and again a rat would crawl out and embolden by the stillness creep close up to I dart back into its hole with a jump and a squeal as i wave it off with hand or foot my visitor from the village do not return to-day which be something to be thankful for although towards evening i should have hail even they with delight -- dirt vermin and all patience be reward for next day i be able to stand and towards evening set out for kawamabad twenty-four mile distant though still painful and almost black all inflammation have subside and three day later i be able to get on a boot you would have be well in half the time insist gerôme if you have only let I apply a blister the road from mourghab to kawamabad be wild and picturesque lead through a narrow gorge on either side of which be precipitous cliff of rock and forest three or four hundred foot high a broad swift torrent dash through the valley which be about a quarter of a mile broad in place the pathway hew out of the solid rock be barely three foot wide without guard or handrail of any kind this part of the journey be reach at sunset and we do not emerge on the plain beyond till after dark we horse be fortunately as active as cat and know they way well for to guide they be impossible in place one 's foot actually swing over the precipice and a false step must have send one crash over the side and into the roar torrent below which perhaps luckily we could only hear not see the ruin of persepoli be situate about fifty mile north-east of shiráz two or three mile from the main road sign that we be approach the famous city be visible for some distance before we actually reach they not fifty yard from the post-house of poozeh a picturesque spot surround by a chain of rocky snow-capped hill we come upon a kind of cave with carving in bas-relief on its granite wall represent figure of man and horse from eight to ten foot high evidently of great antiquity the desecrate hand of the british tourist have however leave its mark in the shape of the name j isaacson cut deep into one of the slab considerably mar its beauty it be not my intention to write a description of the ruin that now mark the spot where once stand the capital of the persian empire to say nothing of its have be so graphically portray by far more competent hand my visit be of such short duration that i carry away but faint recollection of the famous city the fact that it have be persistently cram down my throat upon every available occasion ever since i land in persium may have have something to do with the feeling of disappointment which i experience on first sight of the ruin it may be that like many other thing they grow upon one if so the loss be mine i can not however help think that to any but a student of archæology persepoli lack interest the pyramid pompeii the ancient building of rome and greece be picturesque persepoli be not i notice however that here as at poozeh the british tourist have be busy with chisel and hammer and i be ashamed to add some of the name i read be as well know in england as that of the prince of wale on the 18th of February just before midnight we ride into shiráz the approach to the city lie before we white and still in the moonlight through cypress-grove and sweet-smelling garden give I a favourable impression which a daylight inspection only serve to increase shiráz be the pleasantest reminiscence i retain of the ride through persium -lrb- footnote a : small copper money -rrb- chapter viii shir z -- bushire the garden of pleasure where redden the rose and the scent of the cedar be faint on the air owen meredith shiráz stand in a plain twenty-five mile long by twelve broad surround by steep and bare limestone mountain the latter alone recall the desert waste beyond for the plain of shiráz be fertile well cultivate and dot over with prosperous-looking village and garden scarcely a foot of ground be waste by the industrious inhabitant of this happy valley save round the shore of the denia-el-memek a huge salt lake some mile distant where the sun-baked briny soil render cultivation of any kind impossible be it not for its surroundings -- the green and smile plain of wheat barley and indian corn the cluster of pretty sunlit village the long cypress-avenue and last but not least the quiet shady garden with rose and jasmine bower and marble fountain which have be famous from time immemorial -- shiráz would not be what it now be the most picturesque city in persium although over four mile in circumference the city itself have a squalid shabby appearance not improve by the dilapidated rampart of dry mud which surround it found ad 695 shiráz reach its zenith under kerim khan in the middle of the eighteenth century since when it have slowly but steadily decline to its present condition the building themselves be evidence of the apathy reign among the shirázis incessant earthquake destroy whole street of house but no one take the trouble to rebuild they and the population be once nearly double what it now be -- 40000 there be six gate five of which be gradually crumble away the sixth or ispahán gate be the only one with any attempt at architecture and be crenellate and ornament with blue and yellow tile-work a mean poor-looking bazaar narrow tortuous street knee-deep in dust or mud as the case may be and squalid filthy house form a striking contrast to the broad well-kept avenue gilded dome and beautiful garden which encircle the city shiráz have fifteen large mosque and several smaller one but the people be as fanatical as those of teherán be the reverse gerôme who have a singular capacity for get into mischief enter one of these place of worship and be catch red-handed by a old moullah in charge half the little russian 's life have be spend among mohammedan he quickly recite a few verse of the korán in perfect arabic which apparently satisfy the priest for he let he depart with he blessing have the trick be discover he would undoubtedly have be roughly treat if not kill for the shirázis have a unmitigated contempt for european there be few place too in asia where jew be more persecute than in shiráz although they have they own quarter in the lowest most poverty-stricken part of the town and other privilege be grant they by the government shortly before my visit a whole family be tortured and put to death by a mob of infuriate mohammedan the latter accuse they of steal young moslem child and sacrifice they at they secret ceremony -lrb- a -rrb- guilty or innocent of the charge the assassin be leave unpunished the climate of shiráz be delicious but dangerous though to a new-comer the air feel dry pure and exhilarating the city be a hot-bed of disease and have be christen the fever box small-pox typhus and typhoid be never absent and every two or three year a epidemic of cholera break out and carry off a fearful percentage of the inhabitant in spring-time during heavy rain the plain be frequently inundate to a depth of two or three foot and the water stagnate and rot under a blaze sun produce towards nightfall a thick white mist pregnant with miasma and the dreaded shiráz fever which have prove fatal to so many european to say nothing of native medical science be at a very low ebb in persium purge and bleed be the two remedy most resort to by the native hakim if these fail a dervish be call in and write out charm or form of prayer on bit of paper which be roll up and swallow like pill inoculation be perform by place the patient in the same bed as another suffer from virulent small-pox under these circumstance it be scarcely to be wonder at that the shirázis die like sheep during a epidemic and indeed at all time persian surgery be not much better in case of amputation the limb be hack off by repeat blow of a heavy chopper in the case of finger or toe a razor be use the wound be dip into boiling oil or pitch immediately after the operation the office of the indo-european telegraph be in shiráz but the private dwelling of the staff be some distance outside the city a high wall surround the grounds in which the latter be situate -- half a dozen comfortable brick building bungalow style each with its fruit and flower garden look out of my bedroom window the morning follow my arrival on the shrubbery well-kept lawn bright flower-bed and lawn-tennis net i could scarcely realize that this be persium that i be not at home again in some secluded part of the country in far-away england long residence in the east have evidently not change my host mr f -- 's idea as to the necessity for european comfort the cheerful sunlit chintz-covered bedroom with its white furniture blue-and-white wall-paper and lattice window almost hide by rose and jasmine bush be a pleasant _ coup d'oeil _ after the grimy bug-infested post-house and the luxury of a good night 's rest and subsequent shave cold tub and clean linen be that morning appreciate as they only can be by one who have spend many weary day in the saddle uncombed unshaven and unwashed there be no regular post-road between shiráz and bushire or rather sheif the landing-place eight mile from the latter city the journey be perform by mule-caravan rest by night at the caravanserai under the guidance of mr f -- i therefore set about procure animal and chalvadar or muleteer the task be not a easy one for captain t -- of the indian army be then in shiráz buying on behalf of the government and everything in the shape of a mule that could stand be first bring for he inspection by good luck however i manage to get together half a dozen sorry-looking beast but they suit the purpose well enough the price of these animal vary very much in persium they can be buy for as little as # 4 while the best fetch as much as # 60 to # 80 those be pleasant day at shiráz one never tire of wander about the outskirts of the city and through the quiet shady garden and city of the silent as the persian call they cemetery for when the solemn stillness of the latter threaten to become depressing there be always the green plain alive from morning till night with movement and color to go back to early one morning awake by the sound of a crack trumpet and drum i brave the dust and follow a persian regiment of the line to its drill-ground the persian army number on a peace foot about 35000 man the reserve bring it up to perhaps twice that number experience military man have say that material for the smartest soldiery in the world be to be find in persium if so it would surely be the work of year to bring the untrained rabble that at present exist under discipline or order of any kind the regiment whose evolution or antic i witness at shiráz be not in the dress of the russian cossack or german uhlan as at teherán but in the simple uniform of the persian line -- dark-blue tunic with red piping loose red-striped breeches of the same color stuff into ragged leather gaiter and bonnet of black sheepskin or brown feel -lrb- accord to the taste of the wearer -rrb- with the brass badge of the lion and sun all be arm with rusty flint-lock as regard smartness the officer be not much better than the man who do not appear to take the slightest notice of the word of command but straggle about as they please like a flock of sheep some peasant beside I be look on son of dog say one they be good for nothing but drunkenness and frightening woman and child there be no love lose between the army and the people in persium -- none of the enthusiasm of other country when a regiment pass by and no wonder the pay of a persian soldier be at most # 3 a year and he may think himself lucky if he get a quarter of that sum _ en revanche _ the man systematically plunder and rob the wretched inhabitant of every village pass through on the march the passage of troops be sometimes so dreaded that commander of regiment be bribe with heavy sum by the villager to encamp outside they wall troops be not the only source of anxiety to the poor fellah prince and government official also travel with a enormous follow mainly compose of hanger-on and riff-raff who plunder and devastate as ruthlessly as a band of kurd or turkoman robber they be even worse than the soldiery for the latter usually leave the woman alone occasionally a whole village migrate to the mountain on the approach of the unwelcome guest leave house and field at they mercy there be probably no peasantry in the world so grind down and oppress as the persian the agricultural labourer never try to ameliorate he condition or save up money for he old age for the simple reason that on become know to the ruler of the land it be at once take away from he though poor however -lrb- so far as cash and valuable be concerned -rrb- the general condition of the labor class be not so bad as might be suppose in a country so vast -lrb- 550000 square mile -rrb- and so thinly populated -lrb- 5000000 in all -rrb- a small and sufficient supply of food be easily raise especially with such prolific soil at the command of the poorest at shiráz for instance there be two harvest in the year the seifus sown in summer and reap in autumn consist of rice cotton indian corn and garden produce the tchatvus sown in October and November and reap from may till July be exclusively wheat and barley a quantity of fruit be also grow -- grape orange and pomegranate shiráz be famed for the latter the heat and dust to say nothing of smell prevent I from often enter the city but i walk through the bazaar once or twice and succeed in purchase some old tapestry and a prayer-carpet the merchant here be not so reserved and secretive as those of teherán and other city and be moreover civil enough to produce coffee and a kalyan at the conclusion of a bargain as at stamboul the best tobacco for kalyan-smoking be grow round shiráz some the coarser kind from kazeroon and zulfaicar be export to turkey and egypt but the most delicate shiráz never leave the country the pipe be on the same principle as the narghileh the smoke be draw through a vessel of water the tube a wooden stalk about two foot long be change when it become taint with use for the people of the east -lrb- unlike some in the west -rrb- like they tobacco clean manufactory be trifle in comparison with what they be in former day where a century since there stand five hundred factory own by weaver there be now only ten for the supply of a coarse white cotton material call kerba and carpet of a cheap and common kind earthenware and glass be also make in small quantity the latter only for wine-bottle and kalyan water-bowl all the best glass be import from russia a kind of mosaic work call khatemi much use in ornament box and pen-and-ink case be turn out in large quantity at shiráz it be pretty and effective though some of the illustration on the back of mirror etc be hardly fit for a drawing-room table caligraphy or the art of write be also carry by the shirázis to the highest degree of perfection and they be say to be the best penman in the east to write really well be consider as great a accomplishment in persium as to be a successful musician painter or sculptor in europe and a famous writer of the last century living in shiráz be pay as much as five toman for every line transcribe my favorite walk after the heat of the day be to the little cemetery where hafiz the persian poet lie at rest -- a quiet secluded spot on the side of a hill in a clump of dark cypress tree a gap cut through which show the drab-coloured city with its white minaret and gilt dome shine in the sun half a mile away the tomb a huge block of solid marble bring across the desert from yèzd be cover with inscription -- the title of the poet 's most celebrated work near it be a brick building contain chamber where body be put for a year or so previous to final interment at kermansháh or koom each corpse be in a separate room -- a plain whitewashed compartment with a square brick edifice in the center contain the body some of the catafalque be spread with white table-cloths flower candle fruit and biscuit which the friend and relation -lrb- mostly woman and child -rrb- of the defunct be discuss in anything but a mournful manner a visit to a depart one 's grave be generally a excuse for a picnic in persium hard by the tomb of hafiz be a garden one of many of the kind around shiráz it be call the garden of the seven sleeper and be much frequent in summer by shirázis of both sex a small open kiosk in shape something like a theater proscenium stand in the center its outside wall completely hide by rose and jasmine bush inside all be gold moulding light blue green and vermilion a dome of looking-glass reflect the tesselated floor strangely enough this garish mixture of color do not offend the eye tone down as it be by the everlasting twilight shed over the mimic palace and garden by overhang branch of cypress and yew a expanse of smooth-shaven lawn white bed of lily and narcissus marble tank bubble over with clear cold water and gravel path wind in and out of the tree to where a hundred yard or so distant a sink fence divide the garden from a piece of ground two or three acre in extent -- a perfect jungle of tree shrub and flower here from about 4 pm till long after sunset you may see the shirázi take he rest undisturbed save for the ripple of run water the sighing of the breeze through the branch and croon of the pigeon overhead now and again the tinkle of caravan-bell break in upon he meditation or the click-click of the attendant 's sandal as he cross the tiled floor with sherbet coffee or kalyan but the interruption be brief a few moment and silence again reign supreme -- the perfection of rest the acme of _ dolce far niente _ from here my way usually lay homeward through the dusky twilight past the city gate and along the now desert plain a limestone hill to the south of shiráz bear a extraordinary resemblance to the head of a man in profile towards sunset the likeness be startling and the nose chin and mouth as delicately form as if chisel by the tool of a sculptor on fine still evening party of people would sometimes sit out on the plain till long after dark converse eating sweetmeat and tea-drinking till the star appear and the white fever mist gathering round the rampart hide the city from view shiráz have be call the pari of persium from the cheerful sociable character of its people as compare with other persian city also perhaps partly from the beauty and coquetry -lrb- to use no other term -rrb- of its woman i be enable thanks to my host to glean some interesting fact concern the latter many european lady have from time to time reside in shiráz and obtain access to the anderoon have afterwards give mr f -- the benefit of they observation persian woman be unquestionably allow more freedom and liberty than those of other oriental country it be extremely rare in the bazaar of stamboul or cairo to see a lady of the harem unattended but the sight be common enough in shiráz and ispahán infidelity in persium be therefore more common in proportion to the licence allow though when discover it be severely punish in some case by death though a few be highly educate the majority of persian woman be ignorant indolent and sensual _ mariage de convenance _ be as common as in france and have a good deal to do with the immorality and intrigue that go on in the larger city a eye-witness thus describe a anderoon or harem of a prince in ispahán : a large courtyard some thirty yard by ten in extent all down the center be the ` hauz ' or tank -- a raise piece of ornamental water the surface of which be about two foot above the ground the edge be form of huge block of well-wrought stone so accurately level that the ` hauz ' overflow all round its brink make a pleasant sound of run water goldfish of large size flash in shoal in the clear tank on either side of it be long rectangular flower-bed sink six inch below the surface of the court this pavement which consist of what we should call pantile be clean and perfect and freshly sprinkle and the sprinkling and consequent evaporation make a grateful coolness in the flower-bed be irregular clump of marvel of peru some three foot high of varied color blossom come up irregularly in wild luxuriance the moss-rose too be conspicuous with its heavy odour while the edge a foot wide be form by thousand of bulb of the _ narcissus poeticus _ mass together like packed fig these too give out a pleasant perfume but what strike one most be the air of perfect repair and cleanliness of everything no grimy wall no soil curtain here all be clean as a new pin all be spick and span the courtyard be shaded by orange tree cover with bloom and the heavy odour of nerolus pervade the place many of the last year 's fruit have be leave upon the tree for ornament and hang in bright yellow cluster out of reach a couple of widgeon sport upon the tank all round the courtyard be room the door and window of which be jealously close but as we pass we hear whisper conversation behind they and titter of suppress merriment the interior resemble the hall of the alhambra a priceless carpet surround by feel edging two inch thick and a yard wide appear like a lovely but subdue picture artfully set in a sombre frame in the recess of the wall be many bouquet in vase the one great window -- a miracle of intricate carpentry some twenty foot by twenty -- blaze with a geometrical pattern of tiny piece of glass form one gorgeous mosaic three of the sash of this window be throw up to admit air the color glass of the top and four remain sash effectually shut out excess of light such be the _ coup d'oeil _ on enter a anderoon with such surroundings one would expect to find refine if not beautiful woman but though the latter be rare enough the former be even rarer in persium the persian woman be a grown-up child and a very vicious one to boot she daily life indeed be not calculate to improve the health of either mind or body most of the time be spend in dress and undress try on clothes paint she face suck sweetmeat and smoking cigarette till she complexion be as yellow as a guinea intellectual occupation or amusement of any kind be unknown in the anderoon and the obscene conversation and habit of its inmate worse even than those of the harem of constantinople and cairo which accord to all account be say a good deal a love of cruelty too be show in the persian woman when a execution or brutal spectacle of any kind take place one-third at least of the spectator be sure to consist of woman but this be perhaps not peculiar to persia witness a recent criminal trial at the old bailey it will thus be see that sensuality be the prevalent vice of the female sex in persium a english-speaking persian at bushire tell I that with the exception of the woman of the wander eeliaut tribe there be few chaste wife in persium although the nominal punishment for adultery be death the law as it stand at present be little else than a dead letter and as in some more civilized country husband who be fond of intrigue do not scruple to allow they wife a similar liberty not half a hour 's walk from the tomb of hafiz at the summit of the mountain be a deep well so deep that no one have ever yet succeed in sound it the origin of the chasm be unknown some say it be a extinct volcano but the smallest child in shiráz know the use to which it have be put from time immemorial it be the grave of adulterous woman -- the well of death a execution take place about fifteen year ago but there have be none since prove guilty of infidelity the wretched woman dress in a long white gown be place on a donkey she face to the tail with shaven head and bare face in front of the _ cortége _ march the executioner musician dancer and abandon woman of the town arrive at the summit of the mountain the victim half dead with fright be lift off and carry to the edge of the yawning abyss which have entomb so many faithless wife before she there be but one god and mohammed be he prophet cry a moullah while the red-robed executioner with one spurn of he foot send the unconscious wretch topple over the brink the awe-stricken crowd peer over watch the white wisp disappear into eternity although the last execution be still fresh in the mind of many the well have no terror for the gay intrigue-loving lady of shiráz they make a jest of it and they husband jokingly threaten they with it time be change indeed in persium i leave shiráz with sincere regret apart from the interest attach to the place i have never receive a kinder or more hospitable welcome than from the little band of englishman who watch over the safety and work the wire of the indo-european telegraph they be under a dozen in number with cheap horseflesh capital shoot the latest book and papers from indium a good billiard-room and lawn-tennis ground time never hang very heavily live be absurdly cheap a bachelor can do well on # 6 a month include servant he have of course no house-rent to pay a number of square stone tower about thirty foot high loophole and crenelate be visible from the caravan-track between shiráz and khaneh zinián where we rest the first night the tower be apparently of great antiquity and must formerly have serve for purpose of defense we lunch at the foot of one on a breezy upland with pink and white heather grow freely around and a brawl tumble mountain stream at we foot it be like a bit of scotland or north wale the tower be in a state of decay and roofless but a wander tribe of ragged eeliaut have take up they quarter inside and watch we suspiciously through the gray smoke of a damp splutter peat fire they be a queer race these eeliaut -lrb- b -rrb- and have little or nothing in common with the other native the sight of a well-filled lunch-basket and flask of wine -lrb- which we kind host have insist on we take -rrb- would have bring ordinary gipsy out like fly round a honey-pot if recollection of epsom or henley go for anything not so the eeliaut who stranger still never even beg for a shei -- a self-control i reward by present the chief a swarthy handsome fellow in picturesque rag of bright color with a couple of keráns but he never even thank I it seem next morning as if we have jump in a night from early spring into midsummer although at daybreak the ice be thick on a pool outside the caravanserai the sun by midday be so strong and the heat so excessive that we could scarcely get the mule along the road lie through splendid scenery pass dashtus arjin or the plain of wild almond a kind of plateau to which the ascent be steep and difficult one might have be in switzerland or the tyrol undulate densely wooded hill with a background of steep limestone cliff they sharp peak just tip with snow stand out crisp and clear against the cloudless sky form a fitting frame to the lovely picture before we the pretty village tree blossom on all side fresh green pasture overgrow in place by mass of fern and wild flower and the white foam waterfall dash down the side of the mountain to lose itself in the blue water of a huge lake just visible in the plain below the neighborhood of the latter teem with game of all kind -- leopard gazelle and wild boar partridge duck snipe and quail the latter in thousand a stiff climb of four hour over the kotal perizun bring we to the caravanserai of meyun kotal over this pass ten mile in length there be no path one must find one 's way as best one can through the huge rock and boulder some of the latter be two to three foot in height how the mule manage will ever be a mystery to I we dismount leave by the chalvadar 's request we animal to look after themselves the summit of the mountain be under two thousand foot we reach it at four o'clock and see to we relief we resting-place for the night only three or four hundred foot below we but it take nearly a hour to do even this short distance the passage of the kotal perizun with a large caravan must be terrible work -lrb- illustration : the caravanserai meyun kotal -rrb- the caravanserai be crowd two large caravan have arrive that morning and a third be hourly expect from bushire there be barely standing-room in the courtyard which be crowd with wild-looking man arm to the tooth gaily caparison mule and bale of merchandise the caravanserai at meyun kotal be one of the finest in persium it be build by shah abba and be entirely of stone and marble surround by wall of enormous thickness the building be in the shape of a square around the latter be seventy or eighty deep arch for the use of traveller at the back of each be a little doorway about three foot by three lead into a dark windowless stone chamber unfurnished smoke-blackened and dirty but dry and weather-proof any one may occupy these should the beggar arrive first the prince be leave out in the cold and _ vice versâ _ everybody however be satisfied as a rule for there be nearly as much accommodation for guest as in a large london or pari hotel behind the sleeping-room be stable for five or six hundred horse and in the center of the courtyard a huge marble tank of pure run water for drinking and wash purpose this and fodder for the horse be all that there be to be get in the way of refreshment but gerôme with considerable forethought have purchase bread a fowl and some egg on the road and we room sweep out and candle light we be soon sit down to a comfortable meal with a hissing samovar the property of the caravanserai-keeper between we one need sleep soundly to sleep well in a caravanserai at sunset the mule with loud clashing of bell be drive into the yard from pasture and tethered till one or two in the morning when a start be make and sleep be out of the question in the interim singing talk story-telling occasionally quarrel and fight go on all round the yard till nearly midnight tire out with the stiff climb i fall into a delicious slumber notwithstanding the noise about nine o'clock to be awaken shortly after by a soft cold substance fall heavily with a splash upon my face strike a match i discover a large bat which the smoke from we fire -lrb- there be no chimney -rrb- have evidently detach from the rafter i purchase the next morning before start a persian dagger belong to one of the caravan-man he be one of the bakhtiarus a wild and lawless tribe inhabit a tract of country -lrb- as yet unexplored by european -rrb- on the border of persium and asia minor the blade of the dagger be purest damascene work the handle of fossilized ivory on the back of the blade be engrave in letter of inlaid gold in arabic character -- there be one god he be eternal victory be nigh o true believer connoisseur say that the dagger be over a hundred year old after quite a hour 's haggle -lrb- during which we departure be delay much to gerôme 's disgust -rrb- i manage to secure it for # 9 english money although the bakhtiarus assure I that he have already swear by he two wife never to part with it i have since be offer four time the amount by a good judge of eastern weapon a second pass the kotal doktar lay between we and bushire though steep and slippery in place the path be well protect and there be no boulder to bar the way on leave the caravanserai we pause to examine the second longest telegraph wire -lrb- without support -rrb- in the world it be lay from summit to summit of two hill and span a valley over a mile in width -lrb- c -rrb- the country round meyun kotal be well cultivate and we pass not only man but woman plough with the odd-shaped primitive wooden plough peculiar to these part near the foot of the pass some child be gather and collect acorn which be here eat in the form of a kind of bread by the peasantry seldom have nature seem more beautiful than on that bright cloudless morning as we ride through sweet-scented upland of bean and clover meadow of deep rich grass by the track bloom wild flower violet and narcissus shed they fresh delicate perfume the song of bird and hum of insect fill the air bright butterfly flash across we path while the soft distant note of a cuckoo recall shady country lane and the sunlit hay-field of a english summer it be like come from the grave after the sterile desert and bleak desolate plain of northern persium there be a small square building at the northern end of the kotal doktar a mud hut in which be station a guard of soldier to be of assistance in the event of robbery of caravan or traveller such case be not infrequent upon we approach three man arm with flint-lock and long iron pike accost we we be the escort say one apparently the leader from the bar of rusty gold braid on he sleeve you can not go on alone it be not safe we then learn that a large lion have infested the caravan-track over the pass for some day and have but yesterday attack the mail and carry off one of the mule the native in charge only just escape by climb a tree persian travel be full of these little surprise or rather item of news for one must be of a very ingenuous disposition to be surprise at anything after a journey of any length in that country if the man have say that a ichthyosaurus or dodo bar the way i should have believe he just as much gerôme share my opinion that the report be get up for the sake of extort a few keráns we soon send we informant about they business and calmly proceed on we journey nevertheless the kotal doktar would not be a pleasant place to encounter the king of beast i think the pass consist simply of a narrow pathway four foot wide on the one side a perpendicular wall of rock on the other a equally sheer precipice do you come across the lion be mr j -- 's first question as we dismount at the gate of he telegraph-station at kazeroon i suppose not he add see the surprise with which i greet he remark we have have three party out from here this week but with no luck i just manage to get a sight of he and that be all he be a splendid beast ignorance have indeed be bliss in we case and i feel some compunction when i remember how disdainfully we have treat the ragged sergeant and he man they would have be of no use except in the way of stop-gap like the baby in cheap print that the russian traveller in the sleigh throw to the wolf to occupy they attention while he urge on he mad career a pistol in each hand and the rein in he mouth still even for this purpose they might have be useful and be certainly worth a few keráns i be glad not to learn the truth till we reach kazeroon the enjoyment of the meal of which we partake at the summit of the pass would have be somewhat damp by the feeling that at any moment a loud roar burst out of the silent fastness of the kotal doktar might announce the approach of its grim tenant there be after all nothing very remarkable about the occurrence for the southern part of persium be infested with wild animal of many kind of this i be already aware but not that lion be among the number kazeroon be next to shiráz the most important place in the province of far and have a population of about 6000 surround by field of tobacco and maize it be neatly lay out and present a cheerful appearance the building be of white stone instead of the everlasting baked mud and clay many of the courtyard be surround by date palm and the people seem more civilized and prosperous-looking than those in the village north of shiráz so you refuse the escort over the kotal say j -- that evening as we sit over we coffee and cigar in he little stone courtyard white and cool in the moonlight add with a laugh well i do not blame you a good story be tell I the other day in shiráz _ àpropos _ of escort it happen not long ago to a englishman who be go to bagdad from kermansháh through a nasty bit of country a good many robbery with violence have occur and the governor of kermansháh insist on provide he with a escort at the same time arrange for a turkish escort to meet he on the frontier and take he on to bagdad you have see the ordinary cavalry soldier of this country there be twelve of they and a sergeant v -- be the only european all go well till they reach a small hamlet near zarna about twenty mile from the turkish border it be midday v -- be quietly breakfast in he tent the horse picket the man smoking or asleep suddenly the sound of firing be hear about a mile off not sharp and loud but slow and desultory like the pop pop pop of a rifle or revolver v -- be not in the least alarmed but the firing continue for some time he think well at last to inquire into the matter what be he surprise on emerge from he tent to find himself alone not a trace of he companion to be see there be the picket-rope a smouldering fire a kalyan and the remains of a pilaff on the ground but no man the firing have do it one and all have turn tail and flee the position be not pleasant for v -- be naturally absolutely ignorant of the road ` they will come back ' he think and patiently wait but sunset come then night then the star and still v -- be alone utterly helpless and unable to move backwards or forwards at sunrise a head be shove into he tent but it have a red fez on not a astrakhan bonnet it be one of the bagdad escort the turk laugh heartily when they hear the story ` it must have be we ' they say ` we have nothing to do and be practise with we revolver ' in the mean time the persian return post haste to kermansháh and evince great surprise that v -- be not with they ` he be the first to fly ' say the sergeant ' i be afraid he must have lose he way and fall into the hand of the robber if so god help he there be more than fifty of they ' j -- 's anecdote be follow by many other coffee be succeed by cognac and seltzer gerôme give we some startling central asian experience and we talk over man and thing persian far into the night or rather morning for it be nearly 2 be when i retire to rest i hope you 'll sleep well say j -- as he lead the way to a comfortable bedroom look out on to the needle-like peak of the kotal doktar gleam white in the moonlight by the way i forget to tell you we usually have a earthquake about sunrise but do not let it disturb you the shock have be very slight lately and it be sure not to last long add my host as he calmly close the door and leave I to my slumber i be not particularly nervous but to be suddenly arouse from sleep by a loud crash as if the house be fall about one 's ear to see in the gray dawn brick wall bend to and fro like reed floor heave like the deck of a ship window rattle door bang with a accompaniment of woman and child scream as if the end of the world have arrive be calculate to give the boldest man a little anxiety i must at any rate own to feel a good deal when about 6 be the follow morning the above phenomenon take place as prophesy it do not last long -- eight or ten seconds at most which seem to I a hour not the least unpleasant sensation be a low rumble noise like distant thunder that accompany the shock it seem to come from the very bowels of the earth we have they every day say j -- at breakfast placidly but one soon get use to they my host be oblige to acknowledge reluctantly that this morning 's shock be a little sharper than usual it be sharp enough gerôme afterwards tell I to send all the people of kazeroon run out of they house into the street common as the zil-zillah -lrb- d -rrb- be in these part the native be terrify whenever a shock occur the great shiráz earthquake some year ago when over a thousand lose they life be still fresh in they mind a easy ride through a pretty and fertile country bring we to the telegraph-station of konar takta where mr e -- the clerk in charge have prepare a sumptuous breakfast but we be not destine to enjoy it they have say mr e -- experienced no less than nine severe shock of earthquake the night before one of which have rent the wall of he house from top to bottom he wife and child be live in a tent in the garden and most of the inhabitant of the village have desert they mud hut and rig up temporary shanty of palm leave in the road we will have breakfast anyhow continue we host you must be hungry -- lead the way into the dining-room where a long deep crack in the whitewashed wall show trace of last night 's disaster the latter have apparently considerably upset my host who throughout the meal keep continually rise and walk to the open window and back again in a evidently uneasy state of mind so much so that i be about to propose a adjournment to the garden when a diversion be create by the entrance of a servant with a dish of sklitch which he have no sooner place on the table than he rapidly withdraw sklitch be peculiar to this part of persium it be make of a kind of moss gather on the mountain mix with cream and date and iced be delicious but scarcely have i raise the first mouthful to my lip when my host leap out of he seat there it be again he cry run and with a bind disappear through the window before i could reach it the floor be rock so that i could scarcely keep my foot and i be scarcely prepare for the drop of nine foot that land I on to the flower-bed the shock last quite ten seconds every moment i expect to see the house fall bodily over i leave poor e -- busily engage in remove he instrument into the garden another night like the last would turn my hair gray he say as we bid he good-bye truly the lot of a persian telegraph official be not always a bed of rose a gradual descent of over two thousand foot lead from konar takta to the village of dalakus which be situate on a vast plain partly cultivate the southern extremity of which be wash by the water of the persian gulf there be a comfortable rest-house at this village the population of which be note as be the most fierce and lawless in southern persium rest though undisturbed by earthquake be however almost out of the question on account of a most abominable stench of drainage which come on at sunset and last throughout the night so overpower be it that towards 3 be both gerôme and myself be attack by severe vomiting and recurrence be have to the medicine-chest and large dose of brandy one might have be sleep over a open drain it be not till next day that i discover the cause -- rotten naphtha which spring in large quantity from the ground all round the village curiously enough the smell be not observable in the daytime we have do with the snow now monsieur say gerôme as we ride next morning through a land of green barley and cotton plain date palm and mimosa on the other hand we have come in for other annoyance in the shape of heat dust and swarm of fly and mosquito near the sea vegetation entirely cease nothing be visible around but hard calcined plain brown and level lose on the horizon seaward in a series of mirage end northward in a chain of rocky precipitous mountain the bright clear atmosphere be remarkable object thirty or forty mile off look but a mile or so away about midday a unusual sight appear on the horizon -- two european a lady and gentleman mount on donkey and attend by a chalvadar on a third who apparently carry all the baggage of the party halt for a few moment and waive introduction we exchange a few word mr and mr d -- be on they way to teherán with the object of make scientific research at persepoli and other part of persium i could not help admire the courage of the lady though regret at the same time the task she have set herself to inquiry of how be the road i reply very good may the lie be forgive I it be tell for a humane purpose save a large herd of gazelle on the far horizon nothing occur to break the monotony of the journey through deep heavy sand till about 4 pm when a thin thread of dark blue cut the yellow desert and lighter sky-line appear before we it be the persian gulf a hour later and sheif the landing-place for bushire be reach a trim steam-launch with union jack float over she stern await we she be send by colonel ross british resident at bushire who kindly invite I to the residence during my stay in the persian port i be not sorry after the hot dusty ride to throw myself at length on the soft luxurious cushion and after a excellent luncheon to peruse the latest english papers skim swiftly through the bright blue water we near the white city not sorry to have successfully accomplish the voyage so far yet aware that the hardest part of the journey to indium be yet to come at a distance and see from the harbor bushire be not unlike cadiz its moorish building the whiteness of its house and blueness of the sea give it on a fine day a picturesque and take appearance speedily dissipate how ever on closer acquaintance for bushire be indescribably filthy the street be mere alley seven or eight foot broad knee-deep in dust or mud and as irregular and puzzling to a stranger as the maze at hampton court the persian port be cool and pleasant enough in winter-time but in summer the stench from open drain and cesspool become unbearable and european -lrb- of whom there be thirty or forty -rrb- remove _ en masse _ to sabsabad a country place eight or ten mile off the native in the mean time live as best they can and epidemic of cholera and diphtheria be of yearly occurrence the water of bushire produce guinea-worm -lrb- a animal that unless roll out of the skin with great care break rot and form a festering sore -rrb- supplies of it be bring in barrel from bussorah or mahommerah but this be not within reach of the poorer class nearly every third person meet in the street suffer from ophthalmia in some shape or other -- the effect of the dust and glare for there be no shade in or about the city the latter be build at the end of a peninsula ten mile in length and three in breadth the portion furthest away from the town be swampy and overflow by the sea most of the house be of soft crumble stone full of shell some of brick and plastered mud but all be whitewashed which give the place the spurious look of cleanliness to which i have refer the inhabitant of this white sepulchre number from 25000 to 30000 there be a considerable trade in tobacco attar of rose shawl cotton wool etc but vessel draw over ten foot can not approach the town nearer than a distance of three mile -- a great drawback in rough or squally weather be it five thousand mile away bushire could scarcely be less like persium than it be it have but one characteristic in common with other city -- its ruin although of no antiquity bushire be rich in these with this exception it much more resemble a moorish or turkish city the native population largely mixed with arab carry out the illusion and bright-coloured garment white bournous and green turban throng the street in striking contrast to the sombre rook-like garment affect by the native of iran a stranger too be strike by the difference in the mode of life adopt by european as compare with those inhabit other part of the shah 's dominion the semi-french style of teherán and shiráz be here supersede by the anglo-indian _ déjeuner à la fourchette vin ordinaire _ and cigarette be unknown in this land of tiffin peg and cheroot my recollection of bushire be pleasant one the residency be a large rambling building all verandah passage and courtyard face the sea on three side and catch the slightest breath of air that may be stir in hot weather two or three lawn-tennis court and a broad stone walk almost overhang the wave form a favorite rendezvous for european in the cool of the evening from here may be see the persian navy at anchor represent by one small gunboat the _ persepoli _ this toy of the shah 's be build by a german firm in 1885 and cost the government over # 30000 sterling she have never move since she arrival she bottom be now cover with coral and shell she screw stick hard and fast while the four steel krupp gun which she mount be rusty and useless my preparation for baluchistán be soon complete the escort furnish I by the indian government have be await I for some day at sonmiani we starting-point on the coast a telegram from karachi say that man camel tent and store be ready be the signal for we departure and on march 7 i take leave of my host to embark on the british indium company 's steamer _ purulium _ for baluchistán with genuine regret do i leave my pleasant quarter at the residency enjoyable as my visit be it have not come upon I quite as a surprise for the hospitality of colonel ross resident of bushire be well know to traveller in persium -lrb- footnote a : a similar case happen not long ago in southern russium -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : the eeliaut be say to be of arab and kurd descent -rrb- -lrb- footnote c : the longest be in cochin china across the river meikong the distance from post to post be 2560 foot -rrb- -lrb- footnote d : earthquake -rrb- chapter ix baluchist n -- beilum the coast-line of baluchistán be six hundred mile long on it there be one tree a sickly stunted-looking thing near the telegraph station of gwádar which serve as a landmark to native craft and a standing joke to the english sailor plant some year since by a european it have live doggedly on to the surprise of all in this arid soil the tree of baluchistán be as well know to the manner in the persian gulf as regent circus or the marble arch to the london cabman with this solitary exception not a trace of vegetation exist along the sea-board from persian to indian frontier occasionally at long interval a mud hut be see just show that the country be inhabit and that be all the steep rocky cliff with they sharp spire-like summit rise almost perpendicularly out of the blue sea be typical of the desert waste inland and this be the indium they talk so much about say gerôme contemptuously as we watch the desolate shore from the deck of the steamer i do not correct the little man 's geography it be too hot for argument for the heat be stifle there be not a breath of air stir not a ripple on the smooth oily sea and the side of the ship be crack and blister in the fierce blinding sunshine under the awn the temperature be that of a furnace and one almost regret the cold and snow of three week ago so perverse be human nature mark tapley himself would scarcely have take a cheerful view of thing on landing at sonmiani imagine a howling wilderness of rock and scrub stretch away to where on the far horizon some low hill cut the brazen sky-line on the beach the so-called town of sonmianus -- a collection of dilapidated mud hut over which two or three tattered red and yellow banner flutter in the breeze and beneath which a small and shallow harbor emit a powerful odour of mud sewage and rotten fish every hut be surmount by a badgir or wind-catcher -- a queer-looking contrivance in shape exactly like a prompter 's box use in the summer heat to cool the interior of the dark stifle hut a mob of ragged wild-looking baluchi with long matted lock and gaudy rag complete this dreary picture shout of kamoo from the crowd bring a tall good-looking native clad in white out of a adjacent hut who i be relieve to find be the interpreter destine to accompany we to kelát the camel and escort be he say ready for a start on the morrow if necessary in the mean time there be a bare but clean government bungalow at we disposal and in this we be soon settle but notwithstanding the comparative comfort of we quarter compare with the filthy native house around i determine to get away as soon as possible the mosquito be bad enough but the fly be far worse ceiling wall and floor be black with they one not only eat they with one 's food but they inflict a nasty poisonous bite as for the smell they be beyond description but the fact that a dead camel be slowly decompose in the immediate vicinity of we dwelling may have have something to do with this with all these drawback i be glad to find the population although dirty decidedly friendly -- rather too much so indeed for the little whitewashed room be crowd to overflow the greater part of the day with relay of visitor who apparently look upon we as a kind of show get up for they entertainment towards sunset a tall swarthy fellow about fifty year old with sharp restless eye and a huge hook nose make he appearance at the doorway and this be the signal for a general stampede for my visitor be no other than the head-man of sonmianus -- chengiz khan chengiz be attire in a very dirty white garment loose and flow to the heel and a pair of gold-embroidered slipper a small conical cap of green silk be perch rakishly on the top of he head from which fall below the shoulder a tumbled mass of thick coarse black hair the head-man be unarmed but he follower five in number fairly bristle with dagger and pistol like all native chengiz be at first shy and reserve it be only when i have prevail upon he to take a cigar that my visitor become more at he ease have light he cheroot he take a long pull and pass it on to one of he follower who repeat the performance when it have go the round twice it be throw away and chengiz turn to kamoo gravely ask if i wish for anything before he retire for the night you should reach kelát in twenty-five day be the answer to my question provide the camel keep well and you have no difficulty with the people at gwarjak they be not use to european and may give you some trouble one of the man here whisper to he chief malak be the name of the head-man at gwarjak go on chengiz -- a treacherous dangerous fellow do not have much to do with malak he detest european malak be judge from my experience that night not the only baluchus possess of this fail chengiz have leave i retire to rest to be suddenly arouse at midnight by a pierce yell and to find a tall half-naked fellow with wild eye and a face plaster with yellow mud standing over I brandish a heavy club though a revolver be at hand it be useless for i see at a glance that i have to deal with a madman after a severe tussle gerôme and i manage to throw out the unwelcome visitor and bar the door though we see he for a hour or more prowl backwards and forwards in the moonlight in front of the bungalow mutter to himself wave he arm about and break every now and then into peal of loud laughter the incident now seem trifling enough though it leave a powerful impression upon my mind that night on the eve of set out through a unknown country where the life of a european more or less be of little moment to the wild tribe of the interior the madman be a dervish the head-man say and perfectly harmless as a rule but liable to fit of rage at sight of a european and unbeliever i be therefore not sorry to hear next morning that this ardent follower of the prophet have be securely lock up and would not be release till the morrow when we be well on the road to beïla there be i imagine few country practically so little known to european as the one we be about to traverse i have up to the time of my visit often wonder that with indium so near baluchistán should have be so long allow to remain the _ terra incognita _ it be my surprise cease on arrival at kelát it be impossible to conceive a more monotonous or uninteresting journey from a traveller 's point of view than that from the sea to quetta -- a distance -lrb- by my route -rrb- of nearly five hundred mile during which i pass -lrb- with the exception of kelát and beïla -rrb- but half a dozen village worthy of the name and meet outside the village in question a dozen human being at the most this be perhaps scarcely to be wonder at the entire population of the country do not exceed 450000 while its area be estimate at something like 140000 square mile of which 60000 be under persian rule and the remain 80000 -lrb- nominally -rrb- under the suzerainty of the khan of kelát the inhabitant of baluchistán may be roughly divide into two class : the brahui -lrb- a -rrb- in the north and the baluchi in the south the former ascribe they origin to the earliest mohammedan invader of persium and boast of they arab descent the latter be suppose by some to have be originally a nation of tartar mountaineer who settle at a very early period in the southern part of asia where they lead a nomad existence for many century govern by they own chief and law till at length they become incorporated and attain they present footing at kelát and throughout northern baluchistán both race differ essentially in language and custom and be subdivide into a infinitesimal number of smaller tribe under the command or rule of petty chief or khan although somewhat similar in appearance the brahui be say to be morally and physically superior to they southern neighbor the baluch as i shall now call each be not a prepossessing type of humanity on first acquaintance with he swarthy sullen feature dark pierce eye and long matted lock most i meet in the interior look a little distance off like perambulate mass of dirty rag but all even the filthiest and most ragged carry a bright sharp tulwar though rough and uncouth however i find the native as a rule hospitable and kindly it be only in the far interior that any unpleasantness be experience this be perhaps only natural see that seventy mile of the journey lay through a region as yet unexplored by european the inhabitant of which be naturally resentful of what they imagine to be intrusion and interference owing to the nomadic nature of the baluchi the barrenness of they country and consequent absence of manufacture and commerce permanent settlement be very rare -lrb- illustration : sonmianus -rrb- with the exception of quetta kelát beïla and kej there be no town in baluchistán worthy of the name even those i have mention be with the exception of quetta -lrb- now a british settlement -rrb- mere collection of tumble-down mud hut invariably guard by a ramshackle fort and wall of the same material the dwelling of the nomad consist of a number of long slender pole bent and inverted towards each other over which be stretch slip of coarse fabric of camel 's hair it be only in the immediate neighborhood of gwarjak that the native hut be construct of dry palm-leaf the fertile soil of that district render this feasible attend by chengiz khan in a gorgeous costume of blue and yellow silk and follow by a rabble of two or three hundred man and boy i visit the bazaar next morning chengiz have precede he visit with the present of a fine goat and evidently mean to be friendly inform I before we have go many yard that the queen of england have just invest the djam of beïla -lrb- a neighbouring chief -rrb- with the star of indium and do i think that that honor be very likely to accrue to he the trade of sonmianus be as may be imagine insignificant most of the low dark stall be keep for the sale of grain rice salt and tobacco by hindu but i be tell that a brisk trade be do in fish and shark ' fin and dry fruit madder and saffron send down from the northern district be export in small quantity to indium and persium in the vicinity be some ancient pearl-fishery of considerable value which be once work with great profit these have be allow to lie for many year undisturbed owe to lack of vigor and enterprise on the part of those in power in the state here be a chance for european speculator by a well in the center of the village stand some young girl and child the former be decidedly good look and one but for the hideous gold nose-ring -lrb- b -rrb- would have be almost beautiful here as elsewhere in baluchistán the woman present much more the egyptian type of face than the indian -- light bronze complexion straight regular feature and large dark expressive eye none of these make the slightest attempt at concealment as we pass one of they even nod and smile at chengiz make good use of she eye and disclose a row of small pearly tooth they dress a loose divide skirt of thin red stuff and short jacket with tight-fitting sleeve open at the breast show off they slight graceful figure and small well-shaped hand and foot to perfection chengiz point to the group smile and address I in a facetious tone he want to know if you think they pretty say my interpreter but i think it best to maintain a dignified silence the chief of sonmianus be for a mohammedan singularly lax a kind of rough pottery be make at sonmianus and this be the only industry some of the water-jar be neatly and gracefully fashion of a delicate grey-green color other red with rude yellow device paint on they the clay be porous and keep the water deliciously cool by four o'clock next morning all be ready for a start the caravan consist of eighteen camel four baluchi kamoo and gerôme with a escort of ten soldier of the djam of beïla smart-looking well-built fellow in red tunic white baggy trousers and dark-blue turban each man arm with a snider rifle and twenty round of ammunition be mount on a rough wiry-looking pony as we be start chengiz khan ride up on a splendid camel and announce he intention of accompany we the first stage one of eighteen mile to shekh-raj here the honest fellow bid we good-bye the sahib will not forget I when he get to india he say on leave thereby imply that he wish to be well report to the indian government but take care of malak he be a bad man -- a very bad man a rough and tedious journey of two day over deep sandy desert vary by a occasional salt marsh bring we to beïla the seat of government of the djam or chief of the province of las beïla eighty mile due north of sonmianus with a feeling of relief i sight the dirty dilapidated city with its mud hut and tawdry pink and green banner surmount the palace and fort the baluch camel be not the easiest animal in existence and i have for the first few hour of the march experience all the misery of _ mal de mer _ bring on by a blaze sun and the roll unsteady gait of my ship of the desert though awkward in he pace the baluch camel be swift they be small and better look than most nor do they coat present so much the appearance of a doormat with the mange as those of the animal of other country we have as yet pass but two village -- three or four low shapeless hut almost hide in rock and scrub by the side of the caravan-track which as far as beïla be pretty clearly define there have be nothing else to break the dull dead monotony of sand and swamp not a sign of human life and but one well -lrb- at outhal -rrb- of rather brackish water on the second day one of the escort have point out a dry rocky bed as the river puralus which be one of the largest in baluchistán but like all the other quite dry the greater portion of the year there be no permanent river in this country to this fact be perhaps due the slight knowledge obtain up to the present time of the interior where arid sandy desert dangerous alike to native or european traveller be the rule and cover those large open space mark upon map as unexplored notwithstanding the great width of the bed of the purali river in many place it have no regular outlet into the sea its water when in flood from rainfall lose themselves in the level plain in a chain of lagoon or swamp some of these be several mile in length but decrease considerably in the dry season when the water become salt the habb river which divide la from the british province of sind be another case in point it possess permanent bank be feed from the pabb chain of mountain and after heavy rain in these hill a large body of water be form which rush down to the sea with great force and velocity but at other time water be only to be find in a few small pool in its rocky bed it be in short a mountain torrent on a large scale so also with the greater number of stream in the western district though a few of these have more the semblance of river than can be find elsewhere in baluchistán of lake there be none throughout the entire area of the country at outhal we be meet by one hussein khan a wild-looking fellow mount on a good-looking chestnut horse its saddle and headstall ornament with bright-coloured leather and gold and silver ornament hussein be from beïla with a message from the djam to say that i be welcome in he dominion tent be then pitch and i invite hussein to partake of refreshment which be refuse he accept a cigarette however but seem undecided whether to smoke or eat it till present with a light have ask if i would like to be salute with gun on arrival a offer i politely decline my visitor then leave to prepare for we reception on the morrow -lrb- illustration : we camp at outhal -rrb- daybreak see we well _ en route _ and by 10 be we be in sight of beïla about a mile or so out of the city a mount sowar in scarlet and gold uniform and arm with two huge horse-pistol and a long cavalry sabre gallop up to the caravan it be a messenger from the palace say kamoo to say that he highness the djam have be suddenly call away to kej -lrb- c -rrb- but that he son prince kumal khan be ride out in state to meet the sahib and conduct he to he father 's city the prince shortly afterwards appear mount on a huge camel the tail and hind quarter of which be ornament with intricate pattern stamp on the hide by some peculiar process a guard of honor of thirty soldier accompany while a rabble of two or three hundred foot people surround the party for the sight of a white face be rare in beïla it be a strange scene : the picturesque city brilliant barbaric costume of the young chief and he follower and crowd of wild half-naked baluchi be fitly set off by surroundings of desert landscape and dazzling sunshine a gerôme or vereschágin would have revel in the sight shake hand with kumal -lrb- no easy matter on camel -rrb- he place I on he right hand and head the procession we ride into beïla where a large tent have be erect for my accommodation have place a guard at my disposal the prince then leave announce he intention of receive I in state that afternoon at the palace beïla which be protect by a fort and high mud wall be situate on the right bank of the river puralus which at the time of my visit be no more than a dry rocky bed the town contain about 4000 inhabitant and from a distance present a curious appearance each house be fit as at sonmianus with a large badgir or wind-catcher like most eastern city beïla do not improve on closer acquaintance the people be dirty and indolent there be little or no trade and the dark narrow street ankle-deep in mud and filth be crowd with beggar and pariah dog while the dull drab color of the mud house be depress in the extreme the fort and palace alone be build of brick and be whitewashed relieve to a certain extent the melancholy aspect of the place i be escort to the latter the afternoon of my arrival by a guard of honor precede by the djam 's band -- half a dozen crack english cavalry trumpet djam alus khan the present ruler of the state of las beïla be about fifty year of age and be a firm ally of england the djam be a vassal of the khan of kelát but like most independent baluch chief only nominally so so far as i could glean the court of kelát have no influence whatsoever beyond a radius of twenty mile or so from that city the province of sarawán jhalawán kach-gandáva mekrán -lrb- d -rrb- and las beïla which constitute the vast tract of country know as kalati baluchistán be all govern by independent chief nominally viceroy of the khan of kelát practically however the latter have little or no supremacy over they nor indeed over any part of baluchistán kelát and its suburb except prince kumal khan receive I in he father 's durbar-chamber a cheerless whitewashed apartment bare of furniture save for a somewhat rickety throne of paint wood and a huge white linen punkah overlook a dreary landscape of barren desert and mud roof the prince a tall slim young man about twenty-five year of age have weak but not unpleasing feature he be dress in a close-fitting tunic of dark-blue cloth heavily trim with gold braid baggy white linen trousers and a pair of european side-spring boot very dirty and down at heel a light-blue turban complete he attire the interview be not interesting notwithstanding all my effort and the service of the interpreter kumal be evidently shy and ill at ease and resolutely refuse to enter into conversation one thing however rouse he hear that i be accompany by a russian kumal eagerly demand that he should be send for gerôme presently make he appearance and be stare at much to he discomfiture and annoyance as if he have be a wild beast a pair of white-linen drawer no sock carpet slipper and a thin jersey be my faithful follower 's idea of a costume suitable to the indian climate -- surmount by the somewhat inappropriate head-dress of a huge astrakhan cap which for no earthly consideration could he be persuade to exchange for a turban so that be a russian say the prince curiously survey he from head to foot i think they be all big man but patience have limit and with a muttered dourák -lrb- e -rrb- poor gerôme turn and leave the princely presence in anything but a respectful manner coffee and nargileh discuss my host move a adjournment to the roof of the palace where he say i should obtain a better view of he father 's city this ceremony conclude the trumpet sound a gentle hint that the audience be at a end and i take leave and return to camp outside the wall of the town the wazir or prime minister of the djam pay I a visit in the evening _ san cérémonie _ -- a jolly-looking fresh-complexioned old fellow dress in a suit of karki cut european fashion and with nothing oriental about he save a huge white linen turban the wazir speak english fairly well and wax confidential over a cigar and whisky-and-water -lrb- like my sonmiani friend the wazir be no strict mussulman -rrb- entertain I with a account of the doings of the court in beïla and the _ aventure galante _ of kumal who from all account be a veritable don juan will the russian ever take indium ask the old fellow of gerôme as he leave the tent you can tell they they shall never get it so long as _ we _ can prevent they but the next moment the poor wazir to gerôme 's delight have measure he length on the ground either the night be very dark or the whisky very strong a tent-rope have avenge the taunt level at my companion 's countryman early next morning come a message from prince kumal invite I to visit the cave of shahr-rogan a excavate village of great antiquity about ten mile from beïla i gladly accept the camel be tire the man of the caravan unwilling to proceed for another day and time hang heavily on one 's hand with nothing to vary the monotony but a occasional shot at a wood-pigeon -lrb- which swarm about beïla -rrb- or a game of _ ecarté _ -lrb- for nut -rrb- with gerôme the cave be well worth a visit i could gain no information at beïla quetta or even karachi as to the origin of this curious cave-city though there can be no doubt that it be of great antiquity carless the traveller 's account be perhaps the most authentic about nine mile to the northward of beïla a range of low hill sweep in a semicircle from one side of the valley to the other and form its head the purali river issue from a deep ravine on the western side and rush down -lrb- in the wet season -rrb- about two hundred yard broad it be bound on one side by steep cliff forty or fifty foot high on the summit of which be a ancient burial-ground follow the stream we gain the narrow ravine through which it flow and turn into one of the lateral branch enter shahr-rogan here on the day in question prince kumal call a halt a couple of small tent be pitch and a meal consist of a excellent curry stewed pigeon beer and claret serve leave the prince to amuse himself and delight he follower with he skill in rifle-shooting at a mark chalk out on the rock i continue my exploration the result be perhaps better explain to the reader in the word of a older and more experienced observer carless say -- the scene be singular on either side of a wild broken ravine the rock rise perpendicularly to the height of four or five hundred foot and be excavate as far as there be foot to ascend up to the summit the excavation be most numerous along the lower part of the hill and form distinct house most of which be uninjured by-time they consist in general of a room fifteen foot square form a kind of open verandah with a interior chamber of the same dimension to which admittance be gain by a narrow doorway there be niche for lamp in many and a place build up and cover in apparently to hold grain most of the house or cave at the summit of the cliff be now inaccessible from the narrow precipitous path by which they be approach have worn away the cliff be excavate on both side of the valley for a distance little short of a mile there can not be less than fifteen hundred of these strange habitation the cave of shahr-rogan be not the only sight of interest near beïla time unfortunately would not admit of my visit the mud-volcano of las situate near the harra mountain about sixty mile from shahr-rogan the hill upon which these be find be from three to four hundred foot high and be conical in form with flatten and discolor top and precipitous side at they basis be numerous fissure and cavity reach far into they interior captain hart who visit these geyser some year ago describe they as basin of liquid mud about a hundred pace in diameter in a continual state of eruption these geyser or chandra-kupr as they be call by the baluchi be also find on part of the mekrân coast colonel ross hm 's resident at bushire be of opinion that these coast crater have communication with the sea as the state of the tide have considerable influence on the movement of the mud this theory be perhaps strengthen by the fact that by the coast native the volcano be call darya-chân or eye of the sea on the way back from shahr-rogan to beïla a herd of antelope be see i may here mention that with one exception this be the only occasion upon which i come across big game of any kind throughout the journey although from all account there be no lack of wild animal in baluchistán bear and hyena be find in the southern district and the leopard wolf ibex and tiger-cat exist in other part of the country the wild dog be also find in the northern and more mountainous region the latter hunt in pack of twenty and thirty and will seize a bullock and kill he in a few minute on the other hand vermin and venomous animal be not so common as in indium dangerous snake be rare though we be much annoy by scorpion and centipede in the village of the north and a loathsome bug the mangar which infest the house of kelát ride homewards we stop about a mile out of beïla to inspect the djam 's garden a large rambling piece of ground about fifty acre in extent enclose by high wall of solid masonry never be i more surprised than upon enter the lofty iron gate guard by a sowar in neat white uniform it seem incredible that such fertility and abundance could exist in this dry arid land the cool fragrant garden with they shady grass walk forest tree and palm spring up as it be out of the scorch stony desert remind one of a bunch of sweet-smelling flower in a fever ward and the scent of rise jasmine and narcissus be apparent quite half a mile away in the center of the garden be a tamarind tree of enormous girth it take twelve man with join hand to surround it half a hour be spend in this pleasant oasis which be construct by the late djam after infinite trouble and expense by means of irrigation from the purali river there be also two deep well of clear water in the grounds which be never quite dry even in the hottest season proceed homewards we have scarcely reach camp when a terrific thunderstorm burst over we head the thunderclap be in some instance nearly a minute in duration and the lightning unpleasantly close and vivid the weather clearing i visit the bazaar in the evening under the guidance of my old friend the wazir trade be as i have say practically _ nil _ in beïla and the manufacture which be trifle be confine to oil cotton a rough kind of cloth and coarse carpet indeed throughout the country commerce be almost at a standstill this be scarcely surprising when the semi-savage state of the people and consequent risk to life and property be take into account the export trade of the interior be though trifle at present capable under firm and wise rule of great improvement madder almond and dry fruit from kelát and mastung seed and grain from khozdar small quantity of assa-foetida from nushkus and sulphur from kach-gandáva comprise all the export from mekrán and las beïla be export rogan or clarify butter use for cooking purpose hide tobacco -lrb- of a very coarse kind -rrb- salt fish oil-seed and date the import chiefly consist of rice pepper sugar spice indigo wood and piece goods chiefly land at the port of gwádar or sonmiani but little be as yet know of the mineral product of this district iron ore be say to exist in the mountain north of beïla while to the south copper be report as be find in large quantity but nothing have as yet be do to open up the mineral resource of the district although silver and even gold have be find in small quantity and other mineral be know to exist the only mine at present in baluchistán be those near khozdar in the province of jhalawán where lead and antimony be work but in a very primitive manner notwithstanding the trade stagnation there seem to be a good deal of cultivation in and around beïla water be obtain from deep well and vegetable rice and tobacco be largely grow most of the stall in the bazaar be devote to the sale of rice wheat and tobacco cheap cutlery and manchester goods and i notice with some surprise cheap photograph of mr langtry ellen terry miss nelly farren sylvium gray and other lead light of society and art spread out for sale among the many-bladed knife nickel fork and spoon and german timepiece although the narrow alley reek with poisonous smell and filth and abomination of all kind beïla be not unhealthy -- so at least the wazir inform I i doubt the truth of this assertion however for the feature of every second person i meet be scar more or less with small-pox my caravan on leave beïla be considerably increase it now consist of twenty-two camel -lrb- six of which be laden with water -rrb- five baluchi my original escort and six of the djam 's cavalry i could well have dispense with the latter but the kindly little wazir would not hear of my go without they a addition also to we party be a queer creature half portuguese half malay pick up by gerôme in the beïla bazaar and destine to fulfil the duty of cook how he have drift to beïla i never ascertain and think it prudent not to inquire too much into he antecedent no one know anything about he and as he talk a language peculiar to himself no one be ever likely to but he be a undeniably good _ chef _ and that be the chief consideration gaëtan this strange be inform we be he name -- speedily transform by gerôme into the more euphonious and romantic name of gaetano i take leave of the prince and my old friend the wazir with some misgiving for the new camel-driver be beïla man and frankly own that they knowledge of the country lie between gwarjak and noundra -lrb- where we be to leave the caravan-track -rrb- be derive chiefly from hearsay there be two caravan-road through beïla one formerly much use be that over which we have travel from the coast and which on leave beïla lead due north to quetta _ viâ _ wadd and sohrab a ordinary caravan by this route occupy at least forty day in transit traffic be now therefore usually carry on by means of the safer trade-route through british sindh whereby the saving of time be considerable and chance of robbery much lessen the second road -lrb- which have branch lead to the coast town of gwádar pasuus and ormara -rrb- proceeds due west to kej capital of the mekrán province near the persian border the latter track we be to follow as far as noundra ninety mile distant i should add that the so-called road of baluchistán be nothing more than narrow beaten path as often as not entirely obliterate by swamp or brushwood beyond noundra where we leave the main track to strike northwards for gwarjak there be absolutely nothing to guide we but occasional landmark by day and the star at night bar the intense monotony the journey be not altogether unenjoyable to reach noundra it take we five day this may appear slow work but quicker progress be next to impossible in a country where even on the regular caravan-road the guide be constantly lose the track and two or three hour be often waste in regain it the first two or three day of the journey lay through swampy ground through which the camel make they way with difficulty for a cat on the ice in walnut-shell be less awkward than a camel in mud broad deep swamp alternate with tract of sandy desert with nothing to relieve the monotonous landscape but occasional clump of feesh a stunt palm about three foot in height and rough cairn of rock erect by traveller to mark the pathway where it have become obliterated sufficiently describe the scenery pass through for the first three day after leave beïla large stone accurately lay out in circle of eighteen or twenty foot in diameter be also meet with at interval of every two mile or so by the side of the track and this very often in district where nothing be visible but a boundless waste of loose drift sand we baluchi could not or would not explain the _ raison d'être _ of they though the stone must in many instance have be bring great distance and for a definite purpose i could not however get any explanation regard they at either kelát or quetta with the exception of the lakh pass lead over a chain of hill about eighteen mile due west of beïla the road to noundra be as flat as a billiard-table the cross of the lakh however be not accomplish without much difficulty and some danger for the narrow pathway lead over rocky almost perpendicular cliff three to four hundred foot high have in place almost entirely crumble away the summit of these cliff present a curious appearance -- fifty to sixty needle-like spire hardly a couple of foot thick at the top which look as if the hand of man and not of nature have place they in the symmetrical order in which they stand white and clear-cut against the deep-blue sky slender and fragile as sugar ornament and look as though a puff of wind would send they topple over the ascent be terribly hard work for the camel and as the track be totally unprotected by guard-rail of any kind anything but comfortable for they rider towards the summit we meet a couple of these beast laden with tobacco from kej in charge of a wild-looking fellow in rag as black as a coal who eye we suspiciously and answer in sulky monosyllable when ask where he hail from he merchandise consist of four small bag seem hardly worth the carry but kej tobacco fetch high price in beïla at this point the pathway have latterly be widen by order of the djam formerly if two camel travel in opposite direction meet they respective owner draw lot the animal belong to the loser be then sacrifice and push over the precipice to clear the way for the other in the wet season a foam torrent dash through the valley of lakh but this be at the time of my visit a dry bed of rock and shingle indeed although we be fairly fortunate as regard well and i be never compel to put the caravan on short allowance i do not pass a single stream of run water the whole way from sonmianus to dhaïra twenty mile south of gwarjak though we must in that distance have cross at least fifteen dry river-bed vary from twenty to eighty yard in width travel in the daytime soon become impossible on account of the heat as we proceed further inland a start be therefore generally make before it be light and by 11 be the day 's work be over tent pitch camel turn loose and a halt make till three or four the next morning though the sun at midday be with the total absence of shade dangerously powerful and convert the interior of we canvas tent into the semblance of a oven there be little to complain of as regard weather the night be deliciously cool and the pleasantest part of the twenty-four hour be perhaps that from 8 till 10 be when dinner over and camp-fire light the baluchi enliven the caravan with song and dance baluch music be though wild and mournful please some of the escort have fine voice and sing to the accompaniment of a low soft pipe they favorite instrument gerôme be in great request on these occasion and under the influence of some fiery rakus of which he seem to have a unlimited stock would have troll out matoushka volga and weird cossack ditty till the star be pale if not suppress as it be one get little enough rest what with the heat and fly at midday and at the halt about 8 be the shout hammering of tent-peg and bray of camel that go on till the sun be high in the heaven there be a so-called town or village jhow -lrb- situate about twenty mile east of noundra -rrb- in a sparsely cultivate plain of the same name barley and wheat be grow by means of irrigation from the jhow river which in the wet season be of considerable size i have expect to find at jhow some semblance of a town or village as the wazir of beïla have tell I that the place contain a population of four or five hundred and it be plainly mark on all government map but i have yet to learn that a baluch town or even village of forty or fifty inhabitant often extend over a tract of country many mile in extent the town of jhow for instance be spread over a plain thirty-five mile long by fourteen broad in little cluster of from two to six house a few tiny patch of green peep out of the yellow sand and brushwood a wreath of gray smoke rise lazily here and there at long interval over the plain a few camel and goat browse in the dry withered herbage by the caravan-track show that there be inhabitant but we see no dwelling and only one native a woman who at sight of gerôme who gallantly ride forward to address she turn and flee as if she have see the evil one noundra which be reach on the 30th of march be a mere repetition of jhow neither house nor native be visible though we pass occasional patch of cultivate ground about five mile west of this we leave the beaten track and strike out due north for gwarjak which accord to my calculation lay about seventy mile distant -lrb- footnote a : the traveller masson say that the word _ brahuus _ be a corruption of _ ba-roh-i _ meaning literally of the waste -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : these ring be sometimes so heavy that they be attach to a band at the top of the head to lessen the weight on the nostril -rrb- -lrb- footnote c : a town in western baluchistán -rrb- -lrb- footnote d : the word mekrán be say to be derive from mahi-kharan or fish-eater which food the inhabitant of this maritime province subsist on in alexander 's time and do still -rrb- -lrb- footnote e : russian fool -rrb- chapter x baluchist n -- gwarjak most european traveller through this desolate land have testify to the fact that the most commendable trait in the baluch be he practice of hospitality or zang as it be call as among the arab a guest be hold sacred save by some of the wilder tribe on the afghan frontier who though they respect a stranger actually under they roof will rob and murder he without scruple as soon as he have depart the native of kanéro and dhaïra -lrb- the two village lie between noundra and gwarjak -rrb- be though civil evidently not best pleased at we appearance but the sight of a well-armed escort prevent any open demonstration of ill feel the first day 's work after noundra be rough so much so that the camel could scarcely struggle through the deep sand or surmount the steep pathless ridge of slippery rock that bar we progress every two or three mile though the greater part of the journey lay through deep drift sand the soil in place be hard and stony and here the babul tree and feesh palm grow freely also a pretty star-shaped yellow flower call by baluchi the jour this plant be poisonous to camel but strangely enough harmless to sheep goat and other animal for a desert-journey we have little to complain of as regard actual discomfort there be no mosquito or sandfly and the heat though severe be never excessive save for a couple of hour or so at midday when enforce imprisonment in a thin canvas tent become rather try there be absolutely no shade -- not a tree of any kind visible from the day we leave beïla till we arrival at dhaïra about midday on the 31st of march scarcity of water be we greatest difficulty at noundra it have be salt and brackish at kanéro we search in vain for a well have we know that a couple of day ' march distant lay a land with milk and honey blest this would have inconvenience we but little the fact however that only three barrel of the precious liquid remain cause I some anxiety especially as the first well upon which we could rely be at gwarjak nearly sixty mile distant the sight of dhaïra on the morning of the 31st relieved we of all further anxiety this fertile plain about fifteen mile long by ten broad be bound on the north-west by a chain of limestone mountain the name of which i be unable to ascertain here for the second time since beïla we find a village and trace of inhabitant the former encircle for a considerable distance by field of maize and barley enclose by neat bank and hedge -- a grateful contrast to the desolate waste behind we it be the most perfect oasis imaginable shady forest tree and shrub surround we on every side a clear stream of run water fringed with fern and wild flower ripple through we camp while the poor half-starved horse of the escort revel in the long rich grass hard by a cluster of three or four leaf hut half hide in a grove of date palm lay -lrb- part of -rrb- the little village of dhaïra desert at this busy hour of the day save by woman and child the latter flee upon we arrival and do not reappear until the evening when the return of the man reassure they sufficiently to approach we tent and look upon the strange and unwelcome feature of the farangus without fear from here by advice of the wazir of beïla a messenger be despatch to malak at gwarjak twenty mile distant request permission to travel through he dominion i resolve to proceed no further without the chief 's sanction or to afford he in any way a excuse for make himself unpleasant in the mean time arm and accoutrements be look to and the escort clean and smarten up as well as circumstance would permit the native overcome they shyness next morning and bring we goat 's milk and rogan or clarify butter the baluchi seldom eat meat they food principally consist of cake or bread make of grain with buttermilk and rice a favorite preparation know as shalansh and call krout by the afghan be make by boil buttermilk till the original quantity be reduce by half the remainder be then strain through a thick feel bag in the sun when the drain cease the mass in the bag be form into small lump dry hard by the sun 's ray when require for use these lump be pound and place in warm water where they be work by the hand until dissolve the thickened fluid be then boil with rogan and eat with bread assafoetida indigenous to the country be largely use among all class for flavor dish so much be this noxious plant like by baluchi that it go by the name of khush-khorak or pleasant food at kelát in the palace of the khan i be offer it pickle but it be usually eat stew in butter about midday to my great surprise malak make he appearance in person mount on a good-looking chestnut stallion its bridle and saddle adorn with gold and silver trappings four attendant follow on sorry-looking steed the chief a tall well-built fellow about thirty year of age with a sulky sinister cast of countenance be clothe in a bright green satin jacket white and gold turban loose dark-blue trousers and embroidered slipper the loss of one eye give he a still more unpleasant expression a lock of coarse black hair be drag over the face to conceal the disfigurement the whole party be arm to the tooth and carry gun shield and revolver we interview do not commence propitiously swing himself off he horse malak return my salutation with a sulky nod and swagger into the tent signing to he suite to follow he example curtly refuse my offer of refreshment he call for he pipe-bearer and light a kalyan commence puff vigorously at some abominably smell tobacco which soon render the interior of the tent unbearable it be unfortunately baluch etiquette to allow a guest to open the conversation malak well aware of this maintain a stolid silence and appear hugely to enjoy the annoyance and impatience i try in vain to conceal it be not till nearly a hour have elapse that this amiable visitor at last inquire in a rude surly tone what i want my interpreter 's service be then call in but it be not without demur and a long consultation with he suite that malak consent to accompany I to gwarjak on the morrow matter be finally arrange on the understanding that i do not remain more than one day at gwarjak but proceed to kelát without delay i stroll out with a gun in the evening and manage to bag a brace of partridge which swarm in the maize and barley field overcome the fear of the woman i be permit to approach and inspect though not enter one of they dwelling the latter construct of dry palm leaf be about fifteen foot long by eight foot broad and be entirely devoid of rug carpet or furniture of any kind and indescribably filthy the man though shy and suspicious would have be friendly have it not be for malak who follow I like a shadow but nothing would induce the woman and child to approach either gerôme or myself what be this say one old fellow to malak stroke my face with he horny grimy palm i never see anything like it before most of the man be clothe in dirty discolor rag the woman wear simply a cloth tie loosely over the loin while male and female child fourteen or fifteen year old run about stark naked a curious flower the kosisant grow luxuriantly about here it be in shape something like a huge asparagus and about two foot high be cover from top to bottom with tiny white-and-yellow blossom with a sweet but sickly perfume it consist but of one shoot or stalk and burst through the ground apparently with great force displace the soil for several inch we leave for gwarjak at 530 the follow morning etiquette compel malak to offer I he horse while he mount my camel -- a operation effect with very bad grace by my host the baluch saddle consist simply of two sharp piece of wood bind together by leathern thong and the exchange be by no mean a welcome one so far as i be concern have it cut I in two however i would have bear it if only to punish this boorish ruffian for he insolence of yesterday malak 's chief fail be evidently vanity and he be very reluctant even for a hour to cede the place of honor to a european the road for the first ten mile or so lay along the dry bed of a river which i ascertain with difficulty from my one-eyed companion be name the mashkus large hole from eight to ten foot deep have be dig for some distance by the dhaïra native form natural cistern or tank these be even now after a long spell of dry weather more than half full and the water with which we fill barrel and flask clear cold and delicious the shirengaz pass which cross a chain of hill about five hundred foot high separate the dhaïra valley from the equally fertile district of gwarjak the ascent and descent be gradual and easy and by ten o'clock we be in sight of gwarjak before midday have encamp within half a mile of the town if a collection of straggle tumble-down hut can so be call the news of we arrival have precede we and before tent be pitch the population have turn out _ en masse _ and a mob of quite two hundred man woman and child be squat around we camp watch at a respectful distance the proceedings of my man with considerable interest malak have meanwhile disappear ostensibly to warn the wazir of we arrival gwarjak be situate on the left bank of the mashkus river and consist of some thirty hut shapeless and dilapidated build of dry palm leave about two hundred yard north of the village rise a steep almost perpendicular rock about a hundred foot high on the summit of which be perch a small mud fort the latter be crenelated loophole for musketry and mount six cannon of a very primitive kind it be at once apparent that we be anything but welcome the very sight of my armed escort seem to annoy and exasperate the male population while the woman and child gather together some distance off fly in a body whenever one of we party approach they i look forward with some impatience to malak 's return for kamoo 's request for the loan of a knife from one of the bystander be meet with a indignant refusal accompany by murmur and unmistakable expression of hostility we be well armed certainly but be only ten man against over a hundred we camping-place be wild and picturesque and have it not be for the uncomfortable sensation of not quite know what would happen next we stay at gwarjak would have be pleasant enough even gerôme be depressed and anxious and the beïla man and escort ill at ease i be sorely tempt more than once to accede to kamoo 's request strike tent and move on to gajjar the next village but be restrain by the thought that such a proceeding would not only be undignified but a source of satisfaction to my _ bête noire _ malak -lrb- illustration : malak -rrb- after a prolonged absence of four or five hour the latter return together with he wazir and about a dozen follower a more cut-throat look set of ruffian i have seldom see all wear long black-cloth robe trim with scarlet and white turban and carry a snider rifle and belt stuff with cartridge sling over the left shoulder i now notice with some anxiety that malak 's quiet and undemonstrative manner have completely alter to one of swaggering insolence and bravado the chief wish you to know he have twenty more like this say kamoo point to malak 's villainous-looking suite tell he i be very glad to hear it be my reply politely mean but which seem to unduly exasperate the king of gwarjak brushing past I he burst into the tent follow by he man and seat himself on my only camp-stool then produce a large american revolver he cock it with a loud click place it on the ground beside he and call for he kalyan patience have limit with the reflection that few white man would have put up with the insult i have that tommy atkin be after all only three hundred mile away and that in the event of my death malak would probably be shoot if not blow from a gun -- i order he -lrb- through the tremble kamoo -rrb- to instantly leave the tent with all he follower the fire-eating chieftain be -lrb- unlike most baluchi -rrb- a poor creature for to my intense relief he slink out at once with he tail between he leg have then re-appropriate the camp-stool i order in the escort fix bayonet load _ my _ revolver with ostentation and command my friend to re-enter alone which he do and as american say quickly then ensue a uncomfortable silence interrupt by the arrival of one of my man to say that the villager have refuse to sell provision of any kind although egg milk and rice be to be have in plenty i be not the king of these people say malak passionately on be remonstrate with every man here be free to do as he please with he own as we store be now run uncomfortably short this boycott system be anything but pleasant will _ you _ sell we some egg and milk i ask as my unwilling guest rise to go it be eat humble-pie with a vengeance but hunger like many other thing have no law i be not a stall-keeper be the answer a request to be permit to ascend the hill and visit the fort be meet by a emphatic refusal i then as a last resource inquire through kamoo if my hospitable host have any objection to my walk through the village if you like be the reply but i will not be responsible for you safety this be not kelát the english be not we master we care nothing for they notwithstanding these mysterious warning however i visit the village towards sunset alone with gerôme fear lest the sight of my escort should arouse the ire and suspicion of the native there be little to see and nothing to interest gwarjak be build without any attempt at order or symmetry many of the house have topple over till they roof touch the ground and the whole place present a appearance of poverty and decay strangely at variance with the smile plain of grain rice and tobacco around it not a human being be visible for we appearance be the signal for a general stampede indoors but the dirty narrow street swarm with huge fierce dog who would have attack we but for the heavy nagaika -lrb- a -rrb- with which we be arm we be evidently cordially hate by both man and beast on return to camp i give order for a start at four the next morning there be no object to be gain by remain and the native would have be only too glad of a excuse for open attack the remains of a ancient city cover a very large area be say to exist near gwarjak about a mile due south of it i could however discover no trace of they although we come from that direction and must have traverse the supposed site after the fatigue and anxiety of the day i be enjoy a cigar in the bright moonlight when a messenger from the village arrive in camp he have a narrow escape not answer the challenge of the sentry for the second time the latter be about to fire when i run forward and throw up he rifle which discharge in the air a second later and the man would have be shoot in which case i do not suppose we should ever have see quetta the message be from malak invite I to a zigrus a kind of religious dance take place just outside the village after some reflection i decide to go it might of course mean treachery but the probability be that the chief afraid of be report to the indian government for he insolence and insubordination wish to atone for he conduct before i leave under the messenger 's guidance and attend by gerôme and a guard of five man with loaded rifle i set out both the russian and myself carry and prominently display a brace of revolver a walk of ten minute bring we to a clear space by the river in the center blaze a huge bonfire round which in a semicircle be squat some two or three hundred native watch the twisting and contortion of half a dozen grotesque creature with paint face and long streaming hair who as they turn slowly round and round vary the performance with leap and bound alternately groan wail and scream at the top of they voice -lrb- illustration : a zigrus in gwarjak -rrb- a horn a lute and half a dozen tom-tom accompany the dance some distance away and surround by he grim-looking guard sit malak who though he do not rise to receive I beckon I to he side with more politeness than usual it be a weird strange sight the repulsive half-naked figure leap round the fire the silent awestruck crowd of baluchis the wild barbaric music and pillar of flame flash on the dark sullen face of malak and he follower be not a little impressive especially as i be in a state of please uncertainty as to the object of my host 's sudden change of manner and whether this might not be a little dramatic introduction to a attack upon we party this be however evidently not my sulky friend 's intention for as i rise to go he actually stand up and take my hand at gajjar he say you will be able to get all you want but take my advice and get away from here early to-morrow morning they do not like you four hour after we be _ en route _ the zigrus be still go on as we ride out of the village malak and he guard still sit motionless the weird dancer and crowd of onlooker be still there the huge bonfire blaze as brightly as ever though the eastern sky be lighten as we pass within a hundred yard i wave my hand but the compliment be not return some of the crowd look up at the caravan all must have see it but avert they face till we have pass i be not on the whole sorry to leave gwarjak but one european colonel m -- of the indian service have visit gwarjak for fifteen year prior to my visit my road thither from noundra have never be traverse save by native and it be perhaps more by good luck than good management that we come through successfully the inhabitant of gwarjak be a tribe know as the nushirvani who claim to be of persian descent it be only at quetta that i learn that my friend malak be only viceroy of this inhospitable district the head-quarter and residence of the chief one nimrood khan be at kharán -lrb- a hundred and fifty mile north-west of gwarjak -rrb- nimrood who be fortunately absent detest european and would probably have make matter even worse for we intermix freely with the wild and lawless tribe of the baluch-afghan frontier -lrb- from which kharán be but a few mile distant -rrb- it be scarcely to be wonder at that the nushirvani be inimical to european whom they be teach by they chief and afghan neighbor to look upon as natural enemy although we have not as yet form a very favourable idea of baluch hospitality we reception at every village from here to the capital amply atone for the rough and uncivil behavior of the wild nushirvani we be now once more on the beaten track for though the country south of gwarjak be previous to we cross it unexplore the journey from kelát to gajjar have frequently be make by european during the past few year we reception by the native of gajjar -lrb- only twenty mile from gwarjak -rrb- be a pleasant contrast to that give we at the latter place camp be no sooner pitched than present of egg milk rice and tobacco be bring in and i be cordially welcome by the chief of the village gajjar be a ramshackle tumble-down place of about three hundred inhabitant on a small hillock to the right of the village stand the fort a square building of solid masonry which however be now roofless and have only three wall stand the garrison -lrb- of six man -rrb- be lodge in a flimsy tent pitch in the center of the ruin half the house be construct of dry mud the remainder as at gwarjak of palm leave the village stand in a grove of date palm and the swarm of fly be consequently almost unendurable we encamp close to the village well to which during the afternoon many of the female population come to draw water two of they bright pleasant-featured girl of eighteen or twenty be the best-looking specimen of the baluch woman that i meet with throughout the journey towards sunset the corpse of a young man be bear past my tent and inter in a little cemetery hard by the burial rite of the baluchi be very similar to those of persium when a death occur mourner be send for and food be prepare at the decease 's house for such friend as desire to be present at the reading of prayer for the dead while kairat or charitable distribution of food be make for the benefit of the soul of the decease a wife on the decease of she husband neglect wash and be suppose to sit lament by herself for not less than fifteen day long before this however she female friend come to she house and beg she to desist from weep bring with they the powder of a plant call larra with this the widow wash she head and then resume she former life and occupation if however by thoughtlessness or malice she friend defer they visit she must mourn for a much longer period alone a curious baluch custom be that of digging a grave much deeper for a woman than a man they argue that woman be by nature so restless she would not remain quiet even in death without a larger proportion of earth over she -lrb- illustration : nomad baluch tent -rrb- in the matter of birth and marriage the baluchi being of the mohammedan religion regulate they ceremony mainly accord to the korán marriage be

across here in winter they be form by digging hole eight to ten foot deep these be rudely thatch over with palm leave bit of stick and plaited straw thus form a warm and comfortable shelter the chief of jebrus one chaba khan ride out to meet I clothe in a long gown of golden thread which flash in the sun be discernible a couple of mile off jebrus contain about four hundred inhabitant and be a neatly build village protect by a large mud fort and a garrison of twenty baluchi arm with snider rifle chaba who be very proud of he village inform I that he rule extend over a considerable extent of country contain a population of over 20000 many of he subject be native of seistan kharán and shotrawák all afghan border district and give he at time no little trouble the jebrus fort have be attack only a year previous to my visit but chaba -lrb- who i afterwards hear at kelát be a renowned fire-eater -rrb- give the rebel such a warm reception that there have be no outbreak since my genial old host have himself give a good deal of trouble to the kelát government in he younger day and tell I with evident pride that he have lead many a chupao in the good old day the savage and predatory character of the baluchus be formerly well exemplify in these lawless incursion when large tract of country be pillage and devastate and the most unheard-of cruelty practice chupao be now a thing of the past pottinger who traverse this country in the last century and have more than one unpleasant _ rencontre _ with these armed band thus describe one of these plunder expedition -- the depredator be usually mount on camel and furnished accord to the distance they have to go with food consist of date goat 's milk and cheese they also carry water in a small skin-bag if requisite which be often the case if the expedition be prolong when all be prepare the band set off and march incessantly till within a few mile of where the chupao be to commence and then halt in some unfrequented spot to rest they camel on the approach of night they mount again and as soon as the inhabitant of a village have retire to rest begin they attack by burn destroy and carry off whatever come in they way they never think of rest for one moment during the chupao but ride on over the territory on which it be make at the rate of eighty or ninety mile a day until they have load they camel with as much pillage as they can possibly remove and as they be very expert in the management of they animal each man on a average will have charge of ten or twelve if practicable they make a circuit which enable they to return by a different route this afford a double prospect of plunder and also mislead those who pursue the robber -- a step generally take though with little effect when a sufficient body of man can be collect for that purpose in these desperate undertaking the predatory robber be not always successful and when any of they chance to fall into the hand of exasperated villager they be mutilate and put mercilessly to death the fact conclude pottinger of these plunder expedition be a institution in baluchistán must serve to show how slight be the power wield by the paramount ruler and what risk to the safety of both person and property must be run by those engage in the business of trade in such a country chaba visit I towards evening accompany by he son a clever-looking bright-eyed lad about fifteen year old notice that he wear a belt and buckle of the 66th regiment i inquire where he have procure it and be tell that it have be purchase from a gwarjak man who bring it down from kharán shortly after the fatal disaster to the regiment at maiwand the kindly old chief now press my acceptance of a fine fat goat -- a very acceptable gift consider the impoverished condition of the camp larder we then visit the fort and village under he guidance jebrus and its neighborhood be well cultivate the system of agriculture practice in this part of baluchistán be simple but effective the field be divide off by ridge of earth and raise embankment to a accurate level they be then further subdivide longitudinally by ridge throw up about seven or eight pace apart this be do for purpose of irrigation the soil be then plough and manure the former operation be generally carry on by means of bullock tract of land not irrigate by stream but which be dependent on rain and the rivulet which come down from the hillside after it be call kash-kawa and be find scatter about the valley here and there near the tent-encampment of the nomad tribe who plough a piece of land sow it and return to gather in the crop when it be mature the implement of husbandry in general use be a light wooden plough of primitive construction consist of a vertical piece bent forward at the bottom

view be obtainable of the surrounding country immediately below be pretty garden or enclosed space sow in the center with maize wheat and tobacco and surround by plum and pomegranate tree and date

and other flower some remarkably fine vine and a number of mulberry tree the grounds be well and neatly lay out with path grass plot and artificial stream upon which i compliment the old man but he would talk of nothing but he fort which be indeed the only structure worthy of the name meet with between quetta and the sea in the evening he son bring I a delicious dish of preserved apricot and cream for which i present he with three rupee one of which he instantly return it be consider by baluchi extremely unlucky to give or accept a odd number of coin -lrb- illustration : jebrus -rrb- at

native with the exception of a strike among we camel-driver which fortunately last only a few hour and a dust-storm encounter a few mile from sohrab nothing worthy of mention occur to break the

leave great gaping hole in the wall the mir mount a few primitive muzzle-loading cannon and the citadel be garrison by a thousand man chiefly afghan deserter from cábul kandahár and other part of the ameer 's dominion they be a ragged undisciplined lot the khan himself have a wholesome dread of he soldiery who break out at time and commit great depredation among the village surround the capital rob and murder the peasant with impunity for few dare resist they the remainder of the troops three thousand in number be quarter in barracks or rather mud hovel at some distance from the palace each man be suppose to receive three rupee a month and a lump sum of forty-eight rupee at the end of each year but pay be uncertain and mutiny frequent when not engage on military duty the khan 's baluch soldier be put to agricultural work on he estate while the afghan pass they time in pillaging and plunder they neighbor as we enter kelát we pass a regiment at drill on a sandy plain outside the wall with the exception of a conical fur cap there be no attempt at uniform the man fine strap fellow be arm with rusty flint-lock though there appear to be no officer european or otherwise i be rather surprise to hear the word of command give in english and to see this band of ragamuffin march off parade to the strain of home sweet home play by a very fair fife-and-drum band the morning follow my arrival i be startle by the apparition at my bedside of a swarthy wild-looking afghan sowar -- a messenger from the wazir to say that he highness the khan wish to make my acquaintance and would receive I if convenient at three o'clock that afternoon it have not be my intention to solicit a interview for from all account the khan be anything but friendly towards european englishman in particular to refuse however be out of the question the morning be therefore devote to clean up and get out a decent suit of wearing-apparel while my beïla escort who evidently have uncomfortable foreboding as to the appearance of the beïla uniform in the street of kelát polish up arm and accoutrements till they shine like silver and pay i notice particular attention to the loading of they rifle and revolver about midday the wazir make he appearance to conduct I to the palace he be a fat paunchy old man with beady black eye and a shy shifty expression very unlike my cheery little friend at beïla after the usual preliminary question as to who i be my age business etc he anxiously inquire after the health of mr gladstone and somewhat astonished I by ask whether i be a liberal or conservative you have some beïla man with you i see say the khan 's adviser who speak english perfectly do not let he highness see they i could not after such a speech allow my faithful escort to enter the city without warn but it have little effect let the dog do what they like be the reply we shall not let the sahib go alone tea and cigarette discuss a start be make for the palace the wazir on a wiry good look bay horse and attend by half a dozen mount afghan lead the way and i follow on a pony borrow of the telegraph clerk my costume be if not become at any rate original : high boot flannel trousers and shirt a evening dress-coat and astrakhan cap gerôme 's wardrobe be even less presentable i deem it prudent to leave he behind the beïla man bring up the rear of the procession some distance from the afghan who to my anxiety never cease scoffing and jeer at they the whole way every moment i expect to hear the crack of a pistol-shot follow by a general _ mêlée _ arrive at the mastung gate we dismount and leave we horse in charge of the guard slowly proceed up the steep narrow street to the citadel the entrance to kelát be not impose there have be a good deal of rain and the street of the lower part of the town be perfect quagmire of mud nearly knee-deep it be more like crawl into a dark passage than enter a city many of the thoroughfare be entirely cover over with wooden beam plaster with mud which entirely exclude light and give they more the appearance of subterranean passage than street the upper part of the town be the cleanest for the simple reason that all filth and sewage run down open gutter cut in the center of the steep alley until it reach the level of the plain there be no provision make for its escape it be allow to collect in great pool which in long-continued wet weather often flood the house and drive they wretched inhabitant into the open to live as best they may further up the hill kelát be for this reason only very unhealthy small-pox typhoid and typhus be never absent though curiously enough cholera visitation be rare the filthy habit of the inhabitant have apparently a good deal to do with the high death rate i saw while walk up the hill a native fill a cup from a open drain and drink it off although the smell be unbearable the liquid of a dark-brown color a very common and -- in the absence of medical treatment -- fatal disease among the inhabitant of the suburb -lrb- chiefly afghan -rrb- be stone in the bladder the water here though pure and clear in the suburb contain a large quantity of lime the bazaar through which we pass on we way to the mir do not seem a very busy one although not a public or religious holiday many of the stall be close kelát be once the great channel for merchandise from kandahár and cábul to indium but the caravan trade be now insignificant there be in the season a considerable traffic in date but that be all for the road to persium and afghanistán be very unsafe only a few week previous to my visit a kelát merchant proceeding with a large caravan to kermán in persium be rob and murder in the frontier district west of kharán few now attempt the journey most of the goods be send to quetta and thence by rail to various part of indium by sea to persia art and industry be as well as trade practically at a standstill in the khan 's city though a handsome embroidery peculiar to kelát be make by the woman and fetch high price in indium while some of the native be clever at brass work and ironmongery notice a russian samovar in one of the shop i enter and inquire of the owner -lrb- through the wazir -rrb- how it have reach kelát from russium be the reply _ viâ _ meshéd herat and kandahár there be a good caravan-road the whole way add the baluchus take down a small brass shield from a peg in the wall this come from bokhára _ viâ _ cábul only ten day ago but trade be not what it be would there be any difficulty in make that journey i ask for you -- a englishman -- yes say the man with a queer smile and be continue when the khan will be grow impatient break in the wazir take my hand and lead I hurriedly into the street a afghan guard of honor be draw up at the entrance of the palace wear the nearest approach to a uniform i have yet see -- dark-green tunic light-blue trousers and white turban clean well fitting and evidently keep for state occasion each man carry a berdán rifle and cavalry sabre it strike I as a curious coincidence that the former rifle be in general use throughout the russian army leave my escort with strict injunction to keep they temper and under no circumstance to allow themselves to be draw into a quarrel i follow the wazir and he attendant into the mir the entrance be through a underground passage about forty yard long by seven wide ill-smelling and in total darkness arrive at the end we again emerge into daylight and ascend a flight of rickety wooden step find ourselves in the durbar-room -- a spacious apartment its wall decorate with green gold and crimson panel alternate with large looking-glass costly rug and carpet from persium and bokhára strew the grimy floor of the chamber which be about sixty foot long and command a splendid view of the city and fertile plain beyond await I upon the balcony be the khan surround by he suite and another guard of afghan a couple of dilapidated cane-bottomed chair be then bring and set one on each side of the crimson velvet divan occupy by he highness have make my bow which be acknowledge by a curt nod i be conduct to the seat on the right hand of the khan by azim khan he son who seat himself upon he father 's left hand the wazir suite soldier and attendant then squat round we in a semicircle and the interview commence a long silence follow break only by the whish of the fly-brush as a white-clad baluchus whisk it lazily to and fro over the khan 's head the balcony on which we be receive be poise at a dizzy height over the beehive-looking dwelling and narrow tortuous street of the brown city which to-day be bath in sunshine the khan 's residence be well choose the pestilent stench of he capital can not ascend to this height only the sweet scent of hay and clover-field and the distant murmur of a large population while a glorious panorama of emerald-green plain stretch away to a rocky picturesque range of hill on the horizon he highness mir khudadad khan of kelát be about sixty year old he would be tall be it not for a decide stoop which together with a toothless lower jaw give he the appearance of be considerably more than he age he complexion be very dark even for a baluch and he wear a rusty black beard and moustache presumably dye from the streak of red and white that run through they and long coarse pepper-and-salt lock streaming far below he shoulder he personal appearance give I anything but a favourable impression the khan have a scowling expression keen pierce black eye and a sharp hooked nose that remind one forcibly of cruikshank 's picture of fagin the jew in oliver twist the khan be dress in a long loose white garment with red silk embroidery of beautiful workmanship a thin white cashmere shawl be throw carelessly over he shoulder and he wear a conical violet silk cap trim with gold lace and a pair of pointed green morocco slipper turn up at the toe and ornament with the same material a massive gold necklace or collar thickly stud with diamond ruby and sapphire hang round he neck the stone some of they of great size be set indiscriminately without any regard to pattern or design mir khudadad wear no other jewel with the exception of three small torquoise ring all worn on the little finger of the left hand he carry no arm but hold in he right hand a large and very dirty pocket-handkerchief of a bright yellow hue with large red spot which somewhat detract from he regal appearance the khan be a great snuff-taker and during the audience continually refresh himself from the contents of a small gold box carry by he son prince azim who be dress in a green silk jacket and loose magenta-coloured trousers be a pleasant-mannered lad of about twenty he be of much lighter complexion than he father and have a strong jewish cast of feature a huge cabochon emerald of great value suspend from the neck be azim 's sole ornament -lrb- illustration : palace of the khan kel t -rrb- a conversation now commence carry on through the medium of the wazir and my interpreter the khan have a fidgety uneasy manner that must be intensely exasperating to he court more than once during the audience have ask a question with much apparent earnestness he would suddenly break in in the middle of a reply and hum a tune or start off on a totally different subject from the one under discussion at other time he would repeat a question twice or thrice and he eye fix on vacancy utterly ignore the answer of the wazir who evidently stand in great awe of he eccentric sovereign though the follow colloquy may appear brief to the reader it take nearly a hour to get through where do you come from and what be you be the khan 's first question from russium you highness from russium return the khan quickly but you be english be you not certainly i be how strong be russium 's army continue the khan after a application to the gold snuff box and a trumpet-blast on the yellow bandanna nominally about three million and england about two hundred thousand not count the reserve humph grunt the khan tell I do the english imagine that abdur raman -lrb- b -rrb- be they friend i believe so then tell they from I cry the khan excitedly half rise from he seat tell queen victorium from I that it be not so tell she to beware of abdur raman he be she enemy be england afraid of russium continue the khan after a long pause no the english fear no one will england reach kandahár before russium take herat i really can not say be my answer to this somewhat puzzling question mir khudadad then turn away to converse with the wazir in a low tone about ten minute elapse during which a long confabulation be hold in which many of the suite include the afghan soldier join prince azim meanwhile invite I to inspect he sword and pistol the former a splendid damascus blade and hilt encrust with jewel i especially admire have i know the use to which it have be put that morning i should not perhaps have be so enthusiastic again the khan address I do you know russia well pretty well be it true that the russian do not allow mohammedan to worship in central asia i believe that be untrue it be a lie most certainly it be you own countryman tell I so at this there be a roar of laughter in which the khan join the durbar-room of kelát remind I of a english court of justice when the khan laugh he courtier do and _ vice versâ _ after a interval of more snuff-taking and whisper the khan draw forth and examine my watch take this for a polite hint that the interview have last long enough i rise to go but be at once thrust back into my chair by azim you be not to go say the wazir the khan be much interested by you dhuleep singh be in russium be he not then ask the khan yes what do russia pay he a year i do not know more than england do i do not know you english never do know anything mutter the khan impatiently add do you know the czar of russium i have see he be he a good man i believe he to be so then why do he people try to kill he some of they be socialist socialist repeat the khan slowly what be that i then explain with some difficulty the meaning of the word humph be the rejoinder then with a whisk of the yellow bandanna : i be glad i have none in kelát a mark of great favor be then show I the khan present I with he photograph with the request that i would show it to parliament when i get home i think he be under the impression that the latter be a human be a incident that occur but two year since be typical of the intelligence of the ruler of kelát and he court it be at quetta on the occasion of the presentation of mir khudadad to the viceroy of indium previous to a grand _ déjeûner _ give in he honor the khan and he suite be show into a dressing-room for the purpose of wash they hand on enter to announce that luncheon be ready the aide-de-camp find that the distinguished guest have already commence operation and be greedily devour the cake of pear ' soap that have be place there for a somewhat different purpose that none of the party feel any after ill effect speak well for the purity of the wares of the mammoth advertiser -- or the baluch digestion the khan shake my hand cordially at parting and again beg I not to forget he warning anent the ameer of afghanistán with whom he be apparently not on the best of term i find with some relief that my beïla man have make friend with the afghan and surround by a admiring crowd be hobnob over a hissing samovar one of the afghan hand I a glass of tea which not to offend he i drink and find delicious it have come from china _ viâ _ siberium samarcand and cábul russkus say the man with a grin as i hand back the cup the khan of kelát very rarely leave he palace and be seldom see abroad in the street of kelát except on friday when he go to the mosque on foot attend by a escort arm to the tooth he be say to live in constant dread of assassination for he cruel rapacious character have make he universally detest in and around the capital he one thought in life be money and the increase of he income which with the yearly sum allow he by the british government may be put down at considerably over # 30000 per annum a thorough miser the khan do not like most eastern potentate pass the hour of night surround by the beauty of the harem but securely lock in with he money-bag in a small comfortless room on the roof of he palace -lrb- illustration : the khan of kel t -rrb- there be not the smallest doubt in my mind that russian influence be indirectly be bring to bear on the court of kelát but mir khudadad may be say to have no policy as the french say il change sa nationalité comme je change de chemise and be to be buy by the highest bidder although the khan 's subject be heavily tax there be no protection whatsoever of life or property in or around kelát theft be accord to the penal code punish by fine and imprisonment murder and adultery by death but the law be subject to great modification in a word the khan be the law and so long as a man can afford to pay or bribe he handsomely he may commit the most heinous offence with impunity two instance of the way in which justice be carry out happen just before i arrive at kelát in the one a young baluch woman be find by she husband a soldier under circumstance which admit no doubt of she infidelity upon discovery which take place at night the infuriate husband rush off to the guard-house for he weapon during he absence the woman urge she lover who be well arm to meet and slay he in the darkness under pretence of so do the gay lothario leave he paramour but fearful of consequence make off to quetta on he return home the husband use no violence simply hand he wife over to the guard to be deal with accord to law bring before the khan the next day she be lucky enough to find that monarch in a good temper she beauty probably obtain the free pardon accord she and a order that she husband be also to condone she offence the latter say not a word take she quietly home in the evening and cut she throat from ear to ear the khan on hearing of the murder next day make no remonstrance nor be the offender punish he be a afghan the second case be even more disgraceful one of the khan 's own suite a well-known libertine and drunkard contract a alliance with a young girl of eighteen he have endeavor in vain to marry she younger sister almost a child and so beautiful that she be know for many mile round the city as the pearl of kelát six week after marriage this ruffian in a fit of drunken frenzy cause by jealousy almost decapitate he wife with a tulwar and afterwards mutilate she body past recognition the shriek of the poor woman have summon the neighbor he be seize bind and lead before the khan who at once sentence he to death the execution be fix for sunrise the follow day at midnight however a messenger appear at the gate of the mir with a canvas bag contain two thousand rupee tell he he be free say the ruler of kelát and if he send in another thousand i will _ order _ the younger sister to marry he the money be pay and the poor child handed over to the tender mercy of the human devil who have so ruthlessly butcher she sister i have mention that azim khan show I a sword of beautiful workmanship it have the very morning of my visit to the palace cut down and hack to piece a waiting-maid not sixteen year old in the khan 's harem i myself see the corpse of the poor girl the same evening as it be be carry outside the wall for interment -lrb- c -rrb- this then be the state of thing exist at kelát not a hundred mile from the british outpost this the enlighten sovereign who have be make companion of the star of indium a order which among he own people he affect to look upon with the greatest contempt the few woman i see at kelát be distinctly good look far more so than those further south most of they have a italian type of face olive complexion and large dark eye with sweeping lash but very few wear the hideous nose-ring so common at beïla and sonmiani morality be at a discount in the capital and prostitution common the wazir send I a bag of date the morning of my departure with a short note write in english beg that i would send he in return the best gold watch and rifle that could be buy for gold in london the note end jocosely exchange be no robbery the old man seem well _ au fait _ with central asian affair on my mention the day before that i have intend enter indium _ viâ _ cábul he at once say ah i suppose alikhanoff stop you he be very shy of stranger we leave kelát at 6 be on the 12th of April the camel and heavy baggage have be send on four or five hour previously to mangachar the first station we caravan now consist of only eight camel which we find reduce to seven on arrival just before daylight a couple of panther have appear close to the caravan and cause a regular stampede the beast fly right and leave on order be restore two be find to be miss one laden with the only small remain tent and some native luggage the other with a couple of case of whisky -lrb- nearly empty -rrb- and my camp-stool the former be trace and bring in after a search of over two hour but the latter be still for aught i know career over the boundless desert a unconscious advertiser of jameson and co i afterwards hear that this plain be note for panther and wolf also a animal call the peshkorus somewhat larger than a cat with a reddish-coloured hide it move about the country in pack carry off deer and sheep its method of descend precipice and steep hillside be curious each animal fix its tooth in the tail of another thus form a kind of chain the plain of mangachar be situate nearly 6000 foot above sea-level and be well cultivate with wheat lucerne and tobacco the village itself be neatly lay out and contain about three hundred inhabitant the different aspect of the country north and south of kelát be striking we have now do with desert for good for at night light be see twinkle all over the plain while in the daytime large tract of well-cultivated land continually meet the eye between mangachar and mastung a hot wind arise which make the eye smart and dry up the skin like a blast from a furnace one 's hair feel as it do in the hottest room of a turkish bath with the unpleasant addition of be fill with fine gritty sand i hope this may not end in a juloh say kamoo anxiously this my interpreter proceed to explain be a hot poisonous wind peculiar to these district and perhaps the greatest danger run by traveller in baluchistán the warm breeze as kamoo call it that we experience be though almost unbearable not dangerous while the dreaded juloh have slay its hundred of victim cook the traveller who have give this subject much attention have come to the conclusion that it be cause by the generation in the atmosphere of a highly concentrated form of ozone by some intensely marked electrical condition as evidence of its effect in destroy every green thing on its course and in be frequently fatal to human life he cite the follow well-authenticated case which not have encounter the death-dealing blast myself i place before the reader : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- in the year 1851 during one of the hot month certain officer of the sind horse be sleep at night on the roof of general jacob 's house at jacobabad they be awaken by a sensation of suffocation and a exceedingly hot and oppressive feeling in the air while at the same time a very powerful smell of sulphur be notice on the follow morning a number of tree in the garden be find to be wither in a very remarkable manner it look as if a current of fire about two yard in breadth have pass through the garden in a perfectly straight line singeing and destroy every green thing in its course enter on one side and pass out at the other its tract be as clearly define as the course of a river -lrb- 2 -rrb- at the close of 1856 a party of five man be cross the desert of shikarpur be on they way from kandahár to that city when the blast cross they path kill three of they instantly and seriously disable the other two -lrb- 3 -rrb- a moonshus with two companion be travel about seven mile south-east of bagh in kachus -lrb- not far distant from mangachar -rrb- about two o'clock the blast strike they they be sensible of a scorching sensation in the air accompany by a peculiar sulphurous smell but remember nothing further as all three be immediately strike to the ground they be afterwards find and carry to bagh where every attention be afford they they ultimately after many day of sickness recover as regard the strength of the juloh pottinger write that so search be its nature it have be know to kill camel and other hardy animal and its effect on the human frame be say by eye-witness to be the most agonizing and repulsive imaginable shortly after contact with the wind the muscle of the sufferer become rigid and contract the skin shrivel a terrible sensation as if the skin be on fire pervade the whole frame while in the last stage the skin crack into deep gash produce hemorrhage quickly follow by death it be curious to note that the juloh be peculiar to the northern district of sarawán and kach-gandáva and do not exist in the southern province of baluchistán the road from mangachar to mastung be good though slightly undulate and intersect by deep nullah the estimated area of the mastung district be two hundred and eighty mile it be aptly name the garden of baluchistán for considerably more than two-third of its area be under cultivation water at mastung be never-failing and the pretty town nestle in a valley of vineyard and fruit-garden fig and olive tree remind one more of some secluded town in the pyrenee or south of france than a baluch settlement the soil hereabouts be light and sandy and particularly favourable to the cultivation of grape of which there be no less than five kind apricot peach plum and pomegranate be also grow and supply the market of quetta and kelát madder and tobacco be also export in large quantity from mastung which possess a neatly build and busy bazaar the plain of dasht-bi-dowlat or the unpropitious plain lie between mastung and quetta the name however only apply after the harvest have be gather for next to mastung this be one of the most fertile spot in baluchistán dasht-bi-dowlat be mainly cultivate by wander tribe the inhabitant of mastung be enthusiastic in they description of the plain in summer then they tell we the surface be cover with verdure and flower of all kind especially the lalum or tulip which they aver cover it for mile with a carpet of crimson and gold and load the air with sweet intoxicate perfume the cultivation of this plain be mostly dependent on rain and heavy dew to the west of dasht-bi-dowlat be chehel-tan a steep rocky mountain 13000 foot high in the ravine and valley of which snow still lay deeply only two european masson the traveller and sir henry green have ever succeed in reach the summit on which be a zariat or shrine the ascent be difficult and dangerous as the mountain be say to be haunt no native guide be procurable the word chehel-tan signify in baluch forty body and be derive from the follow legend a frugal pair many year marry be unblest with offspring they therefore seek the advice of a holy man who rebuke the wife say that he have not the power to grant she what heaven have deny the priest 's son however -lrb- also a moullah -rrb- feel convinced he could satisfy she wish and cast forty pebble into she lap at the same time pray that she might bear child in process of time she be deliver of forty babe -- rather more than she wish or know how to provide for the poor husband at he wit ' end ascend to the summit of chehel-tan with thirty-nine and leave they there trust to the mercy of the deity to provide for they while the fortieth babe be bring up under the paternal roof one day however touch by remorse the wife unknown to she husband explore the mountain with the object of collect the bone of she child and bury they to she surprise they be all living and gambolling among the tree and rock wild with joy she run back to she dwelling bring out the fortieth babe and place it on the summit of the mountain leave it there for a night to allure back its brother but on return in the morning she find that the latter have carry it off and it be never see again it be by the spirit of these forty babe that chehel-tan be say to be haunt at 8 be on the 14th of April we sight afar off a oasis on the dead green plain of long barrack-like building garden-girt bungalow and white tent we have reach we journey 's end the church-bell be ring as i ride into quetta for it be Sunday and unfortunately a bright fine morning have it be otherwise i might have be spare the ordeal of ride on a very dirty and attenuate camel past a crowd of well-dressed woman and frock-coated man on they way to church as we pass a neat victorium glisten with varnish and draw by a pair of good-looking high-stepping pony contain a general in full uniform and a pretty smartly dress lady i cast a glance behind I gerôme who bring up the rear of the caravan have -lrb- for coolness -rrb- divest himself of boot and sock and sublimely unconscious be refreshing himself from the contents of a large wicker flask one can not unfortunately urge on a camel or quicken he pace at these awkward moment and i pass a very uncomfortable quarter of a hour before reach the dák bungalow but a glance at a looking-glass reassure I no one would ever have take the brick-coloured ragged-looking ruffian we have become for european i accept a kind and courteous invitation from mr l -- of the indo-european telegraph with pleasure for the dák bungalow be dirty and comfortless although my host and charming hostess would have make any place agreeable quetta be from everything but a strategical point of view dull and uninteresting it be a english garrison town and all be say the usual nucleus of scandal surround by dance theatricals polo flirtation drink and -- divorce be they not all alike from gibraltar to hong kong under the guidance of my host however a pleasant trip be make to the khojak tunnel when one consider the comparatively short time it have be in hand it be almost incredible that with so many difficulty -lrb- water hard rock etc -rrb- this work should have progress as it have the tunnel which run due east and west be or will be two mile and a half in length and three hundred and sixty-five foot in depth at the deepest part from the earth 's surface from the eastern end only sixty-five mile over a firm and level plain separate it from kandahár even when i be there -lrb- d -rrb- a light line could have be lay to that city in six week without difficulty the plant rail and sleeper be on the spot have be carry over the hill and a railway-carriage could then run from calcutta to the eastern extremity of the tunnel without break of gauge the tunnel when complete will be thirty-four foot broad and twenty-five foot in height a curious incident happen at one of the railway-station between quetta and karachus at the buffet of the one in question i find gerôme converse volubly in russian with a total stranger a native on inquiry i find he be a very old friend a russian subject and native of samarcand he have just come through from cábul say my companion he often do this journey -- ostensibly for purpose of trade the 20th of April see we in bombay a italian steamer the _ venezium _ be leave for the black sea direct and in she i secure a passage for gerôme who be not impress with we eastern possession the crowd of curious native who persistently follow he everywhere may have have something to do with it for a fur-clad esquimaux in piccadilly would not have create a greater sensation than my companion in high boot black velvet breeches and red caftan in the busy street of the great indian city only a russian could have exist in that blaze sun with no other protection to the head than the astrachan bonnet which he obstinately refuse to discard i see he safely on board and something very like a tear come into my trusty little friend 's eye as we shake hand and part to meet perhaps never again for a better companion no man could wish plucky honest as the day and tender-hearted as a woman be gerôme realinus and it be with a feeling of loneliness and sincere regret that i watch the gray smoke of the _ venezium _ sink below the blue water which be soon to bear I also back to england and european civilization have the journey be worth it have the result repay one for the cold dirt and privation of persium the torrid heat and long desert march through baluchistán perhaps not there be some pleasant hour however to look back upon kashán a vision of golden dome and dim picturesque caravanserai ispahán with its stately madrassa and blue zandarood wind lazily through mile on mile of white and scarlet poppyland shiráz a dream of fair woman poetry and rose in its setting of emerald plain sweet-scented garden and cypress tree these at any rate be bright oasis in that somewhat dreary ride from teherán to the sea and then -- near indium -- the quiet midday siesta after the hot dusty march the _ al fresco _ repast by the light of a glorious sunset and the welcome rest and fragrant pipe in the cool night air of the silent starlit desert -lrb- footnote a : part of this palace be of
