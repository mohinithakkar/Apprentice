white forehead and disclose the fact of she very recent tear never in all she short happy life have betty be so move as now for the twin passion of gratitude and loyalty be at war within she and she realize with a feeling akin to dismay that she must meet the responsibility alone that those of she household be all array against she if my father be but at home say betty to herself he would know and understand but oliver will not listen no not even when i implore he to keep captain yorke close prisoner here for two day by which time my father be sure to arrive aunt euphemia be too timid and

in scorn over she brother 's four year ' seniority -- and -- and -- oh i be indeed astray what here i be one of the loyal wolcott -- a family know all through the land as true to the cause of freedom and the declaration -- and here i sit plan how to let a british officer foe to my country escape from my father 's house i wonder the wall do not open and fall on I and poor betty gaze half fearfully overhead as if she expect the rafter would descend upon the author of such treasonable sentiment but something must be do she think rapidly i care not whether he be friend or foe i take the consequence be mine the blame and she lift she pretty head with a air of determination as a soft knock fall upon she chamber door but before she could rise to open it the latch be raise and a little figure all in white creep inside i can not sleep betty sob moppet as she sister gather the child in she arm it be too too dreadful will general putnam hang my dear kind gentleman as the british hang captain nathan hale and shall we never never see he more dear heart say betty smooth the yellow hair and tear spring again to she eye as she think of the brave manly face of she country 's foe no

word about it how do you come to think of that say betty astonished i be afraid it be the devil prompt I say moppet with a sigh partly over she own iniquity and part in wonderment as to whether that overworked personage be somewhere soar in the air near at hand but i always think the british be big ogre with fierce eye and red whisker and i be sure my good kind gentleman be very like ourselves betty be betray into a low laugh moppet be always original but this be delicious no child she say softly the british be some bad some good and there be no doubt cruel man to be find in all war moppet as you come by the north door whom do you see on guard in the hall josiah huntington say moppet promptly but you hear what oliver say at supper yes answer betty oliver be so weary that josiah be to watch until twelve o'clock then at midnight reuben be to guard the hall until four in the morning when oliver would take he place until breakfast do you note the time on the hall clock it be half past eleven say moppet the half hour sound as i rapped betty sit ponder for a moment then she slide moppet gently from she lap to the floor and rise moppet she say gravely you be a little maid but you have a true heart and i believe you can keep a secret i be go to try to release captain yorke and i think you can help I i bind you to keep silent except to we dear and honor father and even to he you shall not speak until i permit you promise I dear heart i promise say moppet solemnly and betty know that no matter what happen she could depend on she devoted little sister moppet say betty i have a plan but ` tis a slender one do you recollect how close the great elm-tree bough come to you window i can put out my hand and nearly reach they say moppet you remember reuben cut the bough nearest but oh betty the tree have a limb which run a arm 's length only from the north chamber so i think answer betty who be busily engage in change she light summer gown for one of homespun gray and now moppet you and i must go into you room for the next part of my plot i must speak to captain yorke and can you guess how i shall manage to do it moppet 's eye grow large and round with excitement i know she whisper breathlessly through my doll 's dungeon oh betty how lucky ` tis that oliver never once dream of that i doubt if he even know its existence say betty there go the clock as the slow solemn voice of the timepiece sound out on the night it be twelve o'clock and reuben will be come upstairs from the kitchen hark -- extinguish she candle and open she door softly josiah have go to the turn on the stair and be speak to reuben quick moppet if you come still as a mouse they will not see we before we can gain you door and with swift soft step the two small figure steal across the hall in the semi-darkness which the night lamp standing near the great clock but serve to make visible and in another second panting and eager they stand safely within moppet 's chamber cling to each other as they quickly fasten the latch moppet 's chamber be a small one and occupy the center of the house miss euphemia 's be upon one side and the north chamber -lrb- as one of the great room be call -rrb- upon the other the great chimney of the mansion run up between the large and small room and what moppet call she doll 's dungeon be a hollow place just high enough for the child to reach in the back of the chimney for some purpose of ventilation there be a opening from this aperture into the north chamber it be cover with a piece of movable iron and in summer when no fire be use in that part of the house moppet take great delight in consign she contumacious doll -lrb- a rag baby of large size and much plainness of feature -rrb- to what she be please to call she dungeon to-night betty 's quick wit have divine what a important factor the aperture might prove to she and directly she have secure the door she walk softly toward the chimney and feel in the darkness for the movable bit of iron which fill the back when geoffrey yorke have finish the ample and delicious supper with which miss euphemia 's hospitable and pity soul have furnish he he light he candle and make thorough search of he temporary prison to ascertain whether he could escape therefrom betty 's gesture of disapproval when he be about to give he parole have seem to promise he assistance could it be possible that the lovely little rebel 's heart be so move with pity sweet betty think geoffrey be ever maid so grateful for a small service i wish with all my soul i might have chance and opportunity to do she a great one for never have i see so bewitching and dainty a creature and geoffrey 's heart give a mad leap as he remember the tearful beseech glance which betty have bestow upon he as oliver have conduct he from she presence the window of which there be two look north receive he first attention but he find they amply secure and although a strong arm might wrench they open it would be attend by such noise as could not fail to attract the attention of he guard post outside the door this reflection prompt he to inspect the door and discover a inside bolt as well as the outer one he draw it thus assure he privacy from intrusion the large chimney be he next point of investigation and although the flue seem somewhat narrow geoffrey decide that it afford some slight chance provide he have the means of descent when once he reach the roof back to the window again yes the great elm of which moppet have speak stand like a tall sentinel guard the mansion and geoffrey feel confident that he could crawl from roof to tree and thus reach the ground to be sure it be most hazardous there be the chance of some one sleep in the chamber near who might hear even so slight a noise he might become wedge in the chimney or -- pshaw one must risk life if need be for liberty and here geoffrey smile as it occur to he that this be what these very colonist be engage in do and for a moment the british officer feel a throb of sympathy hitherto unknown to he he have land at new york but a month before fill with insular prejudice and contempt for these country lad and farmer whom he imagine compose the continental army but the fight at fairfield which be carry on by the hessian with a brutality that disgust he and the encounter with such a family as this under whose roof he be begin to open he eye and he acknowledge frankly to himself that young oliver wolcott be both a soldier and a gentleman the boy look every inch a soldier think geoffrey when he refuse he sister 's plead faith he be make of firm stuff to withstand she oh betty betty i wonder if the fortune of war will ever let I see you face again and with a sigh compound of many thing geoffrey pick up a book that be lie on the table and resolve to read until it should be far on into the night when he would make a bold attempt to escape the clock on the stair strike twelve and geoffrey rouse from the light slumber into which he have fall hear the step outside he door as josiah huntington be join by reuben who be to relieve he guard and straighten himself with a long breath as he rise from he chair as he do so he become conscious of a slight very slight noise in the direction of the chimney and turn he eye toward it a soft whisper reach he ear captain yorke murmur the sweetest voice in the world and as the slight grating noise cease to he amazement a little white hand beckon he to approach a small aperture which he now perceive in the brick about four foot from the floor very softly geoffrey obey the summons and cautiously make he way to the chimney kneel down and put you ear near I say betty and the tall soldier drop on one knee obediently be very careful for though aunt euphemia 's chamber be on this side and she be usually a sound sleeper it might be we ill fortune that to-night she would wake i have make up my mind sir i can not keep you prisoner under a roof that but for you might be mourn my little sister dead i pray you say no more of that interrupted geoffrey softly i be more than repay by you interest in my unhappy condition it may be wrong it doubtless be say betty sigh but i have two plan for you escape tell I be you window securely fasten too strongly to be tamper with except by make noise that be certain to be overhear return geoffrey then we must try other means if you can but manage to scale the chimney -- and i think there be still some peg inside which reuben put there in the spring when he go up after burn it out -- if you can reach the roof by the chimney you will find on the south side close to the chimney itself a trap-door which let down by a ladder into we garret the ladder be stationary and i will meet you there at its foot and from the garret there be a back stairway down which you may creep to the buttery and once there ` tis but a step outside when i open the door god bless you whisper geoffrey feel a mad desire to kiss the pretty pink ear and soft cheek which he could just see by the dim light of miss moppet 's candle shall i start at once no return betty josiah huntington have just seek he chamber and he will be watchful wait until you hear the old clock on the staircase strike three that be the hour i have be tell when all sleep most soundly then moppet will tell you if all go right for i shall be wait for you as i say above and with a soft be very very careful to make no noise betty move away from the doll 's dungeon and yorke bound to he foot now moppet say betty softly let I wrap you well in you woolen habit lest you take cold oh betty darling whisper the child how will you ever gain the garret stair when reuben be watch he will be sure to think it strange can i not go for you no never say betty tenderly i will slip by reuben and you must not fret sit here on my knee and go fast asleep until i wake you moppet nestle she little head down obediently on betty 's shoulder but try hard though she do to keep she eye wide open sleep at last overcome she -- sleep so profound after all this excitement that betty be able to lay she softly upon she bed without awake and for the remainder of those long hour betty keep she vigil alone it be nervous work : for determine though she be to release yorke betty possess a most sensitive and tender conscience and love for she country and she people be as the air she breathe it prove the tenacity of she purpose and the strength of she will that notwithstanding she many misgiving when she hear the clock sound the quarter she rise from she low seat by the window where she have be gaze out into the night and whisper softly to moppet that it be time to wake the child spring up alert and quick as betty herself and listen to she sister 's last warning instruction to have no fear but wait quietly for she return and when the clock strike the hour to whisper through the hole in the chimney to yorke that she have go very softly she slipper hold tightly in she hand betty pull up the latch of the bedroom door and step into the almost dark hall the night lamp have partly die out but there be still enough of its flickering light to permit she when she eye grow accustomed to it to see the dim outline of reuben 's figure sit on a stool at the door of the north chamber in order to reach the garret from this part of the house she must go directly down the hall to where it part at the l where the stair reach the garret be shut off by a door on the other aide of which be a square landing where you could turn down and descend directly from the garret to the buttery once past reuben she would feel comparatively safe for although oliver 's room be opposite he be too weary to be wakeful it take scarcely a minute to creep toward reuben and betty draw a quick breath of relief when she perceive that the farmer-bred lad unaccustomed to night watch and feeling that he prisoner be secure behind the bolt door have fall fast asleep another minute and she have fairly fly through the hall and reach the door of the garret stair she recollect that the latch have a troublesome creak occasionally indeed she have notice it only that very day as she and sally tracy have mount to they eyrie in the big dormer window of the garret where safe from all ear they be wont to confide they girlish secret to each other pray heaven it creak not to-night say betty to herself as she gently and steadily pull the handle of the latch and see the dreaded door open to she hand inside step betty and make breathless pause while she close it and the amiable latch fall softly down again into its place swift as a flash the girlish figure flit up the wind narrow stair and gasp but triumphant betty seat herself on the lowest step of the trap-ladder to await the come of geoffrey yorke in the bedroom below miss moppet whose soul be thrill with mingled delight and terror at be a actor in a real story wait as she be tell until she hear the deep voice of the clock sound rather more awful than usual say one two three and then tiptoe over the bare floor she open with small tremble finger the tiny aperture and whisper be you there start back half frightened as the instant answer come close beside she : yes be it time betty be in the garret by now she falter oh sir be careful and fare you well for answer geoffrey yorke bent down and take the small cold finger extend to he press a kiss on they and with a soft farewell begin he passage up the chimney it be no such very difficult task he find to he satisfaction for betty be right and by feel carefully with he hand he perceive the friendly peg which reuben have insert and of which oliver have no knowledge else he would not have trust so agile and strong a prisoner within they reach geoffrey 's broad shoulder be the only sufferer but the rough homespun which cover they be a better protection than he uniform would have be and he again bless the good fortune which have throw the disguise in he way as he leave fairfield four day before betty sit on the ladder step strain she ear to catch the first sound become conscious of a light sound as geoffrey swing himself from the chimney top to the roof and she speed up the ladder to unhook the door of the trap just as he reach it speak not a word she say in he ear as he set he foot on the ladder but fasten the hook lest they discover that the door have be open now give I you hand and in the darkness the strong manly hand close firmly over she dainty finger with a clasp which strangely enough inspire she with fresh courage stop say betty suddenly as they be at the top stair you must remove you boot : the slightest creak might wake the sleeper at the end of the hall it take but a second of time to follow she direction and then very softly with many pause the pair creep down the wind stair and betty involuntarily hold she breath until the last step be safely pass and she raise the latch of the buttery door if miss bidwell have lock it come the swift thought -- but no like everything else that dreadful night fortune seem to favor betty and with a long-drawn sigh she draw she companion across the threshold and instantly shoot the bolt behind she a faint glow of dawn creep through the pantry window and betty pause a moment and regard the row of milk pan which adorn the shelf of the small room with grave intentness have you not better take a glass of milk she say you may have to travel far without food although i be sure that should you ask for it at any of we connecticut farmhouse you would be cheerfully supply and raise the neat dipper she fill it and hand it to geoffrey who take it gratefully from she hand and now put on you boot for freedom lie beyond that door she say still in softest tone as she unbolt the other door which lead directly outside i must go with you as far as the barn for you will need my mare to take you out of danger of pursuit no no answer geoffrey speak for the first time as they speed rapidly over the grass i will not take she you have dare much for I and i fear censure and harm may come to you for release I should you be discover censure say betty throw back she small head haughtily wherefore do you think i shall conceal my share in this night 's work oliver be but a hot-headed boy have my father be at home it would have be different and to he i shall make my confession that i have give liberty to -- oh i can not say a foe after what you have do for I -- to a british officer who come to slay my countryman never you foe betty cry yorke confront she with face as pale as she own and in he admiration of she spirit and nobility forget all else say rather you adoring friend who one day god willing hope to prove to you that there be british heart which be true and honest as yours and that none will be more loyal to you than mine own a hot wave of color flash up over betty 's charming face she lip tremble but no word come from they what be this impetuous young man daring to say to she the dawn be break over yonder hill geoffrey rush on and before the sun rise i must be as many mile away as my foot can carry I farewell farewell -- may god bless and keep you always go back straightway into the mansion i shall not stir step until i see you safe and through she brimming tear betty realize that he kiss be fall on she hand as without a word she turn and flee toward the open door but when she reach it some new-born impulse tear madly at she heart make she pause and look back she see geoffrey lift something from the grass at he foot which he wave toward she as he speed down the path and raise she hand to she gown she know that he have carry with he she breast-knot of rose-colored ribbon chapter v a loyal traitor betty stumble blindly over the threshold and with shake finger secure the outer bolt of the buttery door she head be whirling and she dare not stop there even to think over this extraordinary adventure for moppet be doubtless wait breathlessly for she return and at the recollection betty 's nerve grow steadier and she bethink herself that a glass of milk would be need by the child and that she must take it to she so she fill the smallest dipper not wish to go back into the china pantry for fear of noise and with the milk in hand conclude it be wiser to seek the main staircase in the hall rather than wake reuben by draw he attention to the exit on the garret stairway and fortunate it be for betty that she have so determine for as she set she foot upon the first step of the stair she behold oliver lean over the upper balustrade gaze gravely down upon she good-morning say betty readily in a cheerful undertone as she reach he side you be up betimes oliver where have you be ask she brother to the buttery say betty this be milk for moppet the child be wakeful and need it why do you not send reuben ask oliver who be always kind and attentive to he sister reuben echo betty do you not set he as guard to you prisoner and then she heart smite she for the gibe miss bidwell let no one meddle with she milk pan and i know best which be last night 's milk and she go up the hall with a naughty little throb of mingled mischief and triumph as she think how she have outwit he while the unsuspecting oliver seat himself near the north chamber door moppet sit up in bed welcome she sister with open arm and drink the milk thirstily as betty tell she that all be safe and that captain yorke be now well on he way i be as glad as can be say moppet who be trouble with no conscientious scruple whatsoever and be now begin to enjoy herself intensely at share a mystery with betty i tell he you be go after the big clock strike three and oh betty he kiss my hand through the hole in the chimney do he say betty flushing brightly under moppet 's keen glance and i sit there and shiver go on moppet discreetly drop that branch of the subject for i could hear he foot as he climb and once he slip and i be so frightened lest he should come tumble down and we fine plot be discover betty betty what a fine flutter oliver and josiah will be in at breakfast do not talk of it say betty shiver in she turn go to sleep moppet and i will fly to my chamber for it be not well that i should be discover here dress oliver be not one to notice now lie still until you be call for rise and betty trip back to she own room where tear off she dress she throw she tired little self on the bed to rest if not to sleep for the short hour that remain before breakfast the wolcott household be one that be early astir however and chloe the old color cook be out in the barn search for egg and miss bidwell have lay the breakfast cloth and polish the silver by half past six when miss euphemia knock briskly at the door where pamelum and dolly trumbull be slumber sweetly and resolve that she would request oliver to permit captain yorke to come down and breakfast with the family for mused miss euphemia we obligation to that young man should make some difference i think in he treatment i must try to persuade oliver to detain he here until my brother 's return for although i do not think it prudent to say so i confess i be no more anxious to keep he prisoner than betty be but miss euphemia have not more than descend at half past seven precisely -lrb- she usual hour -rrb- when oliver come hastily into the room demand a hammer and chisel and with such evident dismay upon he countenance that miss euphemia ask if anything be the matter i do not know say oliver search the drawer for the desire implement i call and knock smartly at captain yorke 's door to ask he if he desire hot water and to offer he a change of clean linen -lrb- as we be much the same size and build -rrb- but although i make sufficient noise to wake the hardest sleeper no response do i receive then i unbolt the door intend to enter but he have fasten it on the inside and -- he be ill cry miss euphemia in alarm i note he look pale last night much more likely ` tis some device to alarm we say oliver seize the chisel and miss euphemia follow he as he go hurriedly up the front staircase at its top stand huntington captain yorke be a sound sleeper he say address oliver i have knock at he door several time and get no response my mind misgive I say oliver fitting he chisel in the door and striking vigorously with the hammer and yet i make sure there be no chance for escape -- ha as the door swing open and discover the closed shutter and the last flickering gleam of the die candle upon the table good heaven huntington he have fly fly cry josiah rush after oliver as miss euphemia join the party and pamelum with dolly open she door across the hall hear the commotion and how surely not by the chimney i wish you have suggest that earlier say oliver bitterly i be a dolt and a fool 's head not to have thoroughly examine it last night and he rush across into betty 's chamber to find a candle with which to investigate the treacherous exit have a care oliver cry betty as she brother enter without knock to find she with she hair over she shoulder brush in hand what do you please to want you candle say oliver catch up the one upon she table and then pause as he be about to rush out again do you hear any noise last night betty noise answer betty face he calmly of what nature in the great chimney say oliver eye she sternly i do not say betty with truth return inward thanks that to that question she could reply without falsehood why do you ask you will find out soon enough say oliver dash down the hall without close the door and hurry to the kitchen for a light by the time he return he find josiah half way up the chimney here be peg he call out as oliver send the ray of the light candle upward ` tis easy enough to see how we prisoner escape fool that i be not to have search this place and he let himself down again where the bewildered group stand around the chimney-piece the fault be mine alone cry oliver furiously let we get out on the roof and see if we can discover how he make he descent to the ground by the great elm exclaim pamelum who have unfasten the shutter with josiah 's help see the branch overhang the roof just here and i think there be some piece of the bark on the ground below all of which be true and quick-witted of pamelum but moppet could have explain the presence of the bit of bark for as it happen the child have empty she apron under the elm the day before and the bark be some she have gather in the orchard for the bit of fungus which at night be phosphorescent and which moppet call fairy lamp true say josiah lean out of the window and there be footstep in the tall grass yonder point westward where he keen eye perceive a fresh path break in the meadow i must follow oliver to the roof this will be a dire blow to he as he think he prisoner so carefully guard how clever of he to escape under we very ear say dolly to pamela how could captain yorke contrive to climb down so softly that no one hear he be not miss euphemia 's chamber on this side yes say pamelum turn away from the window and so be moppet 's where be aunt euphemia and run out into the hall she encounter both betty and she aunt on the way to moppet 's apartment hush whisper betty with hand on the latch i hope she be still sleep moppet come into my room in the night aunt euphemia and be so cold and shiver that i go back with she and put she to bed i get a drink of milk for she and it seem to quiet she that be quite right say miss euphemia i have be afraid that the plunge in the pond do she some injury and she open the door softly only to see miss moppet 's curly head rise up from she pillow and to hear she say with a sleepy yawn : -- what be it all about where 's betty here i be say betty give she a kiss do you sleep soundly after the milk yes and i want some more say moppet seize the situation with such alacrity that betty suspect on the instant that the keen little ear have be on the alert for more minute than moppet care to acknowledge what be you all come in for be it dinner-time no interrupted pamelum we have not even have breakfast captain yorke have escape in the night -- escape cry moppet the liveliest curiosity in she tone oh i be so glad be not you betty better not let oliver hear you say that say pamelum in a undertone as miss euphemia draw betty aside how do he get out say moppet give way to laughter oh what a ruffle oliver must be in naughty child say pamelum but unable to help smile at moppet 's view of the situation do you happen to hear any noise on the roof or in the big elm last night not a sound say moppet like betty rejoice inwardly that she could reply truthfully for the little maid have never tell a lie in she short life and have indeed spend a wakeful half hour that very morning wonder how she would be able to evade any question that might be put to she do captain yorke climb out of he window and go down the big elm pamelum do you know i thought of that at supper he could not open the window moppet answer pamelum but he do go down the tree from the roof whence he climb from the chimney here moppet you must instantly dress or you will lake cold say miss euphemia interrupt to betty 's relief and i will be glad if betty will assist you for i must go down and see if breakfast be still hot as no one be ready yet to eat it and out go miss euphemia call the other to follow she what do you think of all this ask pamelum of betty what do you suppose flash out betty whose quick tongue have be so long restrain that it be absolute relief to she to speak she mind i be as glad as i can possibly be that captain yorke have escape and if that be disloyal -- finish the spirited little maid mindful of patrick henry -- make the most of it oh betty cry pamelum shocked beyond expression it be i that should be shock not you go on betty do you hold moppet 's dear life as nothing do you not wish to acknowledge a obligation when it be doubly due i be ashamed of you pamela -- you and oliver i would my father be here to make you see both side of a question clearly betty betty implore pamelum burst into tear do i not love we little sister as well as you you do mistake I i do not dare go counterwise to oliver and josiah but indeed i love you for you courage there say no more say betty drop the brush with which she be reduce moppet 's rebellious lock to order and rush into pamelum 's arm with quick repentance i be cross and upset this morning and not fit to talk to you my gentle pamelum so go down and make the coffee and forgive my petulance dolly who have witness this little sisterly passage of arm in shy fright put she hand in pamelum 's and whisper as they gain the staircase : -- dry you eye pamela dear betty be most forward to speak thus to she elder sister there you mistake say pamelum change front with true feminine inconsistency betty be quite right and i be displeased -- yes downright displeased with myself that i do not side with she last night and with unwonted color flush she usually pale cheek pamelum walk into the breakfast-room dolly follow meekly behind she meanwhile oliver and josiah be upon the roof of the mansion conduct most careful investigation they have decide that it be useless to pursue yorke for he might have many hour in advance of they and they must take the chance that he would be recapture by some of putnam 's man especially if he again mistake the country and go west instead of north they climb through the trap-door but as the heavy dew have not yet begin there be no trace of footstep upon the roof beyond a faint mark which might be the spot where the prisoner have drop from the chimney it be quite possible for a agile fellow accustom to use he muscle to clamber down the sloping roof to the elm and escape to the ground by its branch and that he be not hear be partly due to he own care and the unusually heavy slumber of the inmate of the mansion have reach this conclusion oliver be fain to make the best of it and in much chagrin descend to the breakfast-table try as she do to look demure and avoid speak upon the subject which all be discuss betty could not keep she dancing eye in order and before the meal be over she flash so roguish a glance at oliver that irritated at she mute opposition he could not refrain from say : -- there sit betty look fairly pleased because she have she own way and apparently care nothing for the escape of a enemy to she country fie oliver speak up pamelum with unusual fire betty be as loyal as you or i and you be unfair to tax she because she heartily disapprove of you course in regard to captain yorke 's detention after the signal service he have render to all we wolcott pamelum cry oliver good temper return and gaze in comic dismay at he favorite sister much as he would at a dive who have ruffle its plume this from you pamela if betty be allow to demoralize the family in this wise i think it be well my father take you all in hand heyday say a kindly voice from the door of the sitting-room as a fine-looking man dress in the continental uniform enter the room who be it that require my parental hand oliver and why do you so lament my absence father father shriek miss moppet tumble out of she chair and fling she arm around general wolcott 's neck as he stoop down to embrace she oh we be so glad you be come why do not you get here last night because i lay over at general putnam 's headquarters say she father oliver you will find captain seymor and lieutenant hillhouse on the porch see that they horse be take and feed and bid they come to breakfast oliver disappear in haste and josiah with a apology to miss euphemia follow he while general wolcott casting off he hat and glove seat himself with moppet on he knee and miss bidwell appear from the kitchen with fresh reinforcement of breakfast for the newcomer betty busy herself by fetch cup and saucer from the china pantry catch fragment of the conversation and become aware that miss moppet be tell the story of she adventure at great pond in the child 's most dramatic fashion and that miss euphemia be also add she testimony to the tale as it go on they be presently interrupt by the entrance of oliver with he father 's two aid and the large mahogany table be surround by guest whose appetite bid fair to do justice to miss bidwell 's breakfast no sooner

lip and large beseech eye so full of entreaty that he change the word almost upon he lip it be a delicate question my son he say gravely and one i would rather not discuss at the present moment more especially -- and a half-quizzical smile light up he grave but kindly face as he turn toward miss moppet and gently pinch she little ear -- more especially as the gentleman have take the law in he own hand and escape from wolcott manor despite the fact that as it be the residence of a continental officer and the sheriff of litchfield county it might be suppose to have exceptional reason for detain

really believe she have make a stock and a half for moppet -- or be it a pair betty the second pair if you please retorted betty rejoice to see pamelum smile even if at she own expense and miss bidwell say they be every bit as fine as yours they may well be that say pamelum whose pet detestation be the manufacture of woolen stocking -lrb- then consider one of the component part of a girl 's

that knocker say peter provoost the house stand on wall street and to the fact that it like a few other have be build of brick it owe its escape from the fire which ravage the city in 1776 the fire which also destroy old trinity church leave the unsightly ruin stand for some year in what be aristocratic new york of the period it be a square comfortable-looking mansion with the dutch _ stoep _ in front and the half-arch of small-paned glass above the front door which be paint white and bear a massive brass knocker that same knocker be a source of much irritation to peter provoost for although he be of fair size for he thirteen year he could barely reach it when mount on the very tip of he toe and even then never dare touch its shine surface unless he finger be clean -- a desirable state of neatness which alas do not often adorn the luckless peter for though tidy and careful enough when appear before he guardian mr and mr verplanck it must be confess that go to and from school peter be prone to lay down both book and hat oftentimes in the mud and square himself pugnaciously if he chance to meet one of the boy of the vly market who be wont to scoff and tease the broadway boy unmercifully and fierce battle be the frequent outcome of the feeling between the two section and in those peter invariably take part the family be a small one and consist of gulian verplanck and he wife he grandmother mr effingham a lovely old quakeress and peter who have lose both parent at a early age have remain in albany with he other guardian mr abram lanse until some six month before when it be decide that he should go to new york and be under the verplanck eye and although peter have rebel much against the plan in the first place he find himself much happier under clarissa 's gentle rule and positively adore she in consequence the only lion in peter 's path at present be the strong tory proclivity of the head of the house and although he have be warn by he albany friend to be prudent and respectful the boy have inherit a sturdy patriotism which burn all the more hotly for its repression on this cold December afternoon peter stand book in hand and survey that aggravate knocker from he stand on the sidewalk he be painfully conscious that he foot be muddy and he chubby finger certainly need soap and water it be Friday and pompey one of the black servant have evidently be scrub the front step therefore peter debate whether it would be wiser to skirt around the mansion and gain entrance by the area step where no doubt he would encounter dinah the cook -lrb- who object to invasion of unclean shoe -rrb- or boldly ascend the front step struggle with that balefully glitter knocker and trust to pompey 's somewhat dim eye to escape remonstrance before he could gain he own room and make himself presentable the chance of a scolding seem pretty equally balanced to peter and he heave a deep sigh and put he foot on the first immaculate step before he as a hand fall on he shoulder and a merry voice say behind he : -- what in the world be you ponder peter i have watch you since i turn the corner of broadway and truly for once have see you stand absolutely still in some scrape with the vly boy i 'll warrant do you wish I to come in and plead for you and kitty cruger trip lightly up the step as she beckon peter to follow now you have do it -- not i say peter with a mischievous chuckle as he tear up after she do what ask mystified kitty she and peter be fast friend muddy the clean step quoth peter with gleeful brevity have i glance down carelessly until she see each dainty footprint plainly depict on the white marble side by side with peter 's heavier track oh what a shame reach up successfully to the brass knocker but i be sure pompey will forgive I and you can -- stop short as the door open and pompey himself stand bow low in the hall good-day missy say he for kitty cruger be a frequent and welcome visitor at the verplanck ' miss clarissa be pretty well to-day thank you and ole madam be in the drawing-room -- law catch sight of peter who be skillfully slip down the hall in kitty 's wake dat you massa peter reckon you better hurry for it be mo ' time for dinner sah but peter with great discretion pause not for reply as he vanish up a back stair-case and reach he own chamber panting but triumphant good-day dear grandma say kitty cross the hall as pompey hold open the door of the drawing-room i be detain by reason of the sewing-bee at the morrise ' and have barely time to see you and ask for clarissa how do thee do say grandma effingham draw she little drab shawl more closely around she shapely shoulder as she lay down she knitting i be pleased to see thee clarissa be somewhat stronger to-day thee know she have be more like she old self since gulian dispatch the letter ask that one of she sister be allow to come to she the poor child pine for a home face it be natural thee see she have be long absent from she people surely it be almost time to get some reply say kitty as she kiss the dear old quakeress for kitty be one of mr effingham 's grandchild although she mother have be read out of meeting for have marry one of the world 's people i doubt that clarissa will shortly begin to worry and grow ill again unless kind providence send some tiding nay nay say grandma gently if thee have half clarissa 's patience it would be thy gain kitty grandma be such a quaint pretty picture as she sit in she straight-backed chair with she quaker cap and steel-gray silk gown she sleeve elbow-cut display still plump and round arm -lrb- although she be nearly seventy -rrb- and she smooth white finger fly rapidly in and out of the blue yarn as she resume she knitting of peter 's stock peter be rather a godsend to grandma in the matter of stocking no wool that be ever card could resist he vigorous onslaught and it keep grandma busy all she spare moment to supply he restless foot with warm cover patience echo kitty with a comical sigh nay grandma give I a few more year without it fie say grandma gaze at the bright face with she indulgent eye eighteen be full late to begin to learn to conform to thy elder i be marry and the twin be bear at thy age kitty good lack quoth kitty where be the man nowadays grandma save for the redcoat and i be not so daft over sir henry clinton 's gay officer as

uneasy glance toward the door do not talk of rebel in this house have not thee better run up and see clarissa if miss kitty please speak the voice of pompey at the door will she walk upstairs young madam want to see she come say kitty kiss grandma fondly and then follow pompey as he march gravely up to open the door of mr verplanck 's morning-room it be a tiny apartment for when gulian verplanck bring he young bride home he have add a room to the wing below and as it greatly enlarged they bedroom the happy idea have strike he to throw up a partition corner-way which form a irregularly shaped room opening on the passage and give clarissa she own cherish den in that great house of square room and high ceiling in it she have place all she home belongings she spinnet which have be she mother 's -lrb- bring by sloop to new york from new haven -rrb- find the largest space there and she grandmother 's small spinning-wheel be in the corner near the chimney-piece which gulian have contrived to have put in lest he delicate wife might suffer with cold near the small log which blaze brightly on the hearth in a low chair make somewhat easy with cushion sit a fair fragile-looking girlish figure

thoroughly except for a few day spend at lebanon betty have never be from home in she life and be as we have see a bit of a philosopher in she own quaint fashion after the first day spend in mr seymor 's cheerful society she find herself much less homesick than she have expect to begin with the coach be for those time very comfortable it be english-built and have be provide with capacious pocket in unexpected place it amuse betty exceedingly to find that she be seat over the turkey ham cake and even a goodly pat of butter carefully pack in a small stone jar while another compartment hold several change of linen powder a small mirror a rouge pot and some brush mrs seymor have be bear and breed in new york and many of she people be tory therefore she hope to assist the brother who break apart from the other have take up arm for the colonist caesar mr seymor 's coachman be a color man of middle age a slave of she father 's and have be bring from new york to connecticut know the route fairly well they break the journey first at a small roadside tavern where the horse be bait while betty and mr seymor gladly descend and warm themselves well by the kitchen fire take a drink of warm milk for which the good woman who have invite they inside refuse payment she be deeply interested when mr seymor tell she of they errand and follow they out to the door of the coach bring with she own hand the soapstone which she have carefully warm for they foot and she wave a kindly good-by as they ride off delighted at see for the first time in she life a pleasure coach the first night be spend by the traveler in danbury where they proceed to the house of mr seymor 's cousin mr beebe and be most warmly welcome the beebe household which consist of mr beebe and seven child -lrb- captain beebe be with the connecticut ranger -rrb- troop out one and all to meet they to inspect the coach interview caesar and admire the horse billy the second boy fraternize with betty at once and after learn all the mystery of the coach pocket help caesar to unharness and superintend the fetch of a extra large log for the fireplace he roasted chestnut in the ash as they sit around the chimney-piece and tell betty thrilling story of the attack on danbury by the british we drag the feather-bed up to the window say billy and mother stuff a pillow or two in the crack my how the bullet do fly the child be all bid to stay in the attic but as the roof shelf you know it become pretty hot especially when the fire begin and then mother do get frighten more especially when she see the blaze of the woolford house down the street do not i just wish i be a man to go and help father that day luckily for we the wind be in the other direction father say that be all that save we and divine providence my son say mr beebe 's soft voice as she lay a hand on the boy 's shoulder billy 's only experience of war be a sharp one for a few hour he have be longing ever since to join he father but i can only find it in my mother 's heart to rejoice that he be too young to do so now billy light the candle for if we friend must resume they journey to-morrow it be full time to retire betty find the little room assign to she with billy 's assistance but before he leave she he point out two small hole near the window frame where bullet have enter and remain bury in the woodwork and as betty curl herself up in the center of the great feather-bed she think with a throb of she girlish heart that perhaps she too might see some of the terror of war before she return to the shelter of she dear litchfield home the next morning dawn cold and chilly a few flake of snow float through the air and mr beebe urge strongly the wisdom of lie over for twenty-four hour lest a storm should come and render the road impassable but mrs seymor after a consultation with caesar decide that it be best to push on winter be approach and each day make the journey less feasible there be a fairly good road between they and white plain and now that she have start she be impatient to reach the city betty too be eager to be off so with many warm thanks they again pack the coach and say farewell to the hospitable beebe who have insist on add fresh store of provision to they hamper and billy 's last act of friendliness be to slip into betty 's hand a package of taffy of he own manufacture which he assure she be not over-sticky provide you use care in bite it this part of the journey be cold and cheerless enough the road wound somewhat and the settlement be few even the house be far apart from each other and although the hill be fewer they hear caesar admonish he horse more frequently than usual and about four o'clock in the day they come to a full stop the snow of the morning have turn into a sort of drizzling rain and caesar dismounting from he seat announce to he mistress that one of the horse have cast a shoe what shall we do cry mr seymor in dismay prepare to jump down into the mud and investigate matter dey 's no use at all of madam 's gettin ' out say caesar hold the door of the coach -- no use at all i ` se do get de shoe 'cause i see it a-comin ' off a ' here it be de horse will

seymor for she know caesar and caesar 's way and moreover have much confidence in he ability to take care of she as well as of he horse then take the turn to the right as you propose be you quite sure you be familiar with the road here caesar it will be dark soon and i confess i should not like to lose we way not gwine to lose de road wid di chile on de box say caesar with fine disdain as he climb to he seat and roll himself up warmly again he tooth chatter as he do so but he say to himself as the horse start slowly pray de lord i be not mistooken do not want to fall into none ob dem old redcoat ' han 's caesar do not dat 's sartain inside the coach which lumber on so slowly that it almost seem to crawl mr seymor and betty try to keep up they spirit by a occasional remark of cheerful character and betty suggest that perhaps some bread and cheese from the beebe larder would prove satisfactory to caesar but on ask the question caesar only shake he head and respond that he be too busy look after the horse to eat and the long hour drag on as it grow darker and darker betty rest she head against the door and peer out at the drip tree whose bare limb stand like skeleton against the leaden sky mr seymor have sink into a fitful doze by she side suddenly the off horse give a plunge the coach tilted far to one side and then right itself as caesar 's loud whoa dar steady steady be hear then betty see half a dozen shadowy form surround they and a voice say sharply who go there halt and a hand be lay roughly on the door of the coach pray who be you who detain lady on a journey say mr seymor address the man nearest she i be in my own coach with a maid on we way to new york and one of my horse have cast a shoe stand aside there say another voice impatiently as a officer dismount from he horse and fling the rein to one of the man if you be bind to a city occupy by the british you must have safe-conduct madam else we be compel to search and detain you for answer mr seymor draw out a fold paper which the officer strain he eye in the fast-fading daylight read aloud as follow : -- after the expiration of eight day from the date hereof mr seymor and maid have

see she but she travel as my maid i meet lieutenant hillhouse last summer at my father 's house say betty as the young officer come around to she side of the coach and right glad i be to see you now sir instead of the redcoat whom caesar we coachman have be imagine would start from every bush as we near white plain you be not above a mile from a little settlement call ridgefield answer the officer and while there be no tavern there my man and i find fairly comfortable quarter to-day if i may suggest you should get there as soon as may be we would be glad to say mr seymor ruefully but one of my horse have cast a shoe hence we slow progress i be more than glad my servant have not mistake the way madam oughter to know caesar better grumble that worthy from the box how long will it take you to drive the remain mile say he mistress soothingly we may perhaps have you escort lieutenant i be on my return there madam permit I to send my man in advance to arrange for you comfort and i will with pleasure ride beside you until we arrive ridgefield lie beyond that turn raise he whip to direct caesar if it be not for the grow darkness you would see the smoke from the chimney of the house where i be quarter and close the door of the coach the officer give direction to he man who march quickly down the road as he mount and pursue he way with the lady just beyond the farmhouse which lieutenant hillhouse have point out as he temporary quarter stand a low wooden structure with a lean-to in the rear and there caesar draw up he tired horse a rather cross-looking spinster stand in the door of the house and as betty and mr seymor alight she say snappishly : -- i do not own much room as i tell you man mister lieutenant but so long as you be not hessian i be willing to open my door for you it will not be for long will it oh no reply mr seymor with she pretty gracious smile we be simply in need of a night 's lodging i think we have food enough in we hamper and if you can give we hot milk i have coffee ready for make i do not begrudge you nothing say the woman in a softened tone as betty bid she a pleasant good-day but it be a poor place anyhow gaze up at the bare rafter and as i live here all alone i have to be precious careful of my few thing but it so neat and clean say betty pull a three-legged stool toward the fire and survey the recently scrub floor we be cold and weary and you be very good to take we in evidently the woman be amenable to politeness for she bustle around and insist upon make the coffee which caesar produce in due time from he hamper under the box-seat and she lay a cloth on the pine-wood table and at last after disappear for a few minute into the darkness of a small inner room reappear with three silver spoon and two fork in she hand which she lay carefully down beside the pewter plate on the table with a air of pride as she remark address no one in particular : -- the fork be my grandmother 's and my father fetch the spoon from a voyage he make on the spanish main and he always say they be make of real spanish dollar thereupon mr seymor and betty fall to admire the queer-looking article -lrb- which from they workmanship be really worthy of admiration -rrb- and the spinster relax she severe air sufficiently to accept a cup of the coffee they be drink and then mr seymor induce she to give consent that caesar should have a shake-down in a corner of the kitchen and although the bed which betty and the pretty matron have to share be hard it be clean and the pillow soft and they sleep soundly and well amid they rough surroundings and to confess the truth enjoy the novelty of the situation lieutenant hillhouse arouse they early in the morning by a message and as mr seymor be not ready to receive he betty run out and meet he at the door you look so fresh and bright that i be sure you night spend upon the roadside have not harm you say the officer bidding she good-morning i be off at once as i carry a order to general wolcott for quartermaster 's store in litchfield what shall i say to you father for you oh cry betty rejoice at this chance to send word of mouth to she beloved one how truly fortunate tell my father we be well and in good spirit and hope to reach the neutral ground to-night at farthest you may easily do that the storm have pass as you see and if my friend caesar can urge he horse somewhat you be not likely to meet with detention one of my man have assist in shoe the horse and if you can you should start at once the coach and mr seymor appear at this moment simultaneously and the lieutenant insist upon see the lady safely start betty seize the opportunity to ask for news of josiah huntington and be tell of he have render good service and that he gain in popularity daily and oliver -- my brother say betty lean from the coach as they be about to move off : what tiding of he he have not be with I reply hillhouse with some constraint indeed i think he be to be send on some special service give he my best affection say betty and oh sir to my little sister at home pray deliver my fondest love and tear be brim in betty 's eye as caesar flick he whip at the horse ' head and the coach start the road be somewhat better than that already travel the mile which intervene between ridgefield and white plain be more briskly do and caesar have the satisfaction of pull up he horse in good condition before the well-known tavern at the latter place in time for dinner the somewhat pretentious sign hang out over the door have be change to suit the time and the temper of the guest for what have previously read the king 's arm accommodation for man and beast be now the washington inn and beneath it a picture in continental uniform of a man whose rubicund countenance require considerable imagination to transform into a likeness of the commander-in-chief as they happen to be a lack of hostler it take some time to get the horse bait and it be later than mr seymor could have wish when caesar finally make he appearance and inform he mistress that all be ready for they departure the weather have be grow colder steadily and greatly to they surprise the traveler learn that in all probability harlem river be freeze and grave doubt be express by mine host of the inn whether the lady could gain they journey 's end without much discomfort and exposure but mr seymor and betty be both of the opinion that it be inexpedient to linger longer on the road so for the fourth time they climb into the coach and muffle themselves as closely as possible to keep out the cold pursue they onward way five mile eight mile be cover with fair speed and betty 's spirit be rise rapidly at the thought that new york and clarissa be not far away when caesar turn around on he box and bring he horse to a walk say in a awestruck whisper -- ` fore de lord madam i do suspect de redcoat be comin ' d'ye heah 'em from de wood ober dar point with tremble hand in the direction of a sound which ring out on the frosty air at first indistinctly and then resolve itself into a song under the tree in sunny weather just try a cup of ale together and if in tempest or in storm a couple then to make you warm -lrb- 1 -rrb- -- sing a rollicking voice in fairly good time and tune as a group of man come in sight as they near the coach the man in advance troll out in a accent which betray he teutonic origin -- but if the day be very cold then take a mug of twelve month old -lrb- footnote 1 : a topical song then in vogue in new york -lrb- see _ story of the city of new york _ -rrb- -rrb- hello halt there come the command as the singer seize the horse by the bridle and another soldier drag caesar roughly from he seat who be you and whence bind ask my mistress gasp caesar almost convinced that he last hour have come but still have firm faith in mr seymor dun you know how to speak to a lady i have safe-conduct from general washington to enter new york say mr seymor calmly extend she hand with the precious paper toward the first speaker the man take it and gaze stupidly at it evidently be german he could not read it but have turn it upside down and gaze at it for some seconds he give a drunken leer as he peer inside the coach what you get in you hamper blenty cognac eh give we a pottle that be better than mug of ale eh poy and he laugh uproariously i shall give you nothing say mr seymor firmly if you can not read my safe-conduct yourself be there not one of you man who can the hessian be about to make angry reply when a young fellow evidently a englishman shove he way through the man to the coach door stop that jori he say prod the corporal with he elbow give I the paper i can read it but jori who evidently have reach the stage of ugly intoxication do not choose to give it up and stand he ground ve want cognac he shout a ' you come out lady a ' ve 'll find for ourselves vhat you be and seize mr seymor by the arm he attempt to drag she from she seat with some violence the pistol betty cry the plucky little woman as she foot touch the ground but as betty with equally reckless courage draw they only weapon from its hiding-place the young englishman rush at jori with a oath exclaim -- look out you fool -- here come the officer 's patrol and there be a clatter of horse ' foot a swift rush and a voice demand in stern fashion stand back there whose coach be this what do you mean fellow by handle a lady in that manner and geoffrey yorke strike jori a blow with he sheathed sword which nearly sober he on the spot back into the corner of the coach sink betty and as she pull she hood still farther over she face she feel as if every drop of blood she possess be tingle in she cheek as she see geoffrey hat in hand dismount and read general washington 's safe-conduct i deeply regret madam he say with stately courtesy to mr seymor that a corporal 's guard should have cause you such annoyance and i shall see that the fellow who treat you so roughly be properly punish meantime if you intend to enter new york you will be oblige to leave you coach a mile farther on and cross the river on horseback king 's bridge as you may know be fire some month ago by the rebel and the flatboat use for ferry have be abandon on account of the ice it will afford I pleasure to do what i can for you comfort and that of you companion but it be my duty unfortunately to make pass search of you coach will you pardon I if i do so as he speak captain yorke advance to the door and extend he hand to assist the occupant of the vehicle to alight but betty ignore assistance attempt to spring past he to the ground as the willful maiden do so the topknot of she hood catch in a provoke nail of the open door and be violently pull from she head : and as she lovely rosy face almost brush he sleeve geoffrey start back with a low cry -- _ betty _ chapter x a maid 's caprice mistress betty sir come the swift whisper in retort and with so haughty a gesture that geoffrey step back as if he have be strike while betty with a slight inclination of she head pass on to where mr seymor stand with caesar on the other side of the coach but if she expect he to follow she be swiftly make aware of she mistake for geoffrey merely pursue he intention of search the pocket of the coach and when he emerge from it he come hat in hand toward the lady with face more calm and unruffled than betty 's own if you will resume you seat he say address mr seymor without a glance at betty who -lrb- now that she anger bear partly of terror have pass -rrb- steal a quick look at he and as quickly look away i will ride on before you and be wait at the river if it be safe you will cross on horseback if not on foot and i shall take great pleasure in see that you reach king 's bridge inn in safety whereupon he escort mr seymor to the coach and when he turn to assist betty find that she be in the act of climb inside by the other door where caesar stand in attendance what a provoke child it be say geoffrey to himself as he fling into he saddle smile at the recollection of betty 's rebuke and proud little toss of she head ` mistress betty ' very well so be it and thanks to the star of good fortune which guide my step up the road to-day i wonder how she come here and why and captain yorke give he horse the spur as he gallop on some distance behind he the coach lumber forward and mrs seymor 's tongue rattle on gayly so engross be she with be nearly at she journey 's end and they good luck at have fall in with yorke that betty 's silence pass unnoticed to think that we should meet again run betty 's thought ` betty ' forsooth how dare he use my name so freely what would mr seymor have think have she hear he and how could i possibly have explain with any air of truth unless i tell she the whole story -- which i would rather die at once than do he have not change at all i should have know he anywhere even in that hateful scarlet coat which become he so mightily i wonder if my rebuke be too severe -- and here she become conscious of mr seymor again yorke -- do not that handsome young officer say he name be yorke why then he must have some kinship with the earl of hardwicke very probably this young man may be a grandson of the earl i must ask my sister she will have some information about it worse and worse think betty a british officer -- kinsman of a earl -- oh I in what a coil be i enveloped but at least my father know all and he would not hold I disloyal the coach bump and jolt along and finally come to a standstill while caesar 's voice be hear address some one betty look out of the window and behold a dismal prospect enough the bank shelve gradually down to the river which at this point be narrow and between they and the other shore stretch a mixture of snow and ice she could distinguish the flat-bottomed boat use for ferry purpose stick fast almost in the middle of the stream how be we to cross say mr seymor dolefully look down at she foot i wish i have a extra pair of woolen stocking to pull over my shoe the snow and ice will be cold walk what be they do to the horse will it please you to alight madam say geoffrey spring from he saddle at the door of the coach my man be of the opinion that the ice will not bear so much weight as you coach with you lady and caesar in it but if you can mount you horse we can lead they and you can cross in safety meanwhile caesar can remain here to guard you property and when my man fetch the horse back they can assist he to transport the coach to the other side i hope the plan meet you approbation it seem the only feasible one provide you lady can ride without a saddle bless I cry mr seymor i shall surely slip off on the ice betty here be a horsewoman but alas i be not then we must contrive a way reply geoffrey if a blanket be strap over my saddle i think you can sit on it -- caesar put one of those blanket on my horse instead of yours oh that will do nicely how kind you be captain yorke will the young lady be able to ride one of you horse ask geoffrey address mr seymor i can ride anything say betty hastily for my mare be -- and then she bite she lip and color brightly as geoffrey turn toward she you will be quite safe for i shall lead you horse myself let I first attend mr seymor between terror and small gasp of laughter mr seymor 's mount be accomplish and then geoffrey -lrb- artful fellow -rrb- summon a tall good-looking trooper from the patrol and place the rein in mr seymor 's hand give direction to the man you will hold the horse by the bridle and guide every step with care let the lady put she hand on you shoulder to steady herself be watchful of the air-hole i think you know the path well yes captain say the trooper salute respectfully be i to dismount the lady at the inn aye go down the path before I and geoffrey turn toward betty but again the mischievous maid have be too quick for he and he behold she already mount on one of the coach horse where she sit demurely and at ease await he geoffrey seize the bridle and walk slowly down the bank take great care of he own step lest he should by slip cause the horse to stumble and in a few seconds they be slowly pick they way over the rough ice the horse 's hoof crunch into the snow and betty hold she breath and a little thrill go over she as she fancy she hear the ice crack under they oh -- a half-involuntary cry escape she and geoffrey look up reassuringly as he stroke the horse 's neck and check he for a brief second mr seymor and the trooper be somewhat in advance and have almost reach the opposite shore i -- you -- that be -- falter betty meekly drop she eyelid -- oh sir do you really think we shall gain the inn safely there be no cause for fear say geoffrey coldly i know the path and he plod on in silence another few rod a slip a half halt but this time it be yorke who stumble and fall on one knee confound my sword he cry recover he foot but we be nearly there see mr seymor have gain the road and be ride on to the inn no reply from betty in truth if he have but know it she dare not trust she voice lest its first sound should be a sob and yorke divide between amusement and wrath at she perversity vow he would say no more until she grow less capricious the road be well trodden and the snow light as the pair pursue it in silence the famous hostelry know as king 's bridge inn be upon the highway go up the hudson where spuyten duyvil creek run down to harlem river and many a rendezvous and intrigue have be carry on within its low wide room since the colony have declare they independence of british rule as yorke approach the door inside which mr seymor have already disappear a tall dark man in riding-boot and long coat come

water from the pond betty think she should some day like to come out and investigate they with peter they be not very sightly but they might prove interesting these building shut out the view and until betty stand on the very bank she have no idea how brilliant a scene the collect present the ground on the north side between they and broadway rise to the height of a hundred foot and this hillside be cover with spectator who be watch the skater with which the ice be alive among the crowd be many woman of fashion muffle in they fur carry huge muff to keep they finger warm and scarlet

off without assistance peter fly after she in round-eyed amazement i say betty he exclaim breathless with he effort to catch she how you do fly my eye there be not one of these new york dame or maid who can equal you and he chuckle with triumph as betty begin to execute some very difficult motion which she and oliver have often practice together give I you hand peter there now glide this way and take the outside roll -- oh have a care if you turn like that you will surely catch you skate in mine that be better now cross hand and go gently see i be cut a face on the ice surely enough as peter glance behind he see a gigantic profile grow on the smooth surface beneath betty 's little foot and the skater around they pause to wonder and admire there say betty make a final flourish come back to the bank and let we find kitty but as they fly along betty see a familiar red coat appear beside kitty 's advance figure so drop peter 's hand she dash off in a opposite direction she head for the north bank which be less crowded but slack she speed a little fear a air-hole as she debate which way to turn mistress betty say a voice just behind she and with a little start she realize that the obnoxious scarlet coat have reach she side will you skate a turn with I down the pond surely and betty be most roguish smile beam into yorke 's eye as she wheel toward he perhaps you will try a race with I captain yorke with pleasure and for what stake return yorke bend down to secure a strap which he feel loosen i mean but a trial of speed to the bridge there where we cross the minetta water a stake well name it a knot of rose-colored ribbon say yorke softly another cry betty unguardedly and could have promptly bite she tongue for the betrayal of she thought ah then you do remember ask yorke in what have i so deeply offended that i can scarce gain speech of you why do you flout one who long to show you he devotion you forget sir say betty coldly the coat you wear do you fancy that scarlet commend itself to a rebel maid like I or that the cause you represent can be aught but hateful to a loyal wolcott betty betty i do beseech you -- nay we will put entreaty outside the question

be off she graceful and almost like a winged bird as she speed along and he tall straight and muscular with a long staying stroke which impel betty 's admiration the distance to the bridge be a good half mile and the spectator on the hill presently perceive the racing pair and from the cry and shout which arise she learn to she add chagrin that they be see and they trial of speed would be eagerly follow on fly betty so intent upon reach she goal that she never notice how yorke creep closer and closer they be almost to the bridge when he voice sound at she shoulder : -- you should have the race sweetheart but i can not part with the ribbon and with a sudden rush yorke dart past she and gain the bridge barely three seconds in advance forgive I he have time to whisper as betty stand still with flash eye and half-quivering lip while they wait for peter kitty and philip livingston who have follow they down the course 'twa too dear a stake for I to lose but as the word leave he lip to he astonishment and delight with all a child 's frankness betty give he she hand nay you win the race fairly and betty wolcott crave you pardon oh my eye shout peter as he fling himself between they ' t

the day propel the ball along the icy surface of the pond with a long sharp-pointed stick and the race be accord to whoever first catch the ball -- often a trial of both speed and endurance when the course be a long one be you desert I peter put in kitty playfully the other hurly be busy with the de lancey party we must have two or three at least yorke move a step forward he first impulse be to offer he service to kitty as he have do before but some fine instinct warn he not to jeopardize he half-reconciliation with betty and before he could speak philip livingston whistle to a tall slight lad who be stand look at they from the bank close at hand in response the lad run down leap on the ice and say pleasantly -- you pleasure sir do you call I can you drive a ball for I ask philip if so i 'll promise you a shilling for a hour of you time indeed i will say the boy but let I first go tell jim bate there who maybe will be return to paulus hook and i 'll just bid he wait for I over

join they and presently betty find herself dart over the ice hither and thither follow peter 's purposely erratic course and pursue the ball determine this time to outdo yorke who follow she every motion and whom she again begin to tease and laugh at but to yorke anything be better than she scorn or displeasure and when by a lucky stroke and a quick turn of she skate betty bent down and capture the elusive ball he be the first to raise a shout of triumph in which the merry party join with the heartiness of good-fellowship and breed it be grow dark and cold as betty climb up the bank and seat herself on a pile of board while peter unstrapp she skate as she look up she see yorke and philip livingston talk with the boy who have be hurlie for kitty and it cross she mind to wonder where kitty have vanish so she rise to she foot and walk leisurely along with peter toward the tan-yard and turn the corner of the furnace chimney as she do so she almost stumble against a man who draw back

disfigure the site where have stand stately mansion betty deliberate for some minute here be two gown : one must be worn to-night for she dear clarissa the other keep for the de lancey ball a event over which all fashionable new york be agog and which would take place on new year 's night just one week ahead on the high four-posted bed lay the gown one which have be she mother 's be a white satin petticoat over which be wear a slip of indium muslin cover with fine embroidery so daintily work that it be almost like lace itself the dame of connecticut and indeed of all new england be much more sober in they dress than those of new york where the dutch love of color still linger and the tory cling to the powdered head and gay fashion of the english court circle the other gown -lrb- which in she secret soul betty long to wear -rrb- have be give she by gulian who be the most generous of man and who admire he pretty sister-in-law far more than he would have tell she a ship have recently arrive from england bring he a box of gown and gewgaw order long since for he wife and of these gulian have make clarissa happy by bid she bestow on betty a gown such as he consider fitting

fray -- oh how vexing and betty fly to she reticule for needle and thread to set a timely stitch now that will not show when the muslin slip go over another anxious moment and with a sigh of relief betty slip on the short waist with its puffed sleeve and essay to pin the fichu daintily around she neck then she dive down to the very depths of a chest of drawer whence she produce a small box and out of this come a single string of pearl -- the pearl which she mother have worn upon she wedding-day and pamelum have press into she hand at parting next betty with cautious step candle in hand approach the mirror which grace the farther end of she tiny chamber and hold it at arm 's length survey herself as far as she could see which be not below she dainty waist as suit the dimension of the mirror aforesaid i be too white thought betty with a little frown all unconscious of she lovely coloring and exquisite red-gold hair which guiltless of powder be mass as usual on top of she head and cluster in wayward little curl on the nape of she snowy neck and over she white forehead but never mind -- with childlike philosophy -- my gown for the new year ball have both breast and shoulder knot of rose-color i wish i dare steal one for to-night but perhaps clarissa would not be please so i will descend as i be i hear peter clatter on the staircase he be no doubt superintend the servant ' dance and betty extinguish she candle and trip lightly down past clarissa 's door from the sound and light she become aware that she be late and have linger too long over she toilet so she hesitate for a brief moment as she reach the door of the drawing-room where she could see clarissa and grandma effingham standing with a number of guest both dame and gentleman as she pause on the threshold a

justice tell he that betty be right in seize the means at hand to rescue she brother but that do not lessen he irritation at be use for anything which appertain to the whig cause for gulian verplanck be a tory to the backbone educate in england bring up to consider that the divine right of king be a sacred principle he carry he devotion to the tory to such a extent that have he foresee the

annoy she by allude to they political difference of opinion except occasionally when he temper get the better of he which to do he justice be seldom but clarissa 's very love for he render she too

that what he consider almost a crime against the king 's majesty -- permit the escape of a rebel spy -- be so far as betty be concern a meritorious act so kitty promise with the utmost sincerity that not one syllable would she breathe of the matter to she mother or in fact to any human being and hug herself mentally as she think of gulian 's horror if he only know what a personal interest she have in that night 's mad race for freedom clarissa sweet soul have lie down quietly when tell that they horse have nearly run away be badly frighten by the hue and cry of a escape rebel and utter

to be such grasp he hand warmly at parting as he fling himself in he saddle and ride gayly up maiden lane but the best lay plan o ' mouse and man often meet with unsuspected hindrance as both gulian and yorke be destine to discover what special imp prompt betty to sally forth for a walk after dinner thereby miss a call from yorke -lrb- who come thus early to prevent gulian 's intended interview

autumn in connecticut and the maple have put on they most gorgeous robe of red and yellow the weather have be mild for that region up to the middle of October when a sudden light frost have fling its triumphant banner over hill and dale with a glow and glory see to its greatest perfection in new england the morning air be somewhat fresh and miss bidwell hearing moppet 's foot fly along the hall open the door of the sitting-room and call the child you will need you tippet if you be go beyond the orchard and i think perhaps you hood hood echo miss moppet disdainfully shake she yellow curl over she shoulder until they dance almost of themselves i do not need to be muffle up as if i be a little girl miss bidwell you forget i be twelve year old yesterday and she waltz around the room spread she short skirt in a courtesy to miss bidwell 's admiring gaze indeed i be likely to recollect when i myself arrange the twelve candle in you birthday cake to be sure cry moppet with swift repentance and such a excellent rich cake as it be too do you think -- insinuatingly -- that i might have a slice a very tiny slice before i go forth with betty to gather nut in the tracy ' wood no reply miss bidwell laugh you will assuredly be ill if you touch one morsel before dinner run along miss moppet i see you sister wait for you at the gate and moppet with a jump and a skip fly off through the side door and down the path at the end of which stand betty it be a very lovely betty over whom the October sunshine play that morning but to a keenly observant eye a different betty from she who have dance at the de lancey ball now nearly three year past this betty have grow slightly taller and there be a air of quiet dignity about she which suggest pamelum but the beautiful merry eye have deepen in expression and it be if anything a still more attractive face than of old although the fair unconsciousness of childhood have depart and if mischief still lurk in the dimpled cheek that be because betty 's heart could never grow old no matter what life might hold for she of joy or sorrow she would always be to a certain extent a child and well for she that it be so do we not all know a few rare nature whose fascination dwell in this very quality the year have go swiftly for betty shortly after she parting with yorke a opportunity have occur for she return to litchfield and although clarissa lament she departure betty be eager to fly home gulian have do he best to smooth over he ill-judged and ill-tempered effort to arrange she matrimonial affair and one of betty 's minor annoyance be she sister 's evident disappointment at yorke 's rejection only once have she forget herself and flash out upon clarissa peremptorily forbid further discussion and clarissa have be positively aghast at the impetuous little creature who confront she with flash eye and quiver lip and have speedily warn gulian never to broach the subject to betty again peter be betty 's closest friend in those stormy day the urchin have a shrewd perception of how matter stand and many a time have betty hug he for very gratitude when he make a diversion and carry she off to some boyish haunt in the city or to the collect thereby give she opportunity to regain the self-control and spirit necessary to appear as usual for betty be form of gallant stuff no matter if she heart ache to burst for sight of geoffrey if she ear long oh so madly for the sound of he voice she could suffer aye deeply and long but she could also be brave and hide even the appearance of a wound that gulian and even clarissa consider she a heartless coquette trouble she not at all and so betty dance and laugh on to the end of she sojourn in new york it have always be a source of thankfulness to she that she have be able to go home before geoffrey 's return from the expedition to south carolina for she sometimes doubt she own ability to withstand he personal appeal if again exert that he have return and then shortly after go upon another detail she have hear incidentally from oliver during one of she brother 's fly visit to litchfield on he way to new london with dispatch oliver have be greatly touch by yorke 's conduct in the matter of he escape but if he suspect that betty 's lovely face have anything to do with the british officer 's kindly blindness he be too clever to hint as much for which forbearance betty thank he in the depths of she heart the only way in which he show he suspicion be in the occasional bit of news concern yorke with which he favor she at the battle of cowpen yorke have be wound and take prisoner and it fall to oliver wolcott to arrange for he exchange then for the first time be oliver 's surmise change to certainty for one night when he have be attend the prisoner whose wound be nearly heal yorke break silence and in the frankest most manly fashion demand news of he little sweetheart and tell oliver of he hope and fear nothing could have appeal so directly to the brother as yorke 's avowal that betty have refuse he because of the coat he wear and he eye fill as he say boyishly enough egad yorke she have all the wolcott pluck and patriotism though be this vexed question of independence settle i wish with all my heart that you may yet conquer this unwilling maid whom i call sister yorke smile but he do not consider it necessary to add that betty have once let compassion and gratitude get the better of she loyalty in the matter of a prisoner to oliver 's own discomfiture there have be some change in the wolcott home : pamelum have go forth from the mansion a bride after cornwalli have surrender at yorktown and josiah huntington have wear a major 's uniform on he wedding-day betty have scarcely recover from that break in the home circle when sally tracy with many blush and much laughter confess that she too be about to follow pamelum 's example and that a certain mr jame gould the gentleman from branford of whom moppet have be so suspicious be the lucky individual upon whom she intend to bestow she hand verily with all these wedding-bell sound betty begin to feel that she be likely to be leave alone but who only laugh gayly when twit with she fancy for maidenhood and dance as merrily at sally 's wedding as if she heart have lie light in she bosom instead of ache bitterly for one whom she begin to fear she should never see more little do betty guess that bright October morning when she and moppet go forth bent on a nutting excursion that a courier be even now speed on he way whose come would change the tide of she whole existence and when as noon strike oliver wolcott dismount at the door of he home and walk straight to he father 's study deliver a packet from general wolcott to miss euphemia he next move be a descent upon miss bidwell 's parlor and a hasty demand for betty so when moppet and betty appear rosy with success and a fair-sized bag of nut as the result of they joint labor they find the household in a state of suppress excitement and lo the cause be oliver 's approach marriage you see explain oliver when he finally get betty to himself for a walk in the orchard after dinner now that the treaty have be sign in paris the british will soon evacuate new york and when we army enter there will be grand doings to celebrate the event and my father must ride at the head of the connecticut troops on that day i

you know betty since the surrender at yorktown the british have be more insolent and overbearing than ever and yorke be too much a gentleman no matter what he political color to be drag into quarrel which i hear be incessant in the city and the cause of many duel duel cry betty as the color leave she check oh i hope he -- that be -- i hope nobody whom i know have be engage in one not i return oliver with a mischievous glance so you might even be sorry for a foe eh betty but betty go fly up the path and do not deign to reply miss moppet childlike be perfectly overjoyed at the prospect of a wedding in which she be to play a part and fly from she aunt to miss bidwell and betty then back to she aunt again in a twitter of excitement at the combination of a journey and festivity as well

these recall that other journey when she heart have be as light as moppet 's be now but she put all think aside with a resolute heart and finally receive direction from miss euphemia in regard to a chest of winter clothing pack safely away in the garret she conclude to give moppet 's restless hand some occupation and bid the child accompany she upstairs the old garret look familiar enough even

what be you say about a british officer who know betty captain yorke he be aide to sir henry clinton be he will he go off to-day with all the other redcoat he sail away to england some month ago -- i
