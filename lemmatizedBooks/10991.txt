be no incongruity in the idea that in the very earliest period of man 's habitation of this world he make a friend and companion of some sort of aboriginal representative of we modern dog and that in return for its aid in protect he from wilder animal and in guard he sheep and goat he give it a share of he food a corner in he dwelling and grow to trust it and care for it probably the animal be originally little else than a unusually gentle jackal or a ail wolf drive by its companion from the wild maraud pack to seek shelter in alien surroundings one can well conceive the possibility of the partnership beginning in the circumstance of some helpless whelp be bring home by the early hunter to be tend and rear by the woman and child the present-day savage of new guinea and mid-africa do not as a rule take the trouble to tame and train a adult wild animal for he own purpose and primitive man be surely equally indifferent to the questionable advantage of harbour a dangerous guest but a litter of woolly whelp introduce into the home as plaything for the child would grow to regard themselves and be regard as member of the family and it would soon be find that the hunting instinct of the mature animal be of value to he captor the savage master tread the primeval forest in search of food would not fail to recognize the helpfulness of a keener nose and sharper eye even than he own unsullied sens while the dog in he turn would find a better shelter in association with man than if he be hunting on he own account thus mutual benefit would result in some kind of tacit agreement of partnership and through the generation the wild wolf or jackal would gradually become gentler more docile and tractable and the dreaded enemy of the flock develop into the trust guardian of the fold in nearly all part of the world trace of a indigenous dog family be find the only exception be the west indian island madagascar the eastern island of the malayan archipelago new zealand and the polynesian island where there be no sign that any dog wolf or fox have exist as a true aboriginal animal in the ancient oriental land and generally among the early mongolian the dog remain savage and neglect for century prowl in pack gaunt and wolf-like as it prowl to-day through the street and under the wall of every eastern city no attempt be make to allure it into human companionship or to improve it into docility it be not until we come to examine the record of the higher civilisation of assyrium and egypt that we discover any distinct variety of canine form assyrian sculpture depict two such a greyhound and a mastiff the latter describe in the tablet as the chained-up mouth-opening dog that be to say it be use as a watch-dog and several variety be refer to in the cuneiform inscription preserve in the british museum the egyptian monument of about 3000 bc present many form of the domestic dog and there can be no doubt that among the ancient egyptian it be as completely a companion of man as much a favorite in the house and a help in the chase as it be among ourselves at present in the city of cynopolis it be reverence next to the sacred jackal and on the death of a dog the member of the household to which he have belong carefully shave they whole body and religiously abstain from use the food of whatever kind which happen to be in the house at the time among the distinct breed keep in egypt there be a massive wolf-dog a large heavily-built hound with drooping ear and a pointed head at least two variety of greyhound use for hunting the gazelle and a small breed of terrier or turnspit with short crooked leg this last appear to have be regard as a especial household pet for it be admit into the living room and take as a companion for walk out of door it be furnish with a collar of leaf or of leather or precious metal work into the form of leaf and when it die it be embalmed every town throughout egypt have its place of interment for canine mummy the dog be not greatly appreciate in palestine and in both the old and new testament it be commonly speak of with scorn and contempt as a unclean beast even the familiar reference to the sheepdog in the book of job -- _ but now they that be younger than i have I in derision whose father i would have disdain to set with the dog of my flock _ -- be not without a suggestion of contempt and it be significant that the only biblical allusion to the dog as a recognize companion of man occur in the apocryphal book of tobit -lrb- v 16 -rrb- _ so they go forth both and the young man 's dog with they _ the pagan greek and roman have a kindlier feeling for dumb animal than have the jew they hound like they horse be select with discrimination breed with care and hold in high esteem receive pet name and the literature of greece and rome contain many tribute to the courage obedience sagacity and affectionate fidelity of the dog the phoenician too be unquestionably lover of the dog quick to recognize the point of special breed in they colony in carthage during the reign of sardanapalus they have already possess themselves of the assyrian mastiff which they probably export to far-off britain as they be say to have export the water spaniel to ireland and to spain it be a significant circumstance when we come to consider the probable origin of the dog that there be indication of he domestication at such early period by so many people in different part of the world as we have see dog be more or less subjugate and tame by primitive man by the assyrian egyptian phoenician greek and roman as also by the ancient barbaric tribe of the western hemisphere the important question now arise : have all these dog a common origin in a definite parent stock or do they spring from separate and unrelated parent half a century ago it be believe that all the evidence which could be bring to bear upon the problem point to a independent origin of the dog youatt write in 1845 argue that this power of trace back the dog to the very earliest period of history and the fact that he then seem to be as sagacious as faithful and as valuable as at the present day strongly favor the opinion that he be descend from no inferior and comparatively worthless animal and that he be not the progeny of the wolf the jackal or the fox but be originally create somewhat as we now find he the associate and friend of man when youatt write most people believe that the world be only six thousand year old and that species be originally create and absolutely unchangeable lyell 's discovery in geology however overthrow the argument of the earth 's chronology and of the antiquity of man and darwin 's theory of evolution entirely transform the accept belief concern the origin of species and the suppose invariability of animal type the general superficial resemblance between the fox and many of we dog might well excuse the belief in a relationship gamekeeper be often very positive that a cross can be obtain between a dog fox and a terrier bitch but case in which this connection be allege must be accept with extreme caution the late mr a d bartlett who be for year the superintendent of the zoological garden in london study this question with minute care and as a result of experiment and observation he positively affirm that he have never meet with one well-authenticated instance of a hybrid dog and fox mr bartlett 's conclusion be incontestable however much in appearance the suppose dog-fox may resemble the fox there be certain oppose characteristic and structural difference which entirely dismiss the theory of relationship one thing be certain that fox do not breed in confinement except in very rare instance the silver fox of north america be the only species record to have breed in the zoological garden of london the european fox have never be know to breed in captivity then again the fox be not a sociable animal we never hear of fox unite in a pack as do the wolf the jackal and the wild dog apart from other consideration a fox may be distinguish from a dog without be see or touch by its smell no one can produce a dog that have half the odour of reynard and this odour the dog-fox would doubtless possess be its sire a fox-dog or its dam a vixen whatever may be say concern the difference exist between dog and fox will not hold good in reference to dog wolf and jackal the wolf and the jackal be so much alike that the only appreciable distinction be that of size and so closely do they resemble many dog in general appearance structure habit instinct and mental endowment that no difficulty present itself in regard they as be of one stock wolf and jackal can be and have repeatedly be tame domestic dog can become and again and again do become wild even consort with wolf interbreed with they assume they gregarious habit and change the characteristic bark into a dismal wolf-like howl the wolf and the jackal when tame answer to they master 's call wag they tail lick he hand crouch jump round he to be caress and throw themselves on they back in submission when in high spirit they run round in circle or in a figure of eight with they tail between they leg they howl become a business-like bark they smell at the tail of other dog and void they urine sideways and lastly like we domestic favorite however refine and gentlemanly in other respects they can not be break of the habit of roll on carrion or on animal they have kill this last habit of the domestic dog be one of the survive trait of he wild ancestry which like he habit of bury bone or superfluous food and of turn round and round on a carpet as if to make a nest for himself before lie down go far towards connect he in direct relationship with the wolf and the jackal the great multitude of different breed of the dog and the vast difference in they size point and general appearance be fact which make it difficult to believe that they could have have a common ancestry one think of the difference between the mastiff and the japanese spaniel the deerhound and the fashionable pomeranian the st bernard and the miniature black and tan terrier and be perplex in contemplate the possibility of they have descend from a common progenitor yet the disparity be no greater than that between the shire horse and the shetland pony the shorthorn and the kerry cattle or the patagonian and the pygmy and all dog breeder know how easy it be to produce a variety in type and size by study selection in order properly to understand this question it be necessary first to consider the identity of structure in the wolf and the dog this identity of structure may best be study in a comparison of the osseous system or skeleton of the two animal which so closely resemble each other that they transposition would not easily be detect the spine of the dog consist of seven vertebra in the neck thirteen in the back seven in the loin three sacral vertebra and twenty to twenty-two in the tail in both the dog and the wolf there be thirteen pair of rib nine true and four false each have forty-two tooth they both have five front and four hind toe while outwardly the common wolf have so much the appearance of a large bare-boned dog that a popular description of the one would serve for the other nor be they habit different the wolf 's natural voice be a loud howl but when confine with dog he will learn to bark although he be carnivorous he will also eat vegetable and when sickly he will nibble grass in the chase a pack of wolf will divide into party one follow the trail of the quarry the other endeavor to intercept its retreat exercise a considerable amount of strategy a trait which be exhibit by many of we sport dog and terrier when hunting in team a further important point of resemblance between the _ cani lupus _ and the _ cani familiari _ lie in the fact that the period of gestation in both species be sixty-three day there be from three to nine cub in a wolf 's litter and these be blind for twenty-one day they be suckle for two month but at the end of that time they be able to eat half-digested flesh disgorge for they by they dam -- or even they sire we have see that there be no authenticate instance of a hybrid between the dog and the fox this be not the case with the dog and the wolf or the dog and the jackal all of which can interbreed moreover they offspring be fertile pliny be the authority for the statement that the gaul tie they female dog in the wood that they might cross with wolf the eskimo dog be not infrequently cross with the gray arctic wolf which they so much resemble and the indian of america be accustom to cross they half-wild dog with the coyote to impart greater boldness to the breed tame dog live in country inhabit by the jackal often betray the jackal strain in they litter and there be instance of man dwelling in lonely outpost of civilisation be molest by wolf or jackal follow upon the trail of a bitch in season these fact lead one to refer to the familiar circumstance that the native dog of all region approximate closely in size coloration form and habit to the native wolf of those region of this most important circumstance there be far too many instance to allow of its be look upon as a mere coincidence sir john richardson writing in 1829 observe that the resemblance between the north american wolf and the domestic dog of the indian be so great that the size and strength of the wolf seem to be the only difference i have more than once mistake a band of wolf for the dog of a party of indian and the howl of the animal of both species be prolong so exactly in the same key that even the practice ear of the indian fail at time to discriminate between they as the eskimo and indian dog resemble the north american wolf so the dog of the hare indian a very different breed resemble the prairie wolf except in the matter of bark there be no difference whatever between the black wolf-dog of the indian of florida and the wolf of the same country the same phenomenon be see in many kind of european dog the shepherd dog of the plain of hungary be white or reddish-brown have a sharp nose short erect ear shaggy coat and bushy tail and so much resemble a wolf that mr paget who give the description say he have know a hungarian mistake a wolf for one of he own dog many of the dog of russium lapland and finland be comparable with the wolf of those country some of the domestic dog of egypt both at the present day and in the condition of mummy be wolf-like in type and the dog of nubium have the closest relation to a wild species of the same region which be only a form of the common jackal dog it may again be note cross with the jackal as well as with wolf and this be frequently the case in africa as for example in bosjesman where the dog have a marked resemblance to the black-backed jackal which be a south african variety it have be suggest that the one incontrovertible argument against the lupine relationship of the dog be the fact that all domestic dog bark while all wild _ canidae _ express they feeling only by howl but the difficulty here be not so great as it seem since we know that jackal wild dog and wolf pup rear by bitch readily acquire the habit on the other hand domestic dog allow to run wild forget how to bark while there be some which have not yet learn so to express themselves the presence or absence of the habit of bark can not then be regard as a argument in decide the question concern the origin of the dog this stumble block consequently disappear leave we in the position of agree with darwin whose final hypothesis be that it be highly probable that the domestic dog of the world have descend from two good species of wolf -lrb- _ c lupus _ and _ c latran _ -rrb- and from two or three other doubtful species of wolf -- namely the european indian and north african form from at least one or two south american canine species from several race or species of jackal and perhaps from one or more extinct species and that the blood of these in some case mingle together flow in the vein of we domestic breed chapter ii the english mastiff of the many different kind of dog now establish as british not a few have have they origin in other land whence specimen have be import into this country in course of time to be so improve by selection that they have come to be commonly accept as native breed some be protect from the claim that they be indigenous by the fact that they origin be indicate in they name no one would pretend that the st bernard or the newfoundland the spaniel or the dalmatian be of native breed they be alien immigrant whom we have naturalise as we be naturalise the majestic great dane the decorative borzoi the alert schipperke and the frown chow chow which be of such recent introduction that they must still be regard as half-acclimatised foreigner but of the antiquity of the mastiff there can be no doubt he be the oldest of we british dog cultivate in these island for so many century that the only difficulty concern he history be that of trace he descent and discover the period when he be not familiarly know it be possible that the mastiff owe he origin to some remote ancestor of alien strain the assyrian king possess a large dog of decide mastiff type and use it in the hunting of lion it be suppose by many student that the breed be introduce into early britain by the adventurous phoenician trader who in the sixth century bc voyage to the scilly island and cornwall to barter they own commodity in exchange for the useful metal know the requirement of they barbarian customer these early merchant from tyre and sidon be believe to have bring some of the larger _ pugnace _ which would be readily accept by the briton to supplant or improve they courageous but undersized fighting dog in anglo-saxon time every two villein be require to maintain one of these dog for the purpose of reduce the number of wolf and other wild animal this would indicate that the mastiff be recognize as a capable hunting dog but at a later period he hunting instinct be not highly esteemed and he be not regard as a peril to preserved game for in the reign of henry iii the forest law which prohibit the keep of all other breed by unprivileged person permit the mastiff to come within the precinct of a forest impose however the condition that every such dog should have the claw of the fore-foot remove close to the skin the name mastiff be probably apply to any massively build dog it be not easy to trace the true breed amid the various name which it own molossus alan alaunt tie-dog bandog -lrb- or band-dog -rrb- be among the number the name tie-dog and bandog intimate that the mastiff be commonly keep for guard but many be specially train for bait bear import lion and bull there be constant record of the mastiff have be keep and carefully breed for many generation in certain old english family one of the oldest strain of mastiff be that keep by mr legh of lyme hall in cheshire they be large powerful dog and longer in muzzle than those which we be now accustom to see another old and valuable strain be keep by the duke of devonshire at chatsworth it be to these two strain that the dog of the present day trace back mr woolmore 's crown prince be one of the most celebrated of mastiff he be a fawn dog with a dudley nose and light eye and be pale in muzzle and whilst full credit must be give to he for have sire many good mastiff he must be hold responsible for the fault in many specimen of more recent year unfortunately he be indiscriminately breed from with the result that in a very short time breeder find it impossible to find a mastiff unrelated to he it be to be deplore that ever since he era there have be a perceptible diminution in the number of good example of this fine old english breed and that from be a admire and fashionable dog the mastiff have so decline in popularity that few be to be see either at exhibition or in breeder ' kennel at the crystal palace in 1871 there be as many as sixty-three mastiff on show form a line of bench two hundred yard long and not a bad one among they whereas at a dog show hold twenty-five year later where more than twelve hundred dog be enter not a single mastiff be bench the difficulty of obtain dog of unblemished pedigree and superlative type may partly account for this decline and another reason of unpopularity may be that the mastiff require so much attention to keep he in condition that without it he be apt to become indolent and heavy nevertheless the mischief of breed too continuously from one strain such as that of crown prince have to some extent be eradicate and we have have many splendid mastiff since he time special mention should be make of that grand bitch cambrian princess by beau she be purchase by mr willin who mate she with maximilian -lrb- a dog of she own breeding by the emperor -rrb- obtain mint who share with mr sidney turner 's beaufort the reputation of be unapproached for all round merit in any period the follow description of a perfect mastiff

fawn-brindle in any case muzzle ear and nose should be black with black round the orbit and extend upward between they \* \* \* \* \* size be a quality very desirable in this breed the height of many dog of olden day be from thirty-two to thirty-three inch the height should be obtain rather from great depth of body than length of leg a leggy mastiff be very undesirable thirty inch may be take as a fair average height for dog and bitch somewhat less many of mr lukey 's stand 32 inch and over mr green 's monarch be over 33 inch the shah 32 inch and cardinal 32 inch the method of rear a mastiff have much to do with its ultimate size but it be perhaps needless to say that the selection of the breed stock have still more to do with this it be therefore essential to select a dog and bitch of a large strain to obtain large mastiff it be not so necessary that the dog themselves should be so large as that they come from a large strain the weight of a full-grown dog should be anything over 160 lb many have turn over the scale at 180 lb the shah for instance be 182 lb in weight scawfell over 200 lb one of the great difficulty that breeder of mastiff and all other large dog have to contend against be in rear the puppy so many bitch be clumsy and apt to kill the whelp by lie on they it be therefore always better to be provide with one or more foster bitch at about six week old a fairly good opinion may be form as to what the puppy will ultimately turn out in certain respects for although they may change materially during growth the good or bad quality which be manifest at that early age will in all probability be apparent when the puppy have reach maturity it be therefore frequently easier to select the best puppy in the nest than to do so when they be from six to nine or ten month old puppy should be allow all the liberty possible and never be tie up : they should be take out for steady gentle exercise and not permit to get too fat or they become too heavy with detrimental result to they leg many mastiff puppy be very shy and nervous but they will grow out of this if kindly handle and eventually become the best guard and protector it be possible to have the temper of a mastiff should be take into consideration by the breeder they be as a rule possess of the best of temper a savage dog with such power as the mastiff possess be indeed a dangerous creature and therefore some inquiry as to the temper of a stud dog should be make before decide to use he in these dog as in all other it be a question of how they be treat by the person have charge of they the feeding of puppy be a important matter and should be carefully see to by anyone wish to rear they successfully if goat 's milk be procurable it be preferable to cow 's milk the price ask for it be sometimes prohibitory but this difficulty may be surmount in many case by keep a goat or two on the premise many breeder have obtain a goat with the sole object of rear a litter of puppy on she milk and have eventually discard cow 's milk altogether use goat 's milk for household purpose instead as soon as the puppy will lap they should be induce to take arrowroot prepare with milk oatmeal and maizemeal about one quarter of the latter to three quarter of the former make a good food for puppy dog biscuit and the various hound meal soak in good broth may be use with advantage but no dog either large or small can be keep in condition for any length of time without a fair proportion of meat of some kind sheep 's paunch clean and well boil mixed with sweet stale bread previously soak in cold water make a excellent food and can hardly be excel as a staple diet in feed on horseflesh care should be take to ascertain that the horse be not diseased especially if any be give uncooked worm be a constant source of trouble from the earliest day of puppy-hood and no puppy suffering from they will thrive every effort therefore should be make to get rid of they with proper feeding groom exercise and cleanliness any large dog can be keep in good condition without resort to medicine the use of which should be strictly prohibit unless there be real need for it mastiff keep under such condition be far more likely to prove successful stud dog and brood bitch than those to which deleterious drug be constantly be give chapter iii the bulldog the bulldog be know to have be domicile in this country for several century like the mastiff of which it be a smaller form it be a descendant of the alaunt mastive or bandog describe by dr caius who state that the mastyve or bandogge be vaste huge stubborne ougly and eager of a hevy and burthenous body and therefore but of little swiftnesse terrible and frightful to beholde and more fearce and fall than any arcadian curre the first mention of bulldog as the distinctive name of this now national breed occur in a letter write by prestwich eaton from st sebastian to george wellingham in st swithin 's lane london in 1631 or 1632 for a good mastive dogge a case of bottle replenish with the best lickor and pray proceur mee two good bulldogg and let they be send by ye first shipp obviously the name be derive from the dog 's association with the sport of bull-bait the object aim at in that pursuit be that the dog should pin and hold the bull by the muzzle and not leave it the bull be naturally helpless when seize in he most tender part as he lower he head in order to use he horn it be necessary for the dog to keep close to the ground or in the word of the old fancier of the sport to play low larger dog be at a disadvantage in this respect and therefore those of smaller proportion which be quite as suitable for the sport be select the average height of the dog be about 16 inch and the weight be generally about 45 lb whilst the body be broad muscular and compact as be show in scott 's well-known engraving of crib and rosa when bull-baiting be prohibit by law the sportsman of the period turn they attention to dog-fighting and for this pastime the bulldog be specially train the chief centre in london where these exhibition take place be the westminster pit the bear garden at bankside and the old conduit field in bayswater in order to obtain greater quickness of movement many of the bulldog be cross with a terrier although some fancier rely on the pure breed it be record that lord camelford 's bulldog belcher fight one hundred and four battle without once suffer defeat the decline of bull-baiting and dog-fighting after the passing of the bill prohibit these sport be responsible for a lack of interest in perpetuate the breed of bulldog even in 1824 it be say to be degenerate and gentleman who have previously be the chief breeder gradually desert the fancy at one time it be state that wasp child and billy who be of the duke of hamilton 's strain be the only remain bulldog in existence and that upon they decease the bulldog would become extinct -- a prophecy which all bulldog lover happily find incorrect the specimen alive in 1817 as see in print of that period be not so cloddy as those meet with at the present day still the outline of rosa in the engraving of crib and rosa be consider to represent perfection in the shape make and size of the ideal type of bulldog the only objection which have be take be that the bitch be deficient in wrinkle about the head and neck and in substance of bone in the limb the commencement of the dog-show era in 1859 enable class to be provide for bulldog and a fresh incentive to breed they be offer to the dog fancier in certain district of the country notably in london birmingham sheffield manchester and dudley a number of fancier reside and it be to they effort that we be indebted for the varied specimen of the breed that be to be see at the present time in form a judgment of a bulldog the general appearance be of most importance as the various point of the dog should be symmetrical and well balanced no one point be in excess of the other so as to destroy the impression of determination strength and activity which be convey by the typical specimen he body should be thickset rather low in stature but broad powerful and compact the head should be strikingly massive and large in proportion to the dog 's size it can not be too large so long as it be square that be it must not be wider than it be deep the larger the head in circumference cause by the prominent cheek the greater the quantity of muscle to hold the jaw together the head should be of great depth from the occiput to the base of the lower jaw and should not in any way be wedge-shaped dome-shaped or peaked in circumference the skull should measure in front of the ear at least the height of the dog at the shoulder the cheek should be well rounded extend sideways beyond the eye and be well furnished with muscle length of skull -- that be the distance between the eye and the ear -- be very desirable the forehead should be flat and the skin upon it and about the head very loose hanging in large wrinkle the temple or frontal bone should be very prominent broad square and high cause a wide and deep groove know as the stop between the eye and should extend up the middle of the forehead divide the head vertically be traceable at the top of the skull the expression well break up be use where this stop and furrow be well marked and if there be the attendant looseness of skin the animal 's expression be well finish the face when measure from the front of the cheek-bone to the nose should be short and its skin should be deeply and closely wrinkled excessive shortness of face be not natural and can only be obtain by the sacrifice of the chop such shortness of face make the dog appear smaller in head and less formidable than he otherwise would be formerly this shortness of face be artificially obtain by the use of the jack a atrocious form of torture by which a iron instrument be use to force back the face by means of thumbscrew the nose should be rough large broad and black and this color should extend to the lower lip its top should be deeply set back almost between the eye the distance from the inner corner of the eye to the extreme tip of the nose should not be greater than the length from the tip of the nose to the edge of the under lip the nostril should be large and wide with a well-defined straight line visible between they the largeness of nostril which be a very desirable property be possess by few of the recent prize-winner when view in profile the tip of the nose should touch a imaginary line draw from the extremity of the lower jaw to the top of the center of the skull this angle of the nose and face be know as the lay-back and can only properly be ascertain by view the dog from the side the inclination backward of the nose allow a free passage of the air into the nostril whilst the dog be hold he quarry it be apparent that if the mouth do not project beyond the nose the nostril would be flat against the part to which the dog be fix and breathing would then be stop the upper lip call the chop or flew should be thick broad pendant and very deep hanging completely over the lower jaw at the side but only just join the under lip in front yet cover the tooth completely the amount of cushion which a dog may have be dependent upon the thickness of the flew the lip should not be pendulous the upper jaw should be broad massive and square the tusk be wide apart whilst the lower jaw be turn upward should project in front of the upper the tooth should be large and strong and the six small tooth between the tusk should be in a even row the upper jaw can not be too broad between the tusk if the upper and lower jaw be level and the muzzle be not turn upward the dog be say to be down-faced whilst if the underjaw be not undershoot he be say to be froggy a wry-faced dog be one have the lower jaw twist and this deformity so detract from the general appearance of the dog as seriously to handicap he in the show-ring the underjaw project beyond the upper in order to allow the dog when run directly to the front to grasp the bull and when fix to give he a firmer hold the eye see from the front should be situate low down in the skull as far from the ear the nose and each other as possible but quite in front of the forehead so long as they corner be in a straight line at right angle with the stop and in front of the forehead they should be a little above the level of the base of the nasal bone and should be quite round in shape of moderate size neither sunken nor prominent and be as black in color as possible -- almost if not quite black show no white when look directly to the front a good deal of a bulldog 's appearance depend on the quality shape and carriage of he ear they should be small and thin and set high on the head that be the front inner edge of each ear should as view from the front join the outline of the skull at the top corner of such outline so as to place they as wide apart as high and as far from the eye as possible the shape should be that which be know as rose in which the ear fold inward at the back the upper or front edge curving over outwards and backwards show part of the inside of the burr if the ear be place low on the skull they give a applehead appearance to the dog if the ear fall in front hide the interior as be the case with a fox-terrier it be say to button and this type be highly objectionable unfortunately within the last few year the button and semi-tulip ear have be rather prevalent amongst the specimen on the show bench if the ear be carry erect it be know as a tulip ear and this form also be objectionable nevertheless at the beginning of the nineteenth century two out of every three dog possess ear of this description the neck should be moderate in length very thick deep muscular and short but of sufficient length to allow it to be well arched at the back commence at the junction with the skull there should be plenty of loose thick and wrinkled skin about the throat form a dewlap on each side from the lower jaw to the chest the chest should be very wide laterally round prominent and deep make the dog appear very broad and short-legged in front the shoulder should be broad the blade slope considerably from the body they should be deep very powerful and muscular and should be flat at the top and play loosely from the chest the brisket should be capacious round and very deep from the shoulder to the lowest part where it join the chest and be well let down between the fore-leg it should be large in diameter and round behind the fore-leg neither flat-sided nor sinking which it will not do provide that the first and succeed rib be well round the belly should be well tuck up and not pendulous a small narrow waist be greatly admire the desire object in body formation be to obtain great girth at the brisket and the smallest possible around the waist that be the loin should be arched very high when the dog be say to have a good cut-up the back should be short and strong very broad at the shoulder and comparatively narrow at the loin the back should rise behind the shoulder in a graceful curve to the loin the top of which should be higher than the top of the shoulder thence curve again more suddenly to the tail form a arch know as the roach back which be essentially a characteristic of the breed though unfortunately many lead prize-winner of the present day be entirely deficient in this respect some dog dip very considerably some distance behind the shoulder before the upward curve of the spine begin and these be know as swamp-backed other rise in a almost straight line to the root of the tail and be know as stern-high the tail should be set on low jut out rather straight then turn downward the end point horizontally it should be quite round in its whole length smooth and devoid of fringe or coarse hair it should be moderate in length rather short than long thick at the root and taper quickly to a fine point it should have a downward carriage and the dog should not be able to raise it above the level of the backbone the tail should not curve at the end otherwise it be know as ring-tailed the ideal length of tail be about six inch many fancier demand a screw or kinked tail that be one have congenital dislocation at the joint but such appendage be not desirable in the best interest of the breed the fore-leg should be very stout and strong set wide apart thick muscular and short with well-developed muscle in the calf present a rather bow outline but the bone of the leg must be straight large and not bandy or curved they should be rather short in proportion to the hind-leg but not so short as to make the back appear long or detract from the dog 's activity and so cripple he the elbow should be low and stand well away from the rib so as to permit the body to swing between they if this property be absent the dog be say to be on the leg the ankle or pastern should be short straight and strong the fore-foot should be straight and turn very slightly outwards they should be of medium size and moderately round not too long or narrow whilst the toe should be thick compact and well split up make the knuckle prominent and high the hind-leg though of slighter build than the fore-leg should be strong and muscular they should be longer in proportion than the fore-leg in order to elevate the loin the stifle should be round and turn slightly outwards away from the body thus bend the hock inward and the hind-feet outward the hock should be well let down so that the leg be long and muscular from the loin to the point of the hock which make the pastern short but these should not be so short as those of the fore-leg the hind-feet whilst be smaller than the forefoot should be round and compact with the toe well split up and the knuckle prominent the most desirable weight for a bulldog be about 50 lb the coat should be fine in texture short close and smooth silky when stroke from the head towards the tail owe to its closeness but not wiry when stroke in the reverse direction the color should be whole or smut the latter be a whole color with a black mask or muzzle it should be brilliant and pure of its sort the color in order of merit be first whole color and smut viz brindle red white with they variety as whole fawn fallow etc and secondly pie and mixed color opinion differ considerably on the color question one judge will set back a fawn and put forward a pied dog whilst other will do the reverse occasionally one come across specimen have a black-and-tan color which although not mention in the recognize standard as be debar do not as a rule figure in the prize list some of the best specimen which the writer have see have be black-and-tans and a few year ago on the award of a first prize to a bitch of this color a long but non-conclusive argument be hold in the canine press grant that the color be objectionable a dog which score in all other property should not be put down for this point alone see that in the dog-fighting day there be many specimen of this color in action the bulldog should have a peculiarly heavy and constrain gait a rolling or slouch movement appear to walk with short quick step on the tip of he toe he hind-foot not be lift high but appear to skim the ground and run with the right shoulder rather advance similar to the manner of a horse when canter the foregoing minute description of the various show point of a bulldog indicate that he should have the appearance of a thick-set ayrshire or highland bull in stature he should be low to the ground broad and compact the body be carry between and not on the fore-leg he should stand over a great deal of ground and have the appearance of immense power the height of the fore-leg should not exceed the distance from the elbow to the center of the back between the shoulder blade considerable importance be attach to the freedom and activity display by the animal in its movement deform joint or weakness be very objectionable the head should be strikingly massive and carry low the face short the muzzle very broad blunt and inclined upward the body should be short and well-knit the limb stout and muscular the hind-quarter should be very high and strong but rather lightly make in comparison with the heavily-made fore-part it must be acknowledge that there be many strain of this breed which be constitutionally unsound for this reason it be important that the novice should give very careful consideration to he first purchase of a bulldog he should ascertain beyond all doubt not only that he propose purchase be itself sound in wind and limb but that its sire and dam be and have be in similarly healthy condition the dog to be choose should be physically strong and show pronounced muscular development if these requirement be present and the dog be in no sense a contradiction of the good quality of its progenitor but a justification of its pedigree care and good treatment will do the rest it be to be remembered however that a bulldog may be improve by judicious exercise when at exercise or take a walk with he owner the young dog should always be hold by a leash he will invariably pull vigorously against this restraint but such action be beneficial as it tend to develop the muscle of the shoulder and front of the body when take up the bulldog fancy nine out of every ten novice choose to purchase a male the contrary course should be adopt the female be a equally good companion in the house or on the road she be not less affectionate and faithful and when the inevitable desire to attempt to reproduce the species be reach the beginner have the means at once available it be always difficult for the uninitiated to select what be likely to be a good dog from the nest in choose a puppy care should be take to ensure it have plenty of bone in its limb and these should be fairly short and wide the nostril should be large and the face as short as possible the chop should be thick and heavily wrinkled and the mouth square there should be a distinct indent in the upper jaw where the bone will eventually curve whilst the lower jaw should show sign of curvature and protrude slightly in front of the upper jaw the tooth from canine to canine include the six front tooth should be in a straight line see that the ear be very small and thin and the eye set well apart the puppy have these property together with a domed peaked or cocoanut shaped skull be the one which in nine case out of ten will eventually make the best head dog of the litter the breeding of bulldog require unlimited patience as success be very difficult to attain the breeder who can rear five out of every ten puppy bear may be consider fortunate it be frequently find in what appear to be a healthy lot of puppy that some of they begin to whine and whimper towards the end of the first day and in such case the writer 's experience be that there will be a speedy burial it may be that the cause be due to some acidity of the milk but in such a case one would expect that similar difficulty would be experience with the remainder of the litter but this be not the usual result provide that the puppy can be keep alive until the fourth day it may be take that the chance be well in favor of ultimate success -lrb- illustration : mr and mr arthur mayor 's bulldog ch silent duchess -rrb- many breeder object to feed the mother with meat at this time but the writer once have two litter sister who whelp on the same day and he decide to try the effect of a meat _ versus _ farinaceous diet upon they as a result the bitch who be freely feed with raw beef rear a stronger lot of puppy show better develop bone than do the one who be feed on milk and cereal similarly in order that the puppy after wean may develop plenty of bone and muscle it be advisable to feed once a day upon finely mince raw meat there be some successful breeder indeed who invariably give to each puppy a teaspoonful of cod liver oil in the morning and a similar dose of extract of malt in the evening with the result that there be never any rickety or weak dog in the kennel whilst the development of the bone in the skull and limb be most pronounced owe to they lethargic disposition young bulldog be somewhat liable to indigestion and during the period of puppyhood it be of advantage to give they a tablespoonful of lime water once a day in they milk food many novice be in doubt as to the best time to breed from a bull bitch see that oestrum be present before she be fully develop it may be take as practically certain that it be better for she to be allow to breed at she first heat nature have so arrange matter that a bull bitch be not firmly set in she bone until she reach a age of from twelve to eighteen month and therefore she will have less difficulty in give birth to she offspring if she be allow to breed at this time great mortality occur in attempt to breed from maiden bitch exceed three year of age as the writer know to he cost it be desirable in the case of a young bitch have she first litter for she master or mistress to be near she at the time in order to render any necessary assistance but such attention should not be give unless actual necessity arise some bitch with excessive lay-back and shortness of face have at time a difficulty in release the puppy from the membrane in which it be bear and in such a case it be necessary for the owner to open this cover and release the puppy gently shake it about in the box until it cough and begin to breathe the umbilical cord should be sever from the afterbirth about four inch from the puppy and this will dry up and fall away in the course of a couple of day in general it be true economy for the bulldog breeder to provide a foster-mother in readiness for the birth of the expect litter especially be this so in the case of a first litter when the qualification for nursing by the mother be unknown where there be more than five puppy it be also desirable to obtain a foster-mother in order that full nourishment may be give to the litter by both mother the best time of the year for puppy to be bear be in the spring when owe to the approach warm weather they can lead a outdoor life by the time they be six month old they should have sufficient stamen to enable they to withstand the cold of the succeed winter it have be ascertain that bulldog which have be rear out of door be the least liable to suffer from indigestion torpidity of the liver asthma or other chest ailment whilst they invariably have the hardiest constitution bulldog generally require liberal feeding and should have a meal of dry biscuit the first thing in the morning whilst the evening meal should consist of a good stew of butcher 's offal pour over broken biscuit bread or other cereal food in the winter time it be advantageous to soak a tablespoonful of linseed in water overnight and after the pod have open to turn the result jelly into the stew pot this ensure a fine glossy coat and be of value in tone up the intestine care must however be take not to follow this practice to excess in warm weather as the heating nature of the linseed will eventually cause skin trouble with these special point attend to the novice should find no difficulty in successfully become a bulldog fancier owner and breeder in conclusion it can not be too widely know that the bulldog be one of the very few breed which can with perfect safety be trust alone to the mercy of child who naturally in the course of play try the patience and good temper of the firmest friend of man the miniature bulldog fifty or sixty year ago toy -- or rather as a recent edict of the kennel club require they to be dub miniature -- bulldog be common object of the canine country-side in fact you can hardly ever talk for ten minute to any bulldog breeder of old standing without he tell you tall story of the wonderful little bulldog weigh about fifteen or sixteen pound he either know or own in those long-past day prominent among those who make a cult of these bantam be the laceworker of nottingham and many print be extant which bear witness to the excellent little specimen they breed but a wave of unpopularity overwhelm they and they fade across the channel to france where if as be assert we gallic neighbor appreciate they highly they can not be say to have take much care to preserve they best point when in 1898 a small but devoted band of admirer revive they in england they return _ most _ attractive ` tis true but hamper by many undesirable feature such as bat ear froggy face wave tail and a general lack of bulldog character however the toy bulldog club then start take the dog vigorously in hand and thanks to unceasing effort toy bulldog have always since be cater for at a ever increase number of show they weight after much heated discussion and sundry downs and up be finally fix at twenty-two pound and under the original aim of miniature bulldog -- _ ie _ to look like the larger variety see through the wrong end of a telescope -- if not actually achieve be be rapidly approach and can no longer be look upon as merely the hopeless dream of a few enthusiast to enumerate in detail the miniature bulldog scale of point be quite unnecessary as it be simply that of the big one writ small in other word the general appearance of the miniature bulldog must as nearly as possible resemble that of the big bulldog -- a terse sentence which comprise in itself all that can be say on the subject as companion and friend miniature bulldog be faithful fond and even foolish in they devotion as all true friend should be they be absolutely and invariably good-tempered and as a rule sufficiently fond of the luxury of this life -- not to say greedy -- to be easily cajole into obedience remarkably intelligent and care enough for sport to be sympathetically excite at the sight of a rabbit without degenerate into crank on the subject like terrier take a keen interest in all surround people and object without however give way to ceaseless bark enjoy outdoor exercise without require a exhausting amount they be in every way ideal pet and adapt themselves to town and country alike as puppy they be delicate and require constant care and supervision but that only add a keener zest to the attractive task of breed they the more so owe to the fact that as mother they do not shine be very difficult to manage and generally manifest a strong dislike to rear they own offspring in other respects they be quite hardy little dog and -- one great advantage -- they seldom have distemper cold and damp they particularly dislike especially when puppy and the greatest care should be take to keep they thoroughly dry and warm when very young indeed they can stand and be the better for a extraordinary amount of heat the french bulldog -lrb- bouledogue francai -rrb- there appear to be no doubt that the french bulldog originate in england and be a offshoot of the english miniature variety bulldog not the bulldog one see on the bench to-day but of the tulip-eared and short underjawed specimen which be common in london nottingham birmingham and sheffield in the early ` fifty there be at that time a constant emigration of laceworker from nottingham to the coast town of normandy where lace factory be spring into existence and these immigrant frequently take a bulldog with they to the land of they adoption the converse method be also adopt prior to 1902 french bulldog be import into this country with the object of resuscitate the strain of bantam bulldog which in course of year have be allow to dwindle in number and be in danger of become extinct there be superficial similarity between the english and the french toy bulldog the one distinguish characteristic be that in the french variety the ear be higher on the head and be hold erect until a few year ago the two be interbreed but dispute as to they essential difference lead the kennel club to intervene and the type have since be keep rigidly apart the smart little bat-eared bulldog of france receive recognition under the breed name of bouledogue francais chapter iv the st bernard the history of the st bernard dog would not be complete without reference be make to the noble work that he have do in switzerland he native land : how the hospice st bernard keep a considerable number of dog which be train to go over the mountain with small barrel round they neck contain restorative in the event of they come across any poor traveller who have either lose they way or have be overcome by the cold we have be tell that the intelligent animal save many life in this way the subject of they deliverance often be find entirely bury in the snow handsome as the st bernard be with he attractive color and marking he be a cross-bred dog from the record of old writer it be to be gather that to refill the kennel at the hospice which have be render vacant from the combined catastrophe of distemper and the fall of a avalanche which have sweep away nearly all they hound the monk be compel to have recourse to a cross with the newfoundland and the pyrenean sheepdog the latter not unlike the st bernard in size and appearance then again there be no doubt whatever that at some time the bloodhound have be introduce and it be know for a certainty that almost all the most celebrated st bernard in england at the present time be closely ally to the mastiff the result of all this intermixture of different breed have be the production of a exceedingly fine race of dog which form one of the most attractive feature at we dog show and be individually excellent guard and companion as a companion the st bernard can not be surpass when a large dog be require for the purpose most docile in temperament and disposition he be admirably suit as the associate of a lady or a child the st bernard be sensitive to a degree and seldom forget a insult which he resent with dignity specimen of the breed have occasionally be see that be savage but when this be the case ill-treatment of some sort have assuredly be the provoke cause the dog at the hospice of st bernard be small in comparison with those that be see in england belong to the same race the holy father be more particular about they marking than great size the body color should be brindle or orange tawny with white marking the muzzle white with a line run up between the eye and over the skull join at the back the white collar that encircle the neck down to the front of the shoulder the color round the eye and on the ear should be of a darker shade in the red in the center of the white line at the occiput there should be a spot of color these marking be say to represent the steal chasuble and scapular which form part of the vestment worn by the monk but it be seldom that the marking be so clearly define they be more often white with brindle or orange patch on the body with evenly-marked head in england st bernard be either distinctly rough in coat or smooth but the generality of the hospice dog be break in coat have a texture between the two extreme the property however of the rough and smooth be the same so that the two variety be often breed together and as a rule both texture of coat will be the result of the alliance the late m schumacher a great authority on the breed in switzerland aver that dog with very rough coat be find to be of no use for work on the alp as they thick cover become so load with snow and they foot so clog that they succumb under the weight and perish on that account they be discard by the monk in connection with the origin of the st bernard m schumacher write in a letter to mr j c macdona who be the first to introduce the breed into great britain in any number : accord to the tradition of the holy father of the great saint bernard they race descend from the cross of a bitch -lrb- a bulldog species -rrb- of denmark and a mastiff -lrb- shepherd 's dog -rrb- of the pyrenee the descendant of the cross who have inherit from the danish dog its extraordinary size and bodily strength and from the pyrenean mastiff the intelligence the exquisite sense of smell and at the same time the faithfulness and sagacity which characterise they have acquire in the space of five century so glorious a notoriety throughout europe that they well merit the name of a distinct race for themselves from the same authority we learn that it be something like six hundred year since the st bernard come into existence it be not however till competitive exhibition for dog have be for some year establish that the st bernard gain a footing in great britain a few specimen have be import from the hospice before mr cumming macdona -lrb- then the rev cum macdona -rrb- introduce we to the celebrated tell who with other of the breed bring from switzerland form the foundation of he magnificent kennel at west kirby in cheshire albert smith whom some few that be now alive will remember as a amusing lecturer bring a pair from the hospice when return from a visit to the continent and make they take a part in he attractive entertainment but the association of the st bernard with the noble deed record in history be not then so widely known and these two dog pass away without have create any particular enthusiasm later on at a dog show at cremorne hold in 1863 two st bernard be exhibit each of whom rejoice in the name of monk and be respectively the property of the rev a n bate and mr w h stone these dog be exhibit without pedigree but be say to have be breed at the hospice of st bernard three year later at the national show at birmingham a separate class be provide for the saintly breed and mr cumming macdona be first and second with tell and bernard this lead to a immediate popularity of the st bernard but tell be the hero of the show at which he appear and he owner be recognize as be the introducer into this country of the magnificent variety of the canine race that now hold such a prominent position as a show dog the name of tell and bernard have be hand down to fame the former as the progenitor of a long line of rough-coated offspring the latter as one of the founder of the famous shefford kennel keep by mr fred gresham who probably contribute more to the perfecting of the st bernard than any other breeder he birnie monk abbess grosvenor hector and shah be name which appear in the pedigree of most of the best dog of more recent time when mr gresham draw he long record of success to a close there come a lull in the popularity of the breed until dr inman in partnership with mr b walmsley establish a kennel first at barford near bath and then at the priory at bowden in cheshire where they succeed in breed the finest kennel of st bernard that have ever be see in the world dr inman have for several year own good dog and set about the work on scientific principle he in conjunction with mr walmsley purchase the smooth-coated kenilworth from mr loft breed that dog 's produce with a brindle mastiff of high repute and then cross back to he st bernard with the most successful result dr inman be instrumental in form the national st bernard club which be soon well support with member and now have at its disposal a good collection of valuable challenge cup the dog breed at bowden carry all before they in the show ring and be continually in request for stud purpose improve the breed to a remarkable extent at the disposal of messr inman and walmsley 's kennel there be such admirable dog as the rough-coated wolfram -- from whom be breed tannhauser narcissus leonte and klingsor -- the smooth-coated dog the king 's son and the vike the rough-coated bitch judith inman and the smooth viola the last-named the finest specimen of she sex that have probably ever be see these dog and bitch with several other be disperse all over england with the exception of klingsor who go to south africa almost all the best st bernard in great britain at the present time have be breed or be descend from the bowden dog -lrb- illustration : mr george sinclair 's st bernard ch lord montgomery photograph by c reid wishaw -rrb- the follow be the description of the st bernard as

\* during the past twenty-five year st bernard have be breed in this country very much taller and heavier than they be in the day of tell hope moltke monk hector and othman not one of these measure over 32 inch in height or scale over 180 lb but the increase height and greater weight of the more modern production have be obtain by force they as puppy and by fattening they to such a extent that they have be injure in constitution and in many case convert into cripple behind the prizewinning rough-coated st bernard as he be see to-day be a purely manufacture animal handsome in appearance certainly but so cumbersome that he be scarcely able to raise a trot let alone do any tracking in the snow usefulness however be not a consideration with breeder who have rear the dog to meet the exigency of the show ring there be still much leave to be desire and there be room for considerable improvement as only a few of the more modern dog of the breed approach the standard draw up by the club that be interested in they welfare chapter v the newfoundland the dog which take they name from the island of newfoundland appeal to all lover of animal romance and beauty a newfoundland form the subject of perhaps the most popular picture paint by sir edwin landseer a monument be erect by byron over the grave of he newfoundland in proximity to the place where the poet himself hope to be bury at newstead abbey and the inscription on he monument contain the line so frequently quote : but the poor dog in life the firmest friend the first to welcome foremost to defend whose honest heart be

1786 refer to a newfoundland as be a aristocrat among dog doubtless other breed of dog have be the subject of popular picture and have have they praise sing by poet but the newfoundland have yet a further honor unique amongst dog in be the subject for a postage stamp of they native land all these distinction and honor have not be confer without reason for no breed of dog have greater claim to the title of friend of man and it have become famous for its known readiness and ability to save person in danger especially from drown it be strong and courageous in the water and on land a properly train newfoundland be a ideal companion and guard innumerable be the account of newfoundland have prove they devotion to they owner and of the many life save by they in river and sea and when sir edwin landseer select one of the breed as the subject of he picture entitle a distinguished member of the humane society he be justified not only by the sentiment attach to this remarkable race of dog but also by the deed by which newfoundland have make good they claim to such great distinction and the popular recognition of this no doubt in some degree add to the great esteem in which this painting have always be hold the picture be paint in 1838 and as almost everyone know represent a white and black newfoundland the dog portray be typical of the breed and after a lapse of over seventy year the painting have now the add value of enable we to make a comparison with specimen of the breed as it exist to-day such a comparison will show that among the best dog now live be some which might have be the model for this picture it be true that in the interval the white and black newfoundland have be coarser heavier higher on the leg with a expression denote excitability quite foreign to the true breed but these departure from newfoundland character be pass away -- it be to be hope for good the breed be rapidly return to the type which landseer 's picture represent -- a dog of great beauty dignity and benevolence of character showing in its eye a almost human pathos some twenty-five to thirty year ago there be considerable discussion among owner of newfoundland in this country as to the proper color of the true breed and there be many person who claim as some still claim that the black variety be the only true variety and that the white and black coloring indicate a cross-breed again landseer 's picture be of value because in the first place we may be almost certain that he would have select for such a picture a typical dog of the breed and secondly because the picture show nearly half a century prior to the discussion a white and black dog typical in nearly every respect except color of the black newfoundland there be no appearance of cross-breeding in landseer 's dog on the contrary he reveal all the characteristic of a thoroughbred seventy year ago therefore the white and black variety may be fairly consider to have be establish and it be worthy of mention here that idstone quote a article write in 1819 state that back in the eighteenth century newfoundland be large rough-coated liver and white dog it be clear also that in 1832 newfoundland in british north america be of various color additional evidence too be provide in the fact that when select the type of head for they postage stamp the government of newfoundland choose the landseer dog therefore there be very strong argument against the claim that the true variety be essentially black however that may be there be now two established variety the black and the white and black there be also bronze-coloured dog but they be rare and be not favor it be state however that puppy of that color be generally the most promising in all other respects the black variety of the newfoundland be essentially black in color but this do not mean that there may be no other color for most black newfoundland have some white mark and these be not consider objectionable so long as they be limit to white hair on the chest toe or the tip of the tail in fact a white mark on the chest be say to be typical of the true breed any white on the head or body would place the dog in the other than black variety the black color should preferably be of a dull jet appearance which approximate to brown in the other than black class there may be black and tan bronze and white and black the latter predominate and in this color beauty of mark be very important the head should be black with a white muzzle and blaze and the body and leg should be white with large patch of black on the saddle and quarter with possibly other small black spot on the body and leg apart from color the variety should conform to the same standard the head should be broad and massive but in no sense heavy in appearance the muzzle should be short square and clean cut eye rather wide apart deep set dark and small not show any haw ear small with close side carriage cover with fine short hair -lrb- there should be no fringe to the ear -rrb- expression full of intelligence dignity and kindness the body should be long square and massive loin strong and well fill chest deep and broad leg quite straight somewhat short in proportion to the length of the body and powerful with round bone well cover with muscle foot large round and close the tail should be only long enough to reach just below the hock free from kink and never curl over the back the quality of the coat be very important the coat should be very dense with plenty of undercoat the outer coat somewhat harsh and quite straight a curly coat be very objectionable a dog with a good coat may be in the water for a considerable time without get wet on the skin the appearance generally should indicate a dog of great strength and very active for he build and size move freely with the body swing loosely between the leg which give a slight roll in gait this have be compare to a sailor 's roll and be typical of the breed as regard size the newfoundland club standard give 140 lb to 120 lb weight for a dog and 110 lb to 120 lb for a bitch with a average height at the shoulder of 27 inch and 25 inch respectively but it be doubtful whether dog in proper condition do conform to both requirement at any rate the writer be unable to trace any prominent newfoundland which do and it would be safe to assume that for dog of the weight specify the height should be quite 29 inch for dog and 27 inch for bitch a dog weigh 150 lb and measure 29 inch in height at the shoulder would necessarily be long in body to be in proportion and would probably much nearer approach the ideal form of a newfoundland than a taller dog in that respect newfoundland have very much improve during the past quarter of a century twenty-five year ago the most note dog be state as a rule to be well over 30 inch in height but they weight for height would indicate legginess which be a abomination in a newfoundland a 29-inch newfoundland be quite tall enough and even that height should not be gain at the expense of type and symmetry the white and black variety be as a rule slightly taller smaller in loin and longer in head but these difference in the two variety be be rapidly remove and at no distant date the white and black variety will probably be as correct in type and symmetry as the black variety now be for very many year the black variety have be the better in type and in breed if black be desire it will be safer as a general rule to insist upon the absence of white and black blood in any of the immediate ancestor of the sire and dam but if on the contrary white and black dog be require the proper course be to make judicious cross between the black and white and black variety and destroy any black puppy unless they be require for further cross with white and black blood in any case the first cross be likely to produce both black and mis-marked white and black puppy but the latter if breed back to the white and black blood would generally produce well-marked white and black newfoundland in mating never be guide solely by the good point of the dog and bitch it be very desirable that they should both have good point the more good one the better but it be more important to ensure that they be dissimilar in they defect and if possible that in neither case be there a very objectionable defect especially if such defect be also apparent in the animal 's sire or dam -lrb- illustration : mr vale nicola 's newfoundland ch shelton vike photograph by t fall -rrb- it be therefore important to study what be the good and still more so the bad point in the parent and grandparent if you do not know these other newfoundland breeder will willingly give information and any trouble involve in trace the knowledge require will be amply repay in the result and probably save great disappointment when rear puppy give they soft food such as well-boiled rice and milk as soon as they will lap and shortly afterwards scrape lean meat newfoundland puppy require plenty of meat to induce proper growth the puppy should increase in weight at the rate of 3 lb a week and this necessitate plenty of flesh bone and muscle-forming food plenty of meat both raw and cook milk be also good but it require to be strengthen with plasmon or casein the secret of grow full-sized dog with plenty of bone and substance be to get a good start from birth good feeding warm dry quarter and freedom for the puppy to move about and exercise themselves as they wish force exercise may make they go wrong on they leg medicine should not be require except for worm and the puppy should be physic for these soon after they be wean and again when three or four month old or before that if they be not thrive if free from worm newfoundland puppy will be find quite hardy and under proper condition of food and quarter they be easy to rear chapter vi the great dane the origin of the great dane like that of many other variety of dog be so obscure that all research have only result in speculative theory but the undoubted antiquity of this dog be prove by the fact that representative of a breed sufficiently similar to be consider he ancestor be find on some of the oldest egyptian monument a few year ago a controversy arise on the breed 's proper designation when the german claim for it the title deutsche dogge germany have several variety of big dog such as the hatzrude saufanger ulmer dogge and rottweiler metzgerhund but contemporaneously with these there exist as in other country in europe another very big breed but much nobler and more thoroughbred know as the great dane when after the war of 1870 national feeling be pulsate very strongly in the vein of reunited germany the german cynologist be on the lookout for a national dog and for that purpose the great dane be re-christened deutsche dogge and elect as the champion of german dogdom for a long time all these breed have no doubt be indiscriminately cross the great dane be introduce into this country spasmodically some thirty-five year ago when he be commonly refer to as the boarhound or the german mastiff and for a time the breed have to undergo a probationary period in the foreign class at dog show but it soon gain in public favor and in the early ` eighty a great dane club be form and the breed have since become one of the most popular of the larger dog the kennel club have class the great dane amongst the non-sporting dog probably because with we he can not find a quarry worthy of he mettle but for all that he have the instinct and qualification of a sport dog and he have prove himself particularly valuable for hunting big game in hot climate which he stand very well respect the temperament of the great dane and he suitability as a companion writer have go to extreme in praise and condemnation in he favor it must be say that in natural intelligence he be surpass by very few other dog he have a most impose figure and do not like some other big breed slobber from he mouth which be a particularly unpleasant peculiarity when a dog be keep in the house on the other hand it must be admit that with almost the strength of a tiger he combine the excitability of a terrier and no doubt a badly trained great dane be a very dangerous animal it be not sufficient to teach he in the haphazard way which might be successful in get a small dog under control but even as a companion he ought to be train systematically and consider he marked intelligence this be not difficult of accomplishment the great dane attain he full development in about a year and a half to two year and consider that puppy have to build up in that time a very big skeleton and straight limb special attention must be give to the rearing of they the dam whelp frequently eight puppy and sometimes even a few more mr larke 's princess thor have a litter of seventeen but even eight be too great a number for a bitch to suckle in a breed where great size be a desideratum not more than four or at the outside five should be leave with the bitch the other should be put to a foster mother or if they be weakling or foul-marked it be best to destroy they after the puppy be wean they food should be of bone-making quality and they require ample space for exercise and play nothing be worse than to take the youngster for forced march before they bone have become firm before give the description and standard which have be adopt by the great dane club a few remark on some of the lead point will be useful the general characteristic of the great dane be a combination of grace and power and therefore the lightness of the greyhound as well as the heaviness of the mastiff must be avoid the head should be powerful but at the same time show quality by its nice model the eye should be intelligent and vivacious but not have the hard expression of the terrier the distance between the eye be of great importance if too wide apart they give the dog a stupid appearance and if too close he have a treacherous look another very important point be the graceful carriage of the tail when it be curl over the back it make a otherwise handsome dog look mean and a tail that curl at the end like a corkscrew be also very ugly in former time fake be not infrequently resort to to correct a faulty tail carriage but it be easily detect great danes sometimes injure the end of the tail by hit it against a hard substance and those with a good carriage of tail be most liable to this because in excitement they slash it about whereas the faulty position of the tail curl over the back insure immunity from harm until recently british great dane breeder and exhibitor have pay very little attention to color on the principle that like a good horse a good great dane can not be a bad color the english club however have now in this particular also adopt the german standard the orthodox color be brindle fawn blue black and harlequin in the brindle dog the ground color should be any shade from light yellow to dark red-yellow on which the brindle appear in darker stripe the harlequin have on a pure white ground fairly large black patch which must be of irregular shape break up as if they have be tear and not have round outline when brindle great dane be continuously breed together it have be find that they get darker and that the peculiar striping disappear and in that case the introduction of a good fawn into the strain be advisable the constant mating of harlequin have the tendency to make the black patch disappear and the union with a good black great dane will prevent the loss of color the follow be the official description issue by the great dane club : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- the great dane be not so heavy or massive as the mastiff nor should he too nearly approach the greyhound type remarkable in size and very muscular strongly though elegantly build the head and neck should be carry high and the tail in line with the back or slightly upward but not curl over the hind-quarter elegance of outline and grace of form be most essential to a dane size be absolutely necessary but there must be that alertness of expression and briskness of movement without which the dane character be lose he should have a look of dash and daring of be ready to go anywhere and do anything temperament -- the great dane be good-tempered affectionate and faithful to he master not demonstrative with stranger intelligent courageous and always alert he value as a guard be unrivalled he be easily control when well train but he may grow savage if confine too much keep on chain or ill treated height -- the minimum height of a adult dog should be 30 in that of a bitch 28 in weight -- the minimum weight of a adult dog should be 120 lb that of a bitch 100 lb the greater height and weight to be prefer provide that quality and proportion be also combine head -- take altogether the head should give the idea of great length and strength of jaw the muzzle or foreface be broad and the skull proportionately narrow so that the whole head when view from above and in front have the appearance of equal breadth throughout length of head -- the entire length of head vary with the height of the dog 13 in from the tip of the nose to the back of the occiput be a good measurement for a dog of 32 in at the shoulder the length from the end of the nose to the point between the eye should be about equal or preferably of greater length than from this point to the back of the occiput skull -- the skull should be flat rather than domed and have a slight indentation run up the center the occipital peak not prominent there should be a decide rise or brow over the eye but no abrupt stop between they face -- the face should be chisel well and foreface long of equal depth throughout and well fill in below the eye with no appearance of be pinch muscle of the cheek -- the muscle of the cheek should be quite flat with no lumpiness or cheek bump the angle of the jaw-bone well define lip -- the lip should hang quite square in front form a right angle with the upper line of foreface underline -- the underline of the head view in profile run almost in a straight line from the corner of the lip to the corner of the jawbone allow for the fold of the lip but with no loose skin to hang down jaw -- the lower jaw should be about level or at any rate not project more than the sixteenth of a inch nose and nostril -- the bridge of the nose should be very wide with a slight ridge where the cartilage join the bone -lrb- this be quite a characteristic of the breed -rrb- the nostril should be large wide and open give a blunt look to the nose a butterfly or flesh-coloured nose be not object to in harlequin ear -- the ear should be small set high on the skull and carry slightly erect with the tip fall forward neck -- next to the head the neck be one of the chief characteristic it should be long well arched and quite clean and free from loose skin hold well up snakelike in carriage well set in the shoulder and the junction of head and neck well define shoulder -- the shoulder should be muscular but not load and well slope back with the elbow well under the body so that when view in front the dog do not stand too wide fore-leg and foot -- the fore-leg should be perfectly straight with big flat bone the foot large and round the toe well arch and close the nail strong and curved body -- the body be very deep with rib well spring and belly well draw up back and loin -- the back and loin be strong the latter slightly arch as in the greyhound hind-quarter -- the hind-quarter and thigh be extremely muscular give the idea of great strength and gallop power the second thigh be long and well develop as in a greyhound and the hock set low turn neither out nor in tail -- the tail be strong at the root and end in a fine point reach to or just below the hock it should be carry when the dog be in action in a straight line level with the back slightly curved towards the end but should not curl over the back coat -- the hair be short and dense and sleek-looking and in no case should it incline to coarseness gait or action -- the gait should be lithe springy and free the action high the hock should move very freely and the head should be hold well up color -- the color be brindle fawn blue black and harlequin the harlequin should have jet black patch and spot on a pure white ground gray patch be admissible but not desire but fawn or brindle shades be objectionable \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- illustration : mr h horsfall 's great dane ch viola of redgrave photograph by coe norwich -rrb- chapter vii the dalmatian before the kennel club find it necessary to insist upon a precise definition of each breed the dalmatian be know as the coach dog a name appropriately derive from he fondness for follow a carriage for live in and about the stable and for accompany he master 's horse at exercise as a adjunct to the carriage he be peculiarly suitable for in fine weather he will follow between the wheel for long distance without show fatigue keep easy pace with the best horse he appear almost to prefer equine to human companionship and he be as fond of be among horse as the collie be of be in the midst of sheep yet he be of friendly disposition and it must be insist that he be by no means so destitute of intelligence as he be often represent to be on the contrary he be capable of be train into remarkable cleverness as circus proprietor have discover the earliest authority agree that this breed be first introduce from dalmatium and that he be bring into this country purely on account of he sport proclivity of late year however these dog have so far degenerate as to be look upon simply as companion or as exhibition dog for only very occasionally can it be find that any pain have be take to train they systematically for gun-work the first of the variety which appear in the show ring be mr jame fawdry 's captain in 1873 at that period they be look upon as a novelty and though the generosity and influence of a few admirer ensure separate class be provide for the breed at the lead show it do not necessitate the production of such perfect specimen as those which a few year afterwards win prize at the first they be more popular in the north of england than in any other part of great britain it be at kirkby lonsdale that dr jame 's spotted dick be breed and a early exploiter of the breed who make he dog famous be mr newby wilson of lakeside windermere he be indebted to mr hugo droesse of london for the foundation of he stud inasmuch as it be from mr droesse that he purchase ch acrobat and ch berolina at a later date the famed come still and prince iv be secure from the same kennel the latter dog be the progenitor of most of the best liver-spotted specimen that have attain notoriety as prize-winner down to the present day in appearance the dalmatian should be very similar to a pointer except in head and mark still though not so long in muzzle nor so pendulous in lip as a pointer there should be no coarseness or common look about the skull a fault which be much too prevalent then again some judge do not attach sufficient importance to the eyelid or rather sear which should invariably be edge round with black or brown those which be flesh-coloured in this particular should be discard however good they may be in other respects the density and pureness of color in both black and brown be of great importance but should not be permit to outweigh the evenness of the distribution of spot on the body no black patch or even mingle of the spot should meet with favor any more than a ring-tail or a clumsy-looking heavy-shouldered dog should command attention the darker-spotted variety usually prevail in a cross between the two color the offspring very seldom have the liver-coloured marking the uninitiated may be inform that dalmatian puppy be always bear pure white the clearer and whiter they be the better they be likely to be there should not be the shadow of a mark or spot on they when about a fortnight old however they generally develop a dark ridge on the belly and the spot will then begin to show themselves first about the neck and ear and afterwards along the back until at about the sixteenth day the marking be distinct over the body except only the tail which frequently remain white for a few week longer the standard of point as lay down by the lead club be sufficiently explicit to be easily understand and be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- the dalmatian should represent a strong muscular and active dog symmetrical in outline and free from coarseness and lumber capable of great endurance combine with a fair amount of speed head -- the head should be of a fair length the skull flat rather broad between the ear and moderately well define at the temple -- _ ie _ exhibit a moderate amount of stop and not in one straight line from the nose to the occiput bone as require in a bull-terrier it should be entirely free from wrinkle muzzle -- the muzzle should be long and powerful the lip clean fitting the jaw moderately close eye -- the eye should be set moderately well apart and of medium size round bright and sparkling with a intelligent expression they color greatly depend on the marking of the dog in the black spotted variety the eye should be dark -lrb- black or dark brown -rrb- in the liver-spotted variety they should be light -lrb- yellow or light brown -rrb- the rim round the eye in the black-spotted variety should be black in the liver-spotted variety brown -- never flesh-colour in either ear -- the ear should be set on rather high of moderate size rather wide at the base and gradually taper to a round point they should be carry close to the head be thin and fine in texture and always spot -- the more profusely the better nose -- the nose in the black-spotted variety should always be black in the liver-spotted variety always brown neck and shoulder -- the neck should be fairly long nicely arched light and taper and entirely free from throatiness the shoulder should be moderately oblique clean and muscular denote speed body back chest and loin -- the chest should not be too wide but very deep and capacious rib moderately well spring never round like barrel hoop -lrb- which would indicate want of speed -rrb- the back powerful loin strong muscular and slightly arched leg and foot -- the leg and foot be of great importance the fore-leg should be perfectly straight strong and heavy in bone elbow close to the body fore-feet round compact with well-arched toe -lrb- cat-footed -rrb- and round tough elastic pad in the hind-leg the muscle should be clean though well-defined the hock well let down nail -- the nail in the black-spotted variety should be black and white in the liver-spotted variety brown and white tail -- the tail should not be too long strong at the insertion and gradually taper towards the end free from coarseness it should not be insert too low down but carry with a slight curve upward and never curl it should be spot the more profusely the better coat -- the coat should be short hard dense and fine sleek and glossy in appearance but neither woolly nor silky color and marking -- these be most important point the ground color in both variety should be pure white very decide and not intermix the color of the spot of the black-spotted variety should be black the deeper and richer the black the better in the liver-spotted variety they should be brown the spot should not intermingle but be as round and well-defined as possible the more distinct the better in size they should be from that of a sixpence to a florin the spot on head face ear leg tail and extremity to be smaller than those on the body weight -- dog 55 lb bitch 50 lb chapter viii the collie the townsman who know the shepherd 's dog only as he be to be see out of he true element thread he confine way through crowd street where sheep be not can have small appreciation of he wisdom and he sterling worth to know he

they before he in unbroken company to the fold handle the stubborn pack in a narrow lane or hold they in a corner of a field immobile under the spell of he vigilant eye he be at he best as a worker conscious of the responsibility repose in he a marvel of generalship gentle judicious slow to anger quick to action the priceless helpmeet of he master -- the most useful member of all the tribe of dog few dog possess the fertile resourceful brain of the collie he can be train to perform the duty of other breed he make a excellent sport dog and can be teach to do the work of the pointer and the setter as well as that of the water spaniel and the retriever he be clever at hunting have a excellent nose be a good vermin-killer and a most faithful watch guard and companion major richardson who for some year have be successful in training dog to ambulance work on the field of battle have carefully test the ability of various breed in discover wounded soldier and he give to the collie the decide preference it be however as a assistant to the flock-master the farmer the butcher and the drover that the collie take he most appropriate place in every-day life the shepherd on he daily round travel over mile of moorland could not well accomplish he task without he collie 's skilful aid one such dog know what be expect of he can do work which would otherwise require the combined effort of a score of man little be know with certainty of the origin of the collie but he cunning and he outward appearance would seem to indicate a relationship with the wild dog buffon be of opinion that he be the true dog of nature the stock and model of the whole canine species he consider the sheepdog superior in instinct and intelligence to all other breed and that with a character in which education have comparatively little share he be the only animal bear perfectly train for the service of man one of the most perfect work collie in scotland to-day be the old-fashioned black and white type which be the most popular among the shepherd of scotland at the show this type of dog be invariably at the top of the class he be consider the most tractable and be certainly the most agile second to this type in favor be the smooth-coated variety a very hard useful dog well adapt for hill work and usually very fleet of foot he be not so sweet in temper as the black and white and be slow to make friend in the ettrick and yarrow district the smooth be a popular sheepdog the shepherd maintain that he climb the hill more swiftly than the rough and in the heavy snowstorm he clean unfeathered leg do not collect and carry the snow he have a fuller coat than the show specimen usually carry but he have the same type of head eye and ear only not so well develop then there be the scottish bearded or highland collie less popular still with the flock-master a hardy-looking dog in outward style but soft in temperament and many of they make better cattle than sheep dog this dog and the old english sheepdog be much alike in appearance but that the beard be a more racy animal with a head resemble that of the dandie dinmont rather than the square head of the bobtail the strong-limbed bearded collie be capable of get through a good day 's work but be not so steady nor so wise as the old-fashioned black and white or even the smooth coated variety he be a favorite with the butcher and drover who have sometimes a herd of troublesome cattle to handle and he be well suit to rough and rocky ground active in movement and as sure-footed as the wild goat he can endure cold and wet without discomfort and can live on the highland hill when other less sturdy would succumb in the standard adopt for judge the breed many point be give for good leg and foot bone body and coat while head and ear be not of great importance movement size and general appearance have much weight the color be vary in this breed cream-coloured specimen be not uncommon and snow white with orange or black marking may often be see but the popular color be grizzly gray unfortunately the coat of many be far too soft and the undercoat be frequently absent work trial to test the skill of the sheepdog have become frequent fixture among shepherd and farmer within recent year and these competition have do much towards the improvement of the work quality of the collie in general the excel competitor at work trial be the rough-coated black and white collie the smooth-coated variety and the beardie be less frequent winner the handsome and distinguished gentleman of the ch wishaw leader type be seldom see on the trial field although formerly such a dog as ch ormskirk charlie might be successfully enter with other equally well breed from the kennel of that good trainer and fancier mr piggin of long eaton a good working collie however be not always robe in elegance what be desirable be that the shepherd and farmer should fix a standard of point and breed as near as possible to that standard as the keeper of the show collie breed to a acknowledged type of perfection nevertheless from a bad worker of good descent many a efficient worker might be produce by proper mating and those of we skilled in the breeding of collie know the importance of a well-considered process of selection from unsullied strain it be a pity that the hard-working dog of the shepherd do not receive the attention in the way of feeding and groom that be bestow on the ornamental show dog he be too often neglect in these particulars notwithstanding this neglect however the average life of the work dog be longer by a year or two than that of he more beautiful cousin pampering and artificial living be not to be encouraged but on the other hand neglect have the same effect of shorten the span of life and bad feeding and inattention to cleanliness provoke the skin disease which be far too prevalent there be not a more graceful and physically beautiful dog to be see than the show collie of the present period produce from the old working type he be now practically a distinct breed he quality in the field be not often test but he be a much more handsome and attractive animal and he comeliness will always win for he many admiring friend the improvement in he style and appearance have be allege to be due to a admixture with gordon setter blood in the early year of exhibition he show the shorter head heavy ear and much of the black and tan coloring which might seem to justify such a supposition but there be no evidence that the cross be ever purposely seek gradually the color be lighten to sable and a mingling of black white and tan come into favor the shape of the head be also improve these improvement in beauty of form and color have be largely induce by the many collie club now in existence not only in the unite kingdom and america but also in south africa and germany by whom the standard of point have be perfect type have be enhance the head with the small ornamental ear that now prevail be more classical and scientific cultivation and careful selection of typical breed stock have achieve what may be consider the superlative degree of quality without appreciable loss of stamen size or substance twenty year or so ago when collie be become fashionable the rich sable coat with long white mane be in highest request in 1888 ch metchley wonder captivate he admirer by these rich quality he be the first collie for which a very high purchase price be pay mr sam boddington have sell he to mr a h megson of manchester for p530 high price then become frequent mr megson pay as much as p1600 to mr tom stretch for ormskirk emerald no collie have have a longer or more brilliant career than emerald and although he be not esteem as a successful sire yet he be certainly the greatest favorite among we show dog of recent year mr megson have own many other good specimen of the breed both rough and smooth in the same year that he buy metchley wonder he give p350 for a ten-month ' puppy caractacus sable and white be he favorite combination of color a fancy which be share some year ago by the american buyer who would have nothing else black tan and white become more popular in england and while there be now a good market for these in the united state the sable and white remain the favorite of the american buyer and breeder the best collie of modern time be undoubtedly ch squire of tytton which go to america for p1250 a golden sable with quality nice size and profuse coat he have a unbeaten record in this country another of we best and most typical rough collie be ch wishaw leader this beautiful dog who have a most distinguished show career be a well-made black tan and white with a enormous coat and beautiful flow white mane one of the most active mover display quality all through and yet have plenty of substance he have that desirable distinction of type which be so often lack in we long-headed collie ormskirk emerald 's head be of good length and well balanced the skull sufficiently flat he eye be almond-shaped and dark-brown in color he expression keen and wise entirely free from the soft look which we see on many of the face to-day historical example of the show collie have also be see in champion christopher anfield model sappho of tytton parbold piccolo and woodmanstern tartan in recent year the smooth collie have gain in popularity quite as certainly as he more amply attire relative originally he be a dog produce by mate the old-fashioned black and white with the greyhound but the greyhound type which be formerly very marked can scarcely be discern to-day still it be not infrequent that a throw-back be discover in a litter produce perhaps a slate-coloured a pure white or a jet black individual or that a otherwise perfect smooth collie should betray the heavy ear or the eye of a greyhound at one time this breed of dog be much cultivate in scotland but nowadays the breeding of smooth be almost wholly confine to the english side of the border -lrb- illustration : mr r a tait 's collie ch wishaw leader photograph by c reid wishaw -rrb- the follow be the accept description of the perfect collie : -- \* \* \* \* \* the skull should be flat moderately wide between the ear and gradually taper towards the eye there should only be a slight depression at stop the width of skull necessarily depend upon combine length of skull and muzzle and the whole must be consider in connection with the size of the dog the cheek should not be full or prominent the muzzle should be of fair length taper to the nose and must not show weakness or be snipy or lippy whatever the color of the dog may be the nose must be black the tooth should be of good size sound and level very slight unevenness be permissible the jaw -- clean cut and powerful the eye be a very important feature and give expression to the dog they should be of medium size set somewhat obliquely of almond shape and of a brown color except in the case of merle when the eye be frequently -lrb- one or both -rrb- blue and white or china expression full of intelligence with a quick alert look when listen the ear should be small and moderately wide at the base and place not too close together but on the top of the skull and not on the side of the head when in repose they should be usually carry throw back but when on the alert bring forward and carry semi-erect with tip slightly droop in attitude of listen the neck should be muscular powerful and of fair length and somewhat arch the body should be strong with well spring rib chest deep fairly broad behind the shoulder which should be sloped loin very powerful the dog should be straight in front the fore-leg should be straight and muscular neither in nor out at elbow with a fair amount of bone the

or hare foot curly or soft coat cow hock and brush twist or carry right over the back under or overshot mouth chapter ix the old english sheepdog intelligent and picturesque workmanlike and affectionate the old english sheepdog combine in he shaggy person the attribute at once of a drover 's drudge and of a ideal companion although the modern dog be see less often than of old perform he legitimate duty as a shepherd dog there be no ground whatever for suppose that he be a whit less sagacious than the mongrel which have largely supplant he the instinct of the race remain unchanged but the mongrel certainly come cheaper carefully handle in he youth the bob-tail be unequalled as a stock dog and he be equally at home and efficient in charge of sheep of cattle and of new forest pony so deep-rooted be the natural herding instinct of the breed that it be a thousand pity that the modern shepherd so frequently put up with a inferior animal in place of the genuine article nor be it as a shepherd dog alone that the bob-tail shine in the field he qualification as a sport dog be excellent and he make a capital retriever be usually under excellent control generally light-mouthed and take very readily to water he natural inclination to remain at he master 's heel and he exceptional sagacity and quickness of perception will speedily develop he in a sportsman 's hand into a first-rate dog to shoot over these point in he favor should never be lose sight of because he increase popularity on the show bench be apt to mislead many of he admirer into the belief that he be a ornamental rather than a utility dog nothing could be further from the fact nevertheless he have few equal as a house dog be naturally cleanly in he habit affectionate in he disposition a admirable watch and a extraordinarily adaptable companion as to he origin there be considerable conflict of opinion owing to the natural difficulty of trace he back to that period when the dog-fancier as he flourish to-day be all unknown and the voluminous record of a watchful kennel club be still undreamed of from time immemorial a sheepdog of one kind or another have preside over the welfare of flock and herd in every land probably in a age less peaceable than ours this canine guardian be call upon in addition to he other duty to protect he charge from wolf and bear and other marauder in that case it be very possible that the early progenitor of the breed be build upon a larger and more massive scale than be the sheepdog of to-day the herd dog of foreign country such as the calabrian of the pyrenee the himalayan drover 's dog and the russian owtchah be all of they massive and powerful animal far larger and fiercer than we own though each of they and notably the owtchah have many point in common with the english bob-tail it be quite possible that all of they may trace they origin at some remote period to the same ancestral strain indeed it be quite open to argument that the founder of we breed as it exist to-day be import into england at some far-off date when the duty of a sheepdog demand of he fight quality no longer necessary throughout the nineteenth century one find conclusive evidence that the breed be very fairly represent in many part of england notably in suffolk hampshire and dorsetshire and also in wale youatt write of it in 1845 richardson in 1847 and stonehenge in 1859 they description vary a little though the lead characteristic be much the same but each writer specially note the exceptional sagacity of the breed the dog be well know in scotland too under the title of the bearded collie for there be little doubt that this last be merely a variant of the breed he differ in point of fact chiefly by reason of possess a tail the amputation of which be a recognize custom in england with regard to this custom it be say that the drover originate it they dog keep for work purpose be immune from taxation and they adopt this method of distinguish the animal thus exempt it have be argue by disciple of the darwinian theory of inherit effect from continue mutilation that a long process of breed from tailless animal have result in produce puppy naturally bob-tail and it be difficult on any other hypothesis to account for the fact that many puppy be so bear it be certainly a fact that one or two natural bob-tail be frequently find in a litter of which the remainder be duly furnish with well-developed tail from careful consideration of the weight of evidence it seem unlikely that the breed be originally a tailless one but the modern custom undoubtedly accentuate its picturesqueness by bring into special prominence the round shaggy quarter and the characteristic bear-like gait which distinguish the old english sheepdog somewhere about the ` sixty there would appear to have be a revival of interest in the bob-tail 's welfare and attempt be make to bring he into prominence in 1873 he admirer succeed in obtain for he a separate classification at a recognize show and at the curzon hall at birmingham in that year three temerarious competitor appear to undergo the ordeal of expert judgment it be a unpromising beginning for mr m b wynn who officiate find they quality so inferior that he contented himself with award a second prize but from this small beginning important result be to spring and the old english sheepdog have make great stride in popularity since then at clerkenwell in 1905 the entry in he class reach a total of over one hundred and there be no gainsay the quality this satisfactory result be due in no small measure to the initiative of the old english sheepdog club a society found in 1888 with the avowed intention of promote the breeding of the old-fashioned english sheepdog and of give prize at various show hold under kennel club rule the pioneer of this movement so far as history record they name be dr edwardes-ker a enthusiast both in theory and in practice from whose caustic pen dissentient be wont to suffer periodical castigation mr w g weager who have hold office in the club for some twenty year mr mayhew who capably hold she own amongst she fellow-member of the sterner sex mr freeman lloyd who write a interesting pamphlet on the breed in 1889 and messr j thoma and parry thoma theirs can have be no easy task at the outset for it devolve upon they to lay down in a succinct and practical form lead principle for the guidance of future enthusiast it run thus : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- a strong compact-looking dog of great symmetry absolutely free from legginess profusely coat all over very elastic in its gallop but in walk or trot he have a characteristic ambling or pacing movement and he bark should be loud with a peculiar _ pot casse _ ring in it take he all round he be a thick-set muscular able-bodied dog with a most intelligent expression free from all _ poodle _ or _ deerhound _ character skull -- capacious and rather squarely form give plenty of room for brain power the part over the eye should be well arched and the whole well cover with hair jaw -- fairly long strong square and truncate the stop should be define to avoid a deerhound face _ the attention of judge be particularly call to the above property as a long narrow head be a deformity _ eye -- vary accord to the color of the dog but dark or wall eye be to be prefer nose -- always black large and capacious tooth -- strong and large evenly place and level in opposition ear -- small and carry flat to side of head coated moderately leg -- the fore-leg should be dead straight with plenty of bone remove the body to a medium height from the ground without approach legginess well coat all round foot -- small round toe well arched and pad thick and hard tail -- puppy require docking must have a appendage left of one and a half to two inch and the operation perform when not older than four day neck and shoulder -- the neck should be fairly long arched gracefully and well coat with hair the shoulder slope and narrow at the point the dog stand lower at the shoulder than at the loin body -- rather short and very compact rib well spring and brisket deep and capacious the loin should be very stout and gently arch while the hind-quarter should be round and muscular and with well let down hock and the ham densely coat with a thick long jacket in excess of any other part coat -- profuse and of good hard texture not straight but shaggy and free from curl the undercoat should be a waterproof pile when not remove by groom or season color -- any shade of gray grizzle blue or blue-merled with or without white marking or in reverse any shade of brown or sable to be consider distinctly objectionable and not to be encouraged height -- twenty-two inch and upward for dog slightly less for bitch type character and symmetry be of the greatest importance and on no account to be sacrifice to size alone \* \* \* \* \* turn to the question of care and kennel management we may start with the puppy it be obvious that where bone and substance be matter of special desirability it be essential to build up in the infant what be to be expect of the adult for this reason it be a great mistake to allow the dam to bring up too many by herself to about six or seven she can do justice but a healthy bitch not infrequently give birth to a dozen or more under such circumstance the service of a foster-mother be a cheap investment by divide the litter the weakling may be give a fair chance in the struggle for existence otherwise they receive scant consideration from they stronger brethren at three or four day old the tail should be remove as near the rump as possible the operation be easy to perform and if do with a sharp clean instrument there be no danger of after ill effect if the mother be keep on a very liberal diet it will usually be find that she will do all that be necessary for she family 's welfare for the first three week by which time the pup have increase prodigiously in size they be then old enough to learn to lap for themselves a accomplishment which they very speedily acquire begin with fresh cow 's milk for a week they diet may be gradually increase to mellin 's or benger 's food and later to gruel and quaker oats they steadily increase appetite be cater for by the simple exercise of commonsense feed they little and often about five time a day and encourage they to move about as much as possible and see that they never go hungry without allow they to gorge let they play until they tire and sleep until they hunger again and they will be find to thrive and grow with surprising rapidity at six week old they can fend for themselves and shortly afterwards addition may be make to they diet in the shape of paunch carefully clean and cook and spratt 's puppy rodnim a plentiful supply of fresh milk be still essential gradually the number of they meal may be decrease first to four a day and later on to three until at six month old they verge on adolescence and may be place upon the ration of the adult dog two meal a day meanwhile the more fresh air and sunshine exercise and freedom they receive the better will they prosper but care must be take that they be never allow to get wet they sleeping-place especially must be thoroughly dry well ventilate and scrupulously clean as to the adult dog he need be three : he must be well feed well house and well exercise two meal a day suffice he but he like variety and the more he fare can be diversify the better will he do justice to it biscuit rodnim flako meat vegetable paunch and sheep 's head with a occasional big bone to gnaw provide unlimited change and the particular taste of individual should be learn and cater for as to the bob-tail 's kennel there be no need whatever for a high-priced fancy structure any weatherproof building will do provide it be well ventilate and free from draught in very cold weather a bed of clean wheat straw be desirable in summer the bare board be best in all weather cleanliness be a absolute essential and a liberal supply of fresh water should be always available grooming be a important detail in a breed whose picturesqueness depend so largely on the profuseness of they shaggy coat but there be a general tendency to overdo it a good stiff pair of dandy brush give the best result but the coat must not be allow to mat or tangle which they have a tendency to do if not properly attend to mat and tangle if take in time can generally be tease out with the finger and it be the greatest mistake to try and drag they out with comb these last should be use as little as possible and only with the greatest care when necessary at all a over-groomed bob-tail lose half he natural charm far preferable be a muddy matted rough-and-tumble-looking customer with he coat as nature leave it chapter x the chow chow the chow chow be a dog of great versatility he be a bear sportsman and love a open-air life -- a warrior always ready to accept battle but seldom provoke it he have a way of he own with tramp and seldom fail to induce they to continue they travels yet withal he be tender-hearted a friend of child a ideal companion and often have a clever gift for parlor trick in china he fatherland he be esteem for another quality -- he excellence as a substitute for roast mutton though in he own country he be regard as plebeian just a common cur he be by no mean a mongrel that he be of ancient lineage be prove by the fact that he always breed true to type he yield to the pekinese spaniel the claim to be the royal dog of china yet he blood must be of the bluest if you doubt it look at he tongue outwardly the chow worthily embody the kind faithful heart and the brave spirit within he compact body -lrb- weigh 40 lb or more -rrb- with the beautiful fur coat and ruff the plume tail turn over on he back and almost meet he neck-ruff the strong straight leg and neat catlike foot give a impression of symmetry power and alertness he handsome face wear a scowl this be the technical term for the no nonsense look which deter stranger from undue familiarity though to friend he expression be kindness itself though the chow have many perfection the perfect chow have not yet arrive he nearly come with ch chow viii -- long since dead alas -- and with ch fu chow the best chow now live he light color eye be he only defect with many judge however this dog 's black coat handicap he sadly in competition with he red brethren chow viii be consider the best and most typical dog ever bench notwithstanding he somewhat round eye almond eye be of course correct in chinaman ch red craze own the head which be perfect with the correct ear-carriage and broad muzzle and the scowl and characteristic expression of a good chow dark red be the accept color of the chow modern judge will not look twice at a light or parti-coloured dog and it be to be fear that if even ch chow viii could revisit the scene of he bygone triumph he beautiful light marking would prove a fatal bar to he success the judge would be quite wrong but if you want a dog for show you must be sure to get a good whole-coloured dark red if on the other hand you have a chow as a companion and friend do not be at all trouble if he ruff yoke culotte and tail be white or cream-coloured these be natural correct and typical mark though present-day fancier be try to improve they away a list of point as draw up by the chow chow club some year ago be add the point be fairly right but the tongue of a live chow be never black it should be blue such a color as might result from a diet of bilberry \* \* \* \* \* point of the chow chow : head -- skull flat and broad with little stop well fill out under the eye muzzle -- moderate in length and broad from the eye to the point -lrb- not point at the end like a fox -rrb- nose -- black large and wide -lrb- in cream or light-coloured specimen a pink nose be allowable -rrb- tongue -- black eye -- dark and small -lrb- in a blue dog light color be permissible -rrb- ear -- small pointed and carry stiffly erect they should be place well forward over the eye which give the dog the peculiar characteristic expression of the breed -- viz a sort of scowl tooth -- strong and level neck -- strong full set well on the shoulder and slightly arched shoulder -- muscular and sloping chest -- broad and deep back -- short straight and strong loin -- powerful tail -- curl tightly over the back fore-leg -- perfectly straight of moderate length and with great bone hind-leg -- same as fore-leg muscular and with hock well let down foot -- small round and catlike standing well on the toe coat -- abundant dense straight and rather coarse in texture with a soft woolly undercoat color -- whole-coloured black red yellow blue white etc not in patch -lrb- the under part of tail and back of thigh frequently of a lighter color -rrb- general appearance -- a lively compact short couple dog well-knit in frame with tail curl well over the back disqualify point -- drop ear red tongue tail not curl over back white spot on coat and red nose except in yellow or white specimen nb -- smooth chow be govern by the same scale of point except that the coat be smooth \* \* \* \* \* as to the weight bitch scale about 30 lb but dog be heavier ch shylock weigh 47-3\/4 lb and red craze 38 lb chapter xi the poodle the poodle be commonly acknowledge to be the most wisely intelligent of all member of the canine race he be a scholar and a gentleman but in spite of he claim of long descent and he extraordinary natural cleverness he have never be widely popular in this country as the collie and the fox-terrier be popular there be a general belief that he be a fop whose time be largely occupy in personal embellishment and that he require a great deal of individual attention in the matter of he toilet it may be true that to keep he in exhibition order and perfect cleanliness he owner have need to devote more consideration to he than be necessary in the case of many breed but in other respects he give very little trouble and all who be attach to he be consistent in they opinion that there be no dog so intensely interesting and responsive as a companion he quality of mind and he acute power of reasoning be indeed so great that there be something almost human in he attractiveness and he devotion he aptitude in learning be never deny and many be the story tell of he marvellous talent and versatility not merely as a showman 's dog have he distinguish himself he be something more than a mountebank of the booth train to walk the tight rope and stand on he head he be a adept at perform trick but it be he alertness of brain that place he apart from other animal there be the example of the famous munito who in 1818 perplex the parisian by he cleverness with play card and he intricate arithmetical calculation pari be formerly the home of most of the learn poodle and one remember the instance of the poodle of the pont neuf who have the habit of dirty the boot of the passer-by in order that he master -- a shoe-black station half-way across the bridge -- might enjoy the profit of clean they in belgium poodle be systematically train to smuggle valuable lace which be wind round they shaven body and cover with a false skin these dog be school to a dislike of all man in uniform and consequently on they journey between mechlin and the coast they always give a wide berth to the custom officer on the continent poodle of the larger kind be often use for draught work there can be little doubt that the breed originate in germany where it be know as the _ pudel _ and class as the _ cani familiari aquaticus _ in form and coat he would seem to be closely related to the old water-dog and the resemblance between a brown poodle and a irish water spaniel be remarkable the poodle be no longer regard as a sport dog but at one period he be train to retrieve waterfowl and he still on occasion display a eager fondness for the water throughout europe and in the united state -- wherever these dog be keep -- it be usual to clip the coat on the face the leg and the hinder part of the body leave tuft of hair on the thigh and a ring of hair on the pastern the origin and purpose of the custom be not apparent but now that poodle be almost always keep as house dog this mode of ornamentation at least commend itself by reduce the labor of daily groom if the coat be to be maintain in good condition and the dog to be a pleasant associate the profuse and long coat of this dog have the peculiarity that if not keep constantly brush out it twist up into little cord which increase in length as the new hair grow and cling about it the unshed old hair and the new growth entwine together thus become distinct rope-like cord eventually if these cord be not cut short or accidentally tear off they drag along the ground and so prevent the poor animal from move with any degree of comfort or freedom some few owner who admire and cultivate these long cord keep they tie up in bundle on the dog 's back but so unnatural and unsightly a method of burden the animal be not to be commend corded poodle be very showy and from the remarkable appearance of the coat attract a great deal of public attention when exhibit at show but they have lose popularity among most fancier and have become few in number owe to the obvious fact that it be impossible to make pet of they or keep they in the house the reason of this be that the coat must from time to time be oil in order to keep the cord supple and prevent they from snap and of course as they coat can not be brush the only way of keep the dog clean be to wash he which with a cord poodle be a lengthy and laborious process further the coat take hour to dry and unless the newly wash dog be keep in a warm room he be very liable to catch cold the result be that the coat of cord poodle be almost invariably dirty and somewhat smelly at one time it be suggest that corded and non-corded be two distinct breed but it be now generally accept that the coat of every well-bred poodle will if allow develop cord curly poodle on the other hand have advance considerably in favor they coat should be keep regularly brush and comb and if wash occasionally they will always be smart and clean and pleasant companion in the house the four color usually consider correct be black white brown and blue white poodle be consider the most intelligent and it be certain that professional trainer of perform dog prefer the white variety the black come next in the order of intelligence and easily surpass the brown and blue which be somewhat lack in true poodle character no strict line be draw as regard brown and all shades range from cream to dark brown be class as brown mr robert long a few year ago startle she fellow-enthusiast by exhibit some parti-coloured specimen but they be regard as freak and do not become popular the point to be look for in choose a poodle be that he should be a lively active dog with a long fine head a dark oval eye with a bright alert expression short in the back not leggy but by no means low on the ground with a good loin carry he tail well up the coat should be profuse all one color very curly and rather wiry to the touch if you buy a poodle puppy you will find it like other intelligent and active youngster full of mischief the great secret in training he be first to gain he affection with firmness kindness and perseverance you can then teach he almost anything the most lively and excitable dog be usually the easiest to train it be advantageous to teach you dog when you give he he meal of biscuit let he have the food piece by piece as a reward when each trick be duly perform never attempt to teach he two new trick at a time and when instruct he in a new trick let he always go through he old one first make it a invariable rule never to be beat by he if -- as frequently be the case with you dog -- he decline to perform a trick do not pass it over or allow he to substitute another he like better but when you see he obstinately refuse punish he by put away the coveted food for a hour or two if he once see he can tire you out you will have no further authority over he while if you be firm he will not hold out against you long it be a bad plan to make a dog repeat too frequently a trick which he obviously dislike and insistence on you part may do great harm the poodle be exceptionally sensitive and be far more efficiently teach when treat as a sensible be rather than as a mere quadrupedal automaton he will learn twice as quickly if he master can make he understand the reason for perform a task the whip be of little use when a lesson be to be teach as the dog will probably associate he task with a thrashing and go through they in that unwilling cowed tail-between-leg fashion which too often betray the unthinking hastiness of the master and be the chief reason why the poodle have sometimes be regard as a spiritless coward the poodle bitch make a good mother rarely give trouble in whelping and the puppy be not difficult to rear they chief danger be gastritis and congestion of the lung which can be avoid with careful treatment it should be remember that the dense coat of the poodle take a long time to dry after be wet and that if the dog have be out in the rain and get he coat soak or if he have be wash or allow to jump into a pond you must take care not to leave he in a cold place or to lie inactive before he be perfectly dry most poodle be keep in the house or in enclosed kennel well protect from draught and moisture and there be no difficulty in so keep they as they be naturally obedient and easily teach to be clean in the house and to be regular in they habit the coat of a curly poodle should be keep fleecy and free from tangle by be periodically comb and brush the groom keep the skin clean and healthy and frequent wash even for a white dog be not necessary the dog will of course require clipping from time to time in pari at present it be the fashion to clip the greater part of the body and hind-quarter but the english poodle club recommend that the coat be leave on as far down the body as the last rib and it be also customary with we to leave a good deal of coat on the hind-quarter probably the best-known poodle of he day in this country be ch the model a black cord dog belong to mr h a dagoi who import he from the continent model be a medium-sized dog very well proportioned and with a beautifully moulded head and dark expressive eye and i believe be only once beat in the show ring he die some few year ago at a ripe old age but a great many of the best-known poodle of the present day claim relationship to he one of he most famous descendant be ch the joker also black cord who be very successful at exhibition another very handsome dog be ch vladimir again a black cord belong to miss haulgrave since 1905 the curly poodle have very much improve and the best specimen of the breed be now to be find in they rank ch orchard admiral the property of mr crouch a son of ch the joker and lady godiva be probably the best specimen living white poodle of which mr crouch 's orchard white boy be a notable specimen ought to be more widely keep than they be but it must be admit that the task of keep a full-sized white poodle 's coat clean in a town be no light one toy white poodle consequently be very popular the toy variety should not exceed fifteen inch in height at the shoulder and in all respects should be a miniature of the full-sized dog with the same point \* \* \* \* \* point of the perfect poodle : general appearance -- that of a very active intelligent and elegant-looking dog well build and carry himself very proudly head -- long straight and fine the skull not broad with a slight peak at the back muzzle -- long -lrb- but not snipy -rrb- and strong -- not full in cheek

white all red all blue the white poodle should have dark eye black or very dark liver nose lip and toe-nail the red poodle should have dark amber eye dark liver nose lip and toe-nail the blue poodle should be of even color and have dark eye lip and toe-nail all the other point of white red and blue poodle should be the same as the perfect black poodle nb -- it be strongly recommend that only one-third of the body be clip or shave and that the hair on the forehead be leave on chapter xii the schipperke the schipperke may fitly be describe as the paul pry of canine society he insatiate inquisitiveness induce he to poke he nose into everything every strange object excite he curiosity and he will if possible look behind it the slightest noise arouse he attention and he want to investigate its cause there be no end to he liveliness but he move about with almost catlike agility without upset any object in a room and when he hop he have a curious way of catch up he hind leg the schipperke 's disposition be most affectionate tinge with a good deal of jealousy and even when make one of the household he generally attach himself more particularly to one person whom he own and whose protection he deem he special duty these quality endear the schipperke as a canine companion with a quaint and lovable character and he be also a capital vermin dog when properly enter he can not be surpass as a ratter schipperke have always be keep as watch-dog on the flemish canal barge and that no doubt be the origin of the name which be the flemish for little skipper the syllable ke form the diminutive of schipper the respectable antiquity of this dog be prove by the result of the research mr van der snickt and mr van buggenhoudt make in the archive of flemish town which contain record of the breed go back in pure type over a hundred year the first schipperke which appear at a show in this country be mr berrie 's flo this be however such a mediocre specimen that it do not appeal to the taste of the english dog-loving public in 1888 dr seelig bring over skip drieske and mium the first-named be purchase by mr e b joachim and the two other by mr g r krehl later on mr joachim become the owner of mr green 's shtoot and buy fritz of spa in belgium and these dog form the nucleus of the two kennel which lay the foundation of the breed in england it be probably the introduction of the schipperke to england that induce belgian owner to pay greater attention to careful breeding and a club be start in 1888 in brussels whose member after long and earnest consideration settle a description and standard of point for the breed not long afterwards the schipperke club -lrb- england -rrb- be inaugurate and draw up the follow standard of point which be adopt in December 1890 and differ only very slightly from the one acknowledge by the belgian society and later by the st hubert schipperke club \* \* \* \* \* standard of point of the schipperke club england : head -- foxy in type skull should not be round but broad and with little stop the muzzle should be moderate in length fine but not weak should be well fill out under the eye nose -- black and small eye -- dark brown small more oval than round and not full bright and full of expression ear -- shape : of moderate length not too broad at the base taper to a point carriage : stiffly erect

of the schipperke be describe as straight but it should round off at the rump which should be rotund and full guinea-pig-like the continued straight line of a terrier 's back be not desirable but it will frequently be find in specimen that have be dock the belgian standard require the leg to be fine and not have much bone the bone of a terrier be only meet with in coarse schipperke as to size it need only be note that the maximum of the small size viz 12 lb be that generally prefer in england as well as in belgium further it be only necessary to remark that the schipperke be a dog of quality of distinct characteristic cobby in appearance not long in the back nor high on the leg the muzzle must not be weak and thin nor short and blunt and finally he be not a prick-eared black wire-haired terrier the schipperke 's tail or rather its absence have be the cause of much discussion and at one time give rise to considerable acrimonious feeling amongst fancier on the introduction of this dog into great britain it arrive from abroad with the reputation of be a tailless breed but whether belgian owner accidentally convey that impression or do it purposely to give the breed a additional distinction be difficult to say anyhow the schipperke be no more tailless than the old english sheepdog that be to say a larger number of individual be bear without any caudal appendage or only a stump of a tail than in any other variety of dog it be say that a dock dog can be tell from one that have be bear tailless in this way when the dock animal be please a slight movement at the end of the spine where the tail be cut off be discernible but the naturally tailless dog sway the whole of its hind-quarters chapter xiii the bloodhound the bloodhound be much use in olden time in hunting and in the pursuit of fugitive two service for which he remarkable acuteness of smell he ability to keep to the particular scent on which he be first lay and the intelligence and pertinacity with which he follow up the trail admirably fit he the use and employment of these dog date back into remote antiquity we have it on the authority of strabo that they be use against the gaul and we have certain knowledge that they be employ not only in the frequent feud of the scottish clan and in the continuous border foray of those day but also during the ever-recurring hostility between england and scotland indeed the very name of the dog call up vision of feudal castle with they train of knight and warrior and all the stir panorama of these brave day of old when the only tenure of life property or goods be by the strong hand this feudal dog be frequently picture by the poet in he ballad and romance and in the lady of the lake we find the breed again mention as -- dog of black st hubert 's breed unmatched for courage breath and speed these famous black bloodhound call st hubert be suppose to have be bring by pilgrim from the holy land another larger breed also know by the same name be pure white and another kind be greyish-red the dog of the present day be probably a blend of all these variety -lrb- illustration : bloodhound ch chatley beaufort by ch chatley blazer -- chatley frivol breed and own by mr g a oliphant shrewton wilt -rrb- the bloodhound from the nobler pursuit of hero and knight come in later year to perform the work of the more modern detective but in this also he service be in time supersede by the justice 's warrant and the police officer we find it record about 1805 however that the thrapston association for the prevention of felon in northamptonshire have provide and train a bloodhound for the detection of sheep-stealer the reputation it obtain for sagacity and fierceness in the capture of runaway slave and the cruelty attribute to it in connection with the suppression of the various negro rising especially that of the maroon have give the animal a evil repute which more probably should attach to those who make the animal 's courage and sagacity a means for the gratification of they own revolting cruelty of disposition it have be justly remark that if entire credence be give to the description that be transmit through the country of this extraordinary animal it might be suppose that the spaniard have obtain the ancient and genuine breed of cerberus himself come again to this country we find the bloodhound use from time to time in pursuit of poacher and criminal and in many instance the game recover and the man arrest there be no doubt that the police in country district and at we convict prison could use bloodhound to advantage but public sentiment be decidedly against the idea and although one of he majesty 's prison have be offer a work hound for nothing the authority have refuse to consider the question or give the hound a trial half a century ago the bloodhound be so little esteemed in this country that the breed be confine to the kennel of a very few owner but the institution of dog show induce these owner to bring they hound into public exhibition when it be see that like the mastiff the bloodhound claim the advantage of have many venerable ancestral tree to branch from at the first birmingham show in 1860 lord bagot bring out a team from a strain which have be in he lordship 's family for two century and at the same exhibition there be enter probably one of the best bloodhound ever see in mr t a jenning 's druid know now as old druid this dog be get by lord faversham 's raglan out of baron rothschild 's historic bitch fury and he blood go down in collateral vein through mr l g morrel 's margrave prince albert solm 's druid and mr edwin brough 's napier into the pedigree of many of the celebrated hound of the present day another famous druid -- grandsire of colonel cowen 's hound of the name -- be own by the hon grantley berkeley this typical dog be unsurpassed in he time and he talent in follow a line of scent be astonishing he only blemish be one of character for although usually as good-tempered as most of the breed be he be easily arouse to uncontrollable fit of savage anger queen victorium at various time be the possessor of one or more fine specimen of the bloodhound procure for she by sir edwin landseer and a capital hound from the home park kennel at windsor be exhibit at the london show in 1869 the judge on the occasion be the rev thoma pearce afterwards know as idstone landseer be especially fond of paint the majestic bloodhound and he usually select good model for he study the model for the hound in he well-known picture dignity and impudence be grafton who be a collateral relative of captain j w clayton 's celebrated luath xi four superlative bloodhound of the past stand out in unmistakable eminence as the founder of recognize strain they be mr jenning 's old druid colonel cowen 's druid mr reynold ray 's roswell and captain clayton 's luath xi and the owner of a bloodhound which can be trace back in direct line of descent to any one of these four patriarch may pride himself upon possess a dog of unimpeachable pedigree among breeder within recent year mr edwin brough of scarborough be to be regard as the most experienced and successful no record of the breed would be complete without some acknowledgment of the great service he have render to it bloodhound of the correct type would to-day have be very few and far between if it have not be for he enthusiasm and patient breeding mr brough breed and produce many hound which all bear the stamp of he ideal and there be no doubt that for all-round quality he kennel stand first in the history of the bloodhound he most successful cross be perhaps beckford and bianca and one have only to mention such hound as burgundy babbo benedicta and bardolph to recall the finest team of bloodhound that have ever be bench mr g a oliphant of shrewton wilt whose kennel include chatley blazer and chatley beaufort have of late year be a keen supporter of the breed mr oliphant who be the president of the lady ' branch of the kennel club be a great believer in hound be worker first and show hound second and she large kennel have produce many hound of a robust type and of good size and quality there be no doubt that as far as hunting be concern at the present moment this kennel stand easily first but admirable bloodhound have also give distinction to the kennel of mr s h mangin dr sidney turner mr mark beaufoy mr f w cousen mr a o mudie lord decy mr hood wright mr a croxton smith dr c c garfit dr semmence and mr c ashton cross to mention only a few owner and breeder who have give attention to this noble race of dog the description of a perfect type of dog as define by the association of bloodhound breeder be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* general character -- the bloodhound possess in a most marked degree every point and characteristic of those dog which hunt together by scent -lrb- _ sagace _ -rrb- he be very powerful and stand over more ground than be usual with hound of other breed the skin be thin to the touch and extremely loose this be more especially noticeable about the head and neck where it hang in deep fold height -- the mean average height of adult dog be 26 inch and of adult bitch 24 inch dog usually vary from 25 inch to 27 inch and bitch from 23 inch to 25 inch but in either case the greater height be to be prefer provide that character and quality be also combine weight -- the mean average weight of adult dog in fair condition be 90 pound and of adult bitch 80 pound dog attain the weight of 110 pound bitch 100 pound the greater weight be to be prefer provide -lrb- as in the case of height -rrb- that quality and proportion be also combine expression -- the expression be noble and dignified and characterise by solemnity wisdom and power temperament -- in temperament he be extremely affectionate quarrelsome neither with companion nor with other dog he nature be somewhat shy and equally sensitive to kindness or correction by he master head -- the head be narrow in proportion to its length and long in proportion to the body taper but slightly from the temple to the end of the muzzle thus -lrb- when view from above and in front -rrb- have the appearance of be flatten at the side and of be nearly equal in width throughout its entire length in profile the upper outline of the skull be nearly in the same plane as that of the foreface the length from end of nose to stop -lrb- midway between the eye -rrb- should be not less than that from stop to back of occipital protuberance -lrb- peak -rrb- the entire length of head from the posterior part of the occipital protuberance to the end of the muzzle should be 12 inch or more in dog and 11 inch or more in bitch skull -- the skull be long and narrow with the occipital peak very pronounce the brow be not prominent although owe to the deep-set eye they may have that appearance foreface -- the foreface be long deep and of even width throughout with square outline when see in profile eye -- the eye be deeply sink in the orbit the lid assume a lozenge or diamond shape in consequence of the lower lid be drag down and evert by the heavy flew the eye correspond with the general tone of color of the animal vary from deep hazel to yellow the hazel color be however to be prefer although very seldom see in red-and-tan hound ear -- the ear be thin and soft to the touch extremely long set very low and fall in graceful fold the lower part curl inwards and backwards wrinkle -- the head be furnish with a amount of loose skin which in nearly every position appear super-abundant but more particularly so when the head be carry low the skin then fall into loose pendulous ridge and fold especially over the forehead and side of the face nostril -- the nostril be large and open lip flew and dewlap -- in front the lip fall squarely make a right-angle with the upper line of the foreface whilst behind they form deep hang flew and be continue into the pendent fold of loose skin about the neck constitute the dewlap which be very pronounced these character be find though in a less degree in the bitch neck shoulder and chest -- the neck be long the shoulder muscular and well sloped backwards the rib be well spring and the chest well let down between the foreleg form a deep keel leg and foot -- the fore-leg be straight and large in bone with elbow squarely set the foot strong and well knuckle up the thigh and second thigh -lrb- gaskin -rrb- be very muscular the hock well bent and let down and squarely set back and loin -- the back and loin be strong the latter deep and slightly arched stern -- the stern be long and taper and set on rather high with a moderate amount of hair underneath gait -- the gait be elastic swinging and free -- the stern be carry high but not too much curl over the back color -- the color be black-and-tan red-and-tan and tawny -- the darker color be sometimes intersperse with lighter or badger-coloured hair and sometimes fleck with white a small amount of white be permissible on chest foot and tip of stern chapter xiv the otterhound the otterhound be a descendant of the old southern hound and there be reason to believe that all hound hunting they quarry by nose have a similar source why the breed be first call the southern hound or when he use become practical in great britain must be subject of conjecture but that there be a hound good enough to hold a line for many hour be accredit in history that go very far back into past century the hound require three century ago even be all the better esteem for be slow and unswerving on a line of scent and in many part of the kingdom up to within half that period the so-called southern hound have be especially employ in devonshire and wale the last sign of he in he purity be perhaps when captain hopwood hunt a small pack of hound very similar in character on the fitch or pole-cat the _ modus operandus _ be to find the forage grounds of the animal and then on a line that might be two day old hunt he to he lair often enough ten or twelve mile off when this sort of hunting disappear and improve idea of fox-hunting come into vogue there be nothing leave for the southern hound to do but to hunt the otter he may have do this before at various period but history rather tend to show that otter-hunting be originally associate with a mixed pack and some of sir walter scott 's page seem to indicate that the dandie dinmont and kindred scottish terrier have a good deal to do with the sport it be more than probable that the rough-coated terrier be identical with the now recognize otterhound as a offshoot of the southern hound but be that as it may there have be a special breed of otterhound for the last eighty year very carefully breed and gradually much improve in point of appearance they be beautiful hound to-day with head as typical as those of bloodhound leg and foot that would do for foxhound a unique coat of they own and they be exactly suitable for hunting the otter as everyone know who have have the enjoyment of a day 's sport on river or brook the greatest otter hunter of the last century may have be the hon geoffrey hill a younger brother of the late lord hill a powerful athlete of over six foot major hill be a ideal sportsman in appearance and he be note for the long distance he would travel on foot with he hound they be mostly of the pure rough sort not very big the dog he reckon at about 23-1\/2 inch bitch 22 : beautiful bloodhound type of head coat of thick hard hair big in rib and bone and good leg and foot major hill seldom exhibit he hound they be see now and then at birmingham but hunting as hard as they do through shropshire staffordshire cheshire and into wale where they get they best water there be not much time for show they famous master have be dead now many year but he pack be still go and show great sport as the hawkstone under the mastership of mr h p wardell the kennel be at ludlow race-course bromfield the lead pack in the kingdom for the last sixty year at any rate have be the carlisle when in the hand of mr j c carrick who be famous both for the sport he show and for he breed of otterhound so well represent at all the important show such hound as lottery and lucifer be very typical specimen but of late year the entry of otterhound have not be very numerous at the great exhibition and this can well be explain by the fact that they be want in greater number for active service there be many more pack than formerly -- in all twenty-one for the unite kingdom the sport of otter-hunting be decidedly increase as there have be several hunt start within the last six year there can well be many more as accord to the opinion of that excellent authority the late rev otter davy as he be always call there be otter on every river but owe to the nocturnal and mysterious habit of the animal they whereabouts or existence be seldom know or even suspect hunting they be a very beautiful sport and the question arise as to whether the pure otterhound should not be more generally use than they be at present it be often assert that they continued exposure to water have cause a good deal of rheumatism in the breed that they show age sooner than other and that the puppy be difficult to rear there be however many advantage in have a pure breed and there be much to say for the perfect work of the otterhound the scent of the otter be possibly the sweetest of all trail leave by animal one can not understand how it be that a animal swimming two or three foot from the bottom of a river-bed and the same from the surface should leave a clean line of burn scent that may remain for twelve or eighteen hour the supposition must be that the scent from the animal at first descend and be then always rise at any rate the oldest foxhound or harrier that have never touch otter be at once in ravishing excitement on it and all dog will hunt it the terrier be never keener than when he hit on such a line the foxhound so wonderful in he forward dash may have too much of it for otter hunting the otter be so wary he holt can very well be pass he delicious scent may be overrun but the pure-bred otterhound be equal to all occasion he be terribly certain on the trail when he find it nothing can throw he off it and when he deep note swell into a sort of savage howl as he lift he head towards the root of some old pollard there be a meaning in it -- no mistake have be make in every part of a run it be the same the otter dodge up stream and down land for a moment return to he holt but he adversary be always with he and as one see they steady work the impression become stronger and stronger that for the real sport of otter-hunting there be nothing as good as the pure-bred otterhound there be something so dignified and noble about the hound of unsullied strain that if you once see a good one you will not soon forget he he be a large hound as he well need to be for the varmint who be he customary quarry be the wildest most vicious and for its size the most powerful of all british wild animal the inveterate poacher of we salmon stream and consequently to be mercilessly slaughter although always in sport fashion to be equal to such prey the hound must have a bulldog 's courage a newfoundland 's strength in water a pointer 's nose a retriever 's sagacity the stamen of the foxhound the patience of a beagle the intelligence of a collie \* \* \* \* \* the perfect otterhound : head -- the head which have be describe as something between that of a bloodhound and that of a foxhound be more hard and rugged than either with a narrow forehead ascend to a moderate peak ear -- the ear be long and sweeping but not feathered down to the tip set low and lie flat to the cheek eye -- the eye be large dark and deeply set have a peculiarly thoughtful expression they show a considerable amount of the haw nose -- the nose be large and well develop the nostril expand muzzle -- the muzzle well protect from wiry hair the jaw very powerful with deep flew neck -- the neck be strong and muscular but rather long the dewlap be loose and fold chest -- the chest deep and capacious but not too wide back -- the back be strong wide and arched shoulder -- the shoulder ought to be slope the arm and thigh substantial and muscular foot -- the foot fairly large and spread with firm pad and strong nail to resist sharp rock stern -- the stern when the hound be at work be carry gaily like that of a rough welsh harrier it be thick and well cover to serve as a rudder coat -- the coat be wiry hard long and close at the root impervious to water color -- gray or buff or yellowish or black or rufus red mixed with black or gray height -- 22 to 24 inch chapter xv the irish wolfhound it be now some thirty year since a important controversy be carry on in the column of _ the live stock journal _ on the nature and history of the great irish wolfhound the chief disputant in the discussion be captain g a graham of dursley mr g w hickman mr f adcock and the rev m b wynn and the main point as issue be whether the dog then imperfectly know as the irish wolfdog be a true descendant of the ancient _ cani graius hibernicus _ or whether it be a mere manufactured mongrel owe its origin to a admixture of the great dane and the dog of the pyrenee modify and bring to type by a cross with the highland deerhound it be not doubt -- indeed history and tradition clearly attest -- that there have exist in early time in ireland a very large and rugged hound of greyhound form whose vocation it be to hunt the wolf the red deer and the fox it be assuredly know to the roman and there can be little doubt that the huge dog samr which jarl gunnar get from the irish king myrkiarton in the tenth century and take back with he to norway be one of this breed but it be suppose by many to have become extinct soon after the disappearance of the last wolf in ireland and it be the endeavor of captain graham to demonstrate that specimen although admittedly degenerate be still to be find and that they be capable of be restore to a semblance of the original type at the time when he enter into the controversy captain graham have be actively interesting himself for something like a score of year in the resuscitation of the breed and he patience have be well reward by the year 1881 the irish wolfhound have be practically restore although it have take close upon a quarter of a century to produce the magnificent champion cotswold and cotswold patricium those brilliant example of the modern breed -- a brace of wolfhound who bear testimony to the vast amount of energy and perseverance which captain graham and he enthusiastic colleague major garnier display in evolve from rough material the majestic breed that hold so prominent a position to-day there be little to be gather from ancient writings concern the size and appearance of the irish wolfhound in early time exaggerated figure be give as to height and weight but all authority agree that they be impressively large and impose dog and that they be regard as the giant of the canine race it seem extraordinary that so little should have be accurately know and record of a dog which at one time must have be a familiar figure in the hall of the irish king it be no mere mythical animal like the heraldic griffin but a actual sport dog which be accept as a national emblem of the emerald isle associate with the harp and the shamrock as regard the origin of the irish wolfhound more than one theory be advance by some authority it be suggest that it be the dog which we now know as the great dane other hold that as there be rough-coated greyhound in ireland it be this dog under another name which be now accept but probably the late captain graham be nearer the truth when he give the opinion that the irish hound that be keep to hunt wolf have never become extinct at all but be now represent in the scottish deerhound only alter a little in size and strength to suit the easier work require of it -- that of hunting the deer this be the more probable as the fact remain that the chief factor in the resuscitation of the irish wolfhound have be the scottish deerhound the result of captain graham 's investigation when seek for animal bear some relationship to the original irish wolfe dogge be that three strain be to be find in ireland but none of the representative at that time be anything like so large as those mention in early writings and they all appear to have deteriorate in bone and substance sir j power of kilfane be responsible for one line mr baker of ballytobin for another and mr mahoney of dromore for the remain strain from bitch obtain from two of these kennel captain graham by cross they with the great dane and scottish deerhound achieve the first step towards produce the animal that he desire later on the russian wolfhound better know as the borzoi a exceedingly large hound be introduce as also be one or two other large breed of dog the intermixture of these canine giant however be not at first very satisfactory as although plenty of bone be obtain many be most ungainly in appearance and ill-shaped animal that have very little about they to attract attention captain graham however stick to he work and very soon the specimen that he bring forward begin to show a fixity of type both in head and in general outline brian be one of he best dog but he be not very large as he only stand just over thirty inch at the shoulder banshee and fintragh be other but probably the best of captain graham 's kennel be the bitch sheelah it be not however until towards the end of the last century that the most perfect dog be breed these include o'leary the property of mr crisp of playford hall o'leary be responsible for many of the best dog of the present day and be the sire of mr percy shewell 's ch cotswold who be undoubtedly the grandest irish wolfhound ever breed in height cotswold stand 34-1\/2 inch and be therefore perhaps the largest dog of any breed now alive in 1900 mr crisp breed kilcullen from o'leary this dog win the championship at the kennel club show at the crystal palace in 1902 under captain graham this be the year the irish wolfhound club present the hound rajah of kidnal as a regimental pet to the newly form irish guard rajah of kidnal who be breed and exhibit by mr a gerard of malpa be the selection of captain graham and two other judge this dog which have be rename brian boru be still hearty and well and be at he post on st patrick 's day 1909 when the shamrock that have be send by she majesty queen alexandra be hand to the man mr gerard own one of the largest kennel of irish wolfhound in

donegal the property of mr martin amongst the bitch that have be instrumental in build up the breed to its present high state of excellence be princess patricium of connaught who be by dermot astore out of cheevra and be the dam of ch cotswold patricium she be one of the tallest of she race she height be 33 inch another bitch that measure the same number of inch at the shoulder be dr pitts-tucker 's juno of the fen a daughter of ch wargrave mr everett of felixstowe be now one of the most successful breeder he exhibit at the 1908 kennel club show a most promising young dog in felixstowe kilronan with which he be second to mr shewell 's ch cotswold of whom he be now kennel companion at the same show miss clifford of ryde exhibit a good hound in wildcroft another of dermot astore 's son and other supporter of the breed be lady kathleen pilkington mr t hamilton adam mr g h thurston mr bailey mr f marshall mr j l t dobbin and miss ethel mccheane the follow be the description of the variety as draw up by the club : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- the irish wolfhound should not be quite so heavy or massive as the great dane but more so than the deerhound which in general type he should otherwise resemble of great size and commanding appearance very muscular strongly though gracefully build movement easy and active head and neck carry high the tail carry with a upward sweep with a slight curve towards the extremity the minimum height and weight of dog should be 31 inch and 120 pound of bitch 28 inch and 90 pound anything below this should be debar from competition

fore-leg over-bent fetlock twisted foot spread toe too curly a tail weak hind-quarter cow hock and a general want of muscle too short in body chapter xvi the deerhound the deerhound be one of the most decorative of dog impressively stately and picturesque wherever he be see whether it be amid the surroundings of the baronial hall recline at luxurious length before the open hearth in the fitful light of the log fire that flicker on polished armor and tarnish tapestry out in the open strain at the leash as he scent the dewy air or gracefully bound over the purple of he native hill grace and majesty be in he every movement and attitude and even to the most prosaic mind there be about he the inseparable glamour of feudal romance and poetry he be at he best alert in the excitement of the chase but all too rare now be the inspiring sight that once be common among the mountain of morven and the glen of argyll of the deep-voiced hound speeding in pursuit of he antlered prey race he at full stretch along the mountain 's ridge or bay he at last in the fastness of darksome corrie or deep ravine go be the good romantic day of stalk beloved by scrope the highland have lose they loneliness and the invention of the modern gunsmith have rob one of the grandest of hunting dog of he glory relegate he to the life of a pedestrian pet whose highest dignity be the winning of a pecuniary prize under kennel club rule historian of the deerhound associate he with the original irish wolfdog of whom he be obviously a close relative and it be sure that when the wolf still linger in the land it be the frequent quarry of the highland as of the hibernian hound legend have it that prince ossian son of fingal king of morven hunt the wolf with the gray long-bounding dog swift-footed luath and white-breasted bran be among the name of ossian 's hound i be dispose to affirm that the old irish wolfhound and the highland deerhound be not only intimately ally in form and nature but that they be two strain of a identical breed alter only in size by circumstance and environment whatever the source of the highland deerhound and at whatever period it become distinct from its now larger irish relative it be recognize as a native dog in scotland in very early time and it be distinguish as be superior in strength and beauty to the hound of the pict from remote day the scottish noble cherish they strain of deerhound seek glorious sport in the highland forest the red deer belong by inexorable law to the king of scotland and great drive which often last for several day be make to round up the herd into give neighborhood for the pleasure of the court as in the reign of queen mary but the organise coursing of deer by courtier cease during the stuart trouble and be leave in the hand of retainer who thus replenish they chief 's larder the revival of deerstalk date back hardly further than a hundred year it reach its greatest popularity in the highland at the time when the late queen and prince albert be in residence at balmoral solomon hector and bran be among the balmoral hound bran be a especially fine animal -- one of the best of he time stand over thirty

from Saturday night to Monday morning and the pure breed bran by himself pull down two unwounded stag one carry ten and the other eleven tine these of course be record performance but they demonstrate the possibility of the deerhound when train to he natural sport -lrb- illustration : mr armstrong 's deerhound ch talisman -rrb- driving be commonly resort to in the extensive forest but nowadays when forest be sub-divide into limited shooting the deer be seldom move from they home preserve whilst with the use of improve telescope and the small-bore rifle stalk have go out of fashion with gun have a muzzle velocity of 2500 foot per second it be no longer necessary for sportsman stealthily to stalk they game to come within easy range and as for hound they have become a doubtful appendage to the chase primarily and essentially the deerhound belong to the order _ agaseus _ hunting by sight and not by scent and although he may indeed occasionally put he nose to the ground yet he power of scent be not remarkable he vocation therefore have undergo a change and it be recently ascertain that of sixty deer forest there be only six upon which deerhound be keep for sport purpose happily the deerhound have suffer no decline in the favor bestow upon he for he own sake the contrary be rather the case and he be still a aristocrat among dog value for he good look the symmetry of he form he grace and elegance and even more so for he faithful and affectionate nature sir walter scott declare that he be a most perfect creature of heaven and when one see he represent in so beautiful a specimen of he noble race as st ronan 's rhyme for example or talisman or ayrshire one be tempt to echo this high praise seven-and-twenty year ago captain graham draw up a list of the most notable dog of the last century among these be sir st george gore 's gruim -lrb- 1843-44 -rrb- black bran -lrb- 1850-51 -rrb- the marquis of breadalbane 's king of the forest say to stand 33 inch high mr beaseley

best-bred dog living in the early eighty torrum however appear to have be the most successful of these dog at stud he be a exceedingly grand specimen of he race strong frame with plenty of hair of a blue brindle color captain graham 's own dog keildar who have be train for deerstalk in windsor park be perhaps one of the most elegant and aristocratic-looking deerhound ever see he full height be 30 inch girth 33-1\/2 inch and weight 95 lb he color bluish fawn slightly brindle the muzzle and ear be blue he nearest competitor for perfection be after hector probably mr hood wright 's bevi a darkish red brown brindle of about 29 inch mr wright be the breeder of champion selwood morven who be the celebrity of he race about 1897 and who become the property of mr harry rawson this stately dog be a dark heather brindle standing 32-3\/8 inch at the shoulder with a chest girth of 34-1\/2 inch a few year ago breeder be incline to mar the beauty of the deerhound by a too anxious endeavor to obtain great size rather than to preserve the genuine type but this error have be sufficiently correct with the result that symmetry and elegance conjoin with the desire attribute of speed be not sacrifice the quality aim at now be a height of something less than 30 inch and a weight not greater than 105 lb with straight fore-leg and short cat-like foot a deep chest with broad powerful loin slightly arched and strength of hind-quarter with well-bent stifle and the hock well let down straight stifle be objectionable give a stilty appearance thick shoulder be equally a blemish to be avoid as also a too great heaviness of bone the follow be the accept standard of merit \* \* \* \* \* head -- the head should be broadest at the ear taper slightly to the eye with the muzzle taper more decidedly to the nose the muzzle should be pointed but the tooth and lip level the head should be long the skull flat rather than round with a very slight rise over the eye but with nothing approach a stop the skull should be coat with moderately long hair which be softer than the rest of the coat the nose should be black -lrb- though in some blue-fawn the color be blue -rrb- and slightly aquiline in the lighter-coloured dog a black muzzle be prefer there should be a good moustache of rather silky hair and a fair beard ear -- the ear should be set on high and in repose fold back like the greyhound 's though raise above the head in excitement without lose the fold and even in some case semi-erect a prick ear be bad a big thick ear hang flat to the head or heavily coated with long hair be the worst of fault the ear should be soft glossy and like a mouse 's coat to the touch and the smaller it be the better it should have no long coat or long fringe but there be often a silky silvery coat on the body of the ear and the tip whatever the general color the ear should be black or dark-coloured neck and shoulder -- the neck should be long -- that be of the length that befit the greyhound character of the dog a over-long neck be not necessary nor desirable for the dog be not require to stoop in he work like a greyhound and it must be remember that the mane which every good specimen should have detract from the apparent length of neck moreover a deerhound require a very strong neck to hold a stag the nape of the neck should be very prominent where the head be set on and the throat should be clean-cut at the angle and prominent the shoulder should be well slope the blade well back with not too much width between they loaded and straight shoulder be very bad fault stern -- stern should be tolerably long taper and reach to within 1-1\/2 inch of the ground and about 1-1\/2 inch below the hock when the dog be still drop perfectly straight down or curve when in motion it should be curve when excite in no case to be lift out of the line of the back it should be well cover with hair on the inside thick and wiry underside longer and towards the end a slight fringe be not objectionable a curl or ring tail be very undesirable eye -- the eye should be dark : generally they be dark brown or hazel a very light eye be not like the eye be moderately full with a soft look in repose but a keen far-away gaze when the dog be rouse the rim of the eyelid should be black body -- the body and general formation be that of a greyhound of larger size and bone chest deep rather than broad but not too narrow and flat-sided the loin well arched and droop to the tail a straight back be not desirable this formation be unsuitable for go uphill and very unsightly leg and foot -- the leg should be broad and flat a good broad forearm and elbow be desirable fore-leg of course as straight as possible foot close and compact with well-arched toe the hind-quarter droop and as broad and powerful as possible the hip be set wide apart the hind-leg should be well bent at the stifle with great length from the hip to the hock which should be broad and flat cow hock weak pastern straight stifle and splay foot be very bad fault coat -- the hair on the body neck and quarter should be harsh and wiry and about 3 inch or 4 inch long that on the head breast and belly be much softer there should be a slight hairy fringe on the inside of the fore and hind-leg but nothing approach to the feathering of a collie the deerhound should be a shaggy dog but not over coat a woolly coat be bad some good strain have a slight mixture of silky coat with the hard which be preferable to a woolly coat but the proper covering be a thick close-lying ragged coat harsh or crisp to the touch color -- color be much a matter of fancy but there be no manner of doubt that the dark blue-grey be the most preferred next come the darker and lighter grey or brindle the darkest be generally prefer yellow and sandy-red or red-fawn especially with black point -- _ ie _ ear and muzzle -- be also in equal estimation this be the color of the oldest known strain the mcneil and the chesthill menzy white be condemn by all the old authority but a white chest and white toe occur as they do in a great many of the darkest-coloured dog be not so greatly object to but the less the better as the deerhound be a self-coloured dog a white blaze on the head or a white collar should entirely disqualify in other case though passable a attempt should be make to get rid of white marking the less white the better but a slight white tip to the stern occur in the best strain height of dog -- from 28 inch to 30 inch or even more if there be symmetry without coarseness which however be rare height of bitch -- from 26 inch upwards there can be no objection to a bitch be large unless she be too coarse as even at she greatest height she do not approach that of the dog and therefore could not well be too big for work as over-big dog be besides a big bitch be good for breed and keep up the size weight -- from 85 pound to 105 pound in dog from 65 pound to 80 pound in bitch \* \* \* \* \* among the more prominent owner of deerhound at the present time be mr h armstrong mr w c grow mr janvrin dickson miss a doxford mr harry rawson and mr h mclauchin mr armstrong be the breeder of two beautiful dog hound in talisman and laird of abbotsford and of two typically good bitch in fair maid of perth and bride of lammermoor mr grow own many admirable specimen among they be blair athol ayrshire kenilworth and ferraline she ayrshire be consider by some judge to be the most perfect deerhound exhibit for some time past he be somewhat large perhaps but he be throughout a hound of excellent quality and character have a most typical head with lovely eye and expression perfect front foot and hind-quarter other judge would give the palm to mr harry rawson 's st ronan 's ranger who be certainly difficult to excel in all the characteristic most desirable in the breed chapter xvii the borzoi or russian wolfhound of the many foreign variety of the dog that have be introduce into this country within recent year there be not one among the larger breed that have make greater headway in the public favor than the borzoi or russian wolfhound nor be this to be wonder at the most graceful and elegant of all breed combine symmetry with strength the wearer of a lovely silky coat that a toy dog might envy the length of head possess by no other breed -- all go to make the borzoi the favorite he have become he be essentially what we american cousin would call a spectacular dog give for example the best team of terrier and a fifth-rate team of borzoi which attract the more attention and admiration from the man in the street which do he turn again to look at not the terrier add to this that the borzoi make a capital house dog be as a rule affectionate and a good companion it be not to be wonder at that he have attain the dignified position in the canine world which he now hold in he native country the borzoi be employ as he english name imply in hunting the wolf and also smaller game include fox and hare several method of hunting the larger game be adopt one form be as follow wolf be report to be present in the neighborhood the hunter set out on horseback each hold in he left hand a leash of three borzoi as nearly match as possible in size speed and color arrive at the scene of action the chief huntsman station the hunter at separate point every hundred yard or so round the wood a pack of hound be send in to draw the quarry and on the wolf break cover the nearest hunter slip he dog these endeavor to seize they prey by the neck where they hold he until the hunter arrive throw himself from he horse and with he knife put a end to the fray another method be to advance across the open country at interval of about two hundred yard slip the dog at any game they may put up trial be also hold in russium these take place in a large rail enclosure the wolf be bring in cart similar to we deer cart in this case a brace of dog be loose on the wolf the whole merit of the course be when the hound can overtake the wolf and pin he to the ground so that the keeper can secure he alive it follow therefore that in this case also the hound must be of equal speed so that they reach the wolf simultaneously one dog would of course be unable to hold he naturally the dog have to be train to the work for which purpose the best wolf be take alive and send to the kennel where the young dog be teach to pin he in such a manner that he can not turn and use he tooth there seem to be no reason why the borzoi should not be use for course in this country one of the first example of the breed exhibit in england be own by messr hill and ashton of sheffield about 1880 at which time good specimen be import by the rev j c macdona and lady emily peel whose sandringham and czar excited general admiration it be then know as the siberian wolfhound some year later the duchess of newcastle obtain several fine dog and from this stock she grace found the kennel which have since become so famous later still queen alexandra receive from the czar a gift of a leash of these stately hound one of they be alex who quickly achieve honor as a champion the breed have become as fashionable in the united state as in great britain and some excellent specimen be to be see at the annual show at madison square garden to take the point of the breed in detail the description of the perfect borzoi be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- this should be long lean and well balanced and the length from the tip of the nose to the eye must be the same as from the eye to the occiput a dog may have a long head but the length may be all in front of the eye the head of this breed have greatly improve the last few year fewer apple-headed specimen and more of the desire triangular head be see the skull should be flat and narrow the stop not perceptible the muzzle long and taper too much stress can not be lay on the importance of the head be well fill up before the eye the head from forehead to nose should be so fine that the direction of the bone and principal vein can be see clearly and in profile should appear rather roman nosed bitch should be even narrower in head than dog the eye should be dark expressive almond shape and not too far apart the ear like those of a greyhound small thin and place well back on the head with the tip when throw back almost touch behind the occiput it be not a fault if the dog can raise he ear erect when excite or look after game although some english judge dislike this frequent characteristic the head should be carry somewhat low with the neck continue the line of the back shoulder -- clean and sloping well back _ ie _ the shoulder blade should almost touch one another chest -- deep and somewhat narrow it must be capacious but the capacity must be get from depth and not from barrel rib -- a bad fault in a run hound back -- rather bony and free from any cavity in the spinal column the arch in the back be more marked in the dog than in the bitch loin -- broad and very powerful show plenty of muscular development thigh -- long and well develop with good second thigh the muscle in the borzoi be longer than in the greyhound rib -- slightly spring very deep reach to the elbow fore-leg -- lean and straight see from the front they should be narrow and from the side broad at the shoulder and narrow gradually down to the foot the bone appear flat and not round as in the foxhound hind-leg -- the least thing under the body when stand still not straight and the stifle slightly bent they should of course be straight as regard each other and not cow-hocked but straight hind-leg imply a want of speed foot -- like those of the deerhound rather long the toe close together and well arched coat -- long silky not woolly either flat wavy or curly on the head ear and front-leg it should be short and smooth on the neck the frill should be profuse and rather curly on the chest and the rest of the body the tail and hind-quarter it should be long the fore-leg be well feathered tail -- long well feathered and not gaily carry it should be carry well down almost touch the ground height -- dog from 29 inch upward at shoulder bitch from 27 inch upward -lrb- originally 27 inch and 26 inch alter at a general meeting of the borzoi club hold February 1906 -rrb- fault -- head short and thick too much stop parti-coloured nose eye too wide apart heavy ear heavy shoulder wide chest barrel rib dew-claws elbow turn out wide behind also light eye and over or undershot jaw color -- the club standard make no mention of color white of course should predominate fawn lemon orange brindle blue slate and black marking be meet with too much of the latter or black and tan marking be dislike whole color dog be also see \* \* \* \* \* the foregoing description embody the standard of point as lay down and adopt by the borzoi club interpolate with some remark for the further guidance of the novice the borzoi club be found in 1892 and now consist of about fifty member with the duke and duchess of newcastle as joint-president it do much good work for the breed guaranteeing class at show where otherwise few or none would be give encourage the breeding of high-class borzoi by offer its valuable challenge cup and other special prize and generally look after the interest of the breed although the club standard of height have be raise from 27 and 26 inch to 29 and 27 inch for dog and bitch respectively it must be bear in mind that the best dog of to-day far exceed these measurement and unless _ exceptionally _ good in other point a dog of 29 inch at shoulder would stand little or no chance in the show under the majority of english judge indeed bitch of 29 to 30 inch be by no means uncommon not many of we can afford to start at the top of the tree and except for the favored few to whom money be no object and who can buy ready-made champion there be no better way of start a kennel than to purchase a really good bitch one say capable of win at all but the more important show she must be of good pedigree strong and healthy such a one ought to be obtain for p15 upward mate she to the best dog whose blood nick suitably with hers but do not waste time and money breed from fourth-rate stud dog for if you do it be certain you will only meet with disappointment on the other hand if you have have little or no experience of dog you may possibly prefer to start with a puppy if so place yourself in the hand of a breeder with a reputation at stake -lrb- unless you have a friend who understand the breed -rrb- it be a fact that even a cast off from a good strain that have be breed for certain point for year be more likely to turn out a better dog than a pup whose dam have be mate haphazard to some dog who may or may not have be a good one big kennel also generally possess the best bitch and breed from they and the bitch be quite as important a factor as the sire if however you prefer to rely on you own judgment and wish to choose a puppy yourself from a litter select the one with the longest head biggest bone smallest ear and longest tail or as many of these quality as you can find combine in one individual coat be a secondary matter in quite a young pup here one should be guide by the coat of the sire and dam still choose a pup with a heavy coat if possible although when this puppy coat be cast the dog may not grow so good as one as some of the litter who in early life be smoother as regard size a borzoi pup of three month should measure about 19 inch at the shoulder at six month about 25 inch and at nine month from 27 to 29 inch after ten or twelve month growth be very slow although some continue add to they height until they be a year and a half old they will of course increase in girth of chest and develop muscle until two year old a borzoi may be consider in its prime at from three to four year of age as regard price from p5 to p10 be not too much to pay for a really good pup of about eight to ten week old if you pay less you will probably get only a second-rate one have purchase you puppy there be three principal item to be consider if you intend to rear he well firstly he diet must be varied secondly the pup must have unlimited exercise and never be keep on the chain thirdly internal parasite must be keep in check for young puppy ruby worm cure be most efficacious and do not distress the patient food should be give at regular interval -- not less frequently than five time a day to newly wean puppy -- and may consist of porridge bread and milk raw meat minced fine and any table scrap with plenty of new milk well-boiled paunch be also greatly appreciate and be easily digest may be give freely one important part of the puppy 's education that must by no means be neglect be to accustom he to go on the collar and lead borzoi pup be as a rule extremely nervous and it require great patience in some case to train they to the lead short lesson should be give when about four month old if you can induce the puppy to think it be a new game well and good -- he will take to it naturally but once he look upon it as something to be dread it mean hour of patient work to break he in if you decide on commence with a brood bitch see that she be dose for worm before visit the dog that she be in good hard condition -- not fat however and if possible accompany she yourself and see she mate for the first week rather less than she usual quantity of food should be give afterwards feed as she appetite dictate but do not let she get too fat or she may have a bad time when whelp for two day before the puppy be due give sloppy but nourishing diet and this should be continue give slightly warm for four or five day after the pup be bear borzois as a rule make excellent mother but to rear they well they should not be allow to suckle more than five -- or if a strong big bitch six -- pup if the litter be larger it be better to destroy the remainder or use a foster mother -lrb- illustration : mr aitcheson 's borzoi ch strawberry king -rrb- whatever they may be in they native land -- and the first import specimen be perhaps rather uncertain in temper -- the borzoi as we know he in this country be affectionate devoted to he owner friendly with he kennel companion and make a capital house dog as a lady 's companion he be hard to beat indeed a glance at any show catalogue will prove that the majority of borzoi be own by the gentle sex no one need be deter from keep a borzoi by a remark the writer have hear hundred of time at show : those dog be _ so _ delicate this be not the case once over distemper trouble -- and the breed certainly do suffer badly if it contract the disease -- the borzoi be as hardy as most breed if not hardier give a good dry kennel and plenty of straw no weather be too cold for they damp of course must be avoid but this apply equally to other breed the adult hound like the puppy should never be keep on chain a kennel with a railed-in run should be provide or a loose box make a capital place for those keep out of door otherwise no different treatment be require from that of other large breed chapter xviii the greyhound the greyhound be the oldest and most conservative of all dog and he type have alter singularly little during the seven thousand year in which he be know to have be cherish for he speed and keep by man for run down the gazelle or course the hare the earliest reference to he be far back in the primitive age long before he be beautifully depict by assyrian artist strain at the leash or racing after he prey across the desert sand the egyptian love he and appreciate he century before the pyramid be build in those day he wear a feathered tail and he ear be heavy with a silken fringe of hair he type be that of the modern arabian slughus who be the direct and unaltered descendant of the ancient hound the glorious king solomon refer to he -lrb- proverb xxx 31 -rrb- as be one of the four thing which go well and be comely in go -- a lion which be strongest among beast and turneth not away from any a greyhound a he goat also and a king against whom there be no rise up that the greyhound be comely in go as well as in repose be recognize very early by the greek whose artist be fond of introduce this graceful animal as a ornament in they decorative workmanship in they metal work they carving in ivory and stone and more particularly as part in the design on they terra-cotta oil bottle wine cooler and other vase the greyhound be frequently to be see sometimes follow the hare and always in remarkably characteristic attitude usually these greek greyhound be represent with prick ear but occasionally the true rise ear be show all writings in connection with greyhound point to the high estimation in which the dog have always be hold dr caius when refer to the name say the greyhound have he name of this word gre which word soundeth gradus in latin in englishe degree because among all dogge these be the most principall occupy the chiefest place and be simply and absolutely the best of the gentle kinde of hounde it be not until the reign of queen elizabeth that course in england be conduct under established rule these be draw up by the then duke of norfolk the sport quickly grow in favor and continue to increase in popularity until the first coursing club be establish at swaffham in 1776 then in 1780 the ashdown park meeting come into existence the newmarket meeting in 1805 be the next fixture that be inaugurate and this now remain with the champion stake as its most important event afterwards come the amesbury meeting in 1822 but amesbury like ashdown although for many year one of the most celebrated institution of the description have fall from its high estate three year later come the altcar club but it be not until eleven year after this period that the waterloo cup be institute -lrb- in 1836 -rrb- to win which be the highest ambition of follower of the leash at the present time the run for the waterloo cup which at the commencement be a eight dog stake be compose of sixty-four nomination the entry fee for which be p25 the winner take p500 and the cup value p100 present by the earl of sefton the runner up p200 the third and fourth p50 each four dog p36 each eight dog p20 each and sixteen dog p10 each the thirty-two dog beat in the first round of the cup compete for the waterloo purse value p215 and the sixteen dog run out in the second round for the waterloo plate value p145 the winner in each case take p75 and the runner up p30 the remainder be divide amongst the most forward runner in the respective stake the waterloo cup hold the same position in course circle as the derby do in horse race the national coursing club be establish in 1858 when a stud book be commence and a code of law draw up for the regulation of course meeting this be recognize in australium and other part of the world where course meeting be hold the stud book of which mr w f lamonby be the keeper contain particulars of all the best-known greyhound in the unite kingdom and a dog be not allow to compete at any of the large meeting hold under course club rule unless it have be duly enter with its pedigree complete in fact the national coursing club be more particular in connection with the pedigree of greyhound be correctly give than the kennel club be about dog that be exhibit and that be say a great deal it hold the same position in course matter as the jockey club do in race it be in fact the supreme authority on all matter connect with course various opinion have be advance as to the best size and weight for a greyhound like horse greyhound run in all form and there be no doubt that a really good big one will always have a advantage over the little one but it be so difficult to find the former and most of the chief winner of the waterloo cup have be comparatively small coomassie be the smallest greyhound that ever win the blue ribbon of the leash she draw the scale at 42 lb and be credit with the win of the cup on two occasion bab at the bowster who be consider by many good judge to have be the best bitch that ever run be 2 lb more she win the cup once and many other stake as she be run all over the country and be not keep for the big event master mcgrath be a small dog and only weigh 53 lb but he win the waterloo cup three time fullerton who be a much bigger dog and be four time declare the winner of the cup be 56 lb in weight there be very few greyhound that have win the waterloo cup more than once but cerito be credit with it three time namely in 1850 1852 and 1853 when it be a thirty-two dog stake canaradzo bit of fashion miss glendine herschel thoughtless beauty and fabulous fortune be probably some of the best greyhound that ever run besides those already allude to bit of fashion be the dam of fullerton who share with master mcgrath the reputation of be the two best greyhound that ever run but master mcgrath come first during he remarkable career in public he win thirty-six course out of thirty-seven the only time that he be defeat be the 1870 at he third attempt to win the waterloo cup and the flag go up in favor of mr trevor 's lady lyon he however retrieve he good fortune the following year when he again run through the stake fullerton who when he win all he honor be the property of colonel north be breed by mr jame dent in northumberland colonel north give 850 guinea for he which be then state to be the highest price ever pay for a greyhound he run five time altogether for the waterloo cup and be declare the winner on four occasion the first time be in 1889 when he divide with he kennel companion troughend then he win the cup outright the three follow year in 1893 however after have be put to the stud at which he prove a failure he be again train for the cup but age have begin to tell its tale and after win one course he be beat by mr keating 's full captain in the second this be one of the two occasion upon which out of thirty-three course he fail to raise the flag on the other he be beat by mr gladstone 's greengage when run the decide course at haydock park it appear like descend from the sublime to the ridiculous to mention the greyhound as a show dog after the many brilliant performance that have be record of he in the leash but there be many dog elegant in outline with fine muscular development that be to be see in the judge ring mr george raper 's roast hot be one of the most prominent winner of the day he be a fawn and white as handsome as a peacock and moreover be a good dog in the field on one occasion after compete successfully at the kennel club show at the crystal palace he be take to a course meeting where he win the stake in which he be enter a brace of very beautiful bitch be mr f eyer 's dorset girl and miss w easton 's okeford queen although as a rule the most consistent winner in the leash have not be note for they good look there have be exception in which the opposite have be the case fullerton be a good-looking dog if not quite up to the form require in the show ring mr harding cox have have several specimen that could run well and win prize as show dog and the same may be say of miss maud may 's fine kennel of greyhound in the north of england in the south of england mr a dewe keep a number of longtail that when not win prize at the crystal palace and elsewhere be run at plumpton and other meeting in sussex the follow be the standard by which greyhound should be judge \* \* \* \* \* head -- long and narrow slightly wider in skull allow for plenty of brain room lip tight without any fly and eye bright and intelligent and dark in color ear -- small and fine in texture and semi-pricked tooth -- very strong and level and not decay or canker neck -- lengthy without any throatiness but muscular shoulder -- place well back in the body and fairly muscular without be load fore-leg -- perfectly straight set well into the shoulder with strong pastern and toe set well up and close together body -- chest very deep with fairly well-sprung rib muscular back and loin and well cut up in the flank hind-quarter -- wide and well let down with hock well bent and close to the ground with very muscular haunch show great propel power and tail long and fine and taper with a slight upward curve coat -- fairly fine in texture weight -- the ideal weight of a dog be from 60 pound to 65 pound of a bitch from 55 pound to 60 pound chapter xix the whippet for elegance of style cleanliness of habit and graceful movement few dog can equal the whippet for which reason he popularity as a companion have increase very greatly within the past decade no more affectionate creature be to be find yet he possess considerable determination and pluck and on occasion will defend himself in he own way too fragile in he anatomy for fight in the ordinary sense of the word when molest he will snap at he opponent with such celerity as to take even the most watchful by surprise while he strength of jaw combine with its comparatively great length enable he to inflict severe punishment at the first grab it be probably owe to this habit which be common to all whippet that they be originally know as snap-dog the whippet exist as a separate breed long before dog show be think of and at a time when record of pedigree be not officially preserved but it be very certain that the greyhound have a share in he genealogical history for not only should he appearance be precisely that of a greyhound in miniature but the purpose for which he be breed be very similar to that for which he larger prototype be still use the only difference be that rabbit be course by whippet and hare by greyhound this sport have be mainly confine to the work class the collier of lancashire yorkshire durham and northumberland be particularly devote to it as a rule the contest be handicap the starting point of each competitor be regulate by its weight but the winner of previous important event be penalize in addition accord to they presumed merit by have a certain number of yard deduct from the start to which weight alone would otherwise have entitle they each dog be take to its stipulate mark accord to the handicap and there lay hold of by the nape of the neck and hind-quarter the real starter stand behind the lot and after warn all to be ready discharge a pistol upon which each attendant swing he dog as far forward as he can possibly throw he but always make sure that he alight on he foot the distance cover in the race be generally 200 yard minus the start allot and some idea of the speed at which these very active little animal can travel may be glean from the fact that the full distance have be cover in rather under 12 seconds in order to induce each dog to do its best the owner or more probably the trainer stand beyond the win post and frantically wave a towel or very stout rag accompany by a babel of noise the race be start and in less time than it take to write it the competitor reach the goal one and all as they finish take a fly leap at they trainer 's towel to which they hold on with such tenacity that they be swing round in the air the speed at which they be travel make this movement necessary in many case to enable the dog to avoid accident particularly where the space beyond the win mark be limit for race purpose there be a wide margin of size allow to the dog anything from 8 lb to 23 lb or even more be eligible but in view of the handicap term those dog which possess speed and scale 9 to 12 lb amongst the light-weight and over 17 lb in the heavy one be consider to have the best chance probably there be no locality where the pastime have maintain such a firm hold as in and around oldham one of the most famous track in the world be at higginshaw where not infrequently three hundred dog be enter in one handicap the borough grounds at oldham and the wellington grounds at bury be also note centre for race it be a remarkable but well recognize fact that bitch be faster than dog and in consequence the term upon which they be handicapped be vary the general custom be to allow a dog 2-1\/2 to 3 yard advantage for every pound difference in weight between it and the gentle sex one of the fastest dog that ever run be collier lad but he be almost a greyhound as regard size whitefoot whose owner challenge the world and be consider to be quite unbeatable be a whippet in every sense of the word and be a nice medium weight though probably capplebank 's time of 11-1\/2 seconds stand alone the best of the present-day racing dog be polly fro ' astley -lrb- 15 lb -rrb- and dinah -lrb- 11-1\/2 lb -rrb- and of those which promise well for the future eva whose weight be only 9-3\/4 lb be most prominent the training of whippet be by no means easy work and be more expensive than most people imagine the very choicest food be deem absolutely necessary in fact a whippet undergo preparation for a important race be provide with the most wholesome fare choice mutton-chop beef-steak and similar dainty comprise they daily portion of course exercise be a necessity but it be not consider good policy to allow a dog in training to gambol about either on the road or in the field indeed all dog which be undergo preparation for a race be practically deprive of they freedom in lieu of which they be walk along hard road secure by a lead and for fear of they pick up the least bit of refuse each be securely muzzle by a box-like leather arrangement which completely envelop the jaw but which be freely perforated to permit proper breathing any distance between six and a dozen mile a day accord to the stamen and condition of the dog be suppose to be the proper amount of exercise and scale be bring into use every few day to gauge the effect which be be produce in addition to this private trial be necessary in the presence of someone who be accustom to time race by the aid of a stop-watch -- a by no means easy task consider that a slight particle of a second mean so many yard and the average speed work out at about 16 yard per second -- nearly twice as fast as the fastest pedestrian sprinter and altogether beyond the power of the fleetest race-horse color in the whippet be absolutely of no importance to a good judge though possibly what be know as the peach fawn be the favorite among amateur fancier red fawn blue or slate color black brindled of various shades and these color intermingle with white be most to be meet with however in some quarter the idea be prevalent that whippet be delicate in they constitution but this be a popular error probably they disinclination to go out of door on they own initiative when the weather be cold and wet may account for the opinion but give the opportunity to roam about a house the whippet will find a comfortable place and will rarely ail anything in score of house whippet go to bed with the child and be so clean that even scrupulous housewife take no objection to they find they way under the clothes to the foot of the bed thereby secure they own protection and serve as a excellent footwarmer in the winter month probably in no other breed except the greyhound do judge attach so little importance to the shape of the head so long as the jaw be fairly long and the color of the eye somewhat in keep with that of the body very little else be look for in front of the ear as in the case of race competitor really good dog for show purpose be much more difficult to find than bitch the best of the male be not so classical in outline as the female though some of they be as good in leg and foot -- point which be of the greatest importance though it be not quite in accordance with the standard lay down by the club it will be find that most judge favor dog which be about 17 lb weight and bitch which be between 15 lb and 16 lb the 20 lb mention in the standard of point without variation for sex be consider altogether too heavy appearance be sometimes deceptive but these dog be rarely weigh for exhibition purpose the trained eye of the judge be sufficient guide to the size of the competitor accord to he partiality for middle-size big or little animal the south durham and yorkshire show at darlington have the credit for first introduce class for whippet into the prize ring previous to this it have not long be generally recognize as a distinct breed and it be within the last twenty year that the kennel club have place the breed on its recognize list the follow be the standard of point adopt by the whippet club : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- long and lean rather wide between the eye and flat on the top the jaw powerful yet cleanly cut the tooth level and white eye -- bright and fiery ear -- small fine in texture and rise shape neck -- long and muscular elegantly arched and free from throatiness shoulder -- oblique and muscular chest -- deep and capacious back -- broad and square rather long and slightly arch over the loin which should be strong and powerful fore-leg -- rather long well set under the dog possess a fair amount of bone hind-quarter -- strong and broad across stifle well bent thigh broad and muscular hock well let down foot -- round well split up with strong sole coat -- fine and close color -- black red white brindle fawn blue and the various mixture of each weight -- twenty pound chapter xx the foxhound there be plenty of proof that foxhound be the very first of the canine race in great britain to come under the domination of scientific breeding there have be hound of more ancient origin such as the southern hound and the bloodhound but something different be want towards the end of the seventeenth century to hunt the wild deer that have become somewhat scatter after cromwell 's civil war the demand be consequently for a quicker hound than those hitherto know and people devote to the chase begin to breed it whether there be cross at first remains in dispute but there be more probability that the policy adopt be one of selection those exceptionally fast be breed with the same until the slow steady line hunter be improve out of he very character and shape at any rate there be proof that in 1710 hound be to be find in pack carefully breed and that at that time some of the hunt in question devoted attention to the fox the first known kennel of all be at wardor castle and be say to have be establish in 1696 but more reliable be the date of the brocklesby commence in 1713 the first record of a pack of hound be sell be in 1730 when a mr fowne sell he pack to a mr bowle the latter gentleman show great sport with they in yorkshire at that time lord hertford begin to hunt the cotswold country in gloucestershire and be the first to draw covert for fox in the modern style very soon after this it become the fashion of the day to breed hound many of the nobility and large landowner devote much of they time and money to it and would take long journey to get fresh blood it be the rule to breed hound on the most scientific principle and by 1750 there be fifty such breeder include the fifth duke of beaufort lord lincoln lord stamford lord percival lord granby lord ludlow lord vernon lord carlisle lord mexbro sir walter vavasor sir roland winn mr noel mr stanhope mr meynell mr barry and mr charle pelham the last-named gentleman afterward the first lord yarborough be perhaps the most indefatigable of all as he be the first to start the system of walk puppy amongst he tenantry on the brocklesby estate and of keep list of hound pedigree and age by 1760 all the above-named nobleman and gentleman have be breed from each other 's kennel the hound be register as can be see now in lord middleton 's private kennel stud book through which he lordship can trace the pedigree of he present pack for a hundred and sixty year to hound that be enter in 1760 get by raytor son of merryman and grandson of lord granby 's ranter another pedigree be that of ruby who be credit with a numerous progeny as she be by raytor out of mr stapleton 's cruel by sailor a son of lord granby 's sailor by mr noel 's victor this show well how seriously foxhound breeding be go into before the middle of the eighteenth century portrait prove also that a hound approach very closely to those of modern time have be produce at this early period by such evidence the foxhound have outstrip the harrier in size by nearly five inch as the latter do not appear to have be more than eighteen inch and the early foxhound would have be twenty-three inch then the heavy shoulder the dewlap and jowl of the southern hound have be get rid of and the coat have be somewhat alter the old school of breeder have evidently determine upon great speed and the ability to stay through the medium of deep rib heart room wide loin length of quarter quality of bone straightness of fore-leg and round strong foot the slack loin loosely build and splayfoot hound of former generation have be leave behind to such perfection indeed have the foxhound attain that long before the close of the eighteenth century sportsman be clamour as to what a foxhound could do with so much prominence give to the foxhound in the comparatively short period of forty or fifty year it be no wonder that individual hound become very celebrate in almost every part of the country mr pelham 's rockwood tickler and bumper be name well know in yorkshire and lord ludlow 's powerful and growler be talk of both in lincolnshire and warwickshire from the first indeed it appear that certain hound be very much better than other and old huntsman have generally declare for one which be in the whole length of they career -lrb- sometimes extend to fifty year -rrb- immeasurably superior to all other they have hunt harry ayri who be for just half a century with lord fitzhardinge declare to the day of he death that nothing have equal cromwell osbaldeston say the same of furrier and frank gillard never falter from the opinion that weathergage be quite by himself as the best hound he ever hunt the foxhound kennel stud book abound in the strongest proof that hereditary merit in they work have be transmit from these wonderful hound and they really make the history of the foxhound there have be many great hound but there must be the greatest of the great and the follow twelve hound be probably the best england have ever see : -- mr corbet 's trojan -lrb- 1780 -rrb- lord middleton 's vanguard -lrb- 1815 -rrb- mr osbaldeston 's furrier -lrb- 1820 -rrb- lord henry bentinck 's contest -lrb- 1848 -rrb- lord fitzhardinge 's cromwell -lrb- 1855 -rrb- mr drake 's duster -lrb- 1844 -rrb- sir richard sutton 's dryden -lrb- 1849 -rrb- the duke of rutland 's senator -lrb- 1862 -rrb- duke of rutland 's weathergage -lrb- 1874 -rrb- the earl of coventry 's rambler -lrb- 1874 -rrb- mr e p rawnsley 's freeman -lrb- 1884 -rrb- and the grafton woodman -lrb- 1892 -rrb- breed foxhound be one of the most fascinating of all the pleasure of animal culture as the above list so full of extreme merit can be trace for nearly a hundred and thirty year it can not be say that the price pay for foxhound in very recent time have greatly exceed those of the past in 1790 colonel thornton sell merkin for four hogshead of claret and the seller to have two couple of the whelp then in 1808 mr john warde sell a pack of hound to lord althorpe for 1000 guinea and the same gentleman sell another pack for the same sum a few year later in 1838 lord suffield offer 3000 guinea for mr lambton 's pack and afterwards sell it to sir matthew white ridley for 2500 in 1834 osbaldeston sell ten couple of bitch all descendant of furrier for 2000 sovereign or p100 a hound -- a record that be almost eclipse at the sale of lord politmore 's hound in 1870 when twenty-two couple of dog-hound sell for 3365 guinea of late year there have be the sale of the quorn for it be say p3000 and the late lord willoughby de break value the north warwickshire for the county to purchase at p2500 in 1903 the atherstone be value by mr rawlence the well-known representative of tattersall 's at p3500 or something like p50 a hound and that have be consider very cheap if therefore modern price have not greatly exceed those of the far past there have not be any particular diminution and there be no doubt about it that if certain pack could be purchase the price would far exceed anything ever reach before foxhound have very much improve in look during the past five-and-twenty year and unquestionably they be quite as good in the field or better whenever hound have good fox in front of they and good huntsman to assist or watch over they they be as able as ever notwithstanding that the drawback to good sport be more numerous now than they use to be the noble hound will always be good enough and ever and anon this be show by a run of the great wood order to hunt over five-and-twenty to thirty mile at a pace to settle all the horse and yet every hound will be up there have be a slight tendency to increase size of late year the belvoir dog-hound be within very little of 24 inch instead of 23-1\/2 the standard of twenty year ago and this increase have become very general in elegance of form nothing have be lose and there can be no other to possess beauty combine with power and the essential point for pace and endurance in the same degree as a foxhound a detailed description of the foxhound be here give : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- somewhat broad not peak like the bloodhound but long from the apex to the frontal bone eyebrow very prominent cheek cut clean from the eye to the nostril ear set low and in they natural condition thin and shapely but not large nose large jaw strong and level and small dewlap expression fierce and with the best often repellent eye -- very bright and deeply set full of determination and with a very steady expression the look of the foxhound be very remarkable neck -- should be perfectly clean no skin ruffle whatever or neck cloth as huntsman call it the length of neck be of importance both for stoop and give a air of majesty shoulder -- the blade should be well into the back and should slant otherwise be wide and strong to meet the arm that should be long and powerful leg and foot -- the bone should be perfectly straight from the arm downward and descend in the same degree of size to the ankle or as the say be down to he toe the knee should be almost flat and level there should be no curve until come to the toe which should be very strong round cat-shaped and every toe clean set as it be fore-rib and brisket -- deep fine rib be very essential and the brisket should be well below the elbow back and loin -- back should be straight a hollow back offend the eye much and a roach back be worse the loin wide back rib deep and long a slight prominence over the croup quarter and hock -- the quarter can not be too long full show a second thigh and meet a straight hock low down the shank bone short and meeting shapely foot coat -- the coat be hard hair but short and smooth the texture be as stiff as bristle but beautifully lay color -- belvoir tan which be brown and black perfectly intermix with white marking of various shape and size the white should be very opaque and clear black and white with tan marking on head and stifle badger pie -- a kind of gray and white lemon pied light yellow and white hare pie a darker yellow and white stern -- long and carry gaily but not curl often half white height -- dog from 23-1\/2 to 24 inch bitch from 22 to 22-1\/2 inch chapter xxi the harrier and the beagle the harrier be a distinct breed of hound use for hunting the hare -- or rather it should be say the association of master of harrier be do they utmost to perpetuate this breed the harrier stud book bear witness thereto : and it be to be deplore that so many master of harrier ignore this fact and be content to go solely to foxhound kennel to start they pack of harrier choose maybe 20 inch to 22 inch foxhound and thenceforth call they harrier it be indeed a common belief that the modern harrier be but a smaller edition of the foxhound employ for hunting the hare instead of the fox and it be almost useless to reiterate that it be a distinct breed of hound that can boast of possibly greater antiquity than any other or to insist upon the fact that xenophon himself keep a pack of harrier over two thousand year ago nevertheless in general appearance the harrier and the foxhound be very much alike the one obvious distinction be that of size opinion differ as to what standard of height it be advisable to aim at if you want to hunt you harrier on foot 16 inch be quite big enough -- almost too big to run with but if you be ride to they 20 inch be a useful height or even 19 inch either be a good workable size and such hound should be able to slip along fast enough for most people choose you hound with plenty of bone but not too clumsy or heavy a round firm neck not too short with a swan-like curve a lean head with a long muzzle and fairly short ear a broad chest with plenty of lung room fore-leg like gun barrel straight and strong hind-leg with good thigh and well let down hock foot round like cat ' foot and a well-set-on taper stern such a make and shape should see many season through and allow you to be certain of pace and endurance in you pack it be useless to lay down any hard and fast rule as to color it be so much a matter of individual taste some master have a great fancy for the dark coloring of the old southern hound but nothing could look much smarter than a good combination of belvoir tan with black and white puppy as a rule a week or two after they be whelp show a greater proportion of dark mark than any other but this as they grow older soon alter and they white mark become much more conspicuous as in the case of the foxhound the harrier be very seldom keep as a companion apart from the pack but puppy be usually send out to walk and may easily be procure to be keep and rear until they be old enough to be enter to they work doubtless the rearing of a harrier puppy be a great responsibility but it be also a delight to many who feel that they be help in the advancement of a great national sport \* \* \* \* \* there be nothing to surpass the beauty of the beagle either to see he on the flag of he kennel or in unravel a difficulty on the line of a dodge hare in neatness he be really the little model of a foxhound he be of course finer but with the length of neck so perfect in the bigger hound the little shoulder of the same pattern and the typical quarter and second thigh then how quick he be in he cast and when he be fairly on a line of course he stick to it as the say be like a beagle beagle have be carefully preserve for a great many year and in some case they have be in family for almost century in the hereditary hunting establishment they have be frequently find as the medium of amusement and instruction in hunting for the juvenile member of the house and there can be nothing more likely to instil the right principle of venery into the youthful mind than to follow all the way of these little hound dorsetshire use to be the great county for beagle the downs there be exactly fit for they and year ago when roe-deer be preserve on the large estate beagle be use to hunt this small breed of deer mr crane ' beagle be note at the time and also those of a colonel hard it be on record that king george iv have a strong partiality for beagle and be wont to see they work on the downs round about brighton the use of the beagle in the early day of the last century however be a good deal diversify they be hunt in big woodland to drive game to the gun and perhaps the ordinary beagle of from 12 inch to 14 inch be not big enough for the requirement of the time it be quite possible therefore that the beagle be cross with the welsh southern or otterhound to get more size and power as there certainly be a welsh rough-coated beagle of good 18 inch and a almost identical contemporary that be call the essex beagle sixty year ago such hound be common enough but possibly through the adoption of the more prevalent plan of beat covert and spaniel be in more general use the vocation of the beagle in this particular direction die out and a big rough-coated beagle be now very rarely see that a great many of the true order be breed become very manifest as soon as the harrier and beagle association be form and more particularly when a section of the peterborough hound show be reserve for they then they seem to spring from every part of the country in 1896 one become well acquaint with many pack that have apparently hold aloof from the dog show there be the cheshire the christ church -lrb- oxford -rrb- mr t johnson 's the royal rock the thorpe satchville the worcestershire etc and of late there have be many more that be as well know as pack of foxhound one hear now of the chauston the halstead place -- very note indeed -- the hulton the leigh park the stoke place the edinburgh the surbiton the trinity foot the wooddale mr g w hilliard 's mr price 's and mr turner 's beagle owner like the master of foxhound kennel have never be very partial to the ordinary dog show and so the development of the up-to-date beagle as see at recent show be somewhat new it be just as it should be and if more people take up beagle it may not be in the least surprising they be very beautiful little hound can give a vast amount of amusement and for the matter of that healthy exercise if a stout runner can keep within fairly easy distance of a pack of well-bred beagle on the line of a lively jack hare he be in the sort of condition to be generally envy \* \* \* \* \* description of the beagle : head -- fair length powerful without be coarse skull dome moderately wide with a indication of peak stop well define muzzle not snipy and lip well flew nose -- black broad and nostril well expand eye -- brown dark hazel or hazel not deep set nor bulgy and with a mild expression ear -- long set on low fine in texture and hanging in a graceful fold close to the cheek neck -- moderately long slightly arch the throat show some dewlap shoulder -- clean and slightly slope body -- short between the coupling well let down in chest rib fairly well spring and well rib up with powerful and not tucked-up loin hind-quarter -- very muscular about the thigh stifle and hock well bent and hock well let down fore-leg -- quite straight well under the dog of good substance and round in the bone foot -- round well knuckle up and strongly padded stern -- moderate length set on high thick and carry gaily but not curl over the back color -- any recognize hound color coat -- smooth variety : smooth very dense and not too fine or short rough variety : very dense and wiry height -- not exceed 16 inch pocket beagle must not exceed 10 inch general appearance -- a compactly-built hound without coarseness convey the impression of great stamen and vivacity chapter xxii the pointer it have never be make quite clear in history why the spaniard have a dog that be very remarkable for point all kind of game they have always be a pleasure-loving people certainly but more inclined to bull-fighting than field-craft and yet as early as 1600 they must have have a better dog for game-finding than could have be find in any other part of the world singularly enough too the most esteemed breed in many country can be trace from the same source such as the russian pointer the german pointer the french double-nosed griffon and far more important still the english pointer a view have be take that the spanish double-nosed pointer be introduce into england about two hundred year ago when fire-arm be begin to be popular for fowl purpose setter and spaniel have be use to find and drive bird into net but as the spanish pointer become know it be apparently consider that he alone have the capacity to find game for the gun this must have be towards the end of the seventeenth century and for the next fifty year at least something very slow be want to meet the necessity of the old-fashioned flintlock gun which occupy many minute in load and get into position improvement come by degree until they set in very rapidly but probably by 1750 when hunting have progress a good deal and pace be increase in all pastime the old-fashioned pointer be vote a nuisance through he extreme caution and tortoise-like movement there be evidence through portrait that pointer have be altogether change by the year 1800 but it be possible that the breed then have be continue by selection rather than by cross for a couple of decade as it be quite certain that by 1815 sportsman be still dissatisfy with the want of pace in the pointer and many sportsman be know to have cross they pointer with foxhound at about that time by 1835 the old spanish pointer have be leave behind and the english dog be a perfect model for pace stamen resolution and nerve the breed be exactly adapt to the requirement of that day which be not quite as fast as the present man shoot with good joe manton do they own loading and walk to they dog work they right and leave by hand and whistle the dog beat they ground methodically they head at the right level for body scent and when they come on game down they be the dog that have get it point and the other bark or await development there be nothing more beautiful than the work of a well-bred and well-broken brace of pointer or more perfect than the way a man get he shot from they there be nothing slow about they but on the contrary they go a great pace seem to shoot into the very current of air for scent and yet there be no impatience about they such as might have be expect from the foxhound cross the truth of it be that the capacity to concentrate the whole attention on the object find be so intense as to have lessen every other propensity the rush of the foxhound have be absorb by the additional force of the pointer character there have be nothing at all like it in canine culture and it come out so wonderfully after man have be shoot in the above manner for about forty year it be near the end of this period that field trial begin to occupy the attention of breeder and sportsman and although setter have be get into equal repute for the beauty of they work there be something more brilliant about the pointer at first brockton 's bounce be a magnificent dog a winner on the show bench and of the first field trial in england newton 's ranger be another of the early performer and he be very staunch and brilliant but it be in the next five year that the most extraordinary pointer merit be see as quite incomparable be sir richard garth 's drake who be just five generation from the spanish pointer drake be rather a tall gaunt dog but with immense depth of girth long shoulder long haunch and a benevolent quiet countenance there be nothing very attractive about he when walk about at stafford prior to he trial but the moment he be down he seem to paralyse he opponent as he go half as fast again it be calculate that he go fifty mile a hour and at this tremendous pace he would stop as if petrified and the momentum would cover he with earth and dust he do not seem capable of make a mistake and he bird be always at about the same distance from he to show thereby he extraordinary nose and confidence nothing in he day could beat he in a field he get some good stock but they be not generally show form the bitch by he be mostly light and small and he son a bit high on the leg none of they have he pace but some be capital performer such as sir thoma lennard 's mallard mr george pilkington 's tory mr lloyd price 's luck of edenhall winner of the field trial derby 1878 lord downe 's mar and bounce and mr barclay field 's riot when sir richard garth go to indium and sell he kennel of pointer at tattersall 's mr lloyd price give 150 guinea for drake the mid-century owner and breeder have probably all the advantage of what a past generation have do as there be certainly many wonderful pointer in the ` fifty ` sixty and ` seventy as old man live to-day will freely allow they be produce very regularly too in a marvellous type of perfection mr william arkwright of sutton scarsdale derbyshire have probably the best kennel in england at the present time he discover and revive a old breed of the north of england that be black and breed for a great many year by mr pape of carlisle and he father before he with these mr arkwright have breed to the best working strain with the result that he have have many good field trial winner for a good many year now elia bishop of newton abbot have keep up the old breed of devon pointer the ch bang the mike and the brackenburg romp and he have be amongst the best at the show and the field trial during the past few year there be of course exception to the rule that many of the modern pointer do not carry about they the air of they true business but it would appear that fewer people keep they now than be the case a quarter of a century ago owe to the advance of quick-shooting otherwise drive and the consequent fall away of the old-fashioned method both for the stubble and the moor however there be many still who enjoy the work of dog and it would be a sin indeed in the calendar of british sport if the fine old breed of pointer be allow even to deteriorate the apparent danger be that the personal or individual element be die out in the ` seventy the name of drake bang or garnet be like household word people talk of the great pointer they be speak of in club chat or gossip write about and the prospects of the moor be much associate with the up-to-date character of the pointer and setter there be very little of this sort of talk now-a-day gun be more critically speak of there be however a wide enough world to supply with first-class pointer in england 's numerous colony it may be much more fitting to shoot over dog it have be try in south africa with marvellous result descendant of bang have delight the lone colonist on cape partridge and quail and pointer suit the climate whereas setter do not the pointer be a noble breed to take up as those still in middle life have see its extraordinary merit whenever breed in the right way as to the essential point of the breed they may be set down as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- should be wide from ear to ear long and slant from the top of the skull to the setting on of the nose cheek bone prominent ear set low and thin in texture soft and velvety nose broad at the base mouth large and jaws level neck -- the neck should be very strong but long and slightly arched meeting shoulder well knit into the back which should be straight and join a wide loin there should be great depth of heart room very deep brisket narrow chest rather than otherwise shoulder long and slant leg and foot -- should be as nearly like the foxhound 's as possible there should be really no difference as they must be straight the knee big and the bone should be of goodly size down to the toe and the foot should be very round and cat-shaped hind-quarter -- a great feature in the pointer be he hind-quarter he can not well be too long in the haunch or strong in the stifle which should be well bent and the muscle in the second thigh of a good pointer be always remarkable the hock may be straighter than even in a foxhound as in pull up sharp on he point he in a great measure throw he weight on they the shank bone below the hock should be short color -- there have be good one of all color the derby color be always liver and whites for they pointer and black breasted red for they game-cock the sefton be liver and whites also and so be the edge of strelly but mostly heavily tick brockton 's bounce be so and so be ch bang mike and young bang drake be more of the derby color dark liver and white mr whitehouse 's be mostly lemon and whites after hamlet of that color and notable one of the same hue be squire bang bang and mr whitehouse 's pax and priam all winner of field trial there have be several very good black and whites mr franci 's afterwards mr salter 's chang be a field trial winner of this color a still better one be mr s becket 's rector a somewhat mean little dog to look at but quite extraordinary in he work as he win the pointer puppy stake at shrewsbury and the all-aged stake three year in succession mr salter 's romp family be quite remarkable in color -- a white ground heavily shoot with black in patch and in tick there have never be any better pointer than these there have be and be good black pointer also height and size -- a big pointer dog stand from 24-1\/2 inch to 25 inch at the shoulder old ch bang and young bang be of the former height and the great bitch mr lloyd price 's belle be 24 inch for big pointer 60 pound be about the weight for dog and 56 pound bitch smaller size 54 pound dog and 48 pound bitch there have be some very good one still smaller chapter xxiii the setter i the english setter -- in some form or other setter be to be find wherever gun be in frequent use and irrespective of the precise class of work they have to perform but they proper sphere be either on the moor when the red grouse be in quest or on the stubble and amongst the root crop when September come in and the partridge season commence robert dudley earl of leicester be suppose to have be the first person to train set dog in the manner which have be commonly adopt by he successor he lordship live in the middle of the sixteenth century and be therefore a contemporary of dr caius who may possibly have be indebted to the earl for information when in he work on _ english dogge _ he write of the setter under the name of the index though setter be divide into three distinct variety -- the english the irish and the gordon or black and tan -- there can be no doubt that all have a common origin though it be scarcely probable in view of they dissimilarity that the same individual ancestor can be suppose to be they original progenitor nearly all authority agree that the spaniel family be accountable on one side and this contention be bear out to a considerable extent by old illustration and painting of setter at work in which they be invariably depict as be very much like the old liver and white spaniel though of different color doubt exist as to the other side of they heredity but it do not necessarily follow that all those who first breed they use the same means of the theory put forward that which carry the most presumptive evidence must go to the credit of the old spanish pointer where else could they inherit that wonderful scent power that style in which they draw up to they game they statuesque attitude when on point and above all the staunchness and patience by which they hold they game spellbound until the shooter have time to walk leisurely up even from a considerable distance but apart from the question of they origin the different variety have many other attribute in common all perform the same kind of work and in the same manner consequently the system of break or train they vary only accord to the temper or idea of those who undertake they schooling few dog be more admire than english setter and those who be look upon as professional exhibitor have not be slow to recognize the fact that when a really good young dog make its appearance it be a formidable rival amongst all other breed when the special prize come to be allot see either at its legitimate work as a gun dog or as a domestic companion the english setter be one of the most graceful and beautiful of the canine race and its elegant form and feathery coat command instant admiration twenty year ago it be know by several distinct name among the more important be the blue belton and laverack and this regardless of any consideration as to whether or not the dog be in any way connect by relationship to the stock which have earn fame for either of these time-honoured name it be the great increase in the number of show and some confusion on the part of exhibitor that make it necessary for the kennel club to classify under one head these and other which have attain some amount of notability and the old term have gradually be drop doubtless the english setter club have do much since its institution in 1890 to encourage this breed of dog and have prove the usefulness of the club by provide two very valuable trophy the exhibitor ' challenge cup and the field trial challenge cup for competition amongst its member besides have liberally support all the lead show hence it have rightly come to be regard as the only authority from which a acceptable and official dictum for the guidance of other can emanate the following be the standard of point issue by the english setter club : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- the head should be long and lean with well-defined stop the skull oval from ear to ear show plenty of brain room and with a well-defined occipital protuberance the muzzle moderately deep and fairly square from the stop to the point of the nose should be long the nostril wide and the jaw of nearly equal length flew not too pendulous the color of the nose should be black or dark or light liver accord to the color of the coat the eye should be bright mild and intelligent and of a dark hazel color the darker the better the ear of moderate length set on low and hang in neat fold close to the cheek the tip should be velvety the upper part clothe with fine silky hair neck -- the neck should be rather long muscular and lean slightly arch at the crest and clean cut where it join the head towards the shoulder it should be larger and very muscular not throaty with any pendulosity below the throat but elegant and bloodlike in appearance body -- the body should be of moderate length with shoulder well set back or oblique back short and level loin wide slightly arched strong and muscular chest deep in the brisket with good round widely-sprung rib deep in the back rib -- that be well rib up leg and foot -- the stifle should be well bent and ragged thigh long from hip to hock the forearm big and very muscular the elbow well let down pastern short muscular and straight the foot very close and compact and well protect by hair between the toe tail -- the tail should be set on almost in a line with the back medium length not curly or ropy to be slightly curved or scimitar-shaped but with no tendency to turn upward the flag or feather hanging in long pendant flake the feather should not commence at the root but slightly below and increase in length to the middle then gradually taper off towards the end and the hair long bright soft and silky wavy but not curly coat and feathering -- the coat from the back of the head in a line with the ear ought to be slightly wavy long and silky which should be the case with the coat generally the breeches and fore-leg nearly down to the foot should be well feathered color and marking -- the color may be either black and white lemon and white liver and white or tricolor -- that be black white and tan those without heavy patch of color on the body but fleck all over prefer \* \* \* \* \* ii the irish setter -- though this variety have not attain such popularity as its english cousin it be not because it be regard as be less please to the eye for in general appearance of style and outline there be very little difference in fact none if the chiselling of the head and color of the coat be except the beautiful rich golden chestnut color which predominate in all well-bred specimen be in itself sufficient to account for the great favor in which they be regard generally while they disposition be sufficiently engage to attract the attention of those who desire to have a moderate-sized dog as a companion rather than either a very large or very small one probably this account for so many lady exhibitor in england prefer they to the other variety of setter we have to go over to its native country however to find the breed most highly esteem as a sport dog for actual work and there it be naturally first favorite in fact very few of either of the other variety be to be meet with from one end of the green isle to the other it have be suggest that all irish setter be too headstrong to make really high-class field trial dog some of they on the contrary be quite as great in speed and not only as clever at they business but quite as keen-nosed as other setter some which have compete within the past few year at the irish red setter club 's trial have have as rival some of the best pointer from england and scotland and have successfully hold they own the secretary of the irish setter club be mr s brown 27 eustace street dublin and the standard of point as lay down by that authority be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- the head should be long and lean the skull oval -lrb- from ear to ear -rrb- have plenty of brain room and with well-defined occipital protuberance brow raise show stop the muzzle moderately deep and fairly square at the end from the stop to the point of the nose should be fairly long the nostril wide and the jaw of nearly equal length flew not to be pendulous the color of the nose dark mahogany or dark walnut and that of the eye -lrb- which ought not to be too large -rrb- rich hazel or brown the ear to be of moderate size fine in texture set on low well back and hang in a neat fold close to the head neck -- the neck should be moderately long very muscular but not too thick slightly arched free from all tendency to throatiness body -- the body should be long shoulder fine at the point deep and sloping well back the chest as deep as possible rather narrow in front the rib well spring leave plenty of lung room loin muscular and slightly arch the hind-quarter wide and powerful leg and foot -- the hind-leg from hip to hock should be long and muscular from hock to heel short and strong the stifle and hock joint well bent and not inclined either in or out the fore-leg should be straight and sinewy have plenty of bone with elbow free well let down and like the hock not incline either in or out the foot small very firm toe strong close together and arched tail -- the tail should be of moderate length set on rather low strong at root and taper to a fine point to be carry as nearly as possible on a level or below the back coat -- on the head front of leg and tip of ear the coat should be short and fine but on all other part of the body and leg it ought to be of moderate length flat and as free as possible from curl or wave feathering -- the feather on the upper portion of the ear should be long and silky on the back of fore and hind-leg long and fine a fair amount of hair on the belly form a nice fringe which may extend on chest and throat foot to be well feathered between the toe tail to have a nice fringe of moderately long hair decrease in length as it approach the point all feather to be as straight and as flat as possible color and marking -- the color should be a rich golden chestnut with no trace whatever of black white on chest throat or toe or a small star on the forehead or a narrow streak or blaze on the nose or face not to disqualify \* \* \* \* \* iii the black and tan setter -- originally this variety be know as the gordon setter but this title be only partly correct as the particular dog first favor by the duke of gordon from whom they take the name be black tan and white heavily build and somewhat clumsy in appearance but the introduction of the irish blood have the effect of make a racier-looking dog more fashionable the presence of white on the chest be look upon with disfavor and the kennel club settle the difficulty of name by abolish the term gordon altogether very few of this variety have appear at field trial for several year past but that can not be consider a valid reason for stigmatise they as old-man 's dog as some narrow-minded faddist delight in call they on the few occasion when the opportunity have be present they have acquit themselves at least as well as and on some occasion better than they rival of other variety prove to be as fast as staunch and as obedient as any of they a notable example of this occur during the season of 1902 and 1903 when mr isaac sharpe 's stylish ranger be so remarkably successful at the trial it be very difficult to account for the lack of interest which be take in the variety outside scotland but the fact remain that very few have appear at field trial within recent year and that only about four owner be trouble the official of english show regularly at the present time in france belgium norway and especially in russium this handsome sport dog be a far greater favorite than it be in great britain not only for work with the gun but as a companion and it be a fact that at many a continental dog show more specimen of the breed be exhibit than could be gather together in the whole of the unite kingdom the want of a active organization which would foster and encourage the interest of the black and tan setter be much to be deplore and be without doubt the chief cause of its be so much neglect for in these strenuous day when almost every breed or variety of breed be back up by its own votary it can not be expect that such as be not constantly keep in prominence will receive anything more than scant consideration the black and tan setter be heavier than the english or irish variety but show more of the hound and less of the spaniel the head be stronger than that of the english setter with a deeper and broader muzzle and heavier lip the ear be also somewhat longer and the eye frequently show the haw the black should be as jet and entirely free from white the tan on the cheek and over the eye on the foot and pastern should be bright and clearly define and the feather on the fore-leg and thigh should also be a rich dark mahogany tan amongst the oldest and most successful owner of setter who have consistently compete at field trial may be mention colonel cote whose prince frederick be probably the most wonderful backer ever know messr purcell-llewellyn w arkwright elia and jame bishop f c lowe j shorthose g potter and s smale who may be consider the oldest setter judge and who have own dog whose prowess in the field have bring they high reputation mr b j warwick have within recent year own probably more winner at field trial than any other owner one of he be compton bounce captain heywood lonsdale have on several occasion prove the ightfield strain to be staunch and true as witness the doughty deed of duke of that ilk and the splendid success he achieve at recent grouse trial in scotland with he ightfield rob roy mack and dot the first-named win the all-aged stake and the other be first and third in the puppy stake mr herbert mitchell have be another good patron of the trial and have win many important stake mr a t william have also own a few note trial winner and from scotland come mr isaac sharpe whose gordon setter stylish ranger have effectually put a stop to the silly argument that all this breed be old man 's dog many of the older field trial man hold tenaciously to the opinion that the modern exhibition setter be useless for high-class work and contend that if field-trial winner be to be produce they must be breed from note work strain doubtless this prejudice in favor of work dog have be engender by the circumstance that many owner of celebrated bench winner care nothing about they dog be train in some case generation after generation have be breed simply for show purpose under such condition it be not to be wonder at that the capacity for fine scent property and the natural aptitude for quickly pick up a knowledge of they proper duty in the field be impaired but there be no reason why a good show dog should not also be a good worker and the recent edict of the kennel club which rule that no gun dog shall be entitle to championship honor until it have gain a certificate of merit in field trial will doubtless tend towards a general improvement in the work quality of the breed whose providence be in the finding and retrieving of game chapter xxiv the retriever it be obviously useless to shoot game unless you can find it after it have be wound or kill and from the earliest time it have be the habit of sportsman to train they dog to do the work which they could not always successfully do for themselves the pointer setter and spaniel of we forefather be carefully break not only to find and stand they game but also to fetch the fall bird this use of the setting and point dog be still common on the continent and in the united state and there be no inaccuracy in a french artist depict a pointer with a partridge in its mouth or show a setter retrieve waterfowl the springer and the old curly-coated water-dog be regard as particularly adroit in the double work of finding and retrieve pointer and setter who have be thus break be find to deteriorate in steadiness in the field and it gradually come to be realize that even the spaniel 's capacity for retrieve be limit a larger and quicker dog be want to divide the labor and to be use solely as a retriever in conjunction with the other gun dog the poodle be try for retrieve with some success and he show considerable aptitude in finding and fetch wounded wild duck but he too be incline to maul he bird and deliver they dead even the old english sheepdog be occasionally engage in the work and various cross with spaniel or setter and collie be attempt in the endeavor to produce a grade breed have the desire quality of a good nose a soft mouth and a understanding brain together with a coat that would protect its wearer from the ill effect of frequent immersion in water it be when these effort be most active -- namely about the year 1850 -- that new material be discover in a black-coated dog recently introduce into england from labrador he be a natural water-dog with a constitution impervious to chill and entirely free from the liability to ear canker which have always be a drawback to the use of the spaniel as a retriever of waterfowl moreover he be himself repute to be a bear retriever of game and remarkably sagacious he importer call he a spaniel -- a breed name which at one time be also apply to he relative the newfoundland probably there be not many specimen of the race in england and although there be no record explicitly say so it be conjecture that these be cross with the english setter produce what be now familiarly know as the black flat-coated retriever one very remarkable attribute of the retriever be that notwithstanding the known fact that the parent stock be mongrel and that in the early dog the setter type largely predominate the ultimate result have favor the labrador cross distinctly and prominently prove how potent even when graft upon a stock admittedly various be the blood of a pure race and how powerful its influence for fix type and character over the other less vital element with which it be blended from the first sportsman recognize the extreme value of the new retrieve dog strengthen and improve by the labrador blood he have lose little if any of the setter beauty of form he be a dignified substantial intelligent good-tempered affectionate companion faithful talent highly cultivate and esteem in the season and out of it for he mind as well as he beauty it be only comparatively recently that we have realize how excellent a all-around sport dog the retriever have become in many case indeed where grouse and partridge be drive or walked-up a well-broken soft-mouthed retriever be unquestionably superior to pointer setter or spaniel and for general work in the field he be the best companion that a shooting man can possess doubtless in earlier day when the art of training be less thoroughly understand the breaking of a dog be a matter of infinite trouble to breeder most of the gun dog could be teach by patience and practice to retrieve fur or feather but game carefully and skilfully shot be easily render valueless by be mumble and maul by powerful jaw not school to gentleness and this question of a tender mouth be certainly one of the problem that perturb the mind of the originator of the breed the difficulty be overcome by process of selection and by the exclusion from breed operation of all hard-mouthed specimen with the happy effect that in the present time it be exceptional to find a work retriever who do not know how to bring he bird to hand without injure it a better knowledge of what be expect of he distinguish we modern retriever he know he duty and be intensely eager to perform it but he no longer rush off unbidden at the firing of the gun he have learn to remain at heel until he be order by word or gesture from he master upon whom he rely as he friend and director it would be idle to expect that the offspring of unbroken sire and dam can be as easily educate as a retriever whose parent before he have be properly train inherit quality count for a great deal in the adaptability of all sport dog and the reason why one meet with so many retriever that be incapable or disobedient or gun-shy be simply that they preliminary education have be neglect -- the education which should begin when the dog be very young in he earliest youth he should be train to prompt obedience to a give word or a wave of the hand it be well to teach he very early to enter water or he may be find want when you require he to fetch a bird from river or lake lesson in retrieve ought to be a part of he daily routine equally necessary be it to break he in to the knowledge that sheep and lamb be not game to be chase and that rabbit and hare be to be discriminate from feathered game gun-shyness be often suppose to be hereditary but it be not so any puppy can be cure of gun-shyness in half a dozen short lesson sir henry smith 's advice be to get you puppy accustom to the sound and sight of a gun be fire first at a distance and gradually nearer and nearer until he know that no harm will come to he companionship and sympathy between dog and master be the beginning and end of the whole business and there be a moral obligation between they which ought never to be strain both as a worker and as a show dog the flat-coated retriever have reach something very near to the ideal standard of perfection which have be consistently breed up to careful selection and systematic breeding back up by enthusiasm have result in the production of a dog combine useful work quality with the highest degree of beauty a very prominent admirer and breeder be the late mr s e shirley the president of the kennel club who own many retriever superlative both as worker and as show dog and who probably do more for the breed than any other man of he generation -lrb- illustration : mr h reginald cooke 's retriever ch worsley bess _ from the painting by maud earl _ -rrb- mr shirley 's work be carry on by mr harding cox who devote much time and energy to the production of good retriever many of which be of mr shirley 's strain mr cox 's dog deservedly achieve considerable fame for they levelness of type and the improvement in head so noticeable at the present time be to be ascribe to he breed for this point mr l allen shuter the owner of ch darenth and other excellent retriever of he own breeding claim also a large share of credit for the part he have play in the general improvement of the breed mr c a phillip too own admirable specimen and the name of the late lieut-colonel cornwall legh must be include many of colonel legh 's bitch be of shirley blood but it be believe that a breed of retriever have exist at high legh for several generation with which a judicious cross be make the result be not only the formation of a remarkable kennel but also a decide influence for good upon the breed in general but since the shirley day when competition be more limited than it be at present no kennel of retriever have ever attain anything like the distinction of that own by mr h reginald cooke at riverside nantwich by acquire the best specimen of the breed from all available source mr cooke have gather together a stock which have never be equal he idea of type and conformation be the outcome of close and attentive study and consistent practice and one need to go to riverside if one desire to see the highest example of what a modern flat-coated retriever can be since dr bond moore impart to the retriever a fixity of character the coat have become longer and less wavy and in conformation of skull color of eye straightness of leg and quality of bone there have be a perceptible improvement as there be no club devote to the breed and consequently no official standard of point the following description of the perfect retriever be offer : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- that of a well-proportioned bright and active sport dog show power without lumber and raciness without weediness head -- long fine without be weak the muzzle square the underjaw strong with a absence of lippiness or throatiness eye -- dark as possible with a very intelligent mild expression neck -- long and clean ear -- small well set on and carry close to the head shoulder -- oblique run well into the back with plenty of depth of chest body -- short and square and well rib up stern -- short and straight and carry gaily but not curl over the back fore-leg -- straight pastern strong foot small and round quarter -- strong stifle well bent coat -- dense black or liver of fine quality and texture flat not wavy weight -- from 65 lb to 80 lb for dog bitch rather less \* \* \* \* \* as a rule the retriever should be choose for the intelligent look of he face and particular attention should be pay to the shape of he head and to he eye he frame be important of course but in the retriever the mental quality be of more significance than bodily point there have be a tendency in recent year among retriever breeder to fall into the common error of exaggerate a particular point and of breed dog with a head far too fine and narrow -- it be what have be aptly call the alligator head -- lack in brain capacity and power of jaw a perfect head should be long and clean but neither weak nor snipy the eye should be place just halfway between the occiput and the tip of the nose it be please to add that to this beautiful breed the phrase handsome be as handsome do apply in full measure not only be the average retriever of a companionable disposition with delightful intelligence that be always responsive but he be a good and faithful guard and a courageous protector of person and property it have already be say that the majority of the best-looking retriever be also good work dog and it may here be add that many of the most successful work dog be sire by prize-winner in the show ring the curly-coated retriever the curly-coated retriever be commonly believe to be of earlier origin than he flat-coated relative and he be of less pure descent he probably owe ancestral tribute to the poodle such a cross may conceivably have be resort to by the early retriever breeder and there be little to lose from a merely sport point of view from this alien introduction for the poodle be well know to be by nature if not by systematic training a excellent water dog capable of be teach anything that the canine mind can comprehend during the early year of the nineteenth century the poodle be fairly plentiful in england and we have no other curly-coated dog of similar size and type apart from the irish water spaniel who may himself lay claim to poodle relationship while as to the retriever either curly or flat coated he can in no sense be assign to any country outside of great britain the presumption be strong that the gentleman from france be largely instrumental in the manufacture of the variety but whatever the origin of the curly-coated retriever he be a beautiful dog and one be gratify to note that the old prejudice against he and the old indictment as to he hard mouth be fast give place to praise of he intelligence and admiration of he work ability speak generally it seem to be accept that he be slightly inferior in nose to he flat-coated cousin and not quite so easy to break but there be many keeper and handler who have discover in individual specimen extraordinary merit in the field combine with great endurance it be not certain that any great improvement have be effect in the variety during recent year but there be particular dog to-day who be decidedly better than any that exist a dozen year or more ago when such celebrity as true old sam king koffee ben wonder doden ben lad and una be prominent and there be no doubt that the curly coat attain show form in advance of the flat-coated variety the coat of the curly retriever play a very important part in he value and personality there be many kind of coat but the only true and proper one be the close-fitting nigger curl of which each knot be solid and inseparable a coat of this quality be not capable of improvement by any method of groom for the simple reason that its natural condition be in itself perfect the little lock should be so close together as to be impervious to water and all part of the body should be evenly cover with they include the tail and leg a bad class of coat and one which readily yield to the faker 's art be the thin open curl which by careful manipulation can be greatly improve another bad quality of coat be one in which upon the withers and over the loin in particular the curl do not tighten up naturally but be large loose and soft to the feel regard the dog as a whole the follow may be take as a all-round description : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- that of a smart active clean-cut and alert dog full of go and fire -- a sportsman from stem to stern head -- long and not weedy in the muzzle nor thick and coarse in the skull but taper down and finish with a stout broad muzzle skull -- should be flat and moderately broad between the ear which be rather small and well cover with hair ear -- should lie close to the side of the head but not dead in they carriage face -- the face should be smooth and any indication of a forelock should be penalize eye -- the eye should in all case be dark and not too deeply set neck -- well place in the shoulder and nicely arch of moderate length and yet powerful and free from throatiness shoulder -- well lay back and as free from massiveness as possible though there be a decide tendency in this variety to such a fault leg -- straight and well cover with coat the bone should show quality and yet be fairly abundant foot -- compact and hound-like body -- should show great power with deep well-rounded rib as little cut-up in the flank as possible tail -- strong at the base set on in a line with the back and taper to a point the size of the curl upon it diminish gradually to the end hind-quarter -- should show great development of muscle with bent hock the lower leg be strong and the hind foot compact any suspicion of cow hock should be heavily penalize color -- mostly a dull black some liver-coloured dog be see with very good coat and body but they head be generally thick and coarse and the color of they eye do not always match as it should do with the color of the coat a few dog of this color have achieve distinction on the show bench \* \* \* \* \* the labrador within recent year the original smooth-coated labrador dog have take its place as a recognize variety of the retriever and become prominent both at exhibition and as a worker it be not probable that any have be import into england for the past quarter of a century but without the assistance of show or import blood they have survive marvellously thanks especially to the kennel of such breeder as the duke of buccleuch and hamilton the earl of verulam lord wimborne horne and malmesbury the hon a holland hibbert sir savile crossley mr f p barnett mr c liddell mr o l mansel and other equally enthusiastic to the duke of buccleuch 's kennel we be probably more indebted in the last twenty year than to any other its foundation be lay in two bitch by a dog of the duke of hamilton 's from a bitch of lord malmesbury 's at drumlanrig as well as on the duke 's other estate they have be most particular in preserve the purity and work quality of they strain and the same may be say of the hon a holland hibbert whose principal dog be not only typical in appearance but break to perfection the duchess of hamilton 's kennel have be responsible for some of the best field trial winner of the present day as far as look be concerned one can not say that the labrador compare favourably with either the flat or the curly coated retriever but that be immaterial so long as he continue to work as he be do at present chapter xxv the sport spaniel i the spaniel family -- the spaniel family be without any doubt one of the most important of the many group which be include in the canine race not only on account of its undoubted antiquity and compare with other family its well authenticated lineage but also because of its many branch and subdivision range in size from the majestic and massive clumber to the diminutive toy which we be accustom to associate with fair lady ' lap and gaily-decked pen at we big dog show moreover the different variety of setter undoubtedly derive they origin from the same parent stock since we find they describe by the earlier sport writer as set or crouch spaniel in contradistinction to the finding or spring spaniel who flush the game he find without set or point it as time go on the setting variety be no doubt breed larger and longer in the leg with a view to increase pace but the spaniel-like head and coat still remain to prove the near connection between the two breed all the different variety of spaniel both sport and toy have with the exception of the clumber and the irish water spaniel -lrb- who be not despite he name a true spaniel at all -rrb- a common origin though at a very early date we find they divide into two group -- viz land and water spaniel and these two be keep distinct and breed to develop those point which be most essential for they different sphere of work the earliest mention of spaniel to be find in english literature be contain in the celebrated master of game the work of edward plantagenet second duke of york and master of game to he uncle henry iv to whom the work be dedicate it be write between the year 1406 and 1413 and although none of the mss of which some sixteen be in existence be date this date can be fairly accurately fix as the author be appoint master of game in the former and kill at agincourt in the latter year he chapter on spaniel however be mainly a translation from the equally celebrated livre de chasse of gaston comte de foix generally know as gaston phoebus which be write in 1387 so that we may safely assume that spaniel be well know and habitually use as aid to the chase both in france and england as early as the middle of the fourteenth century in the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century the spaniel be describe by many writer on sport subject but there be a great similarity in most of these account each author apparently have be content to repeat in almost identical language what have be say upon the subject by he predecessor without import any originality or opinion of he own many of these work notwithstanding this defect be very interesting to the student of spaniel lore and the perusal of blaine 's _ rural sport _ taplin 's _ sport dictionary and rural repository _ scott 's _ sportsman 's repository _ and needham 's _ complete sportsman _ can be recommend to all who wish to study the history of the development of the various modern breed the work of the french writer de cominck de cherville blaze and megnin be well worth read while of late year the subject have be treat very fully by such british writer as the late j h walsh -lrb- stonehenge -rrb- mr vero shaw mr rawdon lee colonel claude cane and mr c a phillip nearly all of the early writer both french and english be agree that the breed come originally from spain and we may assume that such early authority as gaston phoebus edward plantagenet and dr caius have good reason for tell we that these dog be call spaniel because they come from spain the follow distinct breed or variety be recognize by the kennel club : -lrb- 1 -rrb- irish water spaniel -lrb- 2 -rrb- water spaniel other than irish -lrb- 3 -rrb- clumber spaniel -lrb- 4 -rrb- sussex spaniel -lrb- 5 -rrb- field spaniel -lrb- 6 -rrb- english springer -lrb- 7 -rrb- welsh springer -lrb- 8 -rrb- cocker spaniel each of these variety differ considerably from the other and each have its own special advocate and admirer as well as its own particular sphere of work for which it be best fit though almost any spaniel can be make into a general utility dog which be perhaps one of the main reason for the popularity of the breed ii the irish water spaniel -- there be only one breed of dog know in these day by the name of irish water spaniel but if we be to trust the writer of no longer ago than half a century there be at one time two if not three breed of water spaniel peculiar to the emerald isle these be the tweed water spaniel the northern water spaniel and the southern water spaniel the last of these be the progenitor of we modern strain the history of the irish water spaniel be in many way a very extraordinary one accord to the claim of mr justin mccarthy it originate entirely in he kennel and this claim have never be seriously dispute by the subsequent owner and breeder of these dog it seem improbable that mr justin mccarthy can actually have originate or manufacture a breed possess so many extremely marked difference and divergence of type as the irish water spaniel but what he probably do be to rescue a old and moribund breed from impend extinction and so improve it by judicious breeding and cross-breeding as to give it a new lease of life and permanently fix its salient point and characteristic however that may be little seem to have be know of the breed before he take it in hand and it be very certain that nearly every irish water spaniel see for the last half century owe its descent to he old dog boatswain who be bear in 1834 and live for eighteen year he must have be a grand old dog since mr mccarthy give he to mr joliffe tuffnell in 1849 when he be fifteen year old and he new owner subsequently breed by he jack a dog whose name appear in many pedigree it be not until 1862 that the breed seem to have attract much notice in england but in that year the birmingham committee give two class for they in which however several of the prize be withhold for want of merit the next few year see these dog make great stride in popularity and class be provide at most of the important show many good specimen be exhibit during the last few year however the breed seem to have be progress the wrong way and class at show have not be nearly so strong either in number or in quality as they use to be yet there have be and be still quite a large number of good dog and bitch to be see and it only need enthusiasm and co-operation among breeder to bring back the palmiest day of the irish water spaniel there be no member of the whole canine family which have a more distinctive personal appearance than the irish water spaniel with he it be a case of once see never forget and no one who have ever see one could possibly mistake he for anything else than what he be he best friend probably would not claim beauty in the aesthetic sense for he but he be attractive in a quaint way peculiarly he own and intelligent-looking in this particular he look do not bewray he he be in fact one of the most intelligent of all the dog use in aid of the gun and in he own sphere one of the most useful that sphere there be no doubt be that indicate by he name and it be in a country of bog and marsh like the south and west of ireland of which he be originally a native where snipe and wildfowl provide the staple sport of the gunner that he be in he element and see at he best though no doubt he can do excellent work as a ordinary retriever and be often use as such but nature -lrb- or mr mccarthy 's art -rrb- have specially form and endowed he for the amphibious sport indicate above and have provide he with a excellent nose a almost waterproof coat the sport instinct of a true son of erin and above all a disposition full of good sense he be high-couraged and at the same time adaptable to the highest degree of perfection in train he detractor often accuse he of be hard-mouthed but this charge be not well found many a dog which be use to hunt or find game as well as to retrieve it will often kill a wounded bird or rabbit rather than allow it to escape while there be many irish water spaniel who under normal circumstance be just as tender-mouthed as the most fashionable of black retriever besides he virtue in the field the irish water spaniel have the reputation -- a very well-founded one -- of be the best of pal most people be well acquaint with the personal appearance of this quaint-looking dog the point regard as essential be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* color -- the color should always be a rich dark liver or puce without any white at all any white except the slightest of shirt front should disqualify the _ nose _ of course should conform to the coat in color and be dark brown head -- the head should have a capacious skull fairly but not excessively domed with plenty of brain room it should be surmount with a regular topknot of curly hair a _ most important _ and distinctive point this topknot should _ never _ be square cut or like a poodle 's wig but should grow down to a well define point between the eye eye -- the eye should be small dark and set obliquely like a chinaman 's ear -- the ear should be long strong in leather low set heavily ringleted and from 18 to 24 inch long accord to size muzzle and jaw -- the muzzle and jaw should be long and strong there should be a decide stop but not so pronounced as to make the brow or forehead prominent neck -- the neck should be fairly long and very muscular shoulder -- the shoulder should be slope most irish water spaniel have bad straight shoulder a defect which should be breed out chest -- the chest be deep and usually rather narrow but should not be so narrow as to constrict the heart and lung back and loin -- the back and loin strong and arched fore-leg -- the fore-leg straight and well bone heavily feathered or ringleted all over hind-leg -- the hind-leg with hock set very low stifle rather straight feathered all over except inside from the hock down which part should be cover with short hair -lrb- a most distinctive point -rrb- foot -- the foot large and rather spread as be proper for a water dog well clothe with hair stern -- the stern cover with the shortest of hair except for the first couple of inch next the buttock whiplike or stinglike -lrb- a most important point -rrb- and carry low not like a hound 's coat -- the coat compose entirely of short crisp curl not woolly like a poodle 's and very dense if leave to itself this coat mat or cord but this be not permissible in show dog the hair on the muzzle and forehead below the topknot be quite short and smooth as well as that on the stern general appearance -- be not remarkable for symmetry but be quaint and intelligent look height -- the height should be between 21 and 23 inch \* \* \* \* \* iii the english water spaniel -- in the kennel club 's register of breed no place be allot to this variety all water spaniel other than irish be class together despite this absence of official recognition there be abundant evidence that a breed of spaniel legitimately entitle to the designation of english water spaniel have be in existence for many year in all probability a descendant of the old water-dogge a animal closely resemble the french barbet the ancestor of the modern poodle they be even trim at time much in the same way as a poodle be nowadays as markham give precise direction for the cut or shear he from the nauill downeward or backeward the opinion express by the writer of _ the sportsman 's cabinet _ 1803 be that the breed originate from a cross between the large water dog and the spring spaniel and this be probably correct though youatt a notable authority think that the cross be with a english setter possibly some strain may have be establish in this way and not differ very much in make and shape from those obtain from the cross with the spaniel as it be well know that setter and spaniel have a common origin in general appearance the dog resemble somewhat closely the springer except that he may be somewhat higher on the leg and that he coat should consist of crisp tight curl almost like astrakhan fur everywhere except on he face where it should be short there should be no topknot like that of the irish water spaniel iv the clumber spaniel be in high favor in the spaniel world both with shooting man and exhibitor and the breed well deserve from both point of view the position which it occupy in the public esteem no other variety be better equipped mentally and physically for the work it be call upon to do in aid of the gun and few certainly none of the spaniel surpass or even equal it in appearance as a sport dog the clumber be possess of the very best of nose a natural inclination both to hunt he game and retrieve it when kill great keenness and perseverance wonderful endurance and activity consider he massive build and as a rule be very easy to train be highly intelligent and more docile and biddable the man who own a good dog of this breed whether he use it as a retriever for drive bird work it in a team or use it as he sole companion when he go gun possess a treasure the great success of these spaniel in the field trial promote by both the society which foster those most useful institution be enough to prove this and more convincing still be the tenacity with which the fortunate possessor of old strain mostly resident in the immediate neighborhood of the original home of the breed have hold on to they and continue to breed and use they year after year for many generation as a show dog he massive frame powerful limb pure white coat with its pale lemon marking and freckling and above all he solemn and majestic aspect mark he out as a true aristocrat with all the beauty of refinement which come from a long line of culture ancestor all research so far have fail to carry they history back any further than the last quarter of the eighteenth century about that time the duc de noaille present some spaniel probably he whole kennel which he bring from france to the second duke of newcastle from whose place clumber park the breed have take its name beyond this it seem impossible to go : indeed the clumber seem to be generally look upon as a purely english breed from clumber park specimen find they way to most of the other great house in the neighborhood notably to althorp park welbeck abbey birdsall house thoresby hall and osberton hall it be from the kennel at the last-named place own by mr foljambe that most of the progenitor of the clumber which have earn notoriety derive they origin nearly all the most famous show winner of early day be descend from mr foljambe 's dog and he beau may perhaps be consider one of the most important pillar of the stud as he be the sire of nabob a great prize-winner and consider one of the best of he day who belong at various time during he career to such famous showman as messr phineas bullock mr fletcher mr rawdon lee and mr g oliver there have be a great deal of lamentation lately among old breeder and exhibitor about the decadence of the breed and the loss of the true old type possess by these dog but despite all they can say to the contrary the clumber be now in a more flourishing state than it ever have be and although perhaps we have not now nor have have for the last decade a john o ' gaunt or a tower there have be a large number of dog show during that time who possess considerable merit and would probably have hold they own even in the day of these bygone hero some of the most notable have be baillie friar beechgrove donally goring of auchentorlie hempstead toby and preston shot who all earn the coveted title of champion the field trial have no doubt have a great deal to do with the largely augmented popularity of the breed and the great increase in the number of those who own clumber for the first two or three year after these be truly establish no other breed seem to have a chance with they and even now though both english and welsh springer have do remarkably well they more than hold they own the most distinguished performer by far be mr winton smith 's beechgrove bee a bitch whose work be practically faultless and the first field trial champion among spaniel other good clumber who earn distinction in the field be beechgrove minette beechgrove maud the duke of portland 's welbeck sambo and mr phillip ' rivington honey rivington pearl and rivington reel the point and general description of the breed as publish by both the spaniel club and the clumber spaniel club be identical they be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- large square and massive of medium length broad on top with a decide occiput heavy brow with a deep stop heavy freckled muzzle with well develop fly eye -- dark amber slightly sink a light or prominent eye objectionable ear -- large vine leaf shaped and well cover with straight hair and hang slightly forward the feather not to extend below the leather neck -- very thick and powerful and well feathered underneath body -lrb- include size and symmetry -rrb- -- long and heavy and near the ground weight of dog about 55 lb to 65 lb bitch about 45 lb to 55 lb nose -- square and flesh color shoulder and chest -- wide and deep shoulder strong and muscular back and loin -- back straight broad and long loin powerful well let down in flank hind-quarter -- very powerful and well develop stern -- set low well feathered and carry about level with the back foot and leg -- foot large and round well cover with hair leg short thick and strong hock low coat -- long abundant soft and straight color -- plain white with lemon marking orange permissible but not desirable slight head marking with white body prefer general appearance -- should be that of a long low heavy very massive dog with a thoughtful expression \* \* \* \* \* iv the sussex spaniel -- this be one of the oldest of the distinct breed of land spaniel now exist in the british island and probably also the purest in point of descent since it have for many year past be confine to a comparatively small number of kennel the owner of which have always be at considerable pain to keep they strain free from any admixture of foreign blood the modern race of sussex spaniel as we know it owe its origin in the main to the kennel keep by mr fuller at rosehill park brightle near hasting this gentleman who die in 1847 be say to have keep he strain for fifty year or more and to have shoot over they almost daily during the season but at he death they be disperse by auction and none of they can be trace with any accuracy except a dog and a bitch which be give at the time to relf the head keeper relf survive he master for forty year and keep up he interest in the breed to the last he use to say that the golden tinge peculiar to the rosehill breed come from a bitch which have be mate with a dog belong to dr watt of battle and that every now and then what he term a sandy pup would turn up in she litter owe to a outbreak of dumb madness in the rosehill kennel a very large number of its occupant either die or have to be destroy and this no doubt account for the extreme scarcity of the breed when several enthusiast begin to revive it about the year 1870 mr saxby and mr marchant be say to have have the same strain as that at rosehill and certainly one of the most famous sire who be to be find in most sussex pedigree be buckingham by marchant 's rover out of saxby 's fan it be from the union of buckingham who be claim to be pure rosehill -- with bebb 's daughter peggie that the great bachelor result -- a dog whose name be to be find in almost every latter-day pedigree though mr campbell newington 's strain to which have descend the historic prefix rosehill contain less of this blood than any other about 1879 mr t jacob of newton abbot take up this breed with great success own amongst other good specimen russett dolly brunette and bachelor iii the latter a dog whose service at the stud can not be estimate too highly when this kennel be break up in 1891 the best of the sussex spaniel be acquire by mr woolland and from that date this gentleman 's kennel carry all before it until it in turn be break up and disperse in 1905 so successful be mr woolland that one may almost say that he beat all other competitor off the field though one of they mr campbell newington stick most gallantly to he all through mr campbell newington have be breed sussex spaniel for over a quarter of a century with a enthusiasm and tenacity worthy of the warmest admiration and he strain be probably the purest and more full of the original blood than any other he kennel have always maintain a very high standard of excellence and many famous show specimen have come from it notably rosehill ruler ii -lrb- a splendid sussex scarcely inferior to bridford giddie -rrb- romulus roein rita rush rock rag and ranjus and many other of almost equal merit colonel claude cane 's kennel of sussex start from a woolland-bred foundation have be go for some seventeen year the best he have show be jonathan swift celbridge eldorado and celbridge chrysolite the breed have always have a good character for work and most of the older writer who mention they speak of sussex spaniel in very eulogistic term they be rather slow worker but thoroughly conscientious and painstaking and be not afraid of any amount of thick covert through which they will force they way and seldom leave anything behind they a well-bred sussex spaniel be a very handsome dog indeed he beautiful color alone be enough to make he appearance a attractive one even if he be unsymmetrical and ungainly in he proportion this color know as golden liver be peculiar to the breed and be the great touchstone and hall-mark of purity of blood no other dog have exactly the same shade of coat which the word liver hardly describe exactly as it be totally different from the ordinary liver color of a irishman a pointer or even a liver field spaniel it be rather a golden chestnut with a regular metallic sheen as of burnish metal show more especially on the head and face and everywhere where the hair be short this be very apparent when a dog get he new coat in time of course it be liable to get somewhat bleached by sun and weather when it turn almost yellow every expert know this color well and look for it at once when judge a class of sussex the description of the breed give by the spaniel club be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- the skull should be moderately long and also wide with a indentation in the middle and a full stop brow fairly heavy occiput full but not point the whole give a appearance of heaviness without dulness eye -- hazel color fairly large soft and languish not show the haw overmuch nose -- the muzzle should be about three inch long square and the lip somewhat pendulous the nostril well develop and liver color ear -- thick fairly large and lobe shaped set moderately low but relatively not so low as in the black field spaniel carry close to the head and furnish with soft wavy hair neck -- be rather short strong and slightly arched but not carry the head much above the level of the back there should not be much throatiness in the skin but well marked frill in the coat chest and shoulder -- the chest be round especially behind the shoulder deep and wide give a good girth the shoulder should be oblique back and back rib -- the back and loin be long and should be very muscular both in width and depth for this development the back rib must be deep the whole body be characterise as low long level and strong leg and foot -- the arm and thigh must be bony as well as muscular knee and hock large and strong pastern very short and bony foot large and round and with short hair between the toe the leg should be very short and strong with great bone and may show a slight bend in the forearm and be moderately well feathered the hind-leg should not be apparently shorter than the fore-leg or be too much bent at the hock so as to give a settery appearance which be so objectionable the hind-leg should be well feathered above the hock but should not have much hair below that point the hock should be short and wide apart tail -- should be dock from five to seven inch set low and not carry above the level of the back thickly clothe with moderately long feather coat -- body coat abundant flat or slightly wave with no tendency to curl moderately well feathered on leg and stern but clean below the hock color -- rich golden liver this be a certain sign of the purity of the breed dark liver or puce denote unmistakably a recent cross with the black or other variety of field spaniel general appearance -- rather massive and muscular but with free movement and nice tail action denote a tractable and cheerful disposition weight from 35 lb to 45 lb \* \* \* \* \* vi the field spaniel -- the modern field spaniel may be divide into two class indeed we may almost say at this stage of canine history two breed as for several year past there have not be very much intermingling of blood between the black and those know by the awkward designation of any other variety though of course all come originally from the same parent stock the black member of the family have always be give the pride of place and account of most importance though latterly they parti-coloured brethren seem to have rather overtake they among the really old writer there be one mention and one only of spaniel of a black color arcussium speak of they and of they be use in connection with the sport of hawk but from he time up to the middle of the nineteenth century though many color be speak of as be appropriate to the various breed of spaniel no author mention black the first strain of black of which we know much belong to mr f burdett and be obtain from a mr footman of lutterworth leicestershire who be suppose to have own they for some time mr burdett 's bob and frank may be find at the head of very many of the best pedigree at he death most of he spaniel become the property of mr jone of oscott and mr phinea bullock of bilston the latter of whom be most extraordinarily successful and own a kennel of field spaniel which be practically unbeatable between the date of the first birmingham show in 1861 and the publication of the first volume of the kennel club 's stud book in 1874 many if not most of the dog which win for other owner have be breed by he he nellie and bob who win the chief prize year after year at all the lead show be probably the two best specimen of they day another most successful breeder be mr w w boulton of beverley whose kennel produce many celebrated dog include beverlac say to be the largest field spaniel ever exhibit and rolf whose union with belle produce four bitch who be destine when mate with nigger a dog of mr bullock 's breed to form the foundation of the equally if not more famous kennel belong to mr t jacob of newton abbot it be mr jacobs who by judiciously mate he sussex sire bachelor bachelor iii and other with these black-bred bitch establish the strain which in he hand and in those of he successor captain s m thoma and mr mose woolland carry all before it for many year and be still easily at the top of the tree be the most seek for and highly prize of all on account of its quality if black spaniel be not quite so popular at present as they be some year ago the fault lie with those breeder exhibitor and judge -lrb- the latter be most to blame -rrb- who encourage the absurd craze for excessive length of body and shortness of leg which not very long ago threaten to transform the whole breed into a race of cripple and to bring it into contempt and derision among all practical man no breed or variety of dog have suffer more from the injudicious fad and craze of those showman who be not sportsman also at one time among a certain class of judge length and lowness be everything and soundness activity and symmetry simply do not count as happen to all absurd craze of this kind when carry to exaggeration public opinion have prove too much for it but not before a great deal of harm have be do to a breed which be certainly ornamental and can be most useful as well most of the prize-winner of the present day be sound useful dog capable of work and it be to be hope that judge will combine to keep they so the color field spaniel have now almost invariably at the principal show special class allot to he and do not have to compete against he black brother as use to be the case in former year the systematic attempt to breed spaniel of various color with a groundwork of white do not date back much more than a quarter of a century and the greater part of the credit for produce this variety may be give to three gentleman mr f e schofield dr j h spurgin and mr j w robinson in the early day of breed black when the bitch be mate either with sussex or liver and white springer or norfolk spaniel many parti-coloured puppy necessarily occur which most breeder destroy but it occur to some of these gentleman that a handsome and distinct variety might be obtain by careful selection and they have certainly succeed to a very great extent the most famous name among the early sire be dr spurgin 's alonzo and he son fop and mr robinson 's alva dash from one or other of whom nearly all the modern celebrity derive they descent those who have be and be interested in promote and breed these variety spaniel deserve a large amount of credit for they perseverance which have be attend with the greatest success so far as produce color go no doubt there be a very great fascination in breed for color and in do so there be no royal road to success which can only be attain by the exercise of the greatest skill and the nicest discrimination in the selection of breed stock at the same time color be not everything and type and work quality should never be sacrifice to it this have too often be do in the case of color field spaniel there be plenty of beautiful blue roan red roan and tricolor whether blue roan and tan or liver roan and tan but nearly all of they be either cocktail weak in hind-quarter crooked-fronted or houndy-headed and show far too much haw in fact in head and front the greater number of the tricolor remind one of the basset-hound almost as much as they do in color it be to be hope that colour-breeder will endeavor to get back the true spaniel type before it be too late the point of both black and colored field spaniel be identical bar color and here it must be say that black and tan liver and tan and liver be not consider true variety color though of course they have to compete in those class but rather sport from black the color aim at by variety breeder have all a ground color of white and be black and white blue roan liver and white red roan liver white and tan and tricolor or quadri-colour -- _ ie _ blue or red roan and tan or both combine with tan the spaniel club furnish the follow description of the black field spaniel : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- should be quite characteristic of this grand sport dog as that of the bloodhound or the bulldog its very stamp and countenance should at once convey the conviction of high breed character and nobility skull well develop with a distinctly elevated occipital tuberosity which above all give the character allude to not too wide across muzzle long and lean never snipy nor squarely cut and in profile curving gradually from nose to throat lean beneath eye a thickness here give coarseness to the whole head the great length of muzzle give surface for the free development of the olfactory nerve and thus secure the highest possible scent power eye -- not too full but not small receding or overhung color dark hazel or dark brown or nearly black grave in expression and bespeak unusual docility and instinct ear -- set low down as possible which greatly add to the refinement and beauty of the head moderately long and wide and sufficiently clad with nice setter-like feather neck -- very strong and muscular so as to enable the dog to retrieve he game without undue fatigue not too short however body -lrb- include size and symmetry -rrb- -- long and very low well rib up to a good strong loin straight or slightly arched never slack weight from about 35 lb to 45 lb nose -- well develop with good open nostril and always black shoulder and chest -- former sloping and free latter deep and well develop but not too round and wide back and loin -- very strong and muscular level and long in proportion to the height of the dog hind-quarter -- very powerful and muscular wide and fully develop stern -- well set on and carry low if possible below the level of the back in a perfectly straight line or with a slight downward inclination never elevate above the back and in action always keep low nicely fringe with wavy feather of silky texture foot and leg -- foot not too small and well protect between the toe with soft feather good strong pad leg straight and immensely bone strong and short and nicely feathered with straight or wave setter-like feather overmuch feather below the hock objectionable coat -- flat or slightly wave and never curl sufficiently dense to resist the weather and not too short silky in texture glossy and refine in nature with neither duffelness on the one hand nor curl or wiriness on the other on chest under belly and behind the leg there should be abundant feather but never too much and that of the right sort viz setter-like the tail and hind-quarter should be similarly adorn color -- jet black throughout glossy and true a little white on chest though a drawback not a disqualification general appearance -- that of a sport dog capable of learn and do anything possible for he inch and conformation a grand combination of beauty and utility \* \* \* \* \* vii the english springer -- it be only quite recently that the kennel club have officially recognize the variety know by the name at the head of this section for a long time the old-fashioned liver and white or black spaniel longer in the leg than either sussex or field spaniel have be know as norfolk spaniel and under this title the spaniel club have publish a description of they there have however be a considerable amount of discussion about the propriety of this name of norfolk and the weight of the evidence adduce go to show that as far as any territorial connection with the county of that name go it be a misnomer and that it probably arise from the breed have be keep by one of the duke of norfolk most likely that one quote by blaine in he _ rural sport _ who be so jealous of he strain that it be only on the expressly stipulate condition that they be not to be allow to breed in the direct line that he would allow one to leave he kennel but when this old breed be take up by the sport spaniel society they decide to drop the name of norfolk and to revert to the old title of springer not perhaps a very happy choice as all spaniel be properly speak springer in contradistinction to setter the complete official designation on the kennel club 's register be english springer other than clumber sussex and field a very clumsy name for a breed there be no doubt that this variety of spaniel retain more resemblance to the old strain which belong to we forefather before the long and low idea find favor in the eye of exhibitor and it be certainly well worth preserve the only way nowadays by which uniformity of type can be obtain be by somebody have authority draw up a standard and scale of point for breeder to go by and the sport spaniel society be to be commend for have do this for the breed under notice the fruit of they action be already apparent in the larger and more uniform class to be see at show as the officially recognize life of the breed have be such a short one there be naturally not very many name of note among the prize-winner the principal breeder and owner have so far be mr w arkwright mr harry jone sir hugo fitzherbert mr c c bethune eversfield and mr winton smith they be undoubtedly the right dog for those who want spaniel to travel faster and cover more ground than the more ponderous and short-legged clumber sussex or field spaniel do but they work be hardly equal in finish and precision to that of either of the two former breed the following revise description of the english springer have be issue by the sport spaniel society : -- \* \* \* \* \* skull -- long and slightly arch on top fairly broad with a stop and well-developed temple jaw -- long and broad not snipy with plenty of thin lip eye -- medium size not too full but bright and intelligent of a rich brown ear -- of fair length low set and lobular in shape neck -- long strong and slightly arched shoulder -- long and sloping fore-leg -- of a moderate length straight with flat strong bone body -- strong with well-sprung rib good girth and chest deep and fairly broad loin -- rather long strong and slightly arched hind-quarter and hind-leg -- very muscular hock well let down stifle moderately bent and not twist inwards or outwards foot -- strong and compact stern -- low carry not above the level of the back and with a vibratory motion coat -- thick and smooth or very slightly wavy it must not be too long the feather must be only moderate on the ear and scanty on the leg but continue down to the heel color -- liver and white and black and white -lrb- with or without tan -rrb- fawn and white yellow and white also roan and self color of all these tint the pied color be preferable however as more easily see in cover general appearance -- a active compact dog upstand but by no means stilty he height at shoulder should about equal he length from the top of the withers to the root of the tail \* \* \* \* \* viii the welsh springer -- like the english springer the welsh springer have only very recently come into existence -- officially that be to say but he admirer claim for he that he have exist as a separate breed for a long time though not beyond the bound of the principality where he be refer to as the starter when he claim be first put forward they be vigorously contest by many who could claim to speak and write with authority upon the various breed of spaniel exist in these island and it be freely assert that they be nothing but crossbred between the ordinary springer and probably a clumber in order to account for the red or orange marking and the vine-leaf-shaped ear even if they be a new breed they be a most meritorious one both in they appearance which be eminently sport and workmanlike and for the excellence of they work in the field which have be amply demonstrate by the record earn at the field trial by mr a t william and other but those who have see they at work have nothing but good to say of they and for work large rough tract of country in team they admirer say they be unequalled in appearance they be decidedly attractive rather more lightly build than most spaniel small in size indeed very little larger than cocker invariably white in color with red or orange marking and possess rather fine head with small clumber-shaped ear they general appearance be that of extremely smart and active little dog the welsh springer be describe by the sport spaniel society as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* skull -- fairly long and fairly broad slightly round with a stop at the eye jaw -- medium length straight fairly square the nostril well develop and flesh color or dark a short chubby head be objectionable eye -- hazel or dark medium size not prominent not sunken nor show haw ear -- comparatively small and gradually narrow towards the tip cover with feather not longer than the ear set moderately low and hang close to the cheek neck -- strong muscular clean in throat shoulder -- long and sloping fore-leg -- medium length straight good bone moderately feathered body -- strong fairly deep not long well-sprung rib length of body should be proportionate to length of leg loin -- muscular and strong slightly arched well couple up and knit together hind-quarter and hind-leg -- strong hock well let down stifle moderately bent -lrb- not twist in or out -rrb- not feathered below the hock on the leg foot -- round with thick pad stern -- low never carry above the level of the back feathered and with a lively motion coat -- straight or flat and thick color -- red or orange and white general appearance -- symmetrical compact strong merry active not stilty build for endurance and activity and about 28 lb and upward in weight but not exceed 45 lb \* \* \* \* \* ix the cocker spaniel -- for the last few year the popularity of this smaller size branch of the spaniel tribe have be steadily increase and the cocker class at most of the best show be now remarkable both for the number of entry and the very high standard of excellence to which they attain a short time ago black cocker be decidedly more fashionable than they parti-coloured relative but now the reverse be the case and the various roan and tricolor have overtake and pass the other both in general quality and in the public esteem the reason for this popularity of the breed as a whole be not far to seek the affectionate and merry disposition of the cocker and he small size compare with that of the other breed pre-eminently fit he for a companion in the house as well as in the field and he rank among he admirer quite as many of the fairer sex as he do man -- a fact which be not without a certain element of danger since it should never be lose sight of that the breed be a sport one which should on no account be allow to degenerate into a race of mere house companion or toy small-sized spaniel usually call cocker from they be more especially use in woodcock shooting have be indigenous to wale and devonshire for many year and it be most likely from one or both of these source that the modern type have be evolve it be probable too that the type in favor to-day of a short couple rather cobby dog fairly high on the leg be more like that of these old-fashioned cocker than that which obtain a decade or two ago when they be scarcely recognize as a separate breed and the spaniel class be usually divide into field spaniel over 25 lb and field spaniel under 25 lb in those day a large proportion of the prize fall to miniature field spaniel the breed be not give official recognition on the kennel club 's register till 1893 nor a section to itself in the stud book and up to that date the only real qualification a dog require to be enable to compete as a cocker be that he should be under the weight of 25 lb a limit arbitrarily and somewhat irrationally fix since in the case of a animal just on the border-line he might very well have be a cocker before and a field spaniel after breakfast it be not easy to find authentic pedigree go back further than a quarter of a century but mr c a phillip can trace he own strain back to 1860 and mr jame farrow be exhibit successfully thirty-five year ago the former gentleman publish the pedigree of he bitch rivington dora for eighteen generation _ in extenso _ in _ the sport spaniel _ while the famous obo strain of the latter may be say to have exercise more influence than any other on the black variety both in this country and in the united state it be in 1880 that the most famous of all the pillar of the cocker stud mr jame farrow 's obo make he first bow to the public he and he litter sister sally have be bear the year before he win the highest honor that the show bench can give and the importance of he service to the breed both in he owner 's kennel and outside it can scarcely be over-estimated nearly all of the best black and many of the best color cocker be descend from he at this period the type mostly favor be that of a dog rather longer in the body and lower on the leg than it be at present but the obo family mark a progressive step and very rightly keep on win under all the best judge for many year they owner be far too good a judge himself ever to exhibit anything but first-class specimen -lrb- illustration : three generation of mr r de c peele 's blue roan cocker spaniel -- ch ben bowdler -lrb- father -rrb- ch bob bowdler -lrb- son -rrb- and ch dixon bowdler -lrb- grandson -rrb- _ from the painting by lilian cheviot _ -rrb- meanwhile although the black be far the most fashionable -- and it be say that it be hopeless to try to get the same quality in color specimen -- several enthusiastic breeder for color be quietly at work quite undismayed by the predilection show by most exhibitor and judge for the former color among they be mr c a phillip whose two bitch from mr jame freme of wepre hall flintshire succeed in breed from one of they whom he name rivington sloe the celebrated dog rivington signal who mate with rivington blossom produce rivington bloom who be in turn the dam of rivington redcoat these dog prove almost if not quite as valuable to the color variety as obo do to the black and form the foundation of mr j m porter 's celebrated braeside strain which afterwards become so famous during the last few year mr r de courcy peele 's kennel have easily hold the pride of place in this variety most reader be no doubt familiar with the many beautiful cocker which have appear in the show ring and carry off so many prize under the distinguishing affix bowdler he kennel be build up on a braeside foundation and have contain at one time or other such flyer as ben bowdler bob bowdler rufus bowdler dixon bowdler eva bowdler mary bowdler blue-coat bowdler susan bowdler and other and ben and bob have also be as sire responsible for the success of a good many dog hail from other kennel he have also be fairly successful with black which however have usually be purchase and not breed by he the two best be master reuben breed by miss joan godfrey and jetsam bowdler a bitch who have distinguish herself both in the ring and in the field color cocker be certainly boom just now and as a consequence the black who be equally worthy of support be be rather neglect certainly it be the case that whereas one see at most show big class of the former fill with a good level lot with hardly a bad specimen amongst they the class devote to the latter besides not be so well fill be much more uneven and always contain a large proportion of weed and toy a few year ago the black class be immeasurably superior to the color and it be to be hope that in the near future they will regain at least a position of equality with they at the last few field trial meeting the spaniel club have provide class confine to cocker which have fill fairly well and enable the small breed to demonstrate that it can in its way be quite as useful as its larger cousin a cocker can very often go and work as well where a larger spaniel can not even creep and for work really thick hedgerow or gorse have no superior there seem to be every prospect of a brilliant future and increase popularity for this charming breed its interest be look after both by the spaniel club and the comparatively newly form cocker spaniel club and it be also quite as much in favor on the other side of the atlantic as it be in the unite kingdom indeed the class in america and canada compare very favourably with we own the descriptive particulars of the breed be : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- not so heavy in proportion and not so high in occiput as in the modern field spaniel with a nicely develop muzzle or jaw lean but not snipy and yet not so square as in the clumber or sussex variety but always exhibit a sufficiently wide and well-developed nose forehead perfectly smooth rise without a too decide stop from muzzle into a comparatively wide and round well-developed skull with plenty of room for brain power eye -- full but not prominent hazel or brown color with a general expression of intelligence and gentleness though decidedly wideawake bright and merry never goggle nor weak as in the king charle and blenheim kind ear -- lobular set on low leather fine and not exceed beyond the nose well clothe with long silky hair which must be straight or wavy -- no positive curl or ringlet neck -- strong and muscular and neatly set on to fine sloping shoulder body -lrb- include size and symmetry -rrb- -- not quite so long and low as in the other breed of spaniel more compact and firmly knit together give the impression of a concentration of power and untiring activity weight -- the weight of a cocker spaniel of either sex should not exceed 25 lb or be less than 20 lb any variation either way should be penalize nose -- sufficiently wide and well develop to ensure the exquisite scent power of this breed shoulder and chest -- the former sloping and fine chest deep and well develop but not too wide and round to interfere with the free action of the fore-leg back and loin -- immensely strong and compact in proportion to the size and weight of the dog slightly slope towards the tail hind-quarter -- wide well round and very muscular so as to ensure untiring action and propel power under the most try circumstance of a long day bad weather rough ground and dense covert stern -- that most characteristic of blue blood in all the spaniel family may in the lighter and more active cocker although set low down be allow a slightly higher carriage than in the other breed but never cock up over but rather in a line with the back though the lower its carriage and action the better and when at work its action should be incessant in this the brightest and merriest of the whole spaniel family foot and leg -- the leg should be well bone feathered and straight for the tremendous exertion expect from this grand little sport dog and should be sufficiently short for concentrated power but not too short as to interfere with its full activity foot firm round and cat-like not too large spreading and loose joint this distinct breed of spaniel do not follow exactly on the line of the larger field spaniel either in lengthiness lowness or otherwise but be shorter in the back and rather higher on the leg coat -- flat or wave and silky in texture never wiry woolly or curly with sufficient feather of the right sort viz wave or setter-like but not too profuse and never curly general appearance -- confirmatory of all indicate above viz a concentration of pure blood and type sagacity docility good temper affection and activity chapter xxvi the basset-hound the basset be not familiarly know to british sportsman before 1863 in which year specimen of the breed be see at the first exhibition of dog hold in pari and cause general curiosity and admiration among english visitor in france however this hound have be use for generation much as we use we spaniel as a finder of game in covert and it have long be a popular sport dog in russium and germany in early time it be chiefly to be find in artoi and flander where it be suppose to have have its origin but the home of the better type of basset be now chiefly in la vendee in which department some remarkably fine strain have be produce there be three main strain of the french basset -- the lane the couteulx and the griffon the griffon basset be a hound with a hard bristly coat and short crooked leg it have never find great favor here the lane hound be derive from the kennel of m lane of franqueville bao seine-inferieure and be also very little appreciate in this country they be a lemon and white variety with _ torse _ or bent leg the couteulx hound be a type breed up into a strain by comte le couteulx de canteleu they be tricolor with straight short leg of sounder constitution than other strain with the make generally of a more agile hound and in the pedigree of the best basset own in this country fifteen year ago when the breed be in considerable demand comte de couteulx 's strain be prominent and always seek for with careful selection and judicious breeding we have now produce a beautiful hound of fine smooth coat and a rich admixture of marking with a head of noble character and the best of leg and foot they short twinkling leg make we basset more suitable for covert hunting than for hunting hare in the open to which latter purpose they have frequently be adapt with some success they note be resonant with wonderful power for so small a dog and in tone it resemble the voice of the bloodhound the basset-hound be usually very good temper and not incline to be quarrelsome with he kennel mate but he be wilful and love to roam apart in search of game and be not very amenable to discipline when alone on the other hand he work admirably with he companion in the pack when he be most painstaking and indefatigable endowed with remarkable power of scent he will hunt a drag with keen intelligence there be now several pack of basset keep in england and they show very fair sport after the hare but it be not they natural vocation and they massive build be against the possibility of they become popular as harrier the general custom be to follow they on foot although occasionally some sportsman use pony they pace however hardly warrant the latter expedient on the continent where big game be more common than with we the employment of the basset be vary he be a valuable help in the tracking of boar wolf and deer and he be also frequently engage in the lighter pastime of pheasant and partridge shooting the earl of onslow and the late sir john everett millai be among the earliest importer of the breed into england they both have recourse to the kennel of count couteulx sir john millai ' model be the first basset-hound exhibit at a english dog show at wolverhampton in 1875 later owner and breeder of prominence be mr g krehl mr stoke mr c c elli and mr mabel tottie as with most import breed the basset-hound when first exhibit be require to undergo a probationary period as a foreign dog in the variety class at the principal show it be not until 1880 that a class be provide for it by the kennel club it be to be regret that owner of this beautiful hound be not more numerous admirable specimen be still to be see at the lead exhibition but the breed be greatly in need of encouragement at the present time the smooth dog hound take the foremost place in the estimate of we most capable judge be mr w w m white 's ch loo-loo-loo breed by mr tottie by ch loui le beau out of sibellum mr croxton smith 's waverer be also a dog of remarkably fine type among bitch hound sandringham dido the favorite of she majesty the queen rank as the most perfect of she kind the rough or griffon-basset introduce into england at a later date than the smooth have fail for some reason to receive great attention in type it resemble the shaggy otterhound and as at present favor it be larger and higher on the leg than the smooth variety they coloring be less distinct and they seem generally to be lemon and white gray and sandy red they note be not so rich as that of the smooth variety in france the rough and the smooth basset be not regard as of the same race but here some breeder have cross the two variety with indifferent consequence some beautiful specimen of the rough basset have from time to time be send to exhibition from the sandringham kennel he majesty the king have always give affectionate attention to this breed and have take several first prize at the lead show latterly with sandringham bob breed in the home kennel by sandringham babil ex saracenesca perhaps the most explicit description of the perfect basset-hound be still that compile twenty-five year ago by sir john millai it be at least sufficiently comprehensive and exact to serve as a guide : -- \* \* \* \* \* the basset for its size have more bone perhaps than nearly any other dog the skull should be peak like that of the bloodhound with the same dignity and expression the nose black -lrb- although some of my own have white about theirs -rrb- and well flew for the size of the hound i think the tooth be extremely small however as they be not intend to destroy life this be probably the reason the ear should hang like the bloodhound 's and be like the softest velvet drapery the eye be a deep brown and be brimful of affection and intelligence they be pretty deeply set and should show a considerable haw a basset be one of those hound incapable of have a wicked eye the neck be long but of great power and in the _ basset a jambes torse _ the flew extend very nearly down to the chest the chest be more expansive than even in the bulldog and should in the _ basset a jambes torse _ be not more than two inch from the ground in the case of the _ basset a jambes demi-torse _ and _ jambe droite _ be generally lighter they chest do not of course come so low the shoulder be of great power and terminate in the crooked foot of the basset which appear to be a mass of joint the back and rib be strong and the former of great length the stern be carry gaily like that of hound in general and when the hound be on the scent of game this portion of he body get extremely animated and tell I in my own hound when they have strike a fresh or a cold scent and i even know when the foremost hound will give tongue the hind-quarter be very strong and muscular the muscle stand rigidly out down to the hock the skin be soft in the smooth haired dog and like that of any other hound but in the rough variety it be like that of the otterhound 's color of course be a matter of fancy although i infinitely prefer the tricolor which have a tan head and a black and white body chapter xxvii the dachshund person unfamiliar with the sport property of this long-bodied breed be apt to refer smilingly to the dachshund as the dog that be sell by the yard and few even of those who know he give credit to the debonair little fellow for the grim work which he be intend to perform in do battle with the vicious badger in its lair dachshund mean badger dog and it be a title fairly and squarely earn in he native germany give proper training he will perform the duty of several sport breed roll into one possess a wonderful nose combine with remarkable steadiness he kind will work out the coldest scent and once fairly on the line they will give plenty of music and get over the ground at a pace almost incredible dachshund hunt well in a pack and though it be not they recognize vocation they can be successfully use on hare on fox and any form of vermin that wear a furry coat but he legitimate work be direct against the badger in locate the brock under ground worry and drive he into he innermost earth and there hold he until dig out it be no part of he call to come to close grip though that often happen in the confine space in which he have to work in this position a badger with he powerful claw dig with such energy and skill as rapidly to bury himself and the dachshund need to be provide with such apparatus as will permit he to clear he way and keep in touch with he formidable quarry the badger be also hunt by dachshund above ground usually in the mountainous part of germany and in the grow crop of maize on the lower slope where the vermin work terrible havoc in the evening in this case the badger be round up and drive by the dog up to the gun which be post between the game and they earth for this sport the dog use be heavier coarser and of larger build higher on the leg and more generally houndy in appearance dachshund be frequently use for deer drive in which operation they be especially valuable as they work slowly and do not frighten or overrun they quarry and can penetrate the densest undergrowth pack of dachshund may sometimes be engage on wild boar and as they be web-footed and excellent swimmer there be no doubt that they terrier quality would make they useful assistant to the otterhound apropo of they capability in the water it be the case that a year or two ago at offenbach-on-main at some trial arrange for life-saving by dog a dachshund carry off the first prize against all comer as a companion in the house the dachshund have perhaps no compeer he be a perfect gentleman cleanly in he habit obedient unobtrusive incapable of smallness affectionate very sensitive to rebuke or to unkindness and amusingly jealous as a watch he be excellent quick to detect a strange footstep valiant to defend the threshold and to challenge with deep voice any intruder yet sensibly discerning he master 's friend and not annoy they with prolonged growling and grumble as many terrier do when a stranger be admit properly bring up he be a perfectly safe and amusing companion for child full of animal spirit and ever ready to share in a romp even though it be accompany by rough and tumble play in germany where he be the most popular of all dog large or small he be to be find in every home from the emperor 's palace downward and he quaint appearance couple with he entertaining personality be daily seize upon by the comic papers to illustrate countless joke at he expense the origin of the dachshund be not very clear some writer have profess to trace the breed or representation of it on the monument of the egyptian some aver that it be a direct descendant of the french basset-hound and other that he be related to the old turnspit -- the dog so excellent in kitchen service of whom dr caius write that when any meat be to be roasted they go into a wheel where they turn about with the weight of they body so diligently look to they business that no drudge nor scullion can do the feat more cunningly whom the popular sort hereupon term turnspit certainly the dog commonly use in this occupation be long of body and short of leg very much resemble the dachshund in all probability the dachshund be a manufactured breed -- a breed evolve from a large type of hound intermix with a terrier to suit the special condition involve in the pursuit and extermination of a quarry that unchecked be capable of seriously interfere with the cultivation of the land he comprise in he small person the characteristic of both hound and terrier -- he wonderful power of scent he long pendulous ear and for he size enormous bone speak of he descent from the hound that hunt by scent in many respects he favor the bloodhound and one may often see dachshund which have be breed from parent carefully select to accentuate some fancy point have exhibit the very pronounced peak -lrb- occipital bone -rrb- the protrude haw of the eye the loose dewlap and the color marking characteristic of the bloodhound he small stature iron heart and willingness to enter the earth bespeak the terrier cross the dachshund be first introduce to this country in sufficient number to merit notice in the early ` sixty and speedily attract notice by he quaint formation and undoubted sport instinct soon become a favorite at first appear at show in the foreign dog class he quickly receive a recognition of he claim to more favored treatment and be promote by the kennel club to a special classification as a sport dog since then he rise have be rapid and he now be reckon as one of the numerically largest breed exhibit unfortunately however he have be little if ever use for sport in the sense that apply in germany and this fact couple with year of breed from too small a stock -lrb- or stock too nearly related -rrb- and the insane strive after the fanciful and exaggerated point demand by judge at dog show many of whom never see a dachshund at he legitimate work have seriously affect he usefulness he have deteriorate in type lose grit and sense too and be often a parody of the true type of dachshund that be to be find in he native land to the reader who contemplate possess one or more dachshund a word of advice may be offer whether you want a dog for sport for show or as a companion endeavor to get a good one -- a well-bred one to arrive at this do not buy from a advertisement on you own knowledge of the breed but seek out a expert amateur breeder and exhibitor and get he advice and assistance if you intend to start a kennel for show purpose do not buy a high-priced dog at a show but start with a well-bred bitch and breed you own puppy under the guidance of the aforementioned expert in this way and by rear and keep you puppy till they be of a age to be exhibit and at the same time carefully note the award at the best show you will speedily learn which to retain and the right type of dog to keep and breed for and in future operation you will be able to discard inferior puppy at a earlier age but it be a great mistake if you intend to form a kennel for show purpose to sell or part with you puppy too early it be notorious with all breed that puppy change very much as they grow the best look in the nest often go wrong later and the ugly duckling turn out the best of the litter this be especially true of dachshund and it require a expert to pick the best puppy of a litter at a month or two old and even he may be at fault unless the puppy be exceptionally well rear to rear dachshund puppy successfully you must not overload they with fat -- give they strengthen food that do not lay on flesh lean raw beef finely chop be a excellent food once or twice a day for the first few month and though this come expensive it pay in the end raw meat be suppose to cause worm trouble but these pest be also find where meat be not give and in any case a puppy be fortify with more strength to withstand they if feed on raw meat than otherwise and a good dosing from time to time will be all that be necessary to keep he well and happy young grow puppy must have they freedom to gambol about and get they leg strong never keep the puppy coop up in a small kennel run or house if you have a fair-sized yard give they the run of that or even the garden in spite of what you gardener may say -- they may do a little damage to the flower but will assuredly do good to themselves they love to dig in the soft border : digging be second nature to they and be of great importance in they development if you have not a garden or if the flower be too sacred it be better to place you puppy as early as possible with respectable cottager or small farmer especially the latter with whom they will have entire freedom to run about and will not be overf if you intend to show you puppy you should begin some time in advance to school they to walk on the lead and to stand quiet when order to much depend on this in the judge ring where a dog who be unused to be on a lead often spoil he chance of appear at he best under the -lrb- to he -rrb- strange experience of restraint which the lead entail during the past five-and-twenty year the name of two particular dachshund stand out head and shoulder above those of they competitor : champion jackdaw and pterodactyl jackdaw have a wonderful record have during a long show career never be beat in he class from start to finish and have win many valuable prize he be credit with be the most perfect dachshund that have ever be see in england and probably as good as anything in germany ch jackdaw be a black and tan dog breed and own by mr harry jone of ipswich he be sire by ch charkow out of wagtail and bear 20th July 1886 through he dam he be descend from a famous bitch thusnelda who be import by mr mudie in the early ` eighty she be a winner of high honor in hanover the name of jackdaw figure in all the best pedigree of to-day ch pterodactyl be bear in 1888 and breed by mr willink he be in a measure a outcross from the standard type of the day and he dam whose pedigree be in dispute be think to have be import after pass through one or two hand he be purchase by mr harry jone and in he kennel speedily make a great name in the show ring and at the stud and be eventually sell for a high price to mr sidney woodiwiss who at that period have the largest kennel of dachshund in england ptero as he be call be a big light red dog with wonderful fore-quarter and great muscular development he also possess what be call a punish jaw and rather short ear and look a thorough business dog he have a almost unbroken series of success at show in england and be take to germany -lrb- in the day before the quarantine regulation -rrb- he take the highest honor in the heavy-weight class and a special prize for the best dachshund of all class this dog become the favorite sire of he day and the fashionable color the black and tan thereupon go quite out of favor and this fact couple with the reckless amount of inbreeding of red to red that have be go on since ptero 's day account largely for the prevalence of light eye pink nose and bad-coloured coat of the dachshund as a class to-day there be strictly speak three variety of dachshund -- -lrb- _ a _ -rrb- the short-haired -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- the long-haired and -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- the rough-haired of these we most usually find the first-named in england and they be no doubt the original stock of the other though fairly numerous in germany very few be to be see in this country and although one or two have be import the type have never seem to appeal to exhibitor both the long-haired and rough-haired variety have no doubt be produce by cross with other breed such as the spaniel and probably the irish terrier respectively in the long-haired variety the hair should be soft and wavy form lengthy plume under the throat lower part of the body and the back of the leg and it be longest on the under side of the tail where it form a regular flag like that of a setter or spaniel the rough-haired variety show strongly a terrier cross by he varmint expression and short ear the german also subdivide by color and again for show purpose by weight these subdivision be deal with in they proper order in the standard of point and it be only necessary to say here that all the variety color and weight be judge by the same standard except in so far as they differ in texture of coat at the same time the german themselves do not regard the dapple dachshund as yet so fix in type as the original color dog and this exception must also apply to the long and the rough haired variety the following german standard of point embody a detailed description of the breed : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance and disposition -- in general appearance the dachshund be a very long and low dog with compact and well-muscled body rest on short slightly crooked fore-leg a long head and ear with bold and defiant carriage and intelligent expression in disposition the dachshund be full of spirit defiant when

the muzzle wedge-shape the skull should be broad rather than narrow to allow plenty of brain room slightly arched and fairly straight without a stop but not deep or snipy eye -- medium in size oval and set obliquely with very clear sharp expression and of a dark color except in the case of the liver and tan when the eye may be yellow and in the dapple when the eye may be light or wall-eyed nose -- preferably deep black the flesh-coloured and spotted nose be allowable only in the liver and tan and dapple variety ear -- set on moderately high or see in profile above the level of the eye well back flat not fold pointed or narrow hanging close to the cheek very mobile and when at attention carry with the back of the ear upward and outward neck -- moderately long with slightly arched nape muscular and clean show no dewlap and carry well up and forward fore-quarter -- he work underground demand strength and compactness and therefore the chest and shoulder region should be deep long and wide the shoulder blade should be long and set on very slope the upper arm of equal length with and at right angle to the shoulder blade strong-boned and well-muscled and lie close to rib but move freely the lower arm be slightly bent inwards and the foot should be turn slightly outwards give a appearance of crooked leg approximate to the cabriole of a chippendale chair straight narrow short shoulder be always accompany by straight short upper arm form a obtuse angle badly develop brisket and keel or chicken breast and the upper arm be throw forward by the weight of the body behind cause the leg to knuckle over at the knee broad sloping shoulder on the other hand insure soundness of the fore-leg and foot leg and foot -- fore-leg very short and strong in bone slightly bent inwards see in profile moderately straight and never bend forward or knuckle over foot large round and strong with thick pad compact and well-arched toe nail strong and black the dog must stand equally on all part of the foot body -- should be long and muscular the chest very oval rather than very narrow and deep to allow ample room for heart and lung hang low between front leg the brisket point should be high and very prominent the rib well spring out towards the loin -lrb- not flat-sided -rrb- loin short and strong the line of back only slightly depressed behind shoulder and only slightly arch over loin the hind-quarter should not be higher than the shoulder thus give a general appearance of levelness hind-quarter -- the rump round broad and powerfully muscle hip bone not too short but broad and slope the upper arm or thigh thick of good length and joint at right angle to the hip bone the lower leg -lrb- or second thigh -rrb- be compare with other animal short and be set on at right angle to the upper thigh and be very firmly muscle the hind-leg be lighter in bone than the front one but very strongly muscle with well-rounded-out buttock and the knee joint well develop see from behind the leg should be wide apart and straight and not cowhock the dog should not be higher at the quarter than at shoulder stern -- set on fairly high strong at root and taper but not too long neither too much curved nor carry too high well but not too much feathered a bushy tail be better than too little hair coat and skin -- hair short and close as possible glossy and smooth but resistant to the touch if stroke the wrong way the skin tough and elastic but fitting close to the body color -- _ one color _ : -- there be several self-colours recognize include deep red yellowish red smutty red of these the dark or cherry red be preferable and in this color light shading on any part of the body or head be undesirable black be rare and be only a sport from black and tan _ two color _ : -- deep black brown -lrb- liver -rrb- or gray with golden or tan marking -lrb- spot -rrb- over the eye at the side of the jaw and lip inner rim of ear the breast inside and back of leg the foot and under the tail for about one-third of its length in the above-mentioned color white marking be objectionable the utmost that be allow be a small spot or a few hair on the chest _ dappled _ : -- a silver gray to almost white foundation color with dark irregular spot -lrb- small for preference -rrb- of dark gray brown tan or black the general appearance should be a bright indefinite coloration which be consider especially useful in a hunting dog weight -- dachshund in germany be classify by weight as follow : -- _ light-weight _ -- dog up to 16-1\/2 lb bitch up to 15-1\/2 lb _ middle-weight _ -- dog up to 22 lb bitch up to 22 lb _ heavy-weight _ -- over 22 lb _ toy _ -- up to 12 lb the german pound be one-tenth more than the english the light-weight dog be most use for go to ground chapter xxviii the old working terrier there can hardly have be a time since the period of the norman conquest when the small earth dog which we now call terrier be not know in these island and use by sport man as assistant in the chase and by husbandman for the killing of obnoxious vermin the two little dog show in the bayeux tapestry run with the hound in advance of king harold 's hawk party be probably mean for terrier dame juliana berner in the fifteenth century do not neglect to include the teroure in she catalogue of sport dog and a hundred year later dr caius give pointed recognition to they value in unearth the fox and draw the badger another sorte there be write the doctor 's translator in 1576 which hunteth the fox and the badger or greye onely whom we call terrar because they -lrb- after the manner and custome of ferret in search for connye -rrb- creep into the grounde and by that meane make afrayde nyppe and bite the foxe and the badger in such sorte that eyther they teare they in piece with theyr tooth bey in the bosome of the earth or else hayle and pull they perforce out of theyr lurk angle darke dongeon and close caue or at the least through cocen feare drive they out of theire hollow harbor in so much that they be compel to prepare speedie flyte and be desirous of the next -lrb- albeit not the safest -rrb- refuge be otherwise take and intrapp with snayre and nette layde over hole to the same purpose but these be the least in that kynde call sagax the color size and shape of the original terrier be not indicate by the early writer and art supplies but vague and uncertain evidence nichola cox who write of sport dog in _ the gentleman 's recreation _ -lrb- 1667 -rrb- seem to suggest that the type of work terrier be already fix sufficiently to be divide into two kind the one have shaggy coat and straight limb the other smooth coat and short bent leg yet some year later another authority -- blome -- in the same publication be more guard in he statement as to the terrier type when he write : everybody that be a fox hunter be of opinion that he have a good breed and some will say that the terrier be a peculiar species of itself i will not say anything to the affirmative or negative of the point search for evidence on the subject one find that perhaps the earliest reference to the color of terrier be make by daniel in he _ field sport _ at the end of the eighteenth century when he describe two sort the one rough short-legged and long-backed very strong and most commonly of a black or yellowish color mix with white -- evidently a hound-marked dog and another smooth-coated and beautifully form with a shorter body and more sprightly appearance generally of a reddish brown color or black with tan leg gilpin 's portrait of colonel thornton 's celebrated pitch paint in 1790 present a terrier have a smooth white coat with a black patch at the set-on of the undocked tail and black marking on the face and ear the dog 's head be badly draw and small in proportion but the body and leg and color would hardly disgrace the totteridge kennel of to-day fox-terrier of a note strain be depict from life by reinagle in _ the sportsman 's cabinet _ publish over a hundred year ago and in the text accompany the engrave a minute account be give of the peculiarity and work capacity of the terrier we be tell that there be two breed : the one wire-haired larger more powerful and harder bite the other smooth-haired and smaller with more style the wire-hair be white with spot the smooth be black and tan the tan apparently predominate over the black the same writer state that it be customary to take out a brace of terrier with a pack of hound a larger and a smaller one the smaller dog be use in emergency when the earth prove to be too narrow to admit he bigger companion it be well know that many of the old fox hunter have keep they special breed of terrier and the belvoir the grove and lord middleton 's be among the pack to which particular terrier strain have be attach that even a hundred year ago terrier be breed with care and that certain strain be hold in especial value be show by the record fact that a litter of seven puppy be sell for twenty-one guinea -- a good price even in these day -- and that on one occasion so high a sum as twenty guinea be pay for a full-grown dog at that time there be no definite and well-established breed recognize throughout the island by a specific name the embrace title of terrier include all the variety which have since be carefully differentiate but very many of the breed exist in they respective locality await national recognition here and there some squire or huntsman nurture a particular strain and develop a type which he keep pure and at many a manor-house and farmstead in devonshire and cumberland on many a highland estate and irish riverside where there be fox to be hunt or otter to be kill terrier of definite strain be religiously cherish several of these still survive and be as respectable in descent and quite as important historically as some of the favor and fashionable champion of we time they do not perhaps possess the outward beauty and distinction of type which would justify they be bring into general notice but as worker they retain all the fire and verve that be require in dog that be expect to encounter such vicious vermin as the badger and the fox some of the breed of terrier see nowadays in every dog show be equally obscure and unknown a few year back thirty-seven year ago the now popular irish terrier be practically unknown in england and the scottish terrier be only begin to be recognize as a distinct breed the welsh terrier be quite a new introduction that a dozen or so year ago be seldom see outside the principality and so recently as 1881 the airedale be merely a local dog know in yorkshire as the waterside or the bingley terrier yet the breed just mention be all of unimpeachable ancestry and the circumstance that they be formerly breed within limited neighborhood be in itself a argument in favor of they purity we have see the process of a sudden leap into recognition enact during the past few year in connection with the white terrier of the western highland -- a dog which be familiarly know in argyllshire century ago yet which have only lately emerge from the heathery hillside around poltalloch to become a attraction on the bench at the crystal palace and on the lawn of the botanical garden and the example suggest the possibility that in another decade or so the neglect sealyham terrier the ignore terrier of the border and the almost forget jack russell strain may have claim a due recompense for they long neglect there be lover of the hard-bitten work earth dog who still keep these strain inviolate and who greatly prefer they to the better-known terrier whose natural activity have be too often atrophy by a system of artificial breed to show point few of these old unregistered breed would attract the eye of the fancier accustomed to judge a dog parade before he in the show ring to know they value and to appreciate they sterling good quality one need to watch they at work on badger or when they hit upon the line of a otter it be then that they display the alertness and the dare-devil courage which have win for the english terrier they name and fame a excellent work terrier be the white rough-haired strain keep by the rev john russell in devonshire and distribute among privileged sportsman about somersetshire and gloucestershire the work attribute of these energetic terrier have long be understand and the smart plucky little dog have be constantly covet by breeder all over the country but they have never win the popularity they deserve those who have keep both variety prefer the russell to the sealyham terrier which be nevertheless a excellent worker it be on record that one of these a bitch of only 9 lb weight fight and kill single-handed a full-grown dog-fox the sealyham derive its breed name from the seat of the edwarde family near haverfordwest in pembrokeshire where the strain have be carefully preserve for well over a century it be a long-bodied short-legged terrier with a hard wiry coat frequently whole white but also white with black or brown marking or brown with black they may be as heavy as 17 lb but 12 lb be the average weight some year ago the breed seem to be on the down grade require fresh blood from a well-chosen outcross one hear very little concern they nowadays but it be certain that when in they prime they possess all the grit determination and endurance that be look for in a good working terrier a wire-haired black and tan terrier be once common in suffolk and norfolk where it be much use for rabbit but it may now be extinct or if not extinct probably identify with the welsh terrier which it closely resemble in size and color there be also in shropshire a well-known breed of wire-hair terrier black and tan on very short leg and weigh about 10 lb or 12 lb with long punish head and extraordinary work power so too in lancashire and cheshire one use to meet with sandy-coloured terrier of no very well authenticate strain but closely resemble the present breed of irish terrier and squire thornton at he place near pickering in yorkshire have a breed of wire-hairs tan in color with a black stripe down the back then there be the cowley strain keep by the cowley of calliper near king 's langley these be white wire-haired dog mark like the fox-terrier and exceedingly game possibly the elterwater terrier be no longer to be find but some few of they still exist a dozen year or so ago in the lake district where they be use in conjunction with the west cumberland otterhound they be not easily distinguishable from the better-known border terrier of which there be still many strain range from northumberland where mr t robson of bellingham have keep they for many year to galloway and ayrshire and the lothian where they coat become longer and less crisp there be many more local variety of the work terrier as for example the roseneath which be often confuse with the poltalloch or white west highlander to whom it be possibly related and the pittenweem with which the poltalloch terrier be now be cross while mr alastair campbell of ardrishaig have a pack of cairn terrier which seem to represent the original type of the improve scottie consider the great number of strain that have be preserve by sport family and maintain in more or less purity to type it be easy to understand how a new breed may become fashionable and still claim the honor of long descent they may not in all case have the beauty of shape which be desire on the show bench but it be well to remember that while we show terrier have be breed to the highest perfection we still possess in great britain a separate order of earth dog that for pluckily follow the fox and the badger into they lair or bolt a otter from he holt can not be excel all the world over chapter xxix the white english terrier this dog one would think ought by the dignified title which he bear to be consider a representative national terrier form a fourth in the distinctively british quartette whose other member be the scottish the irish and the welsh terrier possibly in the early day when pearson and roocroft breed he to perfection it be hope and intend that he should become a breed typical of england he be still the only terrier who own the national name but he have long ago yield pride of place to the fox-terrier and it be the case that the best specimen of he race be breed north of the border while instead of be the most popular dog in the land he be actually one of the most neglect and the most seldom see at the kennel club show of 1909 there be not a single specimen of the breed on view nor be one to be find at the recent show at edinburgh birmingham manchester or islington nor at the national terrier show at westminster it be a pity that so smart and beautiful a dog should be suffer to fall into such absolute neglect one wonder what the reason of it can be possibly it be that the belief still prevail that he be of delicate constitution and be not gifted with a great amount of intelligence or sagacity there be no doubt however that a potent factor in hasten the decline be to be find in the edict against crop neither the white terrier nor the manchester terrier have since be anything like so popular as they both be before April 1898 when the kennel club pass the law that dog ' ear must not be crop writer on canine history and mr rawdon lee among the number tell we that the english white terrier be a comparatively new breed and that there be no evidence to show where he originally spring from who produce he or for what reason he be introduce he existence as a distinct breed be date back no longer than forty year this be about the accept age of most of we name english terrier half a century ago before the institution of properly organise dog show draw particular attention to the differentiation of breed the generic term terrier without distinction be apply to all earth dog and the consideration of color and size be the only common rule observe in breed but it would not be difficult to prove that a white terrier resemble the one now under notice exist in england as a separate variety many generation anterior to the period usually assign to its recognition in the national portrait gallery there be a portrait of mary of modena queen consort of jame ii paint in 1670 by william wissing who have introduce at the queen 's side a terrier that be undoubtedly of this type the dog have slight brown or brindle marking on the back as many english white terrier have and it be to be presume that it be of the breed from which this variety be descend apart from color there be not a great difference between the white english terrier and the manchester black and tan but although they be of similar shape and partake much of the same general character yet there be the distinction that in the black and tan the conservation of type be stronger and more noticeable than in the white in which the correct shape and action be difficult to obtain it ought naturally to be easier to breed a pure white dog from white parent than to breed correctly marked and well tan puppy from perfect black and tan but the effort of many breeder do not seem to support such a theory in connection with the english terrier whose litter frequently show the blemish of a spot of brindle or russet these spot usually appear behind the ear or on the neck and be of course a disfigurement on a dog whose coat to be perfect should be of a intense and brilliant white it appear to be equally difficult to breed one which while have the desire purity of color be also perfect in shape and terrier character it be to be note too that many otherwise good specimen be deaf -- a fault which seriously militate against the dog 's possibility as a companion or as a watch birmingham and manchester be the locality in which the english terrier be most popular forty year ago but it be mr frederick white of clapham who breed all the best of the white variety and who make it popular in the neighborhood of london he terrier be of a strain found by a dog name king dick and in 1863 he exhibit a notable team in laddie fly teddie and nettle mr s e shirley m p be attract to the breed and possess many good example as also do the rev j w mellor and mr j h murchison mr alfr benjamin 's silvio be a prominent dog in 1877 silvio be breed by mr jame roocroft of bolton who own a large kennel of this variety of terrier and who join with he townsman joe walker and with bill pearson in raise the breed to popularity in lancashire bill pearson be the breeder of tim who be consider the best terrier of he time a dog of 14 lb with a brilliant white coat the darkest of eye and a perfect black nose it be apparent that the whippet be largely use as a cross with the english terrier which may account to a great extent for the decline of terrier character in the breed wiser breeder have recourse to the more closely ally bull-terrier mr shirley 's prize win purity be by tim out of a bull-terrier bitch and there be no doubt that whatever stamen remain in the breed have be support by this cross the follow be the description lay down by the white english terrier club : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- narrow long and level almost flat skull without cheek muscle wedge-shaped well fill up under the eye taper to the nose and not lippy eye -- small and black set fairly close together and oblong in shape nose -- perfectly black ear -- crop and stand perfectly erect neck and shoulder -- the neck should be fairly long and taper from the shoulder to the head with sloping shoulder the neck be free from throatiness and slightly arch at the occiput chest -- narrow and deep body -- short and curving upward at the loin spring out behind the shoulder back slightly arch at loin and fall again at the join of the tail to the same height as the shoulder leg -- perfectly straight and well under the body moderate in bone and of proportionate length foot -- foot nicely arch with toe set well together and more inclined to be round than hare-footed tail -- moderate length and set on where the arch of the back end thick where it join the body taper to a point and not carry higher than the back coat -- close hard short and glossy color -- pure white color mark to disqualify condition -- flesh and muscle to be hard and firm weight -- from 12 lb to 20 lb chapter xxx the black and tan terrier the black and tan or manchester terrier as we know he to-day be a comparatively new variety and he be not to be confound with the original terrier with tan and black coloring which be refer to by dr caius in the sixteenth century and which be at that time use for go to ground and drive out badger and fox formerly there be but little regard pay to color and marking and there be a considerably greater proportion of tan in the coat than there be at the present day while the fancy marking such as pencilled toe thumb mark and kiss spot be not cultivate the general outline of the dog too be less graceful and altogether coarser during the first half of the nineteenth century the chief accomplishment of this terrier be rat-killing there be some extraordinary account of he adroitness as well as courage in destroy these vermin the feat of a dog call billy be record he be match to destroy one hundred large rat in eight minute and a half the rat be bring into the ring in bag and as soon as the number be complete billy be put over the railing into they midst in six minute and thirty-five seconds they be all destroy in another match he kill the same number in six minute and thirteen seconds it be a popular terrier in lancashire and it be in this county that the refining process in he shape and color be practice and where he come by the name of the manchester terrier like the white english terrier the black and tan have fall on evil day it be not a popular dog among fancier and although many good one may be see occasionally about the street the breed suffer from want of the care and attention that be incidental to the breeding and rearing of dog intend for competition at show there be many who hold the opinion that one of the chief reason for the decadence in the popularity of the black and tan terrier notwithstanding its many claim to favor be to be find in the loss of that very alert appearance which be a general characteristic before the kennel club make it illegal to crop the ear of such as be intend for exhibition it must be admit that until very recently there be a considerable amount of truth in the prevalent opinion inasmuch as a rather heavy ear if carry erect be the best material to work upon and from which to produce the long fine and upright or pricked effect which be look upon as be the correct thing in a crop dog hence it follow that no care be take to select breed stock likely to produce the small semi-erect well-carried and thin ear require to-day consequently when the edict forbid the use of scissors come into force there be very few small-eared dog to be find it have take at least ten or a dozen year to eradicate the mischief and even yet the cure be not complete another factor which have have a bad effect be the belief which have become much too prevalent that a great deal of fake have be practice in the past and that it have be so cleverly perform as to deceive the most observant judge whereby a very artificial standard of quality have be obtain the standard of point by which the breed should be judge be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- a terrier calculate to take he own part in the rat pit and not of the whippet type head -- the head should be long flat and narrow level and wedge-shaped without show cheek muscle well fill up under the eye with taper tightly-lipped jaw and level tooth eye -- the eye should be very small sparkling and bright set fairly close together and oblong in shape nose -- black ear -- the correct carriage of ear be a debatable point since crop have be abolish probably in the large breed the drop ear be correct but for toy either erect or semi-erect carriage of the ear be most desirable neck and shoulder -- the neck should be fairly long and taper from the shoulder to the head with sloping shoulder the neck be free from throatiness and slightly arch at the occiput chest -- the chest should be narrow but deep body -- the body should be moderately short and curving upward at the loin rib well spring back slightly arch at the loin and fall again at the join of the tail to the same height as the shoulder foot -- the foot should be more inclined to be cat - than hare-footed tail -- the tail should be of moderate length and set on where the arch of the back end thick where it join the body taper to a point and not carry higher than the back coat -- the coat should be close smooth short and glossy color -- the coat should be jet black and rich mahogany tan distribute over the body as follow : on the head the muzzle be tan to the nose which with the nasal bone be jet black there be also a bright spot on each cheek and above each eye the underjaw and throat be tan and the hair inside the ear be the same color the fore-leg tan up to the knee with black line -lrb- pencil mark -rrb- up each toe and a black mark -lrb- thumb mark -rrb- above the foot inside the hind-legs tan but divide with black at the hock joint and under the tail also tan and so be the vent but only sufficiently to be easily cover by the tail also slightly tan on each side of the chest tan outside the hind-leg -- commonly call breeching -- be a serious defect in all case the black should not run into the tan nor _ vice versa _ but the division between the two color should be well define weight -- for toy not exceed 7 lb for the large breed from 10 to 20 lb be most desirable chapter xxxi the bull-terrier the bull-terrier be now a gentlemanly and respectably own dog wear a immaculate white coat and a burnish silver collar he have dealings with aristocracy and be no longer contemn for keep bad company but a generation or two ago he be commonly the associate of rogue and vagabond skulk at the heel of such member of society as mr william sike whom he accompany at night on darksome business to keep watch outside while bill be within crack the crib in those day the dog 's ear be closely crop not for the sake of embellishment but as a measure of protection against the fang of he opponent in the pit when money be lay upon the result of a well-fought fight to the death for fighting be the acknowledged vocation of he order and he be breed and train to the work he know something of rat too and many of he kind be fame in the land for they prowess in this direction jimmy shaw 's jacko could finish off sixty rat in three minute and on one occasion make a record by kill a thousand in a trifle over a hour and a half the breed be sufficiently modern to leave no doubt as to its derivation in the first quarter of the nineteenth century attention be be direct to the improvement of terrier generally and new type be seek for they be alert agile little dog excellent for work in the country but the extravagant corinthian of the time -- the young gamester who patronise the prize-ring and the cock-pit -- desire to have a dog who should do something more than kill rat or unearth the fox or bolt the otter : which accomplishment afford no amusement to the town they want a dog combine all the dash and gameness of the terrier with the heart and courage and fight instinct of the bulldog wherefore the terrier and the bulldog be cross a large type of terrier be choose and this would be the smooth-coated black and tan or the early english white terrier but probably both be use indifferently and for a considerable period the result give the young buck what they require : a dog that be at once a determine vermin killer and a intrepid fighter upon whose skill in the pit wager might with confidence be lay the animal however be neither a true terrier nor a true bulldog but a uncompromising mongrel albeit he serve he immediate purpose and be highly value for he pertinacity if not for he appearance in 1806 lord camelford possess one for which he have pay the very high price of eighty-four guinea and which he present to belcher the pugilist this dog be figure in _ the sport magazine _ of the time he be a short-legged thick-set fawn-coloured specimen with closely amputated ear a broad blunt muzzle and a considerable lay-back and this be the kind of dog which continue for many year to be know as the bull-and-terrier he be essentially a man 's dog and be vastly in favor among the undergraduate of oxford and cambridge gradually the bulldog element at first pronounced be reduce to something like a fourth degree and with the terrier character predominate the head be sharpen the limb be lengthen and straighten until little remain of the bulldog strain but the dauntless heart and the fearless fighting spirit together with the frequent reversion to brindle color which be the last outward and visible characteristic to disappear within the remembrance of man not yet old the bull-terrier be as much marked with fawn brindle or even black as be the fox-terrier of we own period but fifty year or so ago white be become frequent and be much admire a strain of pure white be breed by jame hink a well-known dog-dealer of birmingham and it be no doubt to hink that we be indebted for the elegant bull-terrier of the type that we know to-day these birmingham dog show a refinement and grace and a absence of the crook-leg and color patch which betray that hink have be use a out-cross with the english white terrier thus get away further still from the bulldog with the advent of the hink strain in 1862 the short-faced dog fall into disrepute and pure white become the accept color there be a wide latitude in the matter of weight if all other point be good a dog might weigh anything between 10 and 38 lb but class be usually divide for those above and those below 16 lb the type become fix and it be rule that the perfect bull-terrier must have a long head wide between the ear level jaw a small black eye a large black nose a long neck straight fore-leg a small hare foot a narrow chest deep brisket powerful loin long body a tail set and carry low a fine coat and small ear well hang and drop forward idstone who write this description in 1872 earnestly insist that the ear of all dog should be leave uncut and as nature make they but for twenty year thereafter the ear of the bull-terrier continue to be crop to a thin erect point the practice of crop it be true be even then illegal and punishable by law but although there be occasional conviction under the cruelty to animal act the dog owner who admire the alertness and perkiness of the cut ear ignore the risk they run and it be not until the kennel club take resolute action against the practice that crop be entirely abandon the president of the kennel club mr s e shirley m p have himself be a prominent owner and breeder of the bull-terrier he nelson breed by joe willock be celebrate as a excellent example of the small-sized terrier at a time however when there be not a great many competitor of the highest quality he dick also be a remarkably good dog earlier specimen which have leave they name in the history of the breed be hink 's old dutch who be perhaps even a more perfect terrier than the same breeder 's madman and puss lancashire and yorkshire have always be note for good bull-terrier and the best of the breed have usually be produce in the neighborhood of leed bradford manchester bolton and liverpool while birmingham also share in the reputation at one time londoner give careful attention to the breed stimulate thereto by the encouragement of mr shirley and the success of alfred george of recent year the bull-terrier have not be a great favorite and it have sadly deteriorate in type but there be sign that the variety be again come into repute and within the past two year many admirable specimen -- as nearly perfect perhaps as many that win honor in former generation -- have be bring into prominence among dog for example there be mr e t pimm 's sweet lavender dr m amsler 's macgregor mr chri houlker 's he highness and mr j hayne ' bloomsbury young king among bitch there be mr kip 's delphinium wild and desdemona mr hornby 's lady sweetheart mr w mayor 's mill girl mr t gannaway 's charlwood belle dr j w low 's bess of hardwicke and mr e g money 's eastbourne tarqueenia while these and such as these beautiful and typical terrier be be breed and exhibit there be no cause to fear a further decline in popularity for a variety so eminently engage the club description be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- the general appearance of the bull-terrier be that of a symmetrical animal the embodiment of agility grace elegance and determination head -- the head should be long flat and wide between the ear taper to the nose without cheek muscle there should be a slight indentation down the face without a stop between the eye the jaw should be long and very powerful with a large black nose and open nostril eye small and very black almond shape prefer the lip should meet as tightly as possible without a fold the tooth should be regular in shape and should meet exactly any deviation such as pigjaw or be underhung be a great fault ear -- the ear when crop should be do scientifically and accord to fashion crop dog can not win a prize at show hold under kennel club rule if bear after march 31st 1895 when not crop it should be a semi-erect ear but other do not disqualify neck -- the neck should be long and slightly arched nicely set into the shoulder taper to the head without any loose skin as find in the bulldog shoulder -- the shoulder should be strong muscular and slant the chest wide and deep with rib well round back -- the back short and muscular but not out of proportion to the general contour of the animal leg -- the fore-leg should be perfectly straight with well-developed muscle not out at shoulder but set on the racing line and very strong at the pastern joint the hind-leg be long and in proportion to the fore-leg muscular with good strong straight hock well let down near the ground foot -- the foot more resemble those of a cat than a hare color -- should be white coat -- short close and stiff to the touch with a fine gloss tail -- short in proportion to the size of the dog set on very low down thick where it join the body and taper to a fine point it should be carry at a angle of about 45 degree without curl and never over the back height at shoulder -- from 12 to 18 inch weight -- from 15 lb to 50 lb chapter xxxii the smooth fox-terrier to attempt to set forth the origin of the fox-terrier as we know he to-day would be of no interest to the general reader and would entail the task of trace back the several heterogeneous source from which he spring it be a matter of very little moment whether he owe he origin to the white english terrier or to the bull-terrier cross with the black and tan or whether he have a mixture of beagle blood in he composition so it will suffice to take he as he emerge from the chaos of mongreldom about the middle of the last century rescue in the first instance by the desire of huntsman or master of well-known pack to produce a terrier somewhat in keep with they hound and in the second place to the advent of dog show prior to that time any dog capable from he size conformation and pluck of go to ground and bolt he fox be a fox-terrier be he rough or smooth black brown or white the starting-point of the modern fox-terrier date from about the ` sixty and no pedigree before that be worth consider from three dog then well know -- old jock trap and tartar -- he claim descent and thanks to the fox-terrier club and the great care take in compile they stud-book he can be bring down to to-day of these three dog old jock be undoubtedly more of a terrier than the other it be a moot point whether he be breed as state in most record of the time by captain percy william master of the rufford or by jack morgan huntsman to the grove it seem however well establish that the former own he sire also call jock and that he dam grove pepper be the property of morgan he first come before the public at the birmingham show in 1862 where show by mr wootton of nottingham he win first prize he subsequently change hand several time till he become the property of mr murchison in whose hand he die in the early ` seventy he be exhibit for the last time at the crystal palace in 1870 and though then over ten year old win second to the same owner 's trimmer at he best he be a smart well-balanced terrier with perhaps too much daylight under he and want somewhat in jaw power but he show far less of the bull-terrier type than do he contemporary tartar this dog 's antecedent be very questionable and he breeder be give as mr stevenson of chester most of whose dog be bull-terrier pure and simple save that they have drop ear and short stern be in this respect unlike old trap whose sire be generally suppose to have be a black and tan terrier this dog come from the oakley kennel and he be suppose to have be breed by a miller at leicester however questionable the antecedent of these three terrier may have be they be undoubtedly the progenitor of we present strain and from they arise the kennel that we have to-day mention have be make of mr murchison and to he we owe in a great measure the start in popularity which since the foundation of he large kennel the fox-terrier have enjoy mr murchison 's chief opponent in the early ` seventy be mr gibson of brockenhurst with he dog tyke and old foiler mr luke turner of leicester with he belvoir strain which later give we ch brockenhurst joe ch olive and she son ch spice mr theodore bassett mr allison and a year or so later mr frederick burbidge the messr clarke mr tinne mr franci redmond and mr vicary about this time a tremendous impetus be give to the breed by the formation in 1876 of the fox-terrier club which owe its inception to mr harding cox and a party of enthusiast seat round he dinner table at 36 russell square among whom be messr bassett burbidge doyle allison and redmond the last two name be still member of the club the idea be very warmly welcome a committee form and a scale of point draw up which with but one alteration be in vogue to-day every prominent exhibitor or breeder then and with few exception since have be a member and the club be by far the strongest of all specialist club it will be well to give here the say standard of point \* \* \* \* \* head and ear -- the _ skull _ should be flat and moderately narrow and gradually decrease in width to the eye not much stop should be apparent but there should be more dip in the profile between the forehead and top jaw than be see in the case of a greyhound the _ cheek _ must not be full the _ ear _ should be v-shaped and small of moderate thickness and drop forward close to the cheek not hang by the side of the head like a foxhound 's the _ jaw _ upper and under should be strong and muscular should be of fair punish strength but not so in any way to resemble the greyhound or modern english terrier there should not be much fall away below the eye this part of the head should however be moderately chisel out so as not to go down in a straight line like a wedge the _ nose _ towards which the muzzle must gradually taper should be black the _ eye _ should be dark in color small and rather deep set full of fire life and intelligence as nearly as possible circular in shape the _ tooth _ should be as nearly as possible level _ ie _ the upper tooth on the outside of the lower tooth neck -- should be clean and muscular without throatiness of fair length and gradually widen to the shoulder shoulder and chest -- the _ shoulder _ should be long and sloping well lay back fine at the point and clearly cut at the withers the _ chest _ deep and not broad back and loin -- the _ back _ should be short straight and strong with no appearance of slackness the _ loin _ should be powerful and very slightly arch the fore rib should be moderately arch the back rib deep and the dog should be well rib up hind-quarter -- should be strong and muscular quite free from droop or crouch the thigh long and powerful hock near the ground the dog stand well up on they like a foxhound and not straight in the stifle stern -- should be set on rather high and carry gaily but not over the back or curl it should be of good strength anything approach a pipe-stopper tail be especially objectionable leg and foot -- the _ leg _ view in any direction must be straight show little or no appearance of a ankle in front they should be strong in bone throughout short and straight to pastern both fore and hind leg should be carry straight forward in travel the stifle not turn outwards the elbow should hang perpendicular to the body work free of the side the _ foot _ should be round compact and not large the sole hard and tough the toe moderately arch and turn neither in nor out coat -- should be straight flat smooth hard dense and abundant the belly and under side of the thigh should not be bare as regard color white should predominate brindle red or liver marking be objectionable otherwise this point be of little or no importance symmetry size and character -- the dog must present a general gay lively and active appearance bone and strength in a small compass be essential but this must not be take to mean that a fox-terrier should be cloggy or in any way coarse -- speed and endurance must be look to as well as power and the symmetry of the foxhound take as a model the terrier like the hound must on no account be leggy nor must he be too short in the leg he should stand like a cleverly-made hunter cover a lot of ground yet with a short back as before state he will then attain the highest degree of propel power together with the greatest length of stride that be compatible with the length of he body weight be not a certain criterion of a terrier 's fitness for he work -- general shape size and contour be the main point and if a dog can gallop and stay and follow he fox up a drain it matter little what he weight be to a pound or so though roughly speak it may be say he should not scale over twenty pound in show condition disqualify point : nose -- white cherry or spot to a considerable extent with either of these color ear -- prick tulip or rise mouth -- much overshot or much undershot \* \* \* \* \* in order to give some idea of the extraordinary way in which the fox-terrier take the public taste it will be necessary to hark back and give a _ resume _ of the principal kennel and exhibitor to whom this be due in the year in which the fox-terrier club be form mr fred burbidge at one time captain of the surrey eleven have the principal kennel he be the pluckiest buyer of he day and once he fancy a dog nothing stop he till it be in he kennel he buy nimrod dorca tweezers and nettle and with they and other discriminate purchase he be very hard to beat on the show-bench strange to say at this time he seem unable to breed a good dog and determine to have a clear out and start afresh a few brood bitch only be retain and the kennel move from champion hill to hunton bridge in hertfordshire from thence in a few year come bloom blossom tweezers ii hunton baron hunton bridegroom and a host of other which spread the fame of the great hunton strain when the kennel be disperse at mr burbidge 's untimely death in 1892 the dog 130 lot in all be sell by auction and realize p1800 hunton tartar fetch p135 justice p84 bliss p70 and scramble p65 messr a h and c clarke be at this time quietly found a kennel which perhaps have leave its mark more indelibly on the breed than any before or since brockenhurst rally be a most fortunate purchase from he breeder mr herbert peel and be by brockenhurst joe from a bitters bitch as from this dog come roysterer and ruler they dam be jess a old turk bitch and from rollick by buff be breed ruse and ransome roysterer be the sire of result by many consider the best fox-terrier dog of all time and result 's own daughter rachel be certainly the best bitch of she day all these terrier have intense quality and style due for the most part to inbreed very little new blood be introduce with a inevitable result and by degree the kennel die out no history of the fox-terrier could be complete without mention of mr franci redmond and he kennel go back as it do to the murchison and luke turner period and be still to-day the most prominent one in existence we can date he earlier effort from he purchase of deacon nettle the dam of deacon ruby dusty be the dam of ch diamond dust dickon he have from luke turner and in this dog we have one of the foundation-stone of the fox-terrier stud-book as he be the sire of splinter who in he turn be the sire of vesuvian mr redmond 's next great winner be d'orsay and dominie two sterling good terrier the former of which be the sire of dame d'orsay who breed to despoiler produce dame fortune the mother of donna fortuna whose other parent be dominie donna fortuna consider universally the best specimen of a fox-terrier ever produce have from the first a brilliant career for though fearlessly show on all occasion she never know defeat some take exception to she want of what be call terrier character and other would have like she a shade smaller but we have still to see the fox-terrier take all round that could beat she as a outcross mr redmond purchase dreadnought one of the highest class dog see for many year but have very bad luck with he a accident prevent he from be show and subsequently cause he early death we must not forget duchess of durham or dukedom but to enumerate all mr redmond 's winner it would be necessary to take the catalogue of all the important show hold for the past thirty year to no one do we owe so much no one have make such a study of the breed reduce it almost to a science with the result that even outside he kennel no dog have any chance of permanently hold he own unless he have a ample supply of the blood the great opponent of the totteridge kennel up to some few year ago be unquestionably mr vicary of newton abbot who lay the foundation of he kennel with vesuvian who be by splinter out of kohinor and from whom come the long line of winner venio-vesuvienne vice-regal valuator visto and veracity fierce war rage round these kennel each have its admiring and devoted adherent until one side would not look at anything but a redmond terrier to the exclusion of the vicary type the newton abbot strain be remarkable for beautiful head and great quality but be faulty in foot and not absolute as to front each of which property be a _ sine qua non _ amongst the totteridge dog latter-day breeder have recognize that in the cross of the two perfection lie and mr redmond himself have not hesitate to go some way on the same road -lrb- illustration : fox terrier 1 mr j h brown 's ch captain double

enthusiastically its votary pursue it otherwise we should not have amongst we man like mr j c tinne whose name be now a household word in the fox-terrier world as it have be any time for the past thirty year close proximity in those day to mr gibson at brockenhurst make he all the keener and one of he first terrier be a bitch of that blood by bitters with daughter of old foiler he do very well

respectively auburn and brockenhurst dainty from the latter pair spring lottery and worry the granddam of tom newcome to whom we owe brockenhurst agne brockenhurst dame and dinah morri and consequently adam bede and hester sorrel it have always be mr tinne 's principle to aim at produce the best terrier he could irrespective of the fad of this kennel or that and he judgment have be amply vindicate as the prize list of every large show will testify and to-day he be the proud possessor of ch the sylph who have beat every one of she sex and be consider by many about the best fox-terrier ever see no name be better know or more highly respect by dog owner than that of the late mr j a doyle as a writer breeder judge or exhibitor of fox-terrier whilst breed largely from he own stock he be ever on the look-out for a likely outcross he lay great store on terrier character and be a stickler for good coat a point much neglect in the present-day dog amongst the smaller kennel be that of mr reek now mostly identify with oxonian and that dog 's produce but he will always be remember as the breeder of that beautiful terrier avon minstrel mr arnold gillett have have a good share of fortune 's favor as the ridgewood dog testify whilst the messr powell castle glynn dale and crosthwaite have all write they name on the page of fox-terrier history lady have ever be supporter of the breed and no one more prominently so than mr bennett edward who through duke of doncaster a son of durham have found a kennel which at time be almost invincible and which still shelter such grand terrier as doncaster dominie dodger dauphine and many other well know to fame mr j h brown too as the owner of captain double a terrier which have win and deservedly more prize than any fox-terrier now or in the past must not be omit whether the present fox-terrier be as good both on the score of utility and appearance as he predecessor be a question which have many time be ask and as many time decide in the negative as well as in the affirmative it would be idle to pretend that a great many of the dog now see on the show bench be fit to do the work nature intend they for as irrespective of they make and shape they be so oversized as to preclude the possibility of go to ground in any average size earth this question of size be one that must sooner or later be tackle in some practical way by the fox-terrier club unless we be to see a race of giant in the next few generation they own standard give 20 lb -- a very liberal maximum but there be dog several pound heavier constantly win prize at show and consequently be breed from with the result which we see there be many little dog and good one to be see but as long as the judge favor the big one these hold no chance and as it be far easier to produce a good big one than a good little one breeder be encourage to use sire who would not be look at if a hard-and-fast line be draw over which no dog should win a prize there be hundred of fox-terrier about quite as capable of do they work as they ancestor ever be and there be hardly a large kennel which have not from time to time furnished we lead pack with one or more dog and with gratifying result it be therefore a great pity that we lead exhibitor should often be the greatest delinquent in show dog which they know in they heart should be keep at home or draft altogether and it be deplorable that some of we oldest judge should by they award encourage they before conclude this chapter it may not be out of place to say a few word as to the breeding and rearing of fox terrier in the first place _ never _ breed from a animal whose pedigree be not authenticate beyond a shadow of a doubt and remember that while like _ may _ beget like the inevitable tendency be to throw back to former generation the man who elect to breed fox-terrier must have the bump of patience and hope very strongly develop as if the tyro imagine that he have only to mate he bitch to one of the known prize-winning dog of the day in order to produce a champion he have better try some other breed let he fix in he mind the ideal dog and set to work by patient effort and in the face of many disappointment to produce it it be not sufficient that have acquire a bitch good in all point save in head that he breed she to the best-headed dog he can find he must satisfy himself that the head be not a chance one but be a inherit one hand down from many generation good in this particular and consequently potent to reproduce its like so in all other point that he wish to reproduce in the writer 's experience little bitch with quality be the most successful those have masculine characteristic should be avoid and the best result will be obtain from the first three litter after which a bitch rarely breed anything so good see that you bitch be free from worm before she go to the dog then feed she well and beyond a dose of castor oil some day before she be due to whelp let nature take its course dose you puppy well for worm at eight week old give they practically as much as they will eat and unlimited exercise avoid the various advertised nostrum and rely rather on the friendly advice of some fancier or you veterinary surgeon take you hobby seriously and you will be amply repay even if success do not always crown you effort as while the breeding of most animal be a fascinating pursuit that of the fox-terrier present many vary delight chapter xxxiii the wire-hair fox-terrier the wire-hair fox-terrier be with the exception of its coat identical with the smooth fox-terrier -- full brother in fact to he the two variety be much interbreed and several litter in consequence include representative of both and not only this but it be quite a frequent occurrence to get a smooth puppy from wire-hair parent although for some generation neither of the parent may have have any smooth cross in they pedigree the north of england and south wale -lrb- to a lesser extent -rrb- have ever be the home of the wire-hair and nearly all the best specimen have come originally from one or the other of those district there be no doubt that there be excellent stock in both place and there be also no doubt that though at time this be use to the best advantage there be a good deal of carelessness in mating and a certain amount in record the parentage of some of the terrier with regard to this latter point it be say that one gentleman who have quite a large kennel and several stud dog but who keep no book use never to bother about remember which particular dog he have put to a certain bitch but generally satisfied himself as to the sire of a puppy when it come in from walk by just examine it and say oh that pup must be by owd jock or jim as the case might be ` cos he be so loike ` im and down he would go on the entry form accordingly however this may be there be no doubt that the sire would be a wire-hair fox-terrier and although the pedigree therefore may not have be quite right the terrier be invariably pure breed in the early day the smooth be not cross with the wire to anything like the extent that it be later and this fact be probably the cause of the salvation of the variety the wire-hair have have more harm do to he by he be injudiciously cross with the smooth than probably by anything else the greatest care must be exercise in the matter of coat before any such cross be effect the smooth that be cross with the wire must have a really hard and not too full coat and as there be very very few smooth now be show with anything like a proper coat for a terrier to possess the very greatest caution be necessary some few year back almost incalculable harm be do to the variety by a considerable amount of cross into a strain of smooth with terribly soft flannelly coat good-looking terrier be produce and therein lay the danger but they coat be as bad as bad could be and though people be at first too prone to look over this very serious fault they now seem to have recover they sens and thus although much harm be do any serious damage have be avert if a person have a full-coated wire-hair bitch he be too apt to put she to a smooth simply because it be a smooth whom he think will neutralise the length of he bitch 's jacket but this be absolute heresy and must not be do unless the smooth have the very hardest of hair on he if it be do the result be too horrible for word : you get a elongate smooth full coat as soft as cotton wool and sometimes as silkily wavy as a lady 's hair this be not a coat for any terrier to possess and it be not a wire-hair terrier 's coat which ought to be a hard crinkly peculiar-looking broken coat on top with a dense undercoat underneath and must never be mistakable for a elongate smooth terrier 's coat which can never at any time be a protection from wind water or dirt and be in reality the reverse the wire-hair have have a great advertisement for better or worse in the extraordinarily prominent way he have be mention in connection with fake and trim column have be write on this subject speech of inordinate length have be deliver motion and resolution have be carry rule have be promulgate etc etc and the one dog mention throughout in connection with all of they have be we poor old much maligned wire-hair he have be the scapegoat the subject of all this brilliancy and eloquence and be he capable of understand the language of the human we may feel sure much amusement would be he there be several breed that be more trimmed than the wire-hair and that might well be quote before he in this connection there be a vast difference between legitimate trim and what be call fake all dog with long or wire-hair or rough coat naturally require more attention and more grooming than those with short smooth coat for the purpose of health and cleanliness it be absolutely necessary that such animal should be frequently well groom there be no necessity give a wire-hair with a good and proper coat to use anything but a ordinary close-toothed comb a good hard brush and a occasional removal of long old hair on the head ear neck leg and belly with the finger and thumb the kennel club regulation for the preparation of dog for exhibition be perfectly clear on this subject and be word most properly they say that a dog shall be disqualify if any part of he coat or hair have be cut clip singed or rasp down by any substance or if any of the new or fast coat have be remove by pull or pluck in any manner and that no comb shall be use which have a cutting or rasping edge there be no law therefore against the removal of old coat by finger and thumb and anyone who keep long-haired dog know that it be essential to the dog 's health that there should be none it be in fact most necessary in certain case at certain time to pull old coat out in this way several terrier with good coat be apt to grow long hair very thickly round the neck and ear and unless this be remove when it get old the neck and ear be liable to become infested with objectionable little slate-coloured nit which will never be find as long as the coat be keep down when necessary bitch in whelp and after whelp although ordinarily good-coated seem to go all wrong in they coat unless properly attend to in this way and here again if you wish to keep you bitch free from skin trouble it be a necessity in those case which need it to use finger and thumb if the old hair be pull out only when it be old there be no difficulty about it and no hurt whatever be occasion to the dog who do not in reality object at all if however new or fast coat be pull out it not only hurt the dog but it be also a very foolish thing to do and the person guilty of such a thing fully merit disqualification most of the nonsense that be hear about trim emanate of course from the ignoramus the knife he say be use on they all a sharp razor be run over they coat they be singe they be cut they be rasp -lrb- the latter be the favorite term -rrb- anything like such a sweeping condemnation be quite inaccurate and most unfair it be impossible to cut a hair without be detect by a good judge and very few people ever do any such thing at any rate for some month before the terrier be exhibit for if they do they know they be bind to be discover and as a fact be when the soft-coated dog be clip they be operate on say two or three month before they be wanted and the hair get a chance to grow but even then it be easily discernible and anyone who like the writer have any experience of clipping dog in order to cure they of that awful disease follicular mange know what a sight the animal be when he grow he coat and how terribly unnatural he look the wire-hair have never be in better state than he be to-day he be generally speak far ahead of he predecessor of twenty-five year ago not only from a show point of view but also in work quality one have only to compare the old portrait of specimen of the variety with dog of the present day to see this a good many individual specimen of excellent merit it be true there be but they do not seem to have be immortalise in this way the portrait of those we do see be mostly representation of awful-looking brute as bad in shoulder and light of bone as they could be they appear also to have have very soft coat somewhat akin to that we see on a pomeranian nowadays though it be true this latter fault may have be that of the artist or probably amplify by he perhaps the strongest kennel of wire-hair that have exist be that own a good many year ago by messr maxwell and cassell several champion be in the kennel at the same time and they be a sorty lot of nice size and win prize all over the country jack frost jack again liffey barton wonder barton marvel and several other good one be inmate of this kennel the two latter especially be high-class terrier which at one time be own by sir h de trafford barton marvel be a very beautiful bitch and probably the best of those name above though barton wonder be frequently put above she sir h de trafford have for year a very good kennel of the variety and at that time be probably the biggest and best buyer mr carrick of carlisle be also a prominent owner year ago and show some excellent terrier the best be carlisle tack trick and tyro the latter be a exceptionally good dog mr sam hill of sheffield have also a strong kennel always well show by george porter who be now and have be for some year in america where he still follow he old love mr hill 's name will ever be associate with that of he great dog meersbrook bristle who have undoubtedly do the breed a great amount of good mr mayhew be another old fancier who nearly always show a good one mr mayhew have be in america now for many year one dog of he who it be believe become a champion viz brittle do at one time a big business at stud perhaps not to the advantage of the breed for he be possess of a very bad fault in that he have what be call a topknot ring a bunch of soft silky hair on he forehead a unfailing sign of a soft coat all over and a thing which breeder should studiously avoid this topknot be at one time more prevalent than it be now whether it be a coincidence or not one can not say but it be a fact that in the writer 's experience several terrier possess of this fault have also blue marking which again be almost invariably accompany by a soft coat and take these two peculiarity together it would seem that at some time year ago a cross with that wonderfully game but exceedingly soft-coated terrier the bedlington may have be resort to though if so it would appear that nowadays any effect of it be gradually die out mr george raper be one of the old fancier who have for many year own some of the best specimen of the variety ch go bang perhaps be the most notable go bang be a beautiful terrier there be no deny he quality mr raper sell he to mr g m carnochan of new york for something like p500 probably the biggest price that have ever be pay for any fox-terrier mr hayward field be another gentleman who have be exhibit the breed for very many year and have own several good terrier the late mr clear have also at one time a strong kennel the best of which by a long way be ch jack st leger mr wharton be a well-known exhibitor and judge some time back it be he who own that excellent little terrier ch bushey broom who create quite a furore when first exhibit at the westminster aquarium mr harding cox be year ago a great supporter of the variety he exhibit with vary success and be always much in request as a judge one know in enter under he that he want firstly a _ terrier _ and further that the terrier have to be _ sound _ mr cox have of course play a big part in the popularisation of the fox-terrier for as all the world know he be the instigator of the fox-terrier club it be found at a meeting hold at he house he love have ever be for the small terrier and certainly the specimen show by he whatever they individual fault be invariably a sport game-looking lot mr sidney castle have for many year show wire-hair fox-terrier of more than average merit and thoroughly understand the variety indeed perhaps as well as anybody messr bartle brumby mutter g welch and s wilson be all old fancier who have great experience have breed and show excellent specimen in mention the name of celebrated man and terrier of year go by reference must be make to a terrier show some time ago which be as good take all round as any that have so far appear this be ch quantock nettle afterwards purchase by a gentleman in wale and rename lexden nettle of correct size with marvellous character a excellent jacket and very takingly mark with badger tan and black on a wonderful head and ear this bitch sweep the board as they say and unquestionably rightly so no article on the wire-hair fox-terrier would be complete without mention the name of the late mr s e shirley president of the kennel club mr shirley be a successful exhibitor in the early day of the variety and while he terrier be a good-looking lot though not up to the show form of to-day they be invariably hard-bitten game dog keep chiefly for work on the question of size nearly all the principal judge of the fox-terrier be agree they maxim be a good little one can always beat a good big one the difficulty arise when the little one be no good and the big one be excellent it be a somewhat common occurrence and to anyone who love a truly form dog and who know what a truly form dog can do it be a extremely difficult thing to put the little above the larger all big dog with properly place shoulder and sound formation be better terrier for work of any sort than dog half they size short on the leg but bad in these point it be in reality impossible to make a inexorable rule about this question of size each class must be judge on its own merit chapter xxxiv the airedale terrier there be perhaps no breed of dog that in so short a time have be improve so much as the airedale he be now a very beautiful animal whereas but a few year back although maybe there be a few fairly nice specimen by far the greater number be certainly the reverse of this in place of the shaggy soft-coated ugly-coloured brute with large hound ear and big full eye we have now a very handsome creature possess all the point that go to make a really first-class terrier of take color symmetrical build full of character and go amply justify -- in look at any rate -- its existence as a terrier whether it be common sense to call a dog weigh 40 lb to 50 lb a terrier be a question that one often hear discuss the fact remain the dog be a terrier -- a sort of glorified edition of what we understand by the word it be true but in point look and character a terrier nevertheless and it be impossible otherwise to classify he people will ask : how can he be a terrier why he be a outrage on the very word which can only mean a dog to go to ground and to what animal in the country of he birth can a airedale go to ground above ground and in water however a airedale can and do perform in a very excellent manner everything that any other terrier can do as a water dog he be of course in he element for work on land require a hard strong fast and resolute terrier he be needless to say of great value and he be say to be also when train -- as can easily be imagine when one consider he power of scent he strength sagacity and speed -- a most excellent gun-dog he be in fact a general utility dog for add to the above-mentioned quality those of probably a incomparable guard and a most excellent companion faithful and true and ask yourself what do you want more and what breed of dog take all round can beat he the airedale be not of ancient origin he be probably first hear of about the year 1850 he be undoubtedly the product of the otterhound and the old black and tan wire-haired terrier refer to in the chapter on the wire-hair fox and the welsh terrier when one consider the magnificent nobleness the great sagacity courage and stateliness of the otterhound the great gameness cheek and pertinacity of the old black and tan wire-hair such a cross must surely produce a animal of excellent type and character yorkshire more especially that part of it round and about the town of otley be responsible for the birth of the airedale the inhabitant of the country of broad acre be and always have be exceedingly fond of any kind of sport -- as indeed may also be say of they brother of the red rise -- but if in connection with that sport a dog have to be introduce then indeed be they doubly bless for they have no compeer at the game otter-hunting be formerly much indulge in by the people live in the dale of the aire and the wharfe and not only be pack of otterhound keep but many sportsman maintain on they own account a few hound for they personal delectation these hound be no doubt in some instance a nondescript lot as indeed be several of the pack hunting the otter to-day but there be unquestionably a good deal of otterhound blood in they and some pure breed hound be also to be find yorkshire also have always be the great home of the terrier fox-terrier as we now know they have at this time hardly be see the terrier in existence then be the black and tan wire-hair a hardy game terrier a great workman on land or in water whether by design or accident be not know but the fact remain that in or about the year mention a cross take place between these same hound and terrier it be find that a handier dog be produce for the business for which he be require and it do not take many year to populate the district with these terrier-hound which soon come to be recognize as a distinct breed the waterside terrier be the name first vouchsafe to the new variety after this they go by the name of bingley terrier and eventually they come to be know under they present appellation the specimen of the airedale which be first produce be not of very handsome appearance be what would now be call bad in color very shaggy coated and naturally big and ugly in ear it of course take some time to breed the hound out at all satisfactorily some authority tell we that for this purpose the common fighting pit bull-terrier and also the irish terrier be use the latter to a considerable extent and whether this be correct or not there be no doubt that there would also be many cross back again into the small black and tan terrier primarily responsible for he existence in about twenty year ' time the breed seem to have settle down and become thoroughly recognize as a variety of the terrier it be not however for some ten year after this that class be give for the breed at any representative show in 1883 the committee of the national show at birmingham include three class for airedale in they schedule which be fairly well support and three year after this recognition be give to the breed in the stud-book of the ruling authority from this time on the breed prosper pretty well several very good terrier be breed the hound gradually almost disappear as also do to a great extent the bad-coloured one the best example amongst the early show dog be undoubtedly newbold test who have a long and very successful career this dog excel in terrier character and he be sound all over he advent be opportune -- he be just the dog that be want and there be no doubt he do the breed a great amount of good a dog call colne crack who be a beautiful little terrier be another of the early show one by whom the breed have lose nothing and two other terrier whose name be much revere by lover of the breed be cholmondeley briar and briar test some year ago when the breed be in the stage refer to above a club be form to look after its interest and there be no doubt that though perhaps phenomenal success do not attend its effort it do its best and form a valuable link in the chain of popularity of the airedale it be at best apparently a sleepy sort of concern and never seem to have attract new fancier some dozen or so year ago however a club destine not only to make a great name for itself but also to do a thousandfold more good to the breed it espouse than ever the old club do be form under the name of the south of england airedale terrier club and a marvellously successful and popular life it have so far live the younger club be in no way a antagonist of the older one and it have ever be careful that it should not be look upon in any way as such the old club have however be quite overshadow by the younger which whether it wish it or not be now look upon as the lead society in connection with the breed at a meeting of the first club -- which go by the name of the airedale terrier club -- hold in manchester some eighteen or twenty year ago the following standard of perfection and scale of point be draw up and adopt : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- long with flat skull but not too broad between the ear narrow slightly to the eye free from wrinkle stop hardly visible and cheek free from fullness jaw deep and powerful well fill up before the eye lip light ear v-shaped with a side carriage small but not out of proportion to the size of the dog the nose black the eye small and dark in color not prominent and full of terrier expression the tooth strong and level the neck should be of moderate length and thickness gradually widen towards the shoulder and free from throatiness shoulder and chest -- shoulder long and sloping well into the back shoulder-blade flat chest deep but not broad body -- back short strong and straight rib well spring hind-quarter -- strong and muscular with no drop hock well let down the tail set on high and carry gaily but not curl over the back leg and foot -- leg perfectly straight with plenty of bone foot small and round with good depth of pad coat -- hard and wiry and not so long as to appear ragged it should also be straight and close cover the dog well over the body and leg color -- the head and ear with the exception of dark marking on each side of the skull should be tan the ear be a darker shade than the rest the leg up to the thigh and elbow be also tan the body black or dark grizzle weight -- dog 40 lb to 45 lb bitch slightly less \* \* \* \* \* at the time of the formation of the southern club the state of the airedale be critical possess of perhaps unequalled natural advantage lovely dog as he be he have not make that progress that he should have do he have not be boom in any way and have be crawl when he should have gallop from the moment the new club be form however the airedale have a new lease of life mr holland buckley and other keen enthusiast seem to have recognize to a nicety exactly what be require to give a necessary fillip to the breed they appear also to have found they club at the right moment and to have offer such a attractive bill of fare that not only do everyone in the south who have anything to do with airedale join at once but very shortly a host of new fancier be enrol and crowd of people begin to take the breed up who have have nothing to do with it or indeed any other sort of dog previously some few year after the foundation of this club a junior branch of it be start and this ably look after by mr r lauder mclaren be almost as big a success in its way as be the parent institution other club have be start in the north and elsewhere and altogether the airedale be very well cater for in this respect and if thing go on as they be now go be bind to prosper and become even more extensively own than he be at present to mr holland buckley mr g h elder mr royston mill and mr marshall lee the airedale of the present day owe much the airedale that have strike the writer as the best he have come across be master briar clonmel monarch clonmel marvel dumbarton lass tone masterpiece mistress royal master royal tone chief huckleberry lass fielden fashion york sceptre and clonmel floriform nearly everyone of these be now either in the flesh or spirit in the united state or canada in all probability the person who know more about this terrier than anyone living be mr holland buckley he have write a most entertaining book on the airedale he have found the principal club in connection with the breed he have produce several very excellent specimen and it go without say that he be -- when he can be induce to take the ring -- a first-rate judge mr buckley have frequently tell the writer that in he opinion one of the best terrier he have see be the aforesaid clonmel floriform but as this dog be sell for a big price very early in he career the writer never see he most of the article that have be write on the airedale have come from the pen of mr buckley and therefore but modest reference be make to the man who have work so whole-heartedly so well and so successfully in the interest of the breed he love it would be ungenerous and unfair in any article on the airedale write by anyone but mr buckley if conspicuous reference be not make to the great power this gentleman have be and to the great good that he have do the airedale be such a beautiful specimen of the canine race and be in reality in such healthy state that every one of he admirer -- and they be legion -- be naturally jealous for he welfare and be wishful that all shall go well with he it be gratify to state that he have never be the tool of faction though at one time he be doubtless near the brink but this be some time ago and it would be a grievous pity if he ever again become in jeopardy of feel the baneful influence of any such curse there be one serious matter in connection with he however and that be the laxity display by some judge of the breed in give prize to dog show in a condition with regard to they coat which ought to disentitle they to take a prize in any company shockingly badly-trimmed shoulder be become quite a common thing to see in airedale there be no necessity for this sort of thing it be very foolish and it be impossible to imagine anything more likely to do harm to a breed than that the idea should get abroad that this be the general practice in connection with it chapter xxxv the bedlington terrier this gamest of all the terrier have be know as a distinct and thoroughly british breed for over a century which be i think a fairly ancient lineage there be various theory as to its original parentage but the one which hold that he be the result of a cross between the otterhound and the dandie dinmont suggest itself to I as the most probable one he characteristic strongly resemble in many point both these breed and there can be but little doubt of he near relationship at some time or other to the dandie the earliest authentic record we have of the bedlington be a dog name old flint who belong to squire trevelyan and be whelp in 1782 the pedigree of mr william clark 's scamp a dog well know about 1792 be trace back to old flint and the descendant of scamp be trace in direct line from 1792 to 1873 a mason name joseph aynsley have the credit for give the name of bedlington to this terrier in 1825 it be previously know as the rothbury terrier or the northern county fox-terrier mr thoma j pickett of newcastle-on-tyne be perhaps the earliest supporter of the breed on a large scale and he tynedale and tyneside in especial have leave they name in the history of the bedlington the present day bedlington like a good many other terrier have become taller and heavier than the old day specimen this no doubt be due to breed for show point he be a lathy dog but not shelly incline to be flatsided somewhat light in bone for he size very lively in character and have plenty of courage if anything indeed he pluck be too insistent the standard of point as adopt by the national bedlington terrier and the yorkshire bedlington terrier club be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* skull -- narrow but deep and round high at the occiput and cover with a nice silky tuft or topknot muzzle -- long taper sharp and muscular as little stop as possible between the eye so as to form nearly a line from the nose-end along the joint of skull to the occiput the lip close fitting and without fly eye -- should be small and well sink in the head the blues should have a dark eye the blues and tan ditto with amber shades liver and sandy a light brown eye nose -- large well angled blues and blues and tan should have black nose liver and sandy flesh-coloured tooth -- level or pincher-jawed ear -- moderately large well form flat to the cheek thinly cover and tip with fine silky hair they should be filbert shaped leg -- of moderate length not wide apart straight and square set and with good-sized foot which be rather long tail -- thick at the root taper to a point slightly feathered on lower side 9 inch to 11 inch long and scimitar shaped neck and shoulder -- neck long deep at base rise well from the shoulder which should be flat body -- long and well-proportioned flat ribbed and deep not wide in chest slightly arch back well rib up with light quarter coat -- hard with close bottom and not lie flat to side color -- dark blue blue and tan liver liver and tan sandy or sandy and tan height -- about 15 inch to 16 inch weight -- dog about 24 pound bitch about 22 pound general appearance -- he be a light-made lathy dog but not shelly \* \* \* \* \* there be a tendency nowadays towards excess of size in the bedlington it be incline to be too long in the body and too leggy which if not check will spoil the type of the breed it be therefore very important that size should be more study by judge than be at present the case the fault refer to be doubtless the result of breed for exceptionally long head which seem to be the craze just now and of course one can not get extra long head without proportionately long body and large size if it be possible to do so then the dog would become a mere caricature as a sport terrier the bedlington hold a position in the first rank he be very fast and enduring and exceedingly pertinacious and be equally at home on land and in water he will work a otter draw a badger or bolt a fox and he have no superior at kill rat and all kind of vermin he have a exceptionally fine nose and make a very useful dog for rough shooting be easily teach to retrieve if he have any fault at all it be that he be of too jealous a disposition which render it almost impossible to work he with other dog as he want all the fun to himself and if he can not get it he will fight for it but by himself he be perfect as a companion he be peculiarly affectionate and faithful and remarkably intelligent he make a capital house-dog be a good guard and be very safe with child bedlington be not dainty feeder as most writer have assert nor be they tender dog if they be keep in good condition and get plenty of exercise they feed as well as any other and be as hard as nail if not pampered they be easy to breed and rear and the bitch make excellent mother if train when young they be very obedient and they tendency to fight can in a great measure be cure when they be puppy but if not check then it can not be do afterwards once they take to fight nothing will keep they from it and instead of be pleasurable companion they become positive nuisance on the other hand if properly break they give very little trouble and will not quarrel unless set upon chapter xxxvi the irish terrier the dare-devil irish terrier have most certainly make he home in we bosom there be no breed of dog more genuinely love by those who have sufficient experience and knowledge to make the comparison other dog have a larger share of innate wisdom other be most aesthetically beautiful other more peaceable but we rufous friend have a way of win into he owner 's heart and make there a abide place which be all the more secure because it be gain by sincere and undemonstrative devotion perhaps one like he equally for he fault as for he merit he very failing be due to he soldierly faithfulness and loyalty to he too ardent vigilance in guard the threshold to he officious belligerence towards other canine who offend he sense of proprietorship in he master he particular stature may have some influence in he success as a chum he be just tall enough to rest he chin upon one 's knee and look up with all he soul into one 's eye whatever be the secret of he attraction ` tis certain that he have the hibernian art of compelling affection and forgiveness and that he make one value he not for the beauty of he ruddy raiment the straightness of he fore-leg the set of he eye and ear the levelness of he back or he ability to win prize but rather for he true and trusty heart that exact no return and seek no recompense he may be but a indifferent specimen of he kind take in as a stranger at the gate but when at length the inevitable time arrive as it do all too soon in canine nature one then discover how surely one have be harbour a angel unaware statistics would probably show that in number the fox-terrier justify the reputation of be a more popular breed and the scottish terrier be no doubt a formidable competitor for public esteem it be safe however to say that the irish terrier share with these the distinction of be one of the three most popular terrier in the british isle this fact take into consideration it be interesting to reflect that thirty year ago the dare-devil be virtually unknown in england idstone in he book on dog publish in 1872 do not give a word of mention to the breed and dog show have be institute sixteen year before a class be open for the irish terrier the dog exist of course in its native land it may indeed be almost truthfully say to have exist as long as that country have be a island about the year 1875 expert be in dispute over the irish terrier and many aver that he rough coat and length of hair on forehead and muzzle be indubitable proof of scotch blood he very expression they say be scotch but the argument be quell by more know disputant on the other side who claim that ireland have never be without she terrier and that she owe no manner of indebtedness to scotland for a dog whose every hair be essentially irish in the same year at a show hold in belfast a goodly number of the breed be bring together notable among they be mr d o'connell 's slasher a very good-looking wire-coated work terrier who be say to have excel as a field and water dog slasher be lint white in color and repute to be descend from a pure white strain two other terrier of the time be mr morton 's fly -lrb- the first irish terrier to gain a championship -rrb- and mr george jamison 's sport the prominent irish terrier of the ` seventy vary considerably in type stinger who win the first prize at lisburn in 1875 be long-backed and short-legged with a dark blue grizzle color back tan leg and white turned-out foot the dam of mr burke 's killeney boy be a rough black and tan a combination of color which be believe to accompany the best class of coat brindle be not uncommon some be tall on the leg some short some be lanky and other cobby many be very small there be class give at a dublin show in 1874 for irish terrier under 9 lb weight jamison 's sport be a important dog historically for various reason he be undoubtedly more akin to we present type than any other irish terrier of he time of which there be record he dark ear be uncropped at a period when crop be general he weight approximate to we modern average he be a all color red and he leg be of a length that would not now be seriously object to but in he day he be not accept as typical and he be not particularly successful in the show

terrier 's jacket occasionally it tend towards flaxen occasionally to a deep rich auburn but the black and brindle be so rigidly breed out that by the year 1890 or thereabout they very seldom recur nowadays it be not often that any other color than red be see in a litter of irish terrier although a white patch on the breast be frequent as it be in all self-coloured breed in addition to the early celebrity already name extreme carelessness michael brickbat poppy ii moya doolan straight tip and gaelic have take they place in the record of the breed while yet more recent irish terrier who have achieve fame have be mrs butcher 's bawn boy and bawn beauty mr wallace 's treasurer mr s wilson 's bolton wood mixer dr smyth 's sarah kidd and mr c j barnett 's breda muddler naturally in the case of a breed which have depart from its original type discussion be frequent before a standard of perfection for the irish terrier be fix he size and weight the length or shortness of he limb the carriage of he tail the form of he skull and muzzle the color and texture of he coat be the subject of controversy it be consider at one juncture that he be be breed too big and at another that he be be bring too much to resemble a red wire-hair fox-terrier when once the black mark on he body have be eliminate no one seem to have desire that it should be restore red be acknowledge to be the one and only color for a irish terrier but some hold that the correct red should be deep auburn and other that wheaten color be the tone to be aim at a medium shade between the two extreme be now generally prefer as to size it should be about midway between that of the airedale and the fox-terrier represent by a weight of from 22 to 27 lb the two breed just mention be as a rule superior to the irish terrier in front leg and foot but in the direction of these point great improvement have recently be observable the head of we irish terrier have also be bring nearer to a level of perfection chisel to the desire degree of leanness with the determine expression so characteristic of the breed and with the length squareness and strength of muzzle which formerly be so difficult to find this squareness of head and jaw be a important point to be consider when choose a irish terrier opinion differ in regard to slight detail of this terrier 's conformation but the official description issue by the irish terrier club supply a guide upon which the uncertain novice may implicitly depend : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- long skull flat and rather narrow between ear get slightly narrower towards the eye free from wrinkle stop hardly visible except in profile the jaw must be strong and muscular but not too full in the cheek and of a good punish length there should be a slight fall away below the eye so as not to have a greyhound appearance hair on face of same description as on body but short -lrb- about a quarter of a inch long -rrb- in appearance almost smooth and straight a slight beard be the only longish hair -lrb- and it be only long in comparison with the rest -rrb- that be permissible and this be characteristic tooth -- should be strong and level lip -- not so tight as a bull-terrier 's but well-fitting show through the hair they black lining nose -- must be black eye -- a dark hazel color small not prominent and full of life fire and intelligence ear -- small and v-shaped of moderate thickness set well on the head and drop forward closely to the cheek the ear must be free of fringe and the hair thereon shorter and darker in color than the body neck -- should be of a fair length and gradually widen towards the shoulder well carry and free of throatiness there be generally a slight sort of frill visible at each side of the neck run nearly to the corner of the ear shoulder and chest -- shoulder must be fine long and sloping well into the back the chest deep and muscular but neither full nor wide back and loin -- body moderately long back should be strong and straight with no appearance of slackness behind the shoulder the loin broad and powerful and slightly arched rib fairly spring rather deep than round and well rib back hind-quarter -- should be strong and muscular thigh powerful hock near ground stifle moderately bent stern -- generally dock should be free of fringe or feather but well cover with rough hair set on pretty high carry gaily but not over the back or curl foot and leg -- foot should be strong tolerably round and moderately small toe arch and neither turn out nor in black toe nail most desirable leg moderately long well set from the shoulder perfectly straight with plenty of bone and muscle the elbow work freely clear of the side pastern short and straight hardly noticeable both fore and hind leg should be move straight forward when travel the stifle not turn outwards the leg free of feather and cover like the head with as hard a texture of coat as body but not so long coat -- hard and wiry free of softness or silkiness not so long as to hide the outline of the body particularly in the hind-quarter straight and flat no shagginess and free of lock or curl color -- should be whole-coloured the most preferable be bright red red wheaten or yellow red white sometimes appear on chest and foot it be more objectionable on the latter than on the chest as a speck of white on chest be frequently to be see in all self-coloured breed size and symmetry -- the most desirable weight in show condition be for a dog 24 lb and for a bitch 22 lb the dog must present a active lively lithe and wiry appearance lot of substance at the same time free of clumsiness as speed and endurance as well as power be very essential they must be neither cloddy or cobby but should be frame on the line of speed show a graceful racing outline temperament -- dog that be very game be usually surly or snappish the irish terrier as a breed be a exception be remarkably good-tempered notably so with mankind it be admit however that he be perhaps a little too ready to resent interference on the part of other dog there be a heedless reckless pluck about the irish terrier which be characteristic and couple with the headlong dash blind to all consequence with which he rush at he adversary have earn for the breed the proud epithet of the dare-devil when off-duty they be characterise by a quiet caress-inviting appearance and when one see they endearingly timidly push they head into they master ' hand it be difficult to realize that on occasion at the set on they can prove they have the courage of a lion and will fight unto the last breath in they body they develop a extraordinary devotion to and have be know to track they master almost incredible distance \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- illustration : mr fred w breakell 's irish terrier ch killarney sport -rrb- it be difficult to refer to particular irish terrier of to-day without make invidious distinction there be so many excellent example of the breed that a list even of those who have gain championship honor would be formidable but one would hardly hesitate to head the list with the name of paymaster a dog of rare and almost superlative quality and true irish terrier character paymaster be the property of miss lilian paull of weston-super-mare who breed he from she beautiful bitch erasmic from breda muddler the sire of many of the best side by side with paymaster mr f clifton 's mile end barrister might be place it would need a council of perfection indeed to decide which be the better dog of the two very high in the list also would come mr henry ridley 's redeemer and mr breakell 's killarney sport and among bitch one would name certainly mr gregg 's belfast erin mr clifton 's charwoman mr everill 's erminie and mr j s mccomb 's beeston betty these be but half a dozen but they represent the highest level of excellence that have yet be achieve by scientific breeding in irish terrier type breed up to the standard of excellence necessary in competition in dog show have doubtless be the agent which have bring the irish terrier to its present condition of perfection and it be the means by which the general dog own public be most surely educate to a practical knowledge of what be a desirable and what a undesirable dog to possess but after all success in the show ring be not the one and only thing to be aim at and the irish terrier be not to be regard merely as the possible winner of prize he be above all thing a dog for man 's companionship and in this capacity he take a favored place he have the great advantage of be equally suitable for town and country life in the home he require no pampering he have a good hardy constitution and when once he have get over the ill incidental to puppyhood -- worm and distemper -- he need only to be judiciously feed keep reasonably clean and to have he fill of active exercise if he be teach to be obedient and of gentlemanly habit there be no better house dog he be naturally intelligent and easily trained although he be always ready to take he own part he be not quarrelsome but remarkably good-tempered and a safe associate of child perhaps with he boisterous spirit he be prone sometimes to be over-zealous in the pursuit of trespassing tabby and in assail the ankle of intrude butcher boy and officious postman these characteristic come from he sense of duty which be strongly develop and careful training will make he discriminative in he assault very justly be he class among the sport dog he be a bear sportsman and of he pluck it be superfluous to speak fear be unknown to he in this characteristic as in all other he be truly a son of erin chapter xxxvii the welsh terrier this breed be near akin to the wire-hair fox-terrier the principal difference be merely of color and type the welsh terrier be a wire-haired black or grizzle and tan the most take coloring be a jet black body and back with deep tan head ear leg belly and tail several specimen have however black forehead skull ear and tail and the black will frequently be see also extend for a short way down the leg there must be no black however below the hock and there must be no substantial amount of white anywhere a dog possess either of these fault be accord to the recognize standard of the breed disqualify many of the most successful bench winner have nevertheless be possess of a little white on the chest and even a few hair of that color on they hind toe and apparently by the common consent of all the judge of the breed they have be in nowise handicapped for these blemish there be not so many grizzle color welsh terrier now as there use to be a grizzle and tan never look so smart as a black and tan but though this be so if the grizzle be of a dark hard color its owner should not be handicap as against a black and tan if on the contrary it be a washed-out bluish-looking grizzle a judge be entitle to handicap its possessor apart altogether from the fact that any such color on the back be invariably accompany by a objectionable light tan on the leg the whole be a certain sign of a soft silky unterrierlike coat the coat of the welsh terrier slightly differ from that of the wire-hair fox-terrier in that it be as a rule not so abundant and be in reality a different class of coat it be not so broken as be that of the fox-terrier and be generally a smoother shorter coat with the hair very close together when accompany with this there be a dense undercoat one have for a terrier use to work a good deal in water a ideal cover as waterproof almost as the feather on a duck 's back the other difference between the fox and welsh terrier -- viz type -- be very hard to define to anyone who really understand welsh terrier the selection of those of proper type from those of wrong type present little if any difficulty as a show-bench exhibit the welsh terrier be not more than twenty-two year old he have however reside in wale for century there be no doubt that he be in reality identical with the old black and tan wire-haired dog which be england 's first terrier and which have take such a prominent part in the production and evolution of all the other variety of the sport terrier there be several people live in or about carnarvonshire who can show that welsh terrier have be keep by they ancestor from at any rate a hundred to two hundred year ago notable among these be the present master of the ynysfor otterhound whose great grandfather john jone of ynysfor own welsh terrier in or about the year 1760 this pack of otterhound have always be keep by the jone of ynysfor who have always work and still work welsh terrier with they from this strain some good terrier have spring and this although neither the present master nor any of he ancestor have concern themselves greatly about the look of they terrier or keep anything but a head record of they pedigree they be all however pure breed and be set much store on by they owner and he family just as they always have be by they predecessor until about the year 1884 no one seem to have consider the question of put specimen of the breed on the show bench about that year however several gentleman interested in the variety meet together to see what could be do in connection with the matter the outcome be that the welsh terrier club be shortly afterwards found the kennel club recognize the breed and the terrier himself begin he career as a show dog the specimen which be first show be as may be imagine not a very high-class-looking lot although the breed have be keep pure no care have be take in the culture of it except that which be necessary to produce a sport game terrier able to do its work one can readily understand therefore that such a entirely fancy point as a long foreface and narrow clean skull have never be think of for a moment and it be in these particulars that the welsh terrier at first fail from a show point of view naturally enough good shoulder sound hind-quarter more than fair leg and foot and excellent jacket be to be find in abundance but as the body be almost invariably surmount by a very short and wedge-shaped head and jaw often accompany with a pair of heavy round ear a undershot mouth and a light full eye it will be realize that the general appearance of the dog be not prepossess the welsh terrier to-day be very much improve beyond what he be when first put on the bench this improvement have be bring about by careful and judicious breeding from nothing but pure breed specimen no outside aid have be invoke -- at any rate in the production of any of the best terrier -- and none have be require it be a matter for great congratulation that the breed have be keep pure despite all temptation and exhortation the welsh terrier breed as true as steel you know what you be go to get have popular clamor have its way year ago goodness only know what monstrosity would now be be breed the color of the welsh terrier be of course against he for work with a pack of hound especially in water it be only fair however to the breed to say that bar this color drawback there be no better terrier to hound live they be not quarrelsome show very little jealousy one of another in work can therefore easily be use exercise and kennel together be much better in this respect than any of the other breed of terrier they also as a general rule be dead game they want a bit of rousing and be not so flashily showily game as say the fox-terrier but just as with human when it come to _ real _ business when the talking game be play out and there be nothing left but the _ do _ part of the business then one 's experience invariably be that the quiet man the quiet terrier be the animal want on the formation of the welsh terrier club a standard of perfection be draw up and circulate with the club rule this standard have remain unchanged up to the present day and be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- the skull should be flat and rather wider between the ear than the wire-hair fox-terrier the jaw should be powerful clean cut rather deeper and more punish -- give the head a more masculine appearance -- than that usually see in a fox-terrier the stop not too define fair length from stop to end of nose the latter being of a black color ear -- the ear should be v-shaped small not too thin set on fairly high carry forward and close to the cheek eye -- the eye should be small not be too deeply set in or protrude out of skull of a dark hazel color expressive and indicate abundant pluck neck -- the neck should be of moderate length and thickness slightly arched and sloping gracefully into the shoulder body -- the back should be short and well rib up the loin strong good depth and moderate width of chest the shoulder should be long sloping and well set back the hind-quarter should be strong thigh muscular and of good length with the hock moderately straight well set down and fair amount of bone the stern should be set on moderately high but not too gaily carry leg and foot -- the leg should be straight and muscular possess fair amount of bone with upright and powerful pastern the foot should be small round and catlike coat -- the coat should be wiry hard very close and abundant color -- the color should be black and tan or black grizzle and tan free from black pencilling on toe size -- the height at shoulder should be 15 inch for dog bitch proportionately less twenty pound shall be consider a fair average weight in work condition but this may vary a pound or so either way disqualify point : nose white cherry or spot to a considerable extent with either of these color ear prick tulip or rise undershot jaw or pig jaw mouth black below hock or white anywhere to any appreciable extent black pencilling on toe chapter xxxviii the scottish terrier the scottish terrier as a show dog date from about 1877 to 1879 he seem almost at once to have attain popularity and he have progress gradually since then ever in a upward direction until he be to-day one of the most popular and extensively own variety of the dog sir paynton pigott have at the date mention a very fine kennel of the breed for in _ the live stock journal _ of may 30th 1879 we find he kennel fully review in a most enthusiastic manner by a correspondent who visit it in consequence of a controversy that be go on at the time as to whether or not there be such a dog at all and who therefore wish to see and judge for himself as to this point at the end of he report on the kennel the writer add these word : it be certainly one of the happiest day of my life to have the pleasure of look over so many grand little dog but to find they in england quite stagger I four dog and eight bitch be not a bad beginning and with care and judicious selection in mating i have little doubt but mr pigott 's kennel will be as renowned for terrier as the late mr laverack 's be for setter i know but few that take such a delight in the brave little ` die-hard ' as mr pigott and he may well feel proud of the lot he have get together at great trouble and expense -lrb- illustration : mr spencer 's dandie dinmont ch braw lad photograph by t fall -rrb- -lrb- illustration : a typical airedale head -rrb- -lrb- illustration : mr w l mccandlish 's scottish terrier em cosmetic -rrb- the fact that there be such a kennel already in existence prove of course a strong point in favor of the _ bona fides _ of the breed the best dog in it be granite whose portrait and description be give in the _ journal _ in connection with the say review and the other animal of the kennel being of the same type it be at once recognize that there be in fact such a breed and the mouth of the doubter be stop granite be unquestionably a typical scottish terrier even as we know they at the present day he be certainly longer in the back than we care for nowadays and he head also be shorter and he jaw more snipy than be now see but he portrait clearly show he be a genuine scottish terrier and there be no doubt that he with he kennel mate tartan crofter syringa cavack and posey confer benefit upon the breed to dive deeper into the antiquity of the scottish terrier be a thing which mean that he who try it must be prepare to meet all sort of abuse ridicule and criticism one man will tell you there never be any such thing as the present-day scottish terrier that the mere fact of he have prick ear show he be a mongrel another that he be merely a offshoot of the skye or the dandie another that the only scottish terrier that be a scottish terrier be a white one another that he be merely a manufactured article from aberdeen and so on _ ad infinitum _ it be a most extraordinary fact that scotland should have unto herself so many different variety of the terrier there be strong presumption that they one and all come originally from one variety and it be quite possible nay probable that different cross into other variety have produce the assortment of to-day the writer be strongly of opinion that there still exist in scotland at the present time specimen of the breed which propagate the lot which be what be call even now the highland terrier a little long-backed short-legged snipy-faced prick or drop-eared mostly sandy and black-coloured terrier game as a pebble lively as a cricket and all in all a most charming little companion and further that to produce we present-day scottish terrier -- or shall we say to improve the point of he progenitor -- the assistance of we old friend the black and tan wire-haired terrier of england be seek by a few astute people live probably not very far from aberdeen scottish terrier frequently go by the name of aberdeen terrier -- a appellation it be true usually hear only from the lip of people who do not know much about they mr w l mccandlish one of the greatest living authority on the breed in a able treatise publish some time back tell we in reference to this matter that the terrier under notice go at different period under the name of highland cairn aberdeen and scotch that he be now know by the proud title of scottish terrier and that the only survive trace of the differ nomenclature be the title aberdeen which many people still regard as a different breed -- a want of knowledge frequently turn to account by the unscrupulous dealer who be able to sell under the name of aberdeen a dog too bad to dispose of as a scottish terrier but there can be no doubt that originally there must have be _ some _ reason for the name in a letter to the writer sir paynton pigott say some people call they and advertise they as the aberdeen terrier which be altogether a mistake but the reason of it be that forty year ago a dr van bust who live in aberdeen breed these terrier to a large extent and sell they and those buy they call they in consequence ` aberdeen terrier ' whereas they be in reality merely a pick sort of old scotch or highland terrier sir paynton himself as appear from the column of _ the live stock journal _ -lrb- march 2nd 1877 -rrb- buy some of the strain of van bust and therein give a full description of the same sir paynton pigott 's kennel of the breed assume quite large proportion and be most successful several time win all the prize offer in the variety at different show he may well be call the father of the breed in england for when he give up exhibit a great deal of he best blood get into the kennel of mr h j ludlow who as everyone know have do such a tremendous amount of good in popularize the breed and have also himself produce such a galaxy of specimen of the very best class mr ludlow 's first terrier be a bitch call splinter ii the name of kildee be in the breed almost world-famous and it be interesting to note that in every line do he go back to the say splinter ii rambler -- call by the great authority the first pillar of the stud book -- be a son of a dog call bon-accord and it be to this latter dog and roger rough and also the aforesaid tartan and splinter ii that nearly all of the best present-day pedigree go back this be so it be unnecessary to give many more name of dog who have in they generation of some year back assist in bring the breed to its present state of perfection a exception however must be make in the case of two son of rambler by name dundee and alister name very familiar in the scottish terrier pedigree of the present day alister especially be quite a extraordinary stud dog he progeny be legion and some very good terrier of to-day own he as progenitor in nearly every line the best descendant of alister be kildee tiree whinstone prince alexander and heather prince he be apparently too much inbred to and though he produce or be responsible for several beautiful terrier it be much to be doubt whether in a breed which be suffer from the ill-effect of too much inbreeding he be not one of the greatest sinner the scottish terrier club be form in the year 1882 in the same year a joint committee draw up a standard of perfection for the breed messr j b morison and thomson gray two gentleman who be look upon as great authority have a good deal to do with it \* \* \* \* \* standard of point of the scottish terrier : skull -- proportionately long slightly domed and cover with short hard hair about 3\/4 inch long or less it should not be quite flat as there should be a sort of stop or drop between the eye muzzle -- very powerful and gradually taper towards the nose which should always be black and of a good size the jaw should be perfectly level and the tooth square though the nose project somewhat over the mouth which give the impression of the upper jaw be longer than the under one eye -- a dark-brown or hazel color small pierce very bright and rather sunken ear -- very small prick or half prick -lrb- the former be preferable -rrb- but never drop they should also be sharp pointed and the hair on they should not be long but velvety and they should not be cut the ear should be free from any fringe at the top neck -- short thick and muscular strongly set on sloping shoulder chest -- broad in comparison to the size of the dog and proportionately deep body -- of moderate length but not so long as a skye 's and rather flat-sided well rib up and exceedingly strong in hind-quarter leg and foot -- both fore and hind leg should be short and very heavy in bone the former be straight and well set on under the body as the scottish terrier should not be out at elbow the hock should be bent and the thigh very muscular and the foot strong small and thickly cover with short hair the fore foot be larger than the hind one tail -- should be about 7 inch long never dock carry with a slight bend and often gaily coat -- should be rather short -lrb- about 2 inch -rrb- intensely hard and wiry in texture and very dense all over the body size -- from 15 lb to 20 lb the best weight be as near as possible 18 lb for dog and 16 lb for bitch when in condition for work color -- steel or iron gray black brindle brown brindle gray brindle black sandy and wheaten white marking be objectionable and can only be allow on the chest and to a small extent general appearance -- the face should wear a very sharp bright and active expression and the head should be carry up the dog -lrb- owe to the shortness of he coat -rrb- should appear to be higher on the leg than he really be but at the same time he should look compact and possess of great muscle in he hind-quarter in fact a scottish terrier though essentially a terrier can not be too powerfully put together and should be from about 9 inch to 12 inch in height special fault : muzzle -- either under or over hung eye -- large or light-coloured ear -- large round at the point or drop it be also a fault if they be too heavily cover with hair leg -- bent or slightly bent and out at elbow coat -- any silkiness wave or tendency to curl be a serious blemish as be also a open coat size -- specimen of over 20 lb should be discourage \* \* \* \* \* there have of recent year be many very excellent specimen of the scottish terrier breed and exhibit preeminent among they stand mr hannay 's ch heworth rascal who be a most symmetrical terrier and probably the nearest approach to perfection in the breed yet see other very first-class terrier have be the same lady 's ch gair mr powlett 's ch callum dhu mr mccandlish 's em cosmetic mr chapman 's heather bob and heather charm mr kinnear 's seafield rascal mr wood 's hyndman chief messr buckley and mill 's clonmel invader and mr deane willi 's ch huntley daisy and ch carter laddie it be highly probable that of all the terrier tribe the scottie take as a whole be the best companion he make a most excellent house-dog be not too big do not leave white hair about all over the place love only he master and he master 's household and be withal a capable and reliable guard he be as a rule a game attractive terrier with heap of brain power and from a show point of view there be always some recompense in keep he as it will be find he breed true to type and do not beget offspring of all sort shape and make chapter xxxix the west highland white terrier man be a hunting animal kill the otter for he skin and the badger also the fox he kill because the animal like lamb and game to eat man be unable to deal in the course of a morning with the rock under and between which he quarry harbor make use of the small dog which will go underground to which the french name terrier have be attach towards the end of the reign of jame the first of england and sixth of scotland we find he write to edinburgh to have half a dozen earth dogge or terriere send carefully to france as a present and he direct that they be get from argyll and send over in two or more ship lest they should get harm by the way that be roughly three hundred year ago and the king most probably would not have so highly value a newly-invented strain as he evidently do value the terriere from argyll we may take it then that in 1600 the argyllshire terrier be consider to be the best in scotland and likely enough too see the almost boundless opportunity the county give for the work of the earth dogge but man keep they dog in the evil pre-show day for work and not for point and mighty indifferent be they whether a ear cock up or lay flat to the cheek whether the tail be exactly of fancy length or how high to a hair 's breadth it stand these thing be _ sine qua non _ on the modern show bench but be not think of in the cruel hard fighting day of old in those day two thing -- and two thing only -- be imperatively necessary : pluck and capacity to get at the quarry this entail that the body in which the pluck be enshrine must be small and most active to get at the innermost recess of the lair and that the body must be protect by the best possible tooth and jaw for fight on a strong and rather long neck and direct by a most capable brain it be hold that foot turn out a little be better for scramble up rock than perfectly straight fox-terrier like foot in addition it be useful to have you dog of a color easy to see when in motion though no great weight be lay upon that point as in the day before newspaper and train man 's eye be good as a rule still the quantity of white in the exist terrier all through the west coast of scotland show that it must have be rather a favored color white west highland terrier be keep at poltalloch sixty year ago and so they be first show as poltalloch terrier yet although they be keep in they purest strain in argyllshire they be still to be find all along the west coast of scotland good specimen belong to ross-shire to skye and at ballachulish on loch leven so that it be a breed with a long pedigree and not a invent breed of the present day emphatically they be not simply white color scottish terrier and it be a error to judge they on scottish terrier line they be smaller than the average scottie more foxy in general conformation -- straight limbed rather long rather low and active in body with a broad forehead light muzzle and underjaw and a bright small intelligent eye colonel malcolm of poltalloch who be recognize as the great authority on the breed lay stress upon the quality of the coat the outer coat he say should be very soft on the forehead and get gradually harder towards the haunch but the harsh coat beloved of the show bench be all nonsense and be the easiest thing in the world to ` fake ' as anyone can try who will dip he own hair into the now fashionable ` anturic ' bath the outer coat should be distinctly _ long _ but not long in the ` fancy ' or show sense still it should be long enough to hang as a thatch over the soft woolly real coat of the animal and keep it dry so that a good shake or two will throw off most of the water while the under coat should be so thick and naturally oily that the dog can swim through a fair-sized river and not get wet or be able to sit out through a drenching rain guard something of he master 's and be none the worse this under coat i at least have never see a judge look for but for the work terrier it be most important the size of the dog be perhaps best indicate by weight the dog should not weigh more than 18 lb nor the bitch more than 16 lb there be among judge i find -- with all respect i say it -- a undue regard for weight and what be call strength also for groom which mean brushing or pluck out all the long hair to gratify the judge one might as well judge of sandow 's strength not by he performance but by the kind of wax he put on he moustache the west highland terrier of the old sort -- i do not of course speak of bench dog -- earn they living follow fox badger or otter wherever these go underground between over or under rock that no man could get at to move and some of such size that a hundred man could not move they -lrb- and oh the beauty of they note when they come across the right scent -rrb- i want my reader to understand this and not to think of a highland fox-cairn as if it be a english fox-earth dig in sand nor of badger work as if it be a question of locate the badger and then digging he out no the badger make he home amongst rock the small one perhaps two or three ton in weight and probably he have he ` hinner end ' against one of three or four hundred ton -- no digging he out -- and moreover the passage between the rock must be take as they be no scratch they a little wider so if you dog 's rib be a trifle too big he may crush one or two through the narrow slit and then stick he will never be able to pull himself back -- at least until starvation have so reduce he that he will probably be unable if set free to win -lrb- as we say in scotland -rrb- he way back to the open i remember a tale of one of my father 's terrier who get so lose the keeper go daily to the cairn hope against hope at last one day a pair of bright eye be see at the bottom of a hole they do not disappear when the dog 's name be call a brilliant idea seize one of the keeper the dog evidently could not get up so a rabbit skin be fold into a small parcel round a stone and let down by a string the dog at once seize the situation -- and the skin -- hold on be draw up and faint on reach the mouth of the hole he be carry home tenderly and nurse he recover refer to the characteristic of this terrier colonel malcolm continue : -- attention to breed as to color have undoubtedly increase the whiteness but other point be good a dog of the west highland white terrier breed be not to be reject if he show he descent by a slight degree of pale red or yellow on he back or he ear i know a old argyllshire family who consider that to improve they terrier they ought all to have browny yellow ear neither again except for the show bench be there the slightest objection to half drop ear -- _ ie _ the point of one or both ear just fall over unfortunately the show bench have a great tendency to spoil all breed from too much attention be give to what be evident -- and ear be grand thing for judge to pin they faith to also they greatly admire a fine long face and what be call -- but wrongly call -- a strong jaw meaning by that a ugly heavy face i have often point out that the tiger the cat the otter all animal remarkable for they strength of jaw have exceedingly short face but they bite be cruelly hard and what again could be daintier than the face of a fox the terrier of the west highland of scotland have come down to the present day build on what i may perhaps call the fox line and it be a type evolve by work -- hard and deadly dangerous work it be only of late year that dog have be breed for show the so-called ` scottish ' terrier which at present rule the roost date from 1879 as a show dog i therefore earnestly hope that no fancy will arise about these dog which will make they less hardy less wise less companionable less active or less desperate fighter underground than they be at present a young dog that i give to a keeper get its stomach tear open in a fight it come out of the cairn to its master to be help he put the entrails back to the best of he ability and then the dog slip out of he hand to finish the fight and force the fox out into the open that be the spirit of the breed but alas that can not be exhibit on the show bench they do say that a keeper of mine when chaff by the ` fancy ' about the baby face of he ` lot ' be drive to ask ` well can any of you gentleman oblige I with a cat and i 'll show you ' i do not hear he say it so it may only be a tale anyhow i have in my kennel a dog who at ten month old meet a vixen fox as she be bolt out of she cairn and he at once catch she by the throat stick to she till the pack come up and then on till she be kill in the course of one month he wound be heal and he have two other classical fight one with a cat and the other with a dog fox not bad for a pup with a ` baby face ' i trust my reader understand that the west highland white terrier be not white aberdeen not a new invention but have a most respectable ancestry of they own i add the formal list of point but this be the work of show bench expert -- and it will be see from what i have write that i do not agree with they on certain particulars there should be feather to a fair degree on the tail but if expert will not allow it put rosin on you hand and pull the hair out -- and the rosin will win you prize the eye should not be sink which give the sulky look of the ` scotch ' terrier but should be full and bright and the expression friendly and confide the skull should not be narrow anywhere it be almost impossible to get black nail in a dog of pure breed and the black soon wear off the pad work so folk must understand this on two occasion recently i have show dog acknowledge as dog to be quite first class ` but you see they be not the proper type ' the judge unfortunately have as yet they eye fill with the ` scottish ' terrier type and prefer mongrel that show it to the real ` simon pure ' \* \* \* \* \* standard of point : the general appearance of the west highland white terrier be that of a small

dandie dinmont be one of the race of the dog which can boast of a fairly ancient lineage though it be impossible now to say what be the exact origin of this breed we know that it be first recognize under its present name after the publication of scott 's _ guy manner _ in the year 1814 and we know that for many year previously there have exist in the border county a rough-haired short-legged race of terrier the constant and very effective companion of the border farmer and other in they fox-hunting expedition various theory have be suggest by different writer as to the manner in which the breed be found some say that the dandie be the result of cross a strain of rough-haired terrier with the dachshund other that a rough-haired terrier be cross with the otterhound and other again assert that no direct cross be ever introduce to find the breed but that it be gradually evolve from the rough-haired terrier of the border district and this latter theory be probably correct the dandie would appear to be closely related to the bedlington terrier in both breed we find the same indomitable pluck the same pendulous ear and a light silky topknot adorning the skull of each but the dandie be evolve into a long-bodied short-legged dog and the bedlington become a long-legged short-bodied dog indeed to illustrate the close relationship of the two breed a case be quote of the late lord antrim who in the early day of dog show exhibit two animal from the same litter and with the one obtain a prize or honorable mention in the dandie class and with the other a like distinction in the bedlington class it may be interesting to give a few particulars concern the traceable ancestor of the modern dandie in mr charle cook 's book on this breed we be give particulars of one william allan of holystone bear in 1704 and know as piper allan and celebrate as a hunter of otter and fox and for he strain of rough-haired terrier who so ably assist he in the chase william allan 's terrier descend to he son jame also know as the piper and bear in the year 1734 jame allan die in 1810 and be survive by a son who sell to mr franci somner at yetholm a terrier dog name old pepper descend from he grandfather 's famous dog hitchem old pepper be the great-grandsire of mr somner 's well-known dog shem these terrier belong to the allan and other in the district be consider by mr cook to be the earliest known ancestor of the modern dandie dinmont sir walter scott himself inform we that he do not draw the character of dandie dinmont from any one individual in particular but that the character would well fit a dozen or more of the lidderdale yeoman of he acquaintance however owe to the circumstance of he call all he terrier mustard and pepper without any other distinction except auld and young and little the name come to be fix by he associate upon one jame davidson of hindlee a wild farm in the teviotdale mountain jame davidson die in the year 1820 by which time the dandie dinmont terrier be be breed in considerable number by the border farmer and other to meet the demand for it which have spring up since the appearance of _ guy manner _ as a result of the controversy that be continually recur with regard to the point of a typical dandie dinmont there be form in the year 1876 the dandie dinmont terrier club with the object of settle the question for ever and for this purpose all the most note breeder and other interested be invite to give they view upon it the standard of point adopt by the club be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- strongly make and large not out of proportion to the dog 's size the muscle show extraordinary development more especially the maxillary skull -- broad between the ear get gradually less towards the eye and measure about the same from the inner corner of the eye to back of skull as it do from ear to ear the forehead well dome the head be cover with very soft silky hair which should not be confine to a mere topknot and the lighter in color and silkier it be the better the cheek start from the ear proportionately with the skull have a gradual taper towards the muzzle which be deep and strongly make and measure about three inch in length or in proportion to skull as three be to five the muzzle be cover with hair of a little darker shade than the topknot and of the same texture as the feather of the fore-leg the top of the muzzle be generally bare for about a inch from the black part of the nose the bareness come to a point towards the eye and be about one inch broad at the nose the nose and inside of mouth black or dark color the tooth very strong especially the canine which be of extraordinary size for such a small dog the canine fit well into each other so as to give the greatest available holding and punish power and the tooth be level in front the upper one very slightly overlap the under one -lrb- many of the finest specimen have a swine mouth which be very objectionable but it be not so great a objection as the protrusion of the under jaw -rrb- eye -- set wide apart large full round bright expressive of great determination intelligence and dignity set low and prominent in front of the head color a rich dark hazel ear -- pendulous set well back wide apart and low on the skull hang close to the cheek with a very slight projection at the base broad at the junction of the head and taper almost to a point the fore part of the ear taper very little the taper be mostly on the back part the fore part of the ear come almost straight down from its junction with the head to the tip they should harmonise in color with the body color in the case of a pepper dog they be cover with a soft straight brownish hair -lrb- in some case almost black -rrb- in the case of a mustard dog the hair should be mustard in color a shade darker than the body but not black all should have a thin feather of light hair start about two inch from the tip and of nearly the same color and texture as the topknot which give the ear the appearance of a distinct point the animal be often one or two year old before the feather be show the cartilage and skin of the ear should not be thick but rather thin length of ear from three to four inch neck -- very muscular well develop and strong show great power of resistance be well set into the shoulder body -- long strong and flexible rib well spring and round chest well develop and let well down between the fore-leg the back rather low at the shoulder have a slight downward curve and a corresponding arch over the loin with a very slight gradual drop from top of loin to root of tail both side of backbone well supply with muscle tail -- rather short say from eight inch to ten inch and cover on the upper side with wiry hair of darker color than that of the body the hair on the under side be lighter in color and not so wiry with a nice feather about two inch long get shorter as it near the tip rather thick at the root get thicker for about four inch then taper off to a point it should not be twist or curl in any way but should come up with a curve like a scimitar the tip when excite be in a perpendicular line with the root of the tail it should neither be set on too high nor too low when not excite it be carry gaily and a little above the level of the body leg -- the fore-leg short with immense muscular development and bone set wide apart the chest come well down between they the foot well form and _ not flat _ with very strong brown or dark-coloured claw bandy leg and flat foot be objectionable the hair on the fore-leg and foot of a pepper dog should be tan vary accord to the body color from a rich tan to a pale fawn of a mustard dog they be of a darker shade than its head which be a creamy white in both color there be a nice feather about two inch long rather lighter in color than the hair on the fore-part of the leg the hind-leg be a little longer than the fore one and be set rather wide apart but not spread out in a unnatural manner while the foot be much smaller the thigh be well develop and the hair of the same color and texture as the fore one but have no feather or dew claw the whole claw should be dark but the claw of all vary in shade accord to the color of the dog 's body coat -- this be a very important point the hair should be about two inch long that from skull to root of tail a mixture of hardish and soft hair which give a sort of crisp feel to the hand the hair should not be wiry the coat be term pily or pencil the hair on the under part of the body be lighter in color and softer than that on the top the skin on the belly accord with the color of dog color -- the color be pepper or mustard the pepper range from a dark bluish black to a light silver gray the intermediate shades be prefer the body color come well down the shoulder and hip gradually merge into the leg color the mustard vary from a reddish brown to a pale fawn the head be a creamy white the leg and foot of a shade darker than the head the claw be dark as in other color -lrb- nearly all dandie dinmont have some white on the chest and some have also white claw -rrb- size -- the height should be from 8 to 11 inch at the top of shoulder length from top of shoulder to root of tail should not be more than twice the dog 's height but preferably one or two inch less weight -- from 14 lb to 24 lb the best weight as near 18 lb as possible these weight be for dog in good work order \* \* \* \* \* in the above standard of point we have a very full and detailed account of what a dandie should be like and if only judge at show would bear they in mind a little more we should have fewer conflict decision give and dandie fancier and the public generally would not from time to time be set wonder as to what be the correct type of the breed a dandie make a excellent house guard for such a small dog he have a amazingly deep loud bark so that the stranger who have hear he bark on the far side of the door be quite astonished when he see the small owner of the big voice when keep as a companion he become a most devoted and affectionate little friend and be very intelligent as a dog to be keep in kennel there be certainly one great drawback where large kennel be desire and that be the risk of keep two or more dog in one kennel sooner or later there be sure to be a fight and when dandy fight it be generally a very serious matter if no one be present to separate they one or both of the combatant be pretty certain to be kill but when out walk the dandie be no more quarrelsome than other breed of terrier if properly train from puppyhood there be one little matter in breed dandy that be generally a surprise to the novice and that be the very great difference in the appearance of the young pup and the adult dog the pup be bear quite smooth-haired the pepper be black and tan in color and the mustard have a great deal of black in they color the topknot begin to appear sometimes when the dog be a few month old and sometimes not till he be a year or so old it be generally best to mate a mustard to a pepper to prevent the mustard become too light in color though two rich-coloured mustard may be mate together with good result it be a rather curious fact that when two mustard be mate some of the progeny be usually pepper in color though when two pepper be mate there be very seldom any mustard puppy the popularity of the dandie have now last for nearly a hundred year and there be no reason why it should not last for another century if breeder will only steer clear of the exaggeration of show point and continue to breed a sound active and hardy terrier chapter xli the skye and clydesdale terrier that the skye terrier should be call the heavenly breed be a tribute to the favor in which he be hold by he admirer certainly when he be see in perfection he be a exceedingly beautiful dog as certainly there be no breed more affectionate more faithful or more lovable among he characteristic be a long-enduring patience a prompt obedience and a deep-hearted tenderness combine with fearless courage he be more sensitive to rebuke and punishment than most dog and will nurse resentment to those who be unjust to he not viciously but with a almost human plaintiveness which demand a immediate reconciliation he be staunch and firm as he native hill to those who be kind to he and for enter into battle with a enemy there be no dog more recklessly daring and resolute visitor to dog show be dispose to believe that the skye terrier with its well-groomed coat that fall in smooth cascade down its side and its veil of thick hair that obscure the tender softness of its dark and thoughtful eye be mean only to look beautiful upon the bench or to recline in comfortable indolence on silken cushion this be a mistake see a team of skye race up a hillside after a fugitive rabbit tirelessly burrow after a rat or display they terrier strategy around a fox 's earth or a otter 's holt and you will admit that they be mean for sport and be demon at it even they peculiarity of build be a proof that they be bear to follow vermin underground they be long of body with short strong leg adapt for burrow with the dachshund they approximate more closely than any other breed to the shape of the badger the weasel and the otter and so many animal which nature have make long and low in order that they may inhabit earth and insinuate themselves into narrow passage in the moorland cairn there can be no question that these dog which be so typically highland in character and appearance as well as the clydesdale the scottish the dandie dinmont and the white poltalloch terrier be all the descendant of a purely native scottish original they be all inter-related but which be the parent breed it be impossible to determine it be even difficult to discover which of the two distinct type of the skye terrier be the earlier -- the variety whose ear stand alertly erect or its near relative whose ear be pendulous perhaps it do not matter the difference between the prick-eared skye and the drop-eared be so slight and the characteristic which they have in common be so many that a dual classification be hardly necessary the earliest description and engraving of the breed present a terrier considerably smaller than the type of to-day carry a fairly profuse hard coat with short leg a body long in proportion to its height and with ear that be neither erect nor drooping but semi-erect and capable of be raise to alertness in excitement it be the case that drop-ear puppy often occur in the litter of prick-eared parent and _ vice versa _ as its name imply this terrier have its early home in the misty island of skye which be not to say that it be not also to be find in lewi oronsay colonsay and other of the hebride as well as on the mainland of scotland dr johnson who visit these island with boswell in 1773 notice these terrier and observe that otter and weasel be plentiful in skye that the fox be numerous and that they be _ hunt by small dog _ he be so accurate a observer that one regret he do not describe the macleod 's terrier and they work they be at that time of many color vary from pure white to fawn and brown blue-grey and black the lighter color one have black muzzle ear and tail they tail be carry more gaily than would be permit by a modern judge of the breed in those day the highlander care less for the appearance than he do for the sport proclivity of he dog whose business it be to oust the tod from the earth in which it have take refuge and for this purpose certain quality be imperative first and foremost the terrier need to be small short of leg long and lithe in body with ample face fringe to protect he eye from injury and possess of unlimited pluck and dash the skye terrier of to-day do not answer to each and every one of these requirement he be too big -- decidedly he be too big -- especially in regard to the head a noble-looking skull with large well-feathered ear may be admirable as ornament but would assuredly debar its possessor from follow into a fox 's lair among the boulder then again he long coat would militate against the activity necessary for he legitimate call it be not until about 1860 that the skye terrier attract much notice among dog lover south of the border but queen victorium 's admiration of the breed of which from 1842 onward she always own favorite specimen and sir edwin landseer 's painting in which the skye be introduce have already draw public attention to the decorative and useful quality of this terrier the breed be include in the first volume of the kennel club stud book and the best among the early dog be such as mr pratt 's gillie and dunvegan mr d w fyfe 's novelty mr john bowman 's dandie and mr macdona 's rook these be mostly of the drop-eared variety and be breed small about the year 1874 fierce and stormy dispute arise concern the distinction of the scottish breed of terrier the controversy be continue until 1879 when the kennel club be approach with the view to furnish class the controversy be centre upon three type of scottish terrier : those which claim to be pure skye terrier a dog describe briefly as scotch and a third which for a time be miscall the aberdeen to those who have study the variety the distinction be clear but the question at issue be -- to which of the three rightly belong the title of scottish terrier the dog which the scot enthusiast be try to get establish under this classification be the cairn terrier of the highland know in some locality as the short-coated work skye and in other as the fox-terrier or tod-hunter a sub-division of this breed be the more leggy aberdeen variety the present-day skye be without doubt one of the most beautiful terrier in existence he be a dog of medium size with a weight not exceed 25 lb and not less than 18 lb he be long in proportion to he height with a very level back a powerful jaw with perfectly fitting tooth a small hazel eye and a long hard coat just reach the ground in the prick-eared variety the ear be carry erect with very fine ear feather and the face fringe be long and thick the ear feather and face fall be finer in quality than the coat which be exceedingly hard and weather-resisting and here it be well to point out that the skye have two distinct coat : the under coat somewhat soft and woolly and the upper hard and rain-proof this upper coat should be as straight as possible without any tendency to wave or curl the tail be not very long and should be nicely feathered and in repose never raise above the level of the back the same description apply to the drop-eared type except that the ear in repose instead of be carry erect fall evenly on each side of the head when however the dog be excite the ear be prick forward in exactly the same fashion as those of the airedale terrier this be a important point a houndy carriage of ear be a decide defect the drop-eared variety be usually the heavier and larger dog of the two and for some reason do not show the quality and breeding of its neighbor lately however there have evidently be a effort make to improve the drop-eared type with the result that some very excellent dog have recently appear at the important show probably mr jame pratt have devote more time and attention to the skye terrier than any other now live fancier though the name of mr kidd and mr todd be usually well know mr pratt 's skye be ally to the type of terrier claim to be the original skye of the highland the head be not so large the ear also be not so heavily feathered as be the case in the skye of to-day and the color be very varied range from every tint between black and white in 1892 a great impetus be give to the breed by mr hughe whose kennel at wolverley be of overwhelmingly good quality mr hughe be quickly follow by such ardent and successful fancier as sir claud and lady alexander of ballochmyle mr freeman miss bowyer smyth and miss mccheane lately other prominent exhibitor have force they way into the front rank among whom may be mention the countess of aberdeen mr hugh ripley mr wilmer miss whishaw and mr sandwith mr hughe ' wolverley duchess and wolverley jock be excellent type of what a prick-eared skye should be excellent too be mr freeman 's alister and sir claud alexander 's young rosebery olden time abbess and wee mac of adel mr wilmer 's jean and mr millar 's prince donard but the superlative skye of the period and probably the best ever breed be wolverley chummie the winner of thirty championship which be but the public acknowledgment of he perfection he be the property of miss mccheane who be also the owner of a almost equally good specimen of the other sex in fairfield diamond among the drop-eared skye of present celebrity may be mention mr hugh ripley 's perfection miss whishaw 's piper gray and lady aberdeen 's cromar kelpie there be two club in england and one in scotland institute to protect the interest of this breed namely the skye terrier club of england the skye and clydesdale club and the skye terrier club of scotland the scottish club 's description be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- long with powerful jaw and incisive tooth close level or upper just fitting over under _ skull _ : wide at front of brow narrowing between the ear and taper gradually towards the muzzle with little fall in between or behind the eye _ eye _ : hazel medium size close set _ muzzle _ : always black ear -lrb- prick or pendant -rrb- -- when _ prick _ not large

the neck long and gently crest tail -- when _ hang _ the upper half perpendicular the under half throw backward in a curve when _ raise _ a prolongation of the incline of the back and not rise higher

of body 1 average measurement : dog -- height at shoulder 9 inch length back of skull to root of tail 22-1\/2 inch muzzle to back of skull 8-1\/2 inch root of tail to tip joint 9 inch total length 40 inch bitch -- half a inch lower and 2-1\/2 inch shorter than dog all point proportional thus body 21 inch head 8 inch and tail 8-1\/2 inch total 37-1\/2 inch 2 average weight : dog -- 18 lb bitch 16 lb no dog should be over 20 lb nor under 16 lb and no bitch should be over 18 lb nor under 14 lb \* \* \* \* \* whereas the scottish club limit the approve length of coat to 5-1\/2 inch the english club give a maximum of 9 inch this be a fairly good allowance but many of the breed carry a much longer coat than this it be not uncommon indeed to find a skye with a covering of 12 inch in length which even allow for the round of the body cause the hair to reach and often to trail upon the ground the clydesdale may be describe as a anomaly he stand as it be upon a pedestal of he own and unlike other scotch terrier he be classify as non-sporting perhaps he marvellously fine and silky coat preclude he from the rough work of hunting after vermin though it be certain he game-like instinct would naturally lead he to do so of all the scottish dog he be perhaps the smallest he weight seldom exceed 18 lb he be thus describe by the skye terrier club of scotland : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- a long low level dog with heavily fringed erect ear and a long coat like the finest silk or spin glass which hang quite straight and evenly down each side from a parting extend from the nose to the root of the tail head -- fairly long skull flat and very narrow between the ear gradually widen towards the eye and taper very slightly to the nose which must be black the jaw strong and the tooth level eye -- medium in size dark in color not prominent but have a sharp terrier-like expression eyelid black ear -- small set very high on the top of the head carry perfectly erect and cover with long silky hair hanging in a heavy fringe down the side of the head body -- long deep in chest well rib up the back be perfectly level tail -- perfectly straight carry almost level with the back and heavily feathered leg -- as short and straight as possible well set under the body and entirely cover with silky hair foot round and cat-like coat -- as long and straight as possible free from all trace of curl or waviness very glossy and silky in texture with a entire absence of undercoat color -- a level bright steel blue extend from the back of the head to the root of the tail and on no account intermingle with any fawn light or dark hair the head leg and foot should be a clear bright golden tan free from gray sooty or dark hair the tail should be very dark blue or black \* \* \* \* \* the clydesdale terrier be rare at any rate as regard the show bench there be never more than two or three at most exhibit south of the tweed even when class be provide at the big show and championship offer thus indicate that the breed be not a popular one and amongst those kennel who do show there exist at the present time but one dog who can lay claim to the title of champion this unique specimen be the property of sir claud alexander bart of ballochmyle and be know under the name of wee wattie there be of course several fancier in scotland among whom may be mention mr g shaw of glasgow who be the owner of several fine example of the breed include beautiful san toy and the equally beautiful mozart as with the skye terrier it seem a matter of difficulty to produce a perfect clydesdale and until the breed be take up with more energy it be improbable that first class dog will make a appearance in the show ring a perfect clydesdale should figure as one of the most elegant of the terrier breed he lovely silken coat the golden brown hue of he face fringe paw and leg he well pricked and feathery ear and he generally smart appearance should combine to form a picture exciting general admiration chapter xlii the yorkshire terrier the most devout lover of this charming and beautiful terrier would fail if he be to attempt to claim for he the distinction of descent from antiquity bradford and not babylon be he earliest home and he must be candidly acknowledge to be a very modern manufacture variety of the dog yet it be important to remember that it be in yorkshire that he be make -- yorkshire where live the cleverest breeder of dog that the world have know one can roughly reconstitute the process what the yorkshireman desire to make for themselves be a pigmy prick-eared terrier with a long silky silvery gray and tan coat they already possess the foundation in the old english black and tan wire-haired terrier to lengthen the coat of this work breed they might very well have have recourse to a cross with the prick-eared skye and to eliminate the wiry texture of the hair a further cross with the maltese dog would impart softness and silkiness without reduce the length again a cross with the clydesdale which be then assume a fix type would bring the variety yet nearer to the ideal and a return to the black and tan would tend to conserve the desire color in all probability the dandie dinmont have some share in the process evidence of origin be often to be find more distinctly in puppy than in the mature dog and it be to be note that the puppy of both the dandie and the yorkshire be bear with decide black and tan color the original broken-haired yorkshire terrier of thirty year ago be often call a scottish terrier or even a skye and there be many person who still confound he with the clydesdale whom he somewhat closely resemble at the present time he be classify as a toy dog and exhibit almost solely as such it be to be regret that until very lately the terrier character be be gradually breed out of he and that the perkiness the exuberance and gameness which once distinguish he as the companion of the yorkshire operative be in danger of be sacrifice to the desire for diminutive size and inordinate length of coat perhaps it would be a error to blame the breeder of yorkshire terrier for this departure from the original type as it appear say about 1870 it be necessary to take into consideration the probability that what be now call the old-fashioned work variety be never regard by the yorkshireman who make he as a complete and finish achievement it be possibly they idea at the very begin to produce just such a diminutive dog as be now to be see in its perfection at exhibition glory in its flow tress of steel blue silk and ruddy gold and one must give they full credit for the patience and care with which during the past forty year they have be steadily work to the fixed design of produce a dwarf breed which should excel all other breed in the length and silkiness of its robe the extreme of cultivation in this particular quality be reach some year ago by mr troughear whose little dog conqueror weigh 5-1\/2 lb have a beautiful envelop mantle of the uniform length of four-and-twenty inch doubtless all successful breeder and exhibitor of the yorkshire terrier have they little secret and they peculiar method of induce the growth of hair they regulate the diet with extreme particularity keep the dog lean rather than fat and give he nothing that they would not themselves eat bread mixed with green vegetable a little meat and gravy or fresh fish vary with milk pudding and spratt 's toy pet biscuit should be the staple food bone ought not to be give as the act of gnawing they be apt to mar the beard and moustache for the same reason it be well when possible to serve the food from the finger but many owner use a sort of mask or hood of elastic material which they tie over the dog 's head at meal-time to hold back the long face-fall and whisker that would otherwise be smear and sully similarly as a protection for the coat when there be any skin irritation and a inclination to scratch linen or cotton stocking be wear upon the hind foot many exhibitor pretend that they use no dress or very little and this only occasionally for the jacket of they yorkshire terrier but it be quite certain that continuous use of grease of some sort be not only advisable but even necessary opinion differ as to which be the best cosmetic but hairmero the dress prepare for the purpose by miss d wilmer of yoxford suffolk could not easily be improve upon for this or any other long-coated breed for the full display of they beauty yorkshire terrier depend very much upon careful groom it be only by groom that the silvery cascade of hair down the dog 's side and the beautiful tan face-fall that flow like a rain of gold from he head can be keep perfectly straight and free from curl or wrinkle and no grease or pomade even if they use be officially permit could impart to the coat the glisten sheen that be give by the dexterous application of the brush the gentle art of grooming be not to be teach by theory practice be the best teacher but the novice may learn much by observe the deft method employ by a expert exhibitor mr peter eden of manchester be generally credit with be the actual inventor of the yorkshire terrier he be certainly one of the earliest breeder and owner and he celebrated albert be only one of the many admirable specimen with which he convince the public of the charm of this variety of dog he may have give the breed its first impulse but mr m a foster of bradford be for many year the head and center of all that pertain to the yorkshire terrier and it be undoubtedly she who raise the variety to its highest point of perfection she dog be invariably good in type she never exhibit a bad one and she huddersfield ben toy smart bright sandy ted bradford hero bradford marie and bradford queen -- the last be a bitch weigh only 24 oz -- be remember for they uniform excellence of more recent example that have approach perfection may be mention mr walton 's ashton king queen and bright and she mont thabor duchess mr mitchell 's westbrook fred have deservedly win many honor and mr firmstone 's grand duke and mynd damari and mr sinclair 's mascus superbus stand high in the estimation of expert judge of the breed perhaps the most beautiful bitch ever show be waveless the property of mr r marshall the owner of another admirable bitch in little picture mr w shaw 's ch sneinton amethyst be also a admirable specimen the standard of point lay down by the yorkshire terrier club be as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- that of a long-coated pet dog the coat hang quite straight and evenly down each side a parting extend from the nose to the end of the tail the animal should be very compact and neat he carriage be very sprightly bear a air of importance although the frame be hide beneath a mantle of hair the general outline should be such as to suggest the existence of a vigorous and well-proportioned body head -- should be rather small and flat not too prominent or round in the skull rather broad at the muzzle with a perfectly black nose the hair on the muzzle very long which should be a rich deep tan not sooty or gray under the chin long hair about the same color as on the crown of the head which should be a bright golden tan and not on any account intermingle with dark or sooty hair hair on the side of the head should be very long of a few shades deeper tan than that on the top of the head especially about the ear-roots eye -- medium in size dark in color have a sharp intelligent expression and place so as to look directly forward they should not be prominent the edge of the eyelid should be dark ear -- small v-shaped and carry semi-erect cover with short hair color to be a deep rich tan mouth -- good even mouth tooth as sound as possible a dog have lose a tooth or two through accident or otherwise be not to disqualify provide the jaw be even body -- very compact with a good loin and level on the top of the back coat -- the hair as long and as straight as possible -lrb- not wavy -rrb- should be glossy like silk -lrb- not woolly -rrb- extend from the back of the head to the root of the tail color a bright steel blue and on no account intermingle with fawn light or dark hair all tan should be darker at the root than at the middle of the hair shade off to a still lighter tan at the tip leg -- quite straight should be of a bright golden tan well cover with hair a few shades lighter at the end than at the root foot -- as round as possible toe-nail black tail -- cut to medium length with plenty of hair darker blue than the rest of the body especially at the end of the tail which be carry slightly higher than the level of the back weight -- divide into two class under 5 lb and over 5 lb to 12 lb chapter xliii the pomeranian long before the pomeranian dog be common in great britain this breed be to be meet with in many part of europe especially in germany and he be know under different name accord to he size and the locality in which he flourish the title of pomeranian be not admit by the german at all who claim this as one of they national breed and give it the general name of the german spitz at athen in the street of tomb there be a representation of a little spitz leap up to the daughter of a family as she be take leave of they which bear the date equivalent to 56 bc and in the british museum there be a ancient bronze jar of greek workmanship upon which be engrave a group of winged horse at whose foot there be a small dog of undoubted pomeranian type the date be the second century bc it be now generally accept that wherever we pomeranian originate he be a northern or arctic breed evidence go to show that he native land in prehistoric time be the land of the samoyede in the north of siberium along the shore of the arctic ocean the samoyede dog be be gradually introduce into england and good specimen can be frequently see at the principal show the similarity between we large white pomeranian and the samoyede be too great to be accidental and we be draw to the conclusion that in prehistoric time a migration of the samoyede be make from they native land into pomeranium the most eastern province of prussium border on the baltic sea and that these people take with they they dog which be the progenitor of the present race of pomeranian or spitz but in any case the pomeranian dog so call have be a native of various part of europe from very early time he advent into england have be of comparatively recent date at least in any great number so far as can be ascertain since no ancient record exist on this question gainsborough however paint the famous actress mr robinson with a large white pomeranian sit by she side in ree ' _ encyclopedia _ publish in 1816 a good picture of a white pomeranian be give with a fairly truthful description in this work he be say to be larger than the common sheep dog ree give he name as _ cani pomeranius _ from linnaeus and _ chien loup _ from buffon from these example therefore we may infer that the large pomeranian or wolf spitz be already know in england towards the end of the eighteenth century at least there be however no systematic register of pomeranian prior to the year 1870 even ten year later than this last date so little be the breed appreciate that a well-known writer on dog begin a article on the pomeranian with the word the pomeranian be admittedly one of the least interesting dog in existence and consequently he supporter be few and far between the founder of the kennel club hold they first dog show in 1870 and in that year only three pomeranian be exhibit for the next twenty year little or no permanent increase occur in the number of pomeranian enter at the chief dog show in england the largest entry take place in 1881 when there be fifteen but in 1890 there be not a single pomeranian show from this time however the number rapidly increase commence in 1891 with fourteen increase in 1901 to sixty it culminate in 1905 with the record number of one hundred and twenty-five such a rapid advance between the year 1890 and 1905 be unprecedented in the history of dog show although it be right to add that this extraordinarily rapid rise into popularity have since be equal in the case of the now fashionable pekinese this tendency to advancement in public favor be contemporaneous with the formation of the pomeranian club of england which be found in 1891 and through its foster care the pomeranian have reach a height of popularity far in advance of that attain by any other breed of toy dog one of the first act of the club be to draw up a standard of point as follow : -- \* \* \* \* \* appearance -- the pomeranian should be a compact short couple dog well knit in frame he should exhibit great intelligence in he expression and activity and buoyancy in he deportment head and nose -- should be foxy in outline or wedge-shaped the skull be slightly flat large in proportion to the muzzle which should finish rather fine and free from lippiness the tooth should be level and should on no account be undershoot the hair on the head and face should be smooth and short-coated the nose should be black in white orange and sable dog but in other color may be self but never parti-colour or white ear -- should be small not set too far apart nor too low down but carry perfectly erect like those of a fox and like the head should be cover with short soft hair eye -- should be medium in size not full nor set too wide apart bright and dark in color show great intelligence in white shaded sable or orange dog the rim round the eye should be black neck and body -- the neck should be rather short well set in the back must be short and the body compact be well rib up and the barrel well round the chest must be fairly deep and not too wide but in proportion to the size of the dog leg -- the fore-leg must be well feathered perfectly straight of medium length and not such as would be term leggy or low on leg but in due proportion in length and strength to a well-balanced frame must be fine in bone and free in action the hind-leg and thigh must be well feathered neither contract nor wide behind the foot small and compact in shape shoulder should be clean and well lay back tail -- the tail be one of the characteristic of the breed and should be turn over the back and carry flat and straight be profusely cover with long harsh spreading hair coat -- there should be two coat a undercoat and a overcoat the one a soft fluffy undercoat the other a long perfectly straight coat harsh in texture cover the whole of the body be very abundant round the neck and fore part of the shoulder and chest where it should form a frill of profuse standing off straight hair extend over the shoulder the hind-quarter should be clothe with long hair or feather from the top of the rump to the hock color -- all whole color be admissible but they should be free from white or shading and the whites must be quite free from lemon or any other color a few white hair in any of the self color shall not necessarily disqualify at present the whole color dog be : -- white black brown -lrb- light or dark -rrb- blue -lrb- as pale as possible -rrb- orange -lrb- which should be as deep and even in color as possible -rrb- beaver or cream dog other than white with white foot or foot leg or leg be decidedly objectionable and should be discourage and can not compete as whole color specimen in parti-coloured dog the color should be evenly distribute on the body in patch a dog with white or tan foot or chest would not be a parti-colour shaded sable should be shaded throughout with three or more color the hair to be as uniformly shaded as possible with no patch of self color in mixed class where whole color and parti-coloured pomeranian compete together the preference should if in other point they be equal be give to the whole color specimen where classification be not by color the following be recommend for adoption by show committee : -- 1 not exceed 7 lb -lrb- pomeranian miniature -rrb- 2 exceed 7 lb -lrb- pomeranian -rrb- 3 pomeranian and pomeranian miniature mixed \* \* \* \* \* the early type of a pomeranian be that of a dog vary from 10 lb or 12 lb weight up to 20 lb weight or even more and some few of about 12 lb and over be still to be meet with but the tendency among present-day breeder be to get they as small as possible so that diminutive specimen weigh less than 5 lb be now quite common and always fetch higher price than the heavier one the divide weight as arrange some ten year ago by the pomeranian club be 8 lb and the kennel club have recently divide the breed into two class of pomeranian and pomeranian miniature as a rule the white specimen adhere more nearly to the primitive type and be generally over 8 lb in weight but through the exertion of many breeder several be now to be see under this limit the principal breeder of this color in england to-day be miss hamilton of rozelle miss chell miss lee-robert mr pope and mr goodall-copestake the first two whites to become full champion under kennel club rule be rob of rozelle and konig of rozelle both belong to miss hamilton of rozelle more black pomeranian have be breed in england than of any other color and during the last fifteen year the number of good specimen that have appear at we great exhibition have be legion there do not seem to be so many really good one to-day as heretofore this be explain perhaps by the fact that other color be now receive more and more attention from breeder a typical small black of to-day be billie tee the property of mr and mr stanley mappin he scale only 5-1\/2 lb and be therefore as to size and weight as well as shape style and smartness of action a good type of a toy pomeranian he be breed by mr cate and be the winner of over fifty prize and many special to enumerate all the first-class black during the last thirty year would be impossible but those which stand out first and foremost have be black boy king pippin kaffir boy bayswater swell kensington king marland king black prince hatcham nip walkley queenie viva gateacre zulu glympton king edward and billie tee the brown variety have for a long time be a especial favorite with the public and many good one have be breed during the last ten year there be many different shades of brown vary from a dark chocolate to a light beaver but in all case they should be whole-coloured a admirable example of the brown pomeranian be the incomparable ch tina this beautiful little lady be breed by mr addi from bayswater swell ex kitsey and scale a little under 5 lb she win over every pomeranian that compete against she besides have be many time place over all other dog of any breed in open competition the shaded sable be among the prettiest of all the various color which pomeranian may assume they must be shaded throughout with three or more color as uniformly as possible with no patch of self-colour they be become very popular and good specimen be much seek after at high price mr hall-walker have be constant in she devotion to this variety for several year and she possess a very fine team in champion dainty boy dainty belle bibury belle and in gateacre sable sue mr vale nicolas also have recently be most successful with shaded sable ch nanky po over 8 lb and champion sable mite and atom bear witness to this statement she lovely mite be a typical example of a small pomeranian of this color he be breed by mr hirst by little nipper ex laurel fluffie and scale only 4-1\/4 lb mention should also be make of miss ive ' dragon fly mr boutcher 's lady wolfino miss bland 's marland topaz mr walter winan ' morning light and mr fowler 's may duchess the blues or smoke-coloured pomeranian have likewise they admirer and among those who have take up these as a speciality may be mention miss ive mr parker mr loy and miss ruby cooke another color which have attain of late year increase popularity in england be orange these should be self-coloured throughout and light shading though not disqualify should be discourage the principal breeder of the orange pomeranian to-day be mr w brown of raleigh essex who have probably more specimen in he kennel than any other breeder of this color tiny boy the boy and orange boy be he best and all three be approve sire mr hall-walker be a admirer of this color and she gateacre philander lupino and orange girl be great prize-winner miss hamilton of rozelle have for many year breed orange and have give to the pomeranian club of which she be president two challenge cup for pomeranian of this color mr birch also be a lover of this hue and possess such good dog as rufus rusticus and cheriwinkle there be still another variety which bear the name of parti-coloured as the name imply these dog must be of more than one color and the color should be evenly distribute on the body in patch for example a black dog with a white foot or leg or chest would not be a parti-colour as a matter of fact there have be breed in england very few parti-coloured pomeranian they seem to be freak which be rarely produce it do not follow that by mate a black dog to a white bitch or _ vice versa _ a parti-coloured will be necessarily obtain on the contrary it be more likely that the litter will consist of some whole-coloured black and some whole-coloured whites miss hamilton 's mafeking of rozelle and mr vale nicola 's shelton novelty be the two most prominent specimen at the present time although mr harcourt-clare 's magpie and mr temple 's leyswood tom tit be perhaps better know some time ago among toy dog this particular breed have enjoy a unprecedented popularity the growth in the public favor among all class have be gradual and permanent during the last fifteen year and there be no sign that it be lose its hold on the love and affection of a large section of the english people he handsome appearance he activity and hardihood he devotedness to he owner he usefulness as a housedog and he many other admirable quality will always make the pomeranian a favorite both in the cottage and in the palace chapter xliv the king charle spaniel in the fourth chapter of macaulay 's _ history of england _ we read of king charle ii that he might be see before the dew be off the grass in st jame 's park striding among the tree play with he spaniel and fling corn to he duck and these exhibition endear he to the common people who always like to see the great unbend queen elizabeth 's physician dr caius describe these little spaniel as delicate neate and pretty kind of dogge call the spaniel gentle or the comforter and further say : these dogge be little pretty proper and fyne and seek for to satisfie the delicatenesse of daintie dame and wanton woman 's will instrument of folly for they to play and dally withall to tryfle away the treasure of time to withdraw they minde from they commendable exercise these puppy the smaller they be the more pleasure they provoke as more meete playfellowe for minse mistriss to beare in they bosom to keepe company withall in they chamber to succor with sleepe in bed and nourishe with meate at board to lie in they lappe and licke they lippe as they ryde in they waggon and good reason it should be so for coursenesse with fynenesse have no fellowship but featnesse with neatnesse have neighborhood enough there would appear to be much divergence of opinion as to the origin of this breed and the date of its first appearance in england but it be certainly acclimatise here as early as the reign of henry viii and it be generally think that it be of japanese origin take from japan to spain by the early voyager to the east and thence import into england the english toy spaniel of to-day especially the blenheim variety be also say by some to be relate to some sport spaniel which belong to queen mary about the year 1555 and might have be bring over from germany mary keep a pack of spaniel for hunting purpose there be another theory advance and with some reason that the english toy spaniel of the present day derive its origin from the cocker spaniel as these larger dog have the same color and marking black and tan tricolor and red and white the cocker also occasionally have the spot on the forehead which be a characteristic of the blenheim be the origin of the king charle spaniel and its advent in this country what it may king charle ii so much indulge and love these little friend that they follow he hither and thither as they pleased and seem to have be seldom separate from he by he they be love and cherish and bring into great popularity in he company they adorn canvas and ancient tapestry and be repute to have be allow free access at all time to whitehall hampton court and other royal palace there be now four recognize variety of the english toy spaniel or more properly speak five as the marlborough blenheim be consider a distinct type the latter be say by some to be the oldest of the toy spaniel by other to have be first bring over from spain during the reign of charle ii by john churchill first duke of marlborough from whose home blenheim palace the name be derive and have ever since be retain if we may take the evidence of vandyck watteau francoi boucher and greuze in whose picture they be so frequently introduce all the toy spaniel of bygone day have much longer nose and smaller flatter head than those of the present time and they have much longer ear these in many instance drag on the ground the marlborough blenheim have retain several of the ancestral point although this variety be of the same family and have the same name as the short-nosed blenheim of the present day there be a great deal of difference between the two type the marlborough be higher on the leg which need not be so fully feathered he have a much longer muzzle and a flatter and more contract skull the marlborough possess many of the attribute of a sport spaniel but so also do the modern blenheim although perhaps in a lesser degree he have a very good scent mr rawdon b lee state that the blenheim of marlborough be excellent dog to work the covert for cock and pheasant and that except in color there be in reality not much difference in appearance between the older orange and white dog -lrb- not as they be to-day with they abnormally short nose round skull and enormous eye -rrb- and the liver and white cocker which h b chalon draw for daniel 's _ rural sport _ in 1801 this will bear out the statement that the smaller type of spaniel may be descend from the cocker the ground color of this dog be white with chestnut encircle the ear to the muzzle the side of the neck be chestnut as be also the ear there be a white blaze on the forehead in the center of which should be a clear lozenge-shaped chestnut spot call the beauty spot which by inbreed with other variety be fast be lose chestnut marking be on the body and on the side of the hind-leg the coat should incline to be curly the head must be flat not broad and the muzzle should be straight the chestnut should be of a rich color the four variety -- the king charle tricolor or -lrb- as he have be call -rrb- charle i spaniel the modern blenheim and the ruby -- have all the same point differ from one another in color only and the follow description of the point as determine by the toy spaniel club serve for all : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- should be well domed and in good specimen be absolutely semi-globular sometimes even extend beyond the half-circle and project over the eye so as nearly to meet the upturned nose eye -- the eye be set wide apart with the eyelid square to the line of the face not oblique or fox-like the eye themselves be large and dark as possible so as to be generally consider black they enormous pupil which be absolutely of that color increase the description there be always a certain amount of weep show at the inner angle this be owe to a defect in the lachrymal duct stop -- the stop or hollow between the eye be well mark as in the bulldog or even more so some good specimen exhibit a hollow deep enough to bury a small marble nose -- the nose must be short and well turn up between the eye and without any indication of artificial displacement afford by a deviation to either side the color of the end should be black and it should be both deep and wide with open nostril jaw -- the muzzle must be square and deep and the lower jaw wide between the branch leave plenty of space for the tongue and for the attachment of the lower lip which should completely conceal the tooth it should also be turn up or finish so as to allow of its meet the end of the upper jaw turn up in a similar way as above describe ear -- the ear must be long so as to approach the ground in a average-sized dog they measure twenty inch from tip to tip and some reach twenty-two inch or even a trifle more they should be set low on the head hang flat to the side of the cheek and be heavily feathered in this last respect the king charle be expect to exceed the blenheim and he ear occasionally extend to twenty-four inch size -- the most desirable size be indicate by the accept weight of from 7 lb to 10 lb shape -- in compactness of shape these spaniel almost rival the pug but the length of coat add greatly to the apparent bulk as the body when the coat be wet look small in comparison with that dog still it ought to be decidedly cobby with strong stout leg short broad back and wide chest the symmetry of the king charle be of importance but it be seldom that there be any defect in this respect coat -- the coat should be long silky soft and wavy but not curly in the blenheim there should be a profuse mane extend well down in the front of the chest the feather should be well display on the ear and foot and in the latter case so thickly as to give the appearance of they be web it be also carry well up the back of the leg in the black and tan the feather on the ear be very long and profuse exceed that of the blenheim by a inch or more the feather on the tail -lrb- which be cut to the length of three and a half to four inch -rrb- should be silky and from five to six inch in length constitute a marked flag of a square shape and not carry above the level of the back color -- the color differ with the variety the black and tan be a rich glossy black and deep mahogany tan tan spot over the eye and the usual marking on the muzzle chest and leg be also require the ruby be a rich chestnut red and be whole-coloured the presence of a _ few _ white hair _ intermix with the black _ on the chest of a black and tan or _ intermix with the red _ on the chest of a ruby spaniel shall carry _ weight against _ a dog but shall not in itself absolutely disqualify but a white patch on the chest or white on any other part of a black and tan or ruby spaniel shall be a disqualification the blenheim must on no account be whole-coloured but should have a ground of pure pearly white with bright rich chestnut or ruby red marking evenly distribute in large patch the ear and cheek should be red with a blaze of white extend from the nose up the forehead and end between the ear in a crescentic curve in the center of this blaze at the top of the forehead there should be a clear spot of red of the size of a sixpence tan tick on the fore-leg and on the white muzzle be desirable the tricolor should in part have the tan of the black and tan with marking like the blenheim in black instead of red on a pearly-white ground the ear and under the tail should also be line with tan the tricolor have no spot that beauty be peculiarly the property of the blenheim the all red king charle be know by the name of ruby spaniel the color of the nose be black the point of the ruby be the same as those of the black and tan differ only in color \* \* \* \* \* the king charle variety use to consist of black and tan and black and white spaniel and it be think that by the inter-breeding of the two specimen the tricolor be produce the color of the king charle now be a glossy black with rich mahogany tan spot over the eye and on the cheek there should also be some tan on the leg and under the tail the prince charle or tricolor should have a pearly-white ground with glossy black marking evenly distribute over the body in patch the ear should be line with tan tan must also be see over the eye and some on the cheek under the tail also tan must appear the blenheim must also have a pearly-white ground with bright rich chestnut or ruby red marking evenly distribute in patch over the body the ear and cheek must be red and a white blaze should stretch from the nose to the forehead and thence in a curve between the ear in the middle of the forehead there should be on the white blaze a clear red spot about the size of a sixpence this be call the blenheim spot which as well as the profuse mane add greatly to the beauty of this particular toy spaniel unfortunately in a litter of blenheim the spot be often want the ruby spaniel be of one color a rich unbroken red the nose be black there be now some very beautiful specimen of ruby spaniel but it be only within the last quarter of a century that this variety have exist it seem to have originally appear in a litter of king charle puppy when it be look upon as a freak of nature take for its entire color only the tan marking and lose the black ground the different variety of toy spaniel have be so much interbreed that a litter have be repute to contain the four kind but this would be of very rare occurrence the blenheim be now often cross with the tricolor when the litter consist of puppy quite true to the two type the cross of the king charle with the ruby be also attend with very good result the tan marking on the king charle become very bright and the color of the ruby also be improve neither of these specimen should be cross with either the blenheim or the tricolor as white must not appear in either the king charle or the ruby spaniel it be regret by some of the admirer of these dog that custom have ordain that they tail should be dock as portray in early picture of the king charle and the blenheim variety the tail be long well flag and incline to curve gracefully over the back and in none of the picture of the suppose ancestor of we present toy spaniel -- even so recent as those paint by sir edwin landseer -- do we find a absence of the long tail if leave intact the tail would take two or three year to attain perfection but the same may be say of the dog generally which improve very much with age and be not at its best until it be three year old and even then continue to improve although the toy spaniel be unquestionably true aristocrat by nature birth and breeding and be most at home in a drawing-room or on a well-kept lawn they be by no means deficient in sport proclivity and in spite of they short nose they scent be very keen they thoroughly enjoy a good scamper and be all the better for not be too much pampered they be very good house-dog intelligent and affectionate and have sympathetic coax little way one point in they favor be the fact that they be not noisy and do not yap continually when stranger go into a room where they be or at other time as be the habit with some breed of toy dog those who have once have king charle spaniel as pet seldom care to replace they by any other variety of dog fear lest they might not find in another breed such engaging little friend and companion gentle as of yore and also comforter although these dog need care they possess great power of endurance they appreciate warmth and comfort but do not thrive so well in either extreme heat or intense cold one thing to be avoid be the wetting of they feathered foot or should this happen allow they to remain so and as in the case of all dog with long ear the interior of the ear should be carefully keep dry to avoid the risk of canker in go back to a period long before the last century be half-way through we find that a great number of these ornamental pet be in the hand of work man live in the east end of london and the competition among they to own the best be very keen they hold miniature dog show at small tavern and parade they dog on the sanded floor of tap-room they owner sit around smoking long church-warden pipe the value of good specimen in those early day appear to have be from p5 to p250 which latter sum be say to have be refuse by a comparatively poor man for a small black and tan with very long ear and a nose much too long for we present-day fancy among the name of some old prominent breeder and exhibitor may be mention those of c aistrop j garwood j a bugg and mr forder it be interesting to note on look over a catalogue of the kennel club show that in 1884 the class for toy spaniel number five with two championship prize one each for blenheim and black and tan and the total entry be 19 at this date neither tricolor nor ruby be recognize as a separate variety by the kennel club and they have no place in the register of breed until the year 1902 at the kennel club show in 1904 thirty-one class be provide and eight challenge certificate prize be give the entry numbering 109 the formation of the toy spaniel club in 1885 and the impetus give to breeder and exhibitor by the numerous show with good classification have cause this beautiful breed to become more popular year by year fifty year ago the owner might be almost count on the finger of one 's hand now probably the day of the year would hardly cover they among the most successful exhibitor of late year have be the hon mr mclaren morrison the hon mr lytton mr grave mr l h thompson miss young mr h b looker mr privette miss hall the miss clarkson and grantham mr dean mr h taylor mr bright mr adamson miss spofforth mr hope paterson mr lydium jenkin and miss e taylor the novice fancier desirous of breed for profit exhibition or pleasure when price be a object for consideration be often better advise to purchase a healthy puppy from a breeder of repute rather than to be delude with the notion that a good adult can be purchase for a few pound or to be carry away with the idea that a cheap indifferently breed specimen will produce first-class stock it take year to breed out bad point but good blood will tell when you be purchase a bitch with the intention of breed many inquiry should be make as to the stock from which she come this will influence the selection of the sire to whom she be to be mate and he should excel in the point in which she be deficient it be absolutely necessary to have perfectly healthy animal and if the female be young and small stock be desire she mate should be several year she senior a plain specimen of the right blood be quite likely to produce good result to the breeder for example should there be two female puppy in a well-bred litter one remarkable as promise to have all the requirement for a come champion the other large and plain this latter should be select for breed purpose as be stronger she will make a better and more useful mother than she handsome sister who should be keep for exhibition or for sale at a remunerative price the modern craze for small specimen make they quite unsuitable for procreation a brood bitch should not be less than 9 lb in weight and even heavier be preferable a sire the same size will produce small and far more typical stock than one of 5 lb or 6 lb as the tendency be to degenerate especially in head point but small size can be obtain by suitably select the parent the early spring be the best season for breed as it give the puppy a start of at least six month in which to grow and get strong before the cold weather set in although of course they can be breed at any time but autumn and winter puppy be more troublesome to rear it be always wise to administer occasionally both to puppy and adult a dose of worm medicine so as to give no chance to internal parasite -- the most troublesome ill with which the dog owner have to wrestle cause even more mortality than the dreaded scourge of distemper the rule of hygiene can not be overlook as upon they hang the success of the breeder plenty of fresh air light and sunshine be as necessary as food puppy of this breed be essentially delicate and must be keep free from cold and draught but they require liberty and freedom to develop and strengthen they limb otherwise they be liable to develop rickets they food should be of the best quality and after the age of six month nothing seem more suitable than stale brown breed cut up dice size and moisten with good stock gravy together with minced lean underdone roast beef with the addition two or three time a week of a little well-cooked green vegetable vary with rice or suet pudding and plain biscuit fish may also be give occasionally when only two or three dog be keep table scrap will generally be sufficient but the pernicious habit of feed at all time and give sweet pastry and rich dainty be most harmful and must produce disastrous result to the unfortunate animal two meal a day at regular interval be quite sufficient to keep these little pet in the best condition although puppy should be feed four time daily in small quantity after leave the mother they will thrive better if put on dry food and a small portion of scraped or finely mince lean meat give they every other day alternately with a chop hard-boiled egg and stale bread-crumb chapter xlv the pekinese and the japanese few of the many breed of foreign dog now establish in england have attain such a measure of popularity in so short a time as the pekinese of they early history little be know beyond the fact that at the looting of the summer palace of pekin in 1860 bronze effigy of these dog know to be more than two thousand year old be find within the sacred precinct the dog be and be to this day jealously guard under the supervision of the chief eunuch of the court and few have ever find they way into the outer world so far as the writer be aware the history of the breed in england date from the importation in 1860 of five dog take from the summer palace where they have no doubt be forget on the flight of the court to the interior admiral lord john hay who be present on active service give a graphic account of the finding of these little dog in a part of the garden frequent by a aunt of the emperor who have commit suicide on the approach of the ally force lord john and another naval officer a cousin of the late duchess of richmond 's each secure two dog the fifth be take by general dunne who present it to queen victorium lord john take pain to ascertain that none have find they way into the french camp and he hear then that the other have all be remove to jehal with the court it be therefore reasonable to suppose that these five be the only palace dog or sacred temple dog of pekin which reach england and it be from the pair which live to a respectable old age at goodwood that so many of the breed now in england trace they descent -lrb- illustration : toy dog 1 miss steven ' typical japanese puppy 2 mr vale nicolas 's pomeranian ch the

success even after a correspondence with pekin which last more than two year but we succeed in obtain confirmation of what we have always understand : namely that the palace dog be rigidly guard and that they theft be punishable by death at the time of the boxer rebellion only spaniel pug and poodle be find in the imperial palace when it be occupy by the ally force the little dog have once more precede the court in the flight to si-gnanfu the duchess of richmond occasionally give away a dog to intimate friend such as the dowager lady wharncliffe lady dorothy nevill and other but in those day the pekinese be practically a unknown quantity and it can therefore be more readily understand what interest be arouse about eleven year ago by the appearance of a small dog similar in size color and general type to those so carefully cherish at goodwood this prove to be none other than the since well-known sire ah cum own by mr dougla murray whose husband have extensive interest in china have manage after many year to secure a true palace dog smuggle in a box of hay place inside a crate which contain japanese deer ah cum be mate without delay to two goodwood bitch the result be in the first litter ch goodwood lo and goodwood put-sing to these three sire some of the bluest pekinese blood be traceable _ vide _ ch goodwood chum ch chu-erh of alderbourne ch gia-gia manchu tao-tai goodwood ming marland myth and other it must however be clearly admit that since the popularity of the breed have become establish we unluckily see score of pekinese in the show-ring who have lose all resemblance to the original type and for this the pekinese club be in some measure to blame the original point for the guidance of breeder and judge be draw up by lady samuelson mr dougla murray and lady algernon gordon-lennox who fix the maximum size at 10 lb -- a very generous margin since then the club have amend the scale of point no doubt in order to secure a larger membership and the maximum now stand at 18 lb be it therefore to be wonder at that confusion exist as to what be the true type at show there should be two distinct class the palace dog and the pekin spaniel or any other name which would enable the breed to be keep distinct the follow be the scale of point as issue by the pekinese club : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- massive broad skull wide and flat between the ear -lrb- not dome shaped -rrb- wide between the eye nose -- black broad very short and flat eye -- large dark prominent round lustrous stop -- deep ear -- heart-shaped not set too high leather never long enough to come below the muzzle not carry erect but rather droop long feather muzzle -- very short and broad not underhung nor pointed wrinkled mane -- profuse extend beyond shoulder blade form ruff or frill round front of neck shape of body -- heavy in front broad chest fall away lighter behind lion-like not too long in the body coat and feather and condition -- long with thick undercoat straight and flat not curly nor wavy rather coarse but soft feather on thigh leg tail and toe long and profuse color -- all color allowable red fawn black black and tan sable brindle white and parti-coloured black mask and spectacles round the eye with line to the ear be desirable leg -- short fore-leg heavy bow out at elbow hind-leg lighter but firm and well shaped foot -- flat not round should stand well up on toe not on ankle tail -- curl and carry well up on loin long profuse straight feather size -- be a toy dog the smaller the better provide type and point be not sacrifice anything over 18 lb should disqualify when divide by weight class should be over 10 lb and under 10 lb action -- free strong and high cross foot or throw they out in run should not take off mark weakness of joint should be penalize \* \* \* \* \* lady algernon gordon-lennox have occasionally be criticise for she advocacy of _ whole-coloured _ specimen but in support of this preference it can be prove that the original pair bring to goodwood as well as mr murray 's ah cum be all of the golden chestnut shade and as no brindled parti-coloured or black dog have ever be bear at goodwood or broughton we have some authority for look upon whole-colour as a important point this view be in the first place confirm by the late chinese ambassador in london and further by baron speck von sternberg who be for many year minister at pekin and have very special facility for note the point of the palace dog in every case a black muzzle be indispensable also black point to the ear with trousers tail and feather a somewhat lighter shade than the body there be considerable divergence of opinion as to the penalisation of what in other breed be know as a dudley nose but on this point there must be some difficulty at show in the pekinese the color of the nose vary in a remarkable way especially in the case of the bitch for instance a pinkish tinge be always visible on the nose of goodwood meh before the birth of she puppy but it resume its normal color when the puppy be a few week old as a representative type chu-erh of alderbourne resemble most nearly the old goodwood dog he have the same square cobby appearance broad chest bow leg profuse feather and large lustrous eye -- point which be frequently look for in vain nowadays -- and he breeder and owner may well be proud of he the pekinese differ from the japanese dog in that it appear to be far stronger in constitution and withstand the change of the english climate with much greater ease in fact they be as hardy _ under healthy condition _ as any english breed and the only serious trouble seem to be the weakness which be develop in the eye small abscess frequently appear when the puppy be a few month old and although they may not affect the sight they almost inevitably leave a bluish mark while in some case the eye itself become contract whether this be one of the result of in-breeding it be difficult to say and it would be of interest to know whether the same trouble be meet with in china the pekinese bitch be excellent mother provide they be not interfere with for the first few day this be discover at goodwood year ago by the fact that on two or three occasion one celestial lady who have be give greater attention than she consider necessary revenge herself by devour she own family of puppy one thing seem from experience to be especially advisable -- as far as can be arrange to breed in the spring rather than autumn the puppy need all the open air and exercise that be possible and where rickety specimen be so frequently meet with it be only natural that a puppy who start life with the summer month ahead be more likely to develop well than one bear in the autumn great attention should be pay with reference to the frequent -- almost certain -- presence of worm which trouble seem more prevalent with pekinese than with any other breed wherever possible fish should be give as part of the dietary some pekinese devour it with relish other will not touch it but there be no doubt it be a useful item in the bill of fare bread well soak in very strong stock sheep 's head and liver be always better as regular diet than meat but in case of debility a little raw meat give once a day be most beneficial it would not be fitting to close a article on pekinese without bear testimony to they extraordinarily attractive characteristic they be intensely affectionate and faithful and have something almost cat-like in they domesticity they display far more character than the so-called toy dog usually do and for this reason it be all-important that pain should be take to preserve the true type in a recognition of the fact that quality be more essential than quantity \* \* \* \* \* as they breed-name imply these tiny black and white long-haired lap dog be repute to be native of the land of the chrysanthemum the japanese who have treasured they for century have the belief that they be not less ancient than the dog of malta there seem to be a probability however that the breed may claim to be chinese just as surely as japanese the hon mr mclaren morrison a authority on exotic dog whose opinion must always be take with respect be incline to the belief that they be related to the short-nosed spaniel of thibet while other expert be equally of opinion that the variety be a offshoot from the spaniel of pekin it be fairly certain that they be indigenous to the far east whence we have derive so many of we small snub-nosed large-eyed and long-haired pet the oriental people have always breed they lap dog to small size convenient for carry in the sleeve the sleeve dog and the chin dog be common and appropriate appellation in the east the japanese spaniel be certainly know in england half a century ago and probably much earlier we seaman often bring they home as present for they sweetheart these early import specimen be generally of the larger kind and if they be breed from -- which be doubtful -- it be by cross with the already long-established king charle or blenheim spaniel they color be not invariably white and black many be white and red or white with lemon-yellow patch the color other than white be usually about the long-fringed ear and the crown of the head with a line of white run from the point of the snub black nose between the eye as far as the occiput this blaze up the face be commonly say to resemble the body of a butterfly whose close wing be represent by the dog 's expansive ear the white and black coloring be now the most frequent the point desire be a broad and round skull large in proportion to the dog 's body a wide strong muzzle and a turned-up lower jaw great length of body be not good the back should be short and level the leg be by preference slender and much feathered the foot large and well separate a important point be the coat it should be abundant particularly about the neck where it form a ruffle and it ought to be quite straight and very silky the japanese spaniel be constitutionally delicate require considerable care in feed a frequent -- almost a daily -- change of diet be to be recommend and manufacture food be to be avoid rice usually agree well fresh fish sheep 's head tongue chicken liver milk or batter pudding be also suitable and occasionally give oatmeal porridge alternate with a little scraped raw meat as a especial favor for puppy newly wean it be well to limit the supply of milk food and to avoid red meat finely minced rabbit or fish be better of the japanese spaniel which have recently be prominent in competition may be mention miss serena 's champion fujus of kobe a remarkably beautiful bitch who be under 5 lb in weight and who in she brief life gain six full championship mr gregson 's ch tora of braywick a fine red and white dog somewhat over 7 lb be also to be remember as a typical example of the breed together with kara the smallest jap ever exhibit or breed in this country weigh only 2-1\/2 lb when 2-1\/2 year old lady samuelson 's togo and o'toyo of braywick and mr hull 's ch daddy jap there have lately be a tendency to lay too much stress upon diminutive size in this variety of the dog to the neglect of well-formed limb and free movement but on the whole it may be state with confidence that the japanese be prosper in england thanks largely to the energetic work of the japanese chin club which be form some three year ago to promote the best interest of the breed the follow be the official standard issue by the club : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- should be large for size of animal very broad and with slightly round skull muzzle -- strong and wide very short from eye to nose upper jaw should look slightly turn up between the eye lower jaw should be also turn up or finish so as to meet it but should the lower jaw be slightly underhung it be not a blemish provide the tooth be not show in consequence nose -- very short in the muzzle part the end or nose proper should be wide with open nostril and must be the color of the dog 's mark _ ie _ black in black-marked dog and red or deep flesh color in red or lemon marked dog eye -- large dark lustrous rather prominent and set wide apart ear -- small and v-shaped nicely feathered set wide apart and high on the head and carry slightly forward neck -- should be short and moderately thick body -- very compact and squarely build with a short back rather wide chest and of generally cobby shape the body and leg should really go into a square _ ie _ the length of the dog should be about its height leg -- the bone of the leg should be small give they a slender appearance and they should be well feathered foot -- small and shaped somewhat long the dog stand up on its toe somewhat if feathered the tuft should never increase the width of the foot but only its length a trifle tail -- carry in a tight curl over the back it should be profusely feathered so as to give the appearance of a beautiful plume on the animal 's back coat -- profuse long straight rather silky it should be absolutely free from wave or curl and not lie too flat but have a tendency to stand out especially at the neck so as to give a thick mane or ruff which with profuse feather on thigh and tail give a very showy appearance color -- either black and white or red and white _ ie _ parti-colour the term red include all shades sable brindle lemon or orange but the brighter and clearer the red the better the white should be clear white and the color whether black or red should be evenly distribute in patch over the body cheek and ear height at shoulder -- about ten inch weight -- the size desirable be from 4 lb to 9 lb the smaller size be preferable if good shape chapter xlvi the maltese dog and the pug no doubt have be cast upon the belief that the small white silky _ cani melitaeus _ be the most ancient of all the lap dog of the western world it be a favorite in the time of phidia it be a especial pet of the great lady of imperial rome it appear to have come originally from the adriatic island of melita rather than from the mediterranean malta although this supposition can not be verify there be however no question that it be of european origin and that the breed as we know it to-day have alter exceedingly little in type and size since it be allude to by aristotle more than three hundred year before the christian era one may gather from various reference in literature and from the evidence of art that it be highly value in ancient time when he favorite dog die write theophrastus in illustration of the vain man he deposit the remains in a tomb and erect a monument over the grave with the inscription ` offspring of the stock of malta ' the offspring of the stock of malta be probably first import into england during the reign of henry viii it be certain that they be regard as meet playfellow for mince mistress in the reign of elizabeth whose physician dr caius allude to they as be distinct from the spaniel gentle or comforter early writer aver that it be customary when maltese puppy be bear to press or twist the nasal bone with the finger in order that they may seem more elegant in the sight of man -- a circumstance which go to show that we forefather be not averse to improve artificially the point of they dog the snowy whiteness and soft silky texture of its coat must always cause the maltese dog to be admire but the variety have never be commonly keep in england -- a fact which be no doubt due to the difficulty of breed it and to the trouble in keep the dog 's long jacket clean and free from tangle thirty or forty year ago it be more popular as a lap dog than it have ever be since and in the early day of dog show many beautiful specimen be exhibit this popularity be largely due to the effort of mr r mandeville of southwark who have be refer to as virtually the founder of the modern maltese he fido and lily be certainly the most perfect representative of the breed during the decade between 1860 and 1870 and at the show hold at birmingham islington the crystal palace and cremorne garden this beautiful brace be unapproachable it be a breed which to be keep in perfection require more than ordinary attention not only on account of its silky jacket which be peculiarly liable to become matted and be difficult to keep absolutely clean without frequent wash but also on account of a somewhat delicate constitution the maltese be susceptible to cold and chill if affect by such cause the eye be often attack and the water run from they induce a brown stain to mar the beauty of the face skin eruption due to unwise feeding or parasite due to uncleanliness be quickly destructive to the silky coat and constant watchfulness be necessary to protect the dog from all occasion for scratch the diet be a important consideration always and a nice discernment be imperative in balance the proportion of meat and vegetable too much meat be prone to heat the blood while too little induce eczema scrap of bread and green vegetable well mix with gravy and finely-minced lean meat form the best dietary for the principal meal of the day and plenty of exercise be imperative the follow be the standard description and point of the maltese club of london : -- \* \* \* \* \* head -- should not be too narrow but should be of a terrier shape not too long but not apple-headed ear -- should be long and well feathered and hang close to the side of the head the hair to be well mingled with the coat at the shoulder eye -- should be a dark brown with black eye rim and not too far apart nose -- should be pure black leg and foot -- leg should be short and straight foot round and the pad of the foot should be black body and shape -- should be short and cobby low to the ground and the back should be straight from the top of the shoulder to the tail tail and carriage -- should be well arched over the back and well feathered coat length and texture -- should be a good length the longer the better of a silky texture not in any way woolly and should be straight color -- it be desirable that they should be pure white but slight lemon mark should not count against they condition and appearance -- should be of a sharp terrier appearance with a lively action the coat should not be stain but should be well groom in every way size -- the most approved weight should be from 4 lb to 9 lb the smaller the better but it be desirable that they should not exceed 10 lb \* \* \* \* \* there seem to be no doubt that the fawn-coloured pug enjoy the antiquity of descent that be attach to the greyhound the maltese dog and some few other venerable breed although much have be write on the origin of these dog nothing authentic have be discover in connection with it statement have appear from time to time to the effect that the pug be bring into this country from holland in the early year of the last century it be commonly style the dutch pug but this theory do not trace the history far enough back and it should be remember that at that period the dutch east indium company be in constant communication with the far east other declare that muscovy be the original home of the breed a supposition for which there be no discernible foundation the study of canine history receive frequent enlightenment from the study of the growth of commercial intercourse between nation and the trend of event would lead one to the belief that the pug have its origin in china particularly in view of the fact that it be with that country that most of the blunt-nosed toy dog with tail curl over they back be associate the pug be bring into prominence in great britain about sixty year ago by lady willoughby de eresby of grimthorpe near lincoln and mr morrison of walham green who each independently establish a kennel of these dog with such success that eventually the fawn pug be speak of as either the willoughby or the morrison pug at that period the black variety be not know the willoughby pug be duller in color than the morrison which be of a brighter ruddier hue but the two variety have since be so much interbreed that they be now undistinguishable and the fact that they be ever familiarly recognize as either willoughby or morrison be almost entirely forget a fawn pug may now be either silver gray or apricot and equally valuable whatever may have be the history of the pug as regard its nativity it have not be long introduce into england before it become a popular favorite as a pet and it share with the king charle spaniel the affection of the great lady of the land the late queen victorium possess one of which she be very proud the pug have however now fall from he high estate as a lady ' pet and he place have be usurp by the toy pomeranian the pekinese and japanese all of which be now more highly think of in the drawing-room or boudoir but the pug have a advantage over all these dog as from the fact that he have a shorter coat he be cleaner and do not require so much attention it be not until the establishment of the pug dog club in 1883 that a fixed standard of point be draw up for the guidance of judge when award the prize to pug later on the london and provincial pug club be form and standard of point be draw up by that society these however have never be adhere to the weight of a dog or bitch accord to the standard should be from 13 lb to 17 lb but there be very few dog indeed that be win prize who can draw the scale at the maximum weight one of the most distinctive feature of a fawn pug be the trace which be a line of black run along the top of the back from the occiput to the tail it be the exception to find a fawn pug with any trace at all now the muzzle should be short blunt but not upfaced most of the win pug of the present day be undershot at least half a inch and consequently must be upface only one champion of the present day possess a level mouth the toe-nail should be black accord to the standard but this point be ignore altogether in fact the standard as draw up by the club should be completely revise for it be no true guide the color which should be either silver or apricot fawn the marking on the head which should show a thumb-mark or diamond on the forehead together with the orthodox size be not now take into consideration and the prize be give to over-sized dog with big skull that be patchy in color and the charming little pug which be once so highly prize be now the exception rather than the rule while the large lustrous eye so sympathetic in they expression be seldom see the black pug be a recent production he be bring into notice in 1886 when lady brassey exhibit some at the maidstone show by whom he be manufacture be not a matter of much importance as with the fawn pug in existence there be not much difficulty in cross it with the shortest-faced black dog of small size that could be find and then back again to the fawn and the thing be do fawn and black pug be continually be breed together and as a rule if judgment be use in the selection of suitable cross the puppy be sound in color whether fawn or black in every respect except marking the black pug should be build on the same line as the fawn and be a cobby little dog with short back and well-developed hind-quarter wide in skull with square and blunt muzzle and tightly-curled tail chapter xlvii the brussels griffon away back in the ` seventy number of miner in yorkshire and the midland be say to have possess little wiry-coated and wiry-dispositioned red dog which accompany they owner to work be stow away in pocket of overcoat until the dinner hour when they be bring out to share they master ' meal perchance chase a casual rat in between time old man of to-day who remember these little red tarrier tell we that they be the original of the present-day brussels griffon and to the sport propensity of the aforesaid miner be attribute the gameness which be such a characteristic of they latter-day representative no one who be well acquaint with the brussels griffon would claim that the breed date back like the greyhound to hoary antiquity or indeed that it have any pretension to have come over with the conqueror the dog be not less worthy of admiration on that account it be futile to inquire too closely into he ancestry like topsy he grow and we must love he for himself alone even in the last fifteen year we can trace a certain advance in the evolution of the brussels griffon when the breed be first introduce under this name into this country underjaw be account of little or no importance whereas now a prominent chin be rightly recognize as be one of the most important physical characteristic of the race then again quite a few year ago a griffon with a red pin-wire coat be rarely meet with but now this point have be generally rectify and every show specimen of any account whatever possess the much-desired cover the first authentic importation of brussels griffon into this country be make by mr kingscote miss adelum gordon mr frank pearce and fletcher who at that time -lrb- _ circa _ 1894 -rrb- keep a dog-shop in regent street mr handley spicer soon follow and it be at she house that in 1896 the griffon bruxelloi club be first suggest and then form the brussels griffon club of london be a later offshoot of this club and like many child would appear to be more vigorous than its parent griffon soon make they appearance at show and win many admirer though it must be admit that they progress up the ladder of popularity be not so rapid as might have be expect the breed be especially attractive in the follow point : it be hardy compact portable very intelligent equally smart and alert in appearance affectionate very companionable and above all it possess the special characteristic of wonderful eye ever change in expression and compare with which the eye of many other toy breed appear as a glass bead to a fathomless lake griffon be hardy little dog though like most other they be more susceptible to damp than to cold while not greedy like the terrier tribe they be usually good feeder and good doer and not tiresomely dainty with regard to food as be so often the case with toy spaniel it must be admit that griffon be not the easiest of dog to rear particularly at wean time from five to eight week be always a critical period in the puppyhood of a griffon and it be necessary to supersede they maternal nourishment with extreme caution farinaceous food do not answer and usually cause trouble sooner or later a small quantity of scraped raw beef -- a eggspoonful at four week increase to a teaspoonful at six -- may be give once a day and from four to five week two additional meal of warm milk -- goat 's for preference -- and not more than a tablespoonful at a time should be give from five to six week the mother will remain with the puppy at night only and three milk meal may be give during the day with one of scraped meat at interval of about four hour care be take to give too little milk rather than too much at six week the puppy may usually be take entirely from the mother and at this time it be generally advisable to give a gentle vermifuge such as ruby a very little german rusk may also be add to the milk meal which may be increase to one and a-half tablespoonful at a time but it must always be remember that in nine case out of ten trouble be cause by overfeed rather than underfeed and until the rubicon of eight week have be pass care and oversight should be unremitting at eight week ' old force or brown breadcrumb may be add to the morning milk chop meat may be give instead of scrape at midday the usual milk at tea-time and a dry biscuit such as plasmon for supper at ten week old the milk at tea-time may be discontinue and the other meal increase accordingly and very little further trouble need be fear for griffon very rarely suffer from teethe trouble brussels griffon be divide into three group accord to they appearance and representative of each group may be and sometimes be find in one and the same litter first and foremost both in importance and in beauty come the griffon bruxelloi a cobby compact little dog with wiry red coat large eye short nose well turn up and slope back very prominent chin and small ear secondly come the griffon of any other color or as they be term in brussels griffon belge these be very often griffon of the usual color with a mismark of white or black or occasionally they may be gray or fawn but the most approved color and certainly the most attractive be black and tan the third group of brussels griffon be that term smooth or in brussels griffon brabancon the smooth griffon be identical with the rough in all point except for be short-haired as be well know smooth griffon be most useful for breed rough one with the desire hard red coat and many well-known show dog with rough coat have be breed from smooth one : for example sparklet ch copthorne lobster ch copthorne treasure ch copthorne talk-o ' - the-town and copthorne blunderbuss this and many other fact in connection with breed griffon will be learn from experience always the best teacher the descriptive particulars of the brussels griffon be : -- \* \* \* \* \* general appearance -- a lady 's little dog -- intelligent sprightly robust of compact appearance -- remind one of a cob and captivate the attention by a quasi-human expression head -- round furnished with somewhat hard irregular hair longer round the eye on the nose and cheek ear -- erect when crop as in belgium semi-erect when uncropped eye -- very large black or nearly black eyelid edge with black eyelash long and black eyebrow cover with hair leave the eye they encircle perfectly uncovered nose -- always black short surround with hair converge upward to meet those which surround the eye very pronounce stop lip -- edge with black furnished with a moustache a little black in the moustache be not a fault chin -- prominent without show the tooth and edge with a small beard chest -- rather wide and deep leg -- as straight as possible of medium length tail -- erect and dock to two-third color -- in the griffon bruxelloi red in the griffon belge preferably black and tan but also gray or fawn in the petit brabancon red or black and tan texture of coat -- harsh and wiry irregular rather long and thick in the brabancon it be smooth and short weight -- light weight 5 lb maximum and heavy weight 9 lb maximum fault -- the fault to be avoid be light eye silky hair on the head brown nail tooth show a hang tongue or a brown nose -lrb- illustration : toy dog 1 mr gresham 's pug ch grindley king 2 mr t whaley 's brussels griffon glenartney sport 3 pekinese ch chu-erh

as nearly like the larger breed as possible for the standard of point apply to both variety except that erect or what be commonly know as tulip ear of semi-erect carriage be permissible in the miniature the officially recognize weight for the toy variety be give as under seven pound but none of the most prominent present-day winner reach anything like that weight some in fact be little more than half of it and the great majority be between 4 lb and 5 lb probably the most popular specimen of the miniature black and tan at the present time be mr whaley 's glenartney sport and mr richmond 's merry atom merry atom be only 4-1\/2 lb in weight and he be beautifully proportion with a fine long head a small dark eye small ear and the true type of body he marking of deep black and rich tan be good and he coat be entirely free from the bare patch which so often mar the appearance of these toy give the suggestion of delicacy the miniature black and tan be certainly not a robust dog and he have lose much of the terrier boisterousness of character by reason of be pampered and coddle but it be a fallacy to suppose that he be necessarily delicate he require to be keep warm but exercise be better for he than eiderdown quilt and silken cushion and judicious feeding will protect he from the skin disease to which he be believe to be liable under proper treatment he be no more delicate than any other toy dog and he engaging manners and cleanliness of habit ought to place he among the most favor of lady 's pet and lapdog it be to be hope that the effort now be make by the black and tan terrier club will be beneficial to the increase popularity of this diminutive breed for the technical description and scale of point the reader be refer to the chapter on the larger variety of black and tan terrier \* \* \* \* \* of late year toy bull-terrier have fall in popularity this be a pity as they lilliputian self-assertion be most amusing as pet they be most affectionate excellent as watch-dog clever at acquire trick and always cheerful and companionable they have good nose and will hunt diligently but wet weather or thick undergrowth will deter they and they be too small to do serious harm to the best stock game preserve the most valuable toy bull-terrier be small and very light in weight and these small dog usually have apple-head pony queen the former property of sir raymond tyrwhitt wilson weigh under 3 lb but the breed remain toy up to 15 lb when you get a dog with a long wedge-shaped head the latter in competition with small apple-headed dog always take the prize and a slightly contradictory state of affair arise from the fact that the small dog with a imperfectly shaped head will sell for more money than a dog with a perfectly shaped head which be larger in draw up a show schedule of class for this breed it be perhaps better to limit the weight of competitor to 12 lb the bull-terrier club put 15 lb as the lowest weight allow for the large breed and it seem a pity to have a interregnum between the large and miniature variety still in the interest of the small valuable specimen this seem inevitable and opportunist principle must be apply to doggy matter as to other business in this world at present there be a diversity of opinion as to they point but roughly they be a long flat head wide between the eye and taper to the nose which should be black ear erect and bat-like straight leg and rather distinctive foot some people say these be cat-like toy bull-terrier ought to have a alert gay appearance couple with refinement which require a nice whip tail the best color be pure white a brindle spot be not amiss and even a brindle dog be admissible but black mark be wrong the coat ought to be close and stiff to the touch toy bull-terrier be not delicate as a rule they require warmth and plenty of exercise in all weather \* \* \* \* \* the most elegant graceful and refine of all dog be the tiny italian greyhound they exquisitely delicate line they supple movement and beautiful attitude they soft large eye they charming color they gentle and loving nature and they scrupulous cleanliness of habit -- all these quality justify the admiration bestow upon they as drawing-room pet they be fragile it be true -- fragile as eggshell china -- not to be handle roughly but they constitution be not necessarily delicate and many have be know to live to extreme old age miss mackenzie 's jack one of the most beautiful of the breed ever know live to see he seventeenth birthday and even then be strong and healthy they fragility be more apparent than real and if they be not expose to cold or damp they require less pampering than they usually receive this cause have be a frequent source of constitutional weakness and it be deplorably a fault in the italian greyhound of half a century ago one can not be quite certain as to the derivation of the italian greyhound its physical appearance naturally suggest a descent from the gazehound of the ancient with the add conjecture that it be purposely dwarf for the convenience of be nurse in the lap greek art present many example of a very small dog of greyhound type and there be a probability that the diminutive breed be a familiar ornament in the atrium of most roman villa in pompeius a dwarf greyhound be certainly keep as a domestic pet and there be therefore some justification for the belief that the italian prefix be not misplace in very early time the italian greyhound be appreciate vandyck kneller and watteau frequently introduce the graceful figure of these dog as accessory in they portrait of the court beauty of they time and many such portrait may be notice in the gallery of windsor castle and hampton court mary queen of scot be suppose to have be fond of the breed as more surely be charle i and queen anne some of the best of they kind be in the possession of queen victorium at windsor and balmoral where sir edwin landseer transfer they graceful form to canvas among the more prominent owner of the present time be the baroness campbell von laurentz whose rosemead laura and una be of superlative merit alike in outline color style

under the other over 8 lb \* \* \* \* \* the diminutive shetland sheepdog have many recommendation as a pet like the sturdy little shetland pony this dog have not be make small by artificial selection it be a collie in miniature no larger than a pomeranian and it be perfectly hardy wonderfully sagacious and decidedly beautiful at first glance the dog might easily be mistake for a belgian butterfly dog for its ear be somewhat large and upstand with a good amount of feather about they but upon closer acquaintance the collie shape and nature become more pronounce the body be long and set low on stout short leg which end in long-shaped feathered foot the tail be a substantial brush beautifully carry and the coat be long and inclined to silkiness with a considerable neck-frill the usual weight be from six to ten pound the dog be of smaller size than the bitch the prettiest be all white or white with rich sable marking but many be black and tan or all black the head be short and the face not so aquiline as that of the large collie the eye be well proportion to the size of the head and have a singularly soft round brightness remind one of the eye of a woodcock or a snipe the shetlander use they with the sheep and they be excellent little worker intelligent and very active and as hardy as terrier dog lover in search of novelty might do worse than take up this attractive and certainly genuine breed chapter xlix practical management many people be deter from keep dog by the belief that the hobby be expensive and that it entail a profitless amount of trouble and anxiety but to the true dog-lover the anxiety and trouble be far outbalance by the pleasure of possession and as to the expense that be a matter which can be regulate at will a luxuriously appoint kennel of valuable dog who be pampered into sickness may indeed become a serious drain upon the owner 's banking account but if manage on business principle the occupation be capable of yield a very respectable income one do not wish to see dog-keeping turn into a profession and there seem to be something mean in make money by we pet but the process of draft be necessary when the kennel be overstock and buying and selling be among the interesting accessory of the game second only to the pleasurable excitement of submit one 's favorite to the judgment of the show-ring the delight of breed and rear should be they own reward as they usually be yet something more than mere pin-money can be make by the alert amateur who possess a kennel of acknowledged merit and who know how to turn it to account a champion ought easily to earn he own living : some be a source of handsome revenue occasionally one hear of very high price be pay for dog acknowledge to be perfect specimen of they breed for the st bernard sir belvidere sixteen hundred pound be offer plinlimmon be sell for a thousand the same sum that be pay for the bulldog rodney stone for the collie southport perfection and ormskirk emerald mr megson pay a thousand sovereign each size be no criterion of a dog 's market value mr ashton cross be say to have refuse two thousand pound for she celebrated pekinese chu-erh and there be many lap-dog now live that could not be purchase for that high price these be sum which only a competent judge with a long purse would dream of pay for a animal whose tenure of active life can hardly be more than eight or ten year and already the dog 's value must have be attest by he success in competition it require a expert eye to perceive the potentiality of a puppy and there be always a element of speculative risk for both buyer and seller many a dog that have be sell for a song have grow to be a famous champion at cruft 's show in 1905 the bulldog mahomet be offer for ten pound no one be bold enough to buy he yet eighteen month afterwards he be sell and consider cheap at a thousand uncertainty add zest to a hobby that be in itself engage thanks to the influence of the kennel club and the institution of dog show which have encourage the improvement of distinct breed there be fewer nondescript mongrel in we midst than there be a generation or so ago a fuller knowledge have do much to increase the pride which the british people take in they canine companion and we present population of dog have never be equal for good quality in any other age or any other land the beginner can not easily go wrong or be seriously cheated but it be well when make a first purchase to take the advice of a expert and to be very certain of the dog 's pedigree age temper and condition the approve method of buy a dog be to select one advertise for sale in the weekly journal devote to the dog a better way still if a dog of distinguished pedigree be desire be to apply direct to a well-known owner of the require breed or to visit one of the great annual show such as cruft 's manchester the lady ' kennel association the kennel club -lrb- crystal palace in October -rrb- the scottish kennel club or birmingham and there choose the dog from the bench buy he at he catalogue price in determine the choice of a breed it be to be remember that some be better watchdog than other some more docile some safer with child the size of the breed should be relative to the accommodation available to have a st bernard or a great dane galumph about a small house be a inconvenience and sport dog which require constant exercise and freedom be not suit to the confine life of a bloomsbury flat nor be the long-haired breed at they best draggling round in the wet muddy street of a city for town life the clean-legged terrier the bulldog the pug and the schipperke be to be prefer bitch be cleaner in the house and more tractable than dog the idea that they be more trouble than dog be a fallacy the difficulty arise only twice in a twelvemonth for a few day and if you be watchful there need be no misadventure if only one dog or two or three of the smaller kind be keep there be no imperative need for a outdoor kennel although all dog be the better for life in the open air the house-dog may be feed with meat-scrap from the kitchen serve as a evening meal with rodnim or a dry biscuit for breakfast the duty of feed he should be in the hand of one person only when it be everybody 's and nobody 's duty he be apt to be neglect at one time and overf at another regularity of feeding be one of the secret of successful dog-keeping it ought also to be one person 's duty to see that he have frequent access to the yard or garden that he get plenty of clean drinking water plenty of outdoor exercise and a comfortable bed for the toy and delicate breed it be a good plan to have a dog-room set apart with a suitable cage or basket-kennel for each dog even delicate toy dog however ought not to be permanently lodge within door and the dog-room be only complete when it have as a annexe a grass plot for playground and free exercise next to wholesome and regular food fresh air and sunshine be the prime necessaries of healthy condition weakness and disease come more frequently from injudicious feeding and housing than from any other cause among the free and ownerless pariah dog of the east disease be almost unknown for the kennel of we british-bred dog perhaps a southern or a south-western aspect be the best but wherever it be place the kennel must be sufficiently sheltered from rain and wind and it ought to be provide with a covered run in which the inmate may have full liberty a awning of some kind be necessary tree afford good shelter from the sun-ray but they harbor moisture and damp must be avoid at all cost when only one outdoor dog be keep a kennel can be improvise out of a packing-case support on brick above the ground with the entrance properly shield from the weather no dog should be allow to live in a kennel in which he can not turn round at full length properly construct portable and well-ventilated kennel for single dog be not expensive and be greatly to be prefer to any amateurish makeshift a good one for a terrier need not cost more than a pound it be usually the single dog that suffer most from imperfect accommodation he kennel be generally too small to admit of a good bed of straw and if there be no railed-in run attach he must need be chained up the dog that be keep on the chain become dirty in he habit unhappy and savage he chain be often too short and be not provide with swivel to avert kink on a sudden alarm or on the appearance of a trespassing tabby he will often bind forward at the risk of dislocate he neck the yard-dog 's chain ought always to be fit with a stop link spring to counteract the effect of the sudden jerk the method may be employ with advantage in the garden for several dog a separate rope be use for each unfriendly dog can thus be keep safely apart and still be to some extent at liberty there be no obvious advantage in keep a watch-dog on the chain rather than in a enclosed compound unless he be expect to go for a possible burglar and attack he a wire-netting enclosure can easily be construct at very little expense for the more powerful dog the use of wrought-iron railing be advisable and these can be procure cheaply from spratt 's or boulton and paul 's fit with gate and with revolving trough for feed from the outside opinion differ as to the best material for the flooring of kennel and the paving of run asphalte be suitable for either in mild weather but in summer it become uncomfortably hot for the foot unless it be partly compose of cork concrete have its advantage if the surface can be keep dry flagstone be cold for winter as also be tile and brick for terrier who enjoy burrow earth be the best ground for the run and it can be keep free from dirt and bury bone by a rake over in the morning while tuft of grass leave round the margin supply the dog ' natural medicine the movable sleep bench must of course be of wood raise a few inch above the floor with a ledge to keep in the straw or other bedding wooden floor be open to the objection that they absorb the urine but dog should be teach not to foul they nest and in any case a frequent disinfect with a solution of pearson 's or jeye ' fluid should obviate impurity while flea which take refuge in the dust between the plank may be dismiss or keep away with a sprinkling of paraffin whatever the flooring scrupulous cleanliness in the kennel be a prime necessity and the inner wall should be frequently limewash it be important too that no scrap of reject food or bone should be leave lie about to become putrid or to tempt the visit of rat which bring flea if the dog do not finish they food when it be serve to they it should be remove until hunger give appetite for the next meal many breeder of the large and thick-coated variety such as st bernard newfoundland old english sheepdog and rough-haired collie give they dog nothing to lie upon but clean bare board the coat be itself a sufficient cushion but in winter weather straw give add warmth and for short-haired dog something soft if it be only a piece of carpet or a sack be need as a bed to protect the hock from abrasion with regard to feed this require to be study in relation to the particular breed one good meal a day serve by preference in the evening be sufficient for the adult if a dry dog-cake or a handful of rodnim be give for breakfast and perhaps a large bone to gnaw at clean cold water must always be at hand in all weather and a drink of milk color with tea be nourishing goat 's milk be particularly suitable for the dog : many owner keep goat on they premise to give a constant supply it be a mistake to suppose as many person do that meat diet provoke eczema and other skin trouble the contrary be the case the dog be by nature a carnivorous animal and wholesome flesh either cook or raw should be he staple food horseflesh which be frequently use in large establishment be not so fully to be rely upon as ordinary butcher meat there be no serious objection to bullock ' head sheep ' head bullock ' tripe and paunch and a little liver give occasionally be a aperient food which most dog enjoy but when it can be afford wholesome butcher 's meat be without question the proper food oatmeal porridge rice barley linseed meal and bone meal ought only to be regard as occasional addition to the usual meat diet and be not necessary when dog cake be regularly supply well-boiled green vegetable such as cabbage turnip-top and nettle-top be good mixed with the meat potato be questionable of the various advertised dog food many of which be excellent the choice may be leave to those who be fond of experiment or who seek for convenient substitute for the old-fashioned and wholesome diet of the household sickly dog require invalid 's treatment but the best course be usually the simplest and give a sound constitution to begin with any dog ought to thrive if he be only properly house carefully feed and get abundant exercise chapter l breeding and whelp the modern practice of dog-breeding in great britain have reach a condition which may be esteem as a art at no other time and in no other country have the various canine type be keep more rigidly distinct or bring to a higher level of perfection formerly dog-owner -- apart from the keeper of pack of hound -- pay scant attention to the differentiation of breed and the conservation of type and they consider it no serious breach of duty to ignore the principle of scientific selection and thus contribute to the multiplication of mongrel discriminate breeding be rare and if a bulldog should mate himself with a greyhound or a spaniel with a terrier the alliance be regard merely as a inconvenience so careless be owner in prevent the promiscuous mingling of alien breed that it be little short of surprising so many of we canine type have be preserve in they integrity the elimination of the nondescript cur be no doubt largely due to the work of the home for lose dog that be institute in most of we great town every year some 26000 homeless and ownerless canine be pick up by the police in the street of london and during the forty-seven year which have elapse since the dog ' home at battersea be establish upward of 800000 dog have pass through the book a few to be reclaim or buy the great majority to be put to death a very large proportion of these have be veritable mongrel not worth the value of they licence -- diseased and maimed cur or bitch in whelp turn ruthlessly adrift to be consign to the oblivion of the lethal chamber where the thoroughbred seldom find its way and if as many as 500 undesirable be destroy every week at one such institution ` tis clear that the ill-bred mongrel must soon altogether disappear but the chief factor in the general improvement of we canine population be due to the steadily grow care and pride which be bestow upon the dog and to the scientific skill with which he be be breed admit that the dog see at we best contemporary show be superlative example of scientific selection one have yet to acknowledge that the process of breed for show point have its disadvantage and that in the sport and pastoral variety more especially utility be apt to be sacrifice to ornament and type and stamen to fancy quality not always relative to the animal 's capacity as a worker the standard of perfection and scale of point lay down by the specialist club be usually admirable guide to the uninitiated but they be often unreasonably arbitrary in they insistence upon certain detail of form -- generally in the neighborhood of the head -- while they leave the quality of type and character to look after themselves or to be totally ignore it be necessary to assure the beginner in breed that point be essentially of far less moment than type and a good constitution the one thing necessary in the cultivation of the dog be to bear in mind the purpose for which he be suppose to be employ and to aim at adapting or conserve he physique to the best fulfilment of that purpose remember that the greyhound have tucked-up loin to give elasticity and bend to the body in run that a terrier be keep small to enable he the better to enter a earth that a bulldog be massive and undershot for encounter in the bullring that the collie 's ear be erect to assist he in hear sound from afar as those of the bloodhound be pendant the more readily to detect sound come to he along the ground while he head be bent to the trail nature have be discriminate in she adaptation of animal form and the most perfect dog yet breed be the one which approach nearest to nature 's wise intention the foregoing chapter have give abundant example of how the various breed of the dog have be acquire manufacture improve resuscitate and retain broadly speak two method have be adopt : the method of introduce a outcross to impart new blood new strength new character and the method of inbreed to retain a approve type a outcross be introduce when the breed operate upon be decline in stamen or be in danger of extinction or when some new physical or mental quality be desire new type and eccentricity be hardly wanted however and the extreme requirement of a outcross may nowadays be achieve by the simple process of select individual from differ strain of the same breed mating a bitch which lack the require point with a dog in whose family they be prominently and consistently present inbreeding be the reverse of outcross it be the practice of mating animal closely related to each other and it be within limit a entirely justifiable means of preserve and intensify family characteristic it be a law in zoology that a animal can not transmit a quality which it do not itself innately possess or which none of its progenitor have ever possess by mate a dog and a bitch of the same family therefore you concentrate and enhance the uniform inheritable quality into one line instead of two and you reduce the number of possibly heterogeneous ancestor by exactly a half right back to the very begin there be no surer way of maintain uniformity of type and a examination of the extended pedigree of almost any famous dog will show how commonly inbreed be practice inbreeding be certainly advantageous when manage with judgment and discreet selection but it have its disadvantage also for it be to be remember that fault and blemish be inherit as well as merit and that the fault have a way of assert themselves with annoy persistency furthermore breed between animal closely ally in parentage be prone to lead to degeneracy physical weakness and mental stupidity while impotence and sterility be frequent concomitant and none but experience breeder should attempt so hazardous a experiment observation have prove that the union of father with daughter and mother with son be preferable to a alliance between brother and sister perhaps the best union be that between cousin for the preservation of general type however it ought to be sufficient to keep to one strain and to select from that strain member who while exhibit similar characteristic be not actually too closely ally in consanguinity to move perpetually from one strain to another be only to court a undesirable confusion of type in found a kennel it be advisable to begin with the possession of a bitch as a companion the female be to be prefer to the male she be not less affectionate and faithful and she be usually much cleaner in she habit in the house if it be intend to breed by she she should be very carefully choose and prove to be free from any serious fault or predisposition to disease not only should she write pedigree be scrupulously scrutinise but she own constitution and that of she parent on both side should be minutely inquire into a bitch come into season for breed twice in a year the first time when she be reach maturity usually at the age of from seven to ten month she condition will readily be discern by the fact of a increase attentiveness of the opposite sex and the appearance of a mucous discharge from the vagina she should then be carefully protect from the gallantry of suitor dog keep in the near neighborhood of a bitch on heat who be not accessible to they go off they feed and suffer in condition with most breed it be unwise to put a bitch to stud before she be eighteen month old but mr stubb recommend that a bull bitch should be allow to breed at she first heat while she body retain the flexibility of youth and there be no doubt that with regard to the bulldog great mortality occur in attempt to breed from maiden bitch exceed three year old in almost all breed it be the case that the first three litter be the best it be accordingly important that a proper mating should be consider at the outset and a prospective sire select either through the medium of stud advertisement or by private arrangement with the owner of the desire dog for the payment of the requisite stud fee vary from a guinea to ten or fifteen pound the service of the best dog of the particular breed can usually be secure it be customary for the bitch to be the visitor and it be well that she visit should extend to two or three day at the least when possible a responsible person should accompany she if the stud dog be a frequenter of show he can usually be depend upon to be in sound physical condition no dog who be not so can be expect to win prize but it ought to be ascertain before hand that he be what be know as a good stock-getter the fee be for he service not for the result of they some owner of stud dog will grant two service and this be often desirable especially in the case of a maiden bitch or of a stud dog that be over-wrought as so many be it be most important that both the mate animal should be free from worm and skin disorder fifty per cent of the casualty among young puppy be due to one or other of the parent have be in a unhealthy condition when mate a winter whelping be not advisable it be best for puppy to be bear in the spring or early summer thus escape the rigor of inclement weather during the period of gestation the breed bitch should have ample but not violent exercise with varied and wholesome food include some preparation of bone meal and at about the third week whether she seem to require it or not she should be treat for worm at about the sixtieth day she will begin to be uneasy and restless a mild purgative should be give usually salad oil be enough but if constipation be apparent castor oil may be necessary on the sixty-second day the whelp may be expect and everything ought to be in readiness for the event a coarsely constitute bitch may be trust to look after herself on these occasion no help be necessary and one may come down in the morning to find she with she litter comfortably nestle at she side but with the toy breed and the breed that have be rear in artificial condition difficult or protracted parturition be frequent and human assistance ought to be at hand in case of need the owner of a valuable bull bitch for example would never think of leave she to she own unaided device all undue interference however should be avoid and it be absolutely necessary that the person attend she should be one with whom she be fondly familiar in anticipation of a possibly numerous litter a foster-mother should be arrange for beforehand comfortable quarter should be prepare in a quiet part of the house or kennel warm and free from draught clean bedding of wheaten straw should be provide but the bitch should be allow to make she nest in she own instinctive fashion let she have easy access to drinking water she will probable refuse food for a few hour before she time but a little concentrated nourishment such as brand 's essence or a drink of warm milk should be offer to she in further preparation for the confinement a basin of water contain antiseptic for wash in towel warm milk a flask of brandy a bottle of ergotine and a pair of scissors be commodity which may all be require in emergency the ergot which must be use with extreme caution and only when the labor pain have commence be invaluable when parturition be protracted and there be difficult strain without result its effect be to contract the womb and expel the contents but when the puppy be expel with ease it be superfluous for a bitch of 10 lb in weight ten drop of the extract of ergot in a teaspoonful of water should be ample give by the mouth the scissors be for sever the umbilical cord if the mother should fail to do it in she own natural way sometimes a puppy may be enclose within a membrane which the dam can not readily open with tongue and tooth if help be necessary it should be give tenderly and with clean finger occasionally a puppy may seem to be inert and lifeless and after repeatedly lick it the bitch may relinquish all effort at restoration and turn she attention to another that be be bear in such a circumstance the reject little one may be discreetly remove and a drop of brandy on the point of the finger smear upon its tongue may revive animation or it may be plunge up to the neck in warm water the object should be to keep it warm and to make it breathe when the puppy be all bear they dam may be give a drink of warm milk and then leave alone to they toilet and to suckle they if any should be dead these ought to be dispose of curiosity in regard to the other should be temporarily repress and inspection of they delay until a more fitting opportunity if any be then see to be malform or to have cleft palate these have better be remove and mercifully destroy it be the experience of many observer that the first whelp bear in a litter be the strongest largest and healthiest if the litter be a large one the last bear may be noticeably puny and this disparity in size may continue to maturity the wise breeder will decide for himself how many whelp should be leave to the care of they dam the number should be relative to she health and constitution and in any case it be well not to give she so many that they will be a drain upon she those breed of dog that have be most highly develop by man and that appear to have the greatest amount of brain and intelligence be generally the most prolific as to the number of puppy they produce st bernard pointer setter be notable for the usual strength of they family st bernard have be know to produce as many as eighteen whelp at a birth and it be no uncommon thing for they to produce from nine to twelve a pointer of mr barclay field 's produce fifteen and it be well know that mr statter 's setter phoebe produce twenty-one at a birth phoebe rear ten of these herself and almost every one of the family become celebrated it would be strain the natural possibility of any bitch to expect she to bring up eighteen puppy healthily half that number would tax she natural resource to the extreme but nature be extraordinarily adaptive in temper the wind to the shear lamb and a dam who give birth to a numerous litter ought not to have she family unduly reduce it be good policy to allow phoebe to have the rearing of as many as ten out of she twenty-one a bitch have twelve will bring up nine very well one have nine will rear seven without help and a bitch have seven will bring up five better than four breeder of toy-dog often rear the overplus offspring by hand with the help of a maw and thompson feeding-bottle peptonised milk and one or more of the various advertised infant ' food or orphan puppy food other prefer to engage or prepare in advance a foster-mother the foster-mother need not be of the same breed but she should be approximately of similar size and she own family ought to be of the same age as the one of which she be to take additional charge one can usually be secure through advertisement in the canine press some owner do not object to take one from a dog ' home which be a easy method in consideration of the circumstance that by far the larger number of lose dog be bitch send adrift because they be in whelp the chief risk in this course be that the unknown foster-mother may be diseased or verminous or have contract the seed of distemper or she milk may be populate with embryo worm these be danger to guard against a cat make a excellent foster-mother for toy-dog puppy worm ought not to be a necessary accompaniment of puppyhood and if the sire and dam be properly attend to in advance they need not be the writer have attend at the birth of puppy not one of whom have show the remotest sign of have a worm and the puppy have almost gallop into healthy happy maturity protect from all the usual canine ailment by constitution impervious to disease he have see other almost eat away by worm great writhe knot of they have be eject they have be vomit they have wriggle out of the nostril they have perforated the stomach and work such damage that most of the puppy succumb and those that survive be permanently deficient in stamen and liable to go wrong on the least provocate the puppy that be free from worm start life with a great advantage chapter li some common ailment of the dog and they treatment the experienced dog-owner have long ago realize that cleanliness wholesome food judicious exercise and a dry comfortable and well-ventilated kennel be the surest safeguard of health and that attention to these necessaries save he a infinitude of trouble and anxiety by protect he dog from disease on the first appearance of illness in he kennel the wise dog-owner at once call in the skill of a good veterinary surgeon but there be some of the minor ailment which he can deal with himself whilst he ought at least to be able to recognize the first symptom of the dreaded distemper and give first aid until the vet arrive to apply he remedy and give professional advice distemper although more than one hundred year have elapse since this be first import to this country from france a great amount of misunderstanding still prevail among a large section of dog-breeder regard its true nature and origin the fact be the disease come to we with a bad name for the french themselves deem it incurable in this country the old-fashioned plan of treatment be wont to be the usual rough remedy -- emetic purgative the seton and the lancet fail in this specifics of all sort be eagerly seek for and try and be unfortunately still believe in to a very great extent distemper have a certain course to run and in this disease nature seem to attempt the elimination of the poison through the secretion throw out by the naso-pharyngeal mucous membrane we chief difficulty in the treatment of distemper lie in the complication thereof we may and often do have the organ of respiration attack we have sometimes congestion of the liver or mucous inflammation of the bile duct or some lesion of the brain or nervous structure combine with epilepsy convulsion or chorea distemper be also often complicate with severe disease of the bowels and at time with a affection of the eye _ cause _ -- whether it be that the distemper virus the poison seedling of the disease really originate in the kennel or be the result of contact of one dog with another or whether the poison float to the kennel on the wing of the wind or be carry there on a shoe or the point of a walking-stick the follow fact ought to be bear in mind : -lrb- 1 -rrb- anything that debilitate the body or weaken the nervous system pave the way for the distemper poison -lrb- 2 -rrb- the healthier the dog the more power do he possess to resist contagion -lrb- 3 -rrb- when the disease be epizootic it can often be keep at bay by proper attention to diet and exercise frequent change of kennel straw and perfect cleanliness -lrb- 4 -rrb- the predispose cause which have come more immediately under my notice be debility cold damp starvation filthy kennel unwholesome food impure air and grief _ the age at which dog take distemper _ -- they may take distemper at any age the most common time of life be from the fifth till the eleventh or twelfth month _ symptom _ -- there be first and foremost a period of latency or of incubation in which there be more or less of dullness and loss of appetite and this glide gradually into a state of feverishness the fever may be usher in with chill and shiver the nose now become hot and dry the dog be restless and thirsty and the conjunctiva of the eye will be find to be considerably inject sometimes the bowels be at first constipated but they be more usually irregular sneezing will also be frequent and in some case cough dry and husky at first the temperature should be take and if there be a rise of two or three degree the case should be treat as distemper and not as a common cold at the commencement there be but little exudation from the eye and nose but as the disease advance this symptom will become more marked be clear at first so too will another symptom which be partially diagnostic of the malady namely increase heat of body combine with a rapid fall off in flesh sometimes indeed proceed quickly on to positive emaciation as the disease creep downward and inwards along the air-passage the chest get more and more affect the discharge of mucus and pus from the nostril more abundant and the cough lose its dry character become moist the discharge from the eye be simply mucus and pus but if not constantly dry away will gum the inflamed lid together that from the nostril be not only purulent but often mixed with dark blood the appetite be now clean go and there be often vomit and occasional attack of diarrhoea now in mild case we may look for some abatement of the symptom about the fourteenth day the fever get less inflammation decrease in the mucous passage and appetite be restore as one of the first sign of return health more often however the disease become complicated _ diagnosis _ -- the diagnostic symptom be the severe catarrh combine not only with fever but speedy emaciation _ pneumonia _ as we might easily imagine be a very likely complication and a very dangerous one there be great distress in breathe the animal panting rapidly the countenance be anxious the pulse small and frequent and the extremity cold the animal would fain sit up on he haunch or even seek to get out into the fresh air but sickness weakness and prostration often forbid he movement if the ear or stethoscope be apply to the chest the characteristic sign of pneumonia will be hear these be sound of moist crepitation etc _ bronchitis _ be probably the most common complication in fact it be always present except in very mild case the cough become more severe and often come on in tear paroxysm cause sickness and vomit the breathing be short and frequent the mouth hot and fill with viscid saliva while very often the bowels be constipate if the liver become involve we shall very soon have the jaundiced eye and the yellow skin _ diarrhoea _ be another very common complication we have frequent purge and maybe sickness and vomit _ fit _ of a convulsive character be frequent concomitant of distemper _ epilepsy _ be sometimes see owe no doubt to degeneration of the nerve centre cause by blood-poison there be many other complication and skin complaint be common after it _ treatment _ -- this consist firstly in do all in we power to guide the specific catarrhal fever to a safe termination and secondly in watch for and combate complication whenever we see a young dog ail lose appetite exhibit catarrhal symptom and get thin with a rise in temperature we should not lose a hour if he be a indoor dog find he a good bed in a clean well-ventilated apartment free from lumber and free from dirt if it be summer have all the window out or open if winter a little fire will be necessary but have half the window open at the same time only take precaution against he lie in a draught fresh air in case of distemper and indeed in fever of all kind can not be too highly extol the more rest the dog have the better he must be keep free from excitement and care must be take to guard he against cold and wet when he go out of door to obey the call of nature the most perfect cleanliness must be enjoin and disinfectant use such as permanganate of potash carbolic acid pearson 's or izal if the sick dog on the other hand be one of a kennel of dog then quarantine must be adopt the hospital should be quite remove from the vicinity of all other dog and as soon as the animal be take from the kennel the latter should be thoroughly cleanse and disinfect and the other dog keep warm and dry well feed and moderately exercise _ food and drink _ -- for the first three or four day let the food be light and easily digest in order to induce the animal to take it it should be as palatable as possible for small dog you can not have anything better than milk porridge -lrb- 1 -rrb- at all event the dog must if possible be induce to eat he must not be horn unless there be great emaciation he must not over-eat but what he get must be good as to drink dog usually prefer clean cold water and we can not do harm by mix therewith a little plain nitre -lrb- 1 -rrb- oatmeal porridge make with milk instead of water _ medicine _ -- begin by give a simple dose of castor oil just enough and no more than will clear out the bowels by one or two motion drastic purgative and medicine such as mercury jalap aloe and podophyllyn can not be too highly condemn for very small toy dog such as italian greyhound yorkshire terrier etc i should not recommend even oil itself but _ manna _ -- one drachm to two drachm dissolve in milk by simply get the bowels to act once or twice we shall have do enough for the first day and have only to make the dog comfortable for the night on the next day begin with a mixture such as the following : solution of acetate of ammonia 30 drop to 120 sweet spirit of nitre 15 drop to 60 salicylate of soda 2 grain to 10 thrice daily in a little camphor water if the cough be very troublesome and the fever do not run very high the follow may be substitute for this on the second or third day : syrup of squill 10 drop to 60 tincture of henbane 10 drop to 60 sweet spirit of nitre 10 drop to 60 in camphor water a few drop of dilute hydrochloric acid should be add to the dog 's drink and two teaspoonful -lrb- to a quart of water -rrb- of the chlorate of potash this make a excellent fever drink especially if the dog can be get to take decoction of barley -- barley-water -- instead of plain cold water best make of keen and robinson 's patent barley if there be persistent sickness and vomit the medicine must be stop for a time small bolus of ice frequently administer will do much good and dose of dilute prussic acid from one to four drop in a little water will generally arrest the vomit if constipation be present we must use no rough remedy to get rid of it a little raw meat cut into small piece -- mince in fact -- or a small portion of raw liver may be give if there be little fever if there be fever we be to trust for a time to injection of plain soap-and-water diarrhoea although often a troublesome symptom be it must be remember a salutary one unless therefore it become excessive do not interfere if it do give the simple chalk mixture three time a day but no longer than be needful the discharge from the mouth and nose be to be wipe away with a soft rag -- or better still some tow which be afterwards to be burn -- wet with a weak solution of carbolic the forehead eye and nose may be foment two or three time a day with moderately hot water with great advantage it be not judicious to wet a long-haired dog much but a short-haired one may have the chest and throat well foment several time a day and well rub dry afterwards heat apply to the chest of long-haired dog by means of a flat iron will also effect good the follow be a excellent tonic : sulphate of quinine 1\/8 to 3 grain powdered rhubarb 2 to 10 grain extract of taraxacum 3 to 20 grain make a bolus thrice daily during convalescence good food virol spratt ' invalid food and invalid biscuit moderate exercise fresh air and protection from cold these with a occasional mild dose of castor oil or rhubarb be to be we sheet-anchor i find no better tonic than the tablet of phosferine one quarter of a tablet thrice daily roll in tissue paper for a toy dog up to two tablet for a dog of mastiff size bronchitis dog that have be expose to wet or that have be put to lie in a damp or draughty kennel with insufficient food be not less liable than they master to catch a severe cold which if not promptly attend to may extend downward to the lining membrane of bronchus or lung in such case there be always symptom more or less of fever with fit of shiver and thirst accompany with dullness a tired appearance and loss of appetite the breath be short inspiration painful and there be a rattle of mucus in chest or throat the most prominent symptom perhaps be the frequent cough it be at first dry ringing and evidently painful in a few day however or sooner it soften and there be a discharge of frothy mucus with it and in the latter stage of pus and ropy mucus _ treatment _ -- keep the patient in a comfortable well-ventilated apartment with free access in and out if the weather be dry let the bowels be freely act upon to begin with but no weakening discharge from the bowels must be keep up after the bowels have be move we should commence the exhibition of small dose of tartar emetic with squill and opium thrice a day if the cough be very troublesome give this mixture : tincture of squill 5 drop to 30 paregoric 10 drop to 60 tartar emetic one-sixteenth of a grain to 1 grain syrup and water a sufficiency thrice daily we may give a full dose of opium every night in mild case carbonate of ammonia may be try it often do good the dose be from two grain to ten in camphor water or even plain water the chronic form of bronchitis will always yield if the dog be young to careful feeding moderate exercise and the exhibition of cod-liver oil with a mild iron tonic the exercise however must be moderate and the dog keep from the water a few drop to a teaspoonful of paregoric give at night will do good and the bowels should be keep regular and a simple laxative pill give now and then diarrhoea or looseness of the bowels or purge be a very common disease among dog of all age and breed it be nevertheless more common among puppy about three or four month old and among dog who have reach the age of from seven to ten year it be often symptomatic of other ailment _ cause _ -- very numerous in weakly dog exposure alone will produce it the weather too have no doubt much to do with the production of diarrhoea in most kennel it be more common in the month of July and August although it often come on in the very dead of winter puppy if overf will often be seize with this troublesome complaint a healthy puppy hardly ever know when it have have enough and it will moreover stuff itself with all sort of garbage acidity of the stomach follow with vomiting of the ingesta and diarrhoea succeed bring on by the acrid condition of the chyme which find its way into the duodenum this stuff would in itself act as a purgative but it do more it abnormally excite the secretion of the whole alimentary canal and a sort of sub-acute mucous inflammation be set up the liver too become mixed up with the mischief throw out a superabundance of bile and thus aid in keep up the diarrhoea among other cause we find the eating of indigestible food drinking foul or tainted water too much green food raw paunch foul kennel and damp draughty kennel _ symptom _ -- the purge be of course the principal symptom and the stool be either quite liquid or semi-fluid bilious-looking dirty-brown or clay-coloured or mixed with slimy mucus in some case they resemble dirty water sometimes as already say a little blood will be find in the dejection owe to congestion of the mucous membrane from liver obstruction in case there be blood in the stool a careful examination be always necessary in order to ascertain the real state of the patient blood it must be remember might come from pile or polypus or it might be dysenteric and proceed from ulceration of the rectum and colon in the simplest form of diarrhoea unless the disease continue for a long time there will not be much wasting and the appetite will generally remain good but capricious in bilious diarrhoea with large brown fluid stool and complete loss of appetite there be much thirst and in a few day the dog get rather thin although nothing like so rapidly as in the emaciation of distemper _ the treatment _ will it need hardly be say depend upon the cause but as it be generally cause by the presence in the intestine of some irritating matter we can hardly err by administer a small dose of castor oil combine with it if there be much pain -- which you can tell by the animal 's countenance -- from 5 to 20 or 30 drop of laudanum or of the solution of the muriate of morphia this in itself will often suffice to cut short a attack the oil be preferable to rhubarb but the latter may be try -- the simple not the compound powder -- dose from 10 grain to 2 drachm in bolus it the diarrhoea should continue next day proceed cautiously -- remember there be no great hurry and a sudden check to diarrhoea be at time dangerous -- to administer dog dose of the aromatic chalk and opium powder or give the follow medicine three time a day : compound powdered catechu 1 grain to 10 powdered chalk with opium 3 grain to 30 mix if the diarrhoea still continue good may accrue from a trial of the follow mixture : laudanum 5 to 30 drop dilute sulphuric acid 2 to 15 drop in camphor water this after every liquid motion or if the motion may not be observe three time a day if blood should appear in the stool give the following : kino powder 1 to 10 grain powder ipecac 1\/4 to 3 grain powdered opium 1\/2 to 2 grain this may be make into a bolus with any simple extract and give three time a day the food be of importance the diet should be change the food require to be of a non-stimulating kind no meat be allow but milk and bread sago or arrowroot or rice etc the drink either pure water with a pinch or two of chlorate and nitrate of potash in it or patent barley-water if the dog will take it the bed must be warm and clean and free from draught and in all case of diarrhoea one can not be too particular with the cleanliness and disinfection of the kennel constipation more commonly call costiveness be also a very common complaint it often occur in the progress of other disease but be just as often a separate ailment perhaps no complaint to which we canine friend be liable be less understand by the non-professional dog doctor and by dog owner themselves often cause by weakness in the coat of the intestine _ the exhibition of purgative can only have a temporary effect in relieve the symptom _ and be certain to be follow by reaction and consequently by further debility want of exercise and bath common cause youatt be never more correct in he life than when he say : many dog have a dry constipated habit often greatly increase by the bone on which they be feed this favor the disposition to mange etc it produce indigestion encourage worm blacken the tooth and cause fetid breath _ symptom _ -- the stool be hard usually in large round ball and defecation be accomplish with great difficulty the animal often have to try several time before he succeed in effect the act and this only after the most acute suffer the faeces be generally cover with white mucus show the heat and semi-dry condition of the gut the stool be sometimes so dry as to fall to piece like so much oatmeal there be generally also a deficiency of bile in the motion and in addition to simple costiveness we have more or less loss of appetite with a too pale tongue dullness and sleepiness with slight redness of the conjunctiva sometimes constipation alternate with diarrhoea the food be improperly commingle with the gastric and other juice ferment spoil and become instead of healthy blood-producing chyme a irritant purgative _ treatment _ -- hygienic treatment more than medicinal mild dose of castor oil compound rhubarb pill or olive oil may at first be necessary sometimes a enema will be require if the medicine will not act plenty of exercise and a swim daily -lrb- with a good run after the swim -rrb- or instead of the swim a bucket bath -- water throw over the dog give oatmeal rather than flour or fine bread as the staple of he diet but a goodly allowance of meat be to be give as well with cabbage or boil liver or even a portion of raw liver fresh air and exercise in the field you may give a bolus before dinner such as the following : compound rhubarb pill 1 to 5 grain quinine 1\/8 to 2 grain extract of taraxacum 2 to 10 grain mix fit whatever be the cause they be very alarming in puppy they be call convulsion and resemble epileptic fit keep the dog very quiet but use little force simply enough to keep he from hurt himself keep out of the sun or in a darkened room when he can swallow give from 2 to 20 grain -lrb- accord to size -rrb- of bromide of potassium in a little camphor water thrice daily for a few day only milk food keep quiet skin disease in the whole range of dog ailment include in the term canine pathology there be none more bothersome to treat successfully nor more difficult to diagnose than those of the skin there be none either that afford the quack or patent-nostrum monger a larger field for the practice of he fiendish gift if i be to be ask the question why do dog suffer so much from skin complaint and why do it appear to be so difficult to treat they i should answer the first thus : through the neglect of they owner from want of cleanliness from injudicious feeding from bad kennelling and from permit they favorite such free intercourse with other member of the canine fraternity overcrowding be another and distinct source of skin trouble my answer to the second question be that the layman too often treat the trouble in the skin as if it be the disease itself whereas it be generally merely a symptom thereof example : to plaster medicated oils or ointment all over the skin of a dog suffer from constitutional eczema be about as sensible as would be the painting white of the yellow skin in jaundice in order to cure the disorder liver but even those contagious disease that be cause by skin germ or animalcule will not be wholly cure by any application whatever constitutional remedy should go hand in hand with these and indeed so great be the defensive power of strong pure blood rich in its white corpuscle or leucocyte that i believe i could cure even the worst form of mange by internal remedy good food and tonic etc without the aid of any dress whatever except pure cold water in treat of skin disease it be usual to divide they into three section : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the non-contagious -lrb- 2 -rrb- the contagious and -lrb- 3 -rrb- ailment cause by external parasite -lrb- 1 -rrb- the non-contagious -- -lrb- a -rrb- erythema -- this be a redness with slight inflammation of the skin the deeper tissue underneath not be involve _ example _ -- that see between the wrinkle of well-bred pug mastiff or bulldog or inside the thigh of greyhound etc if the skin break there may be discharge of pus and if the case be not cure the skin may thicken and crack and the dog make matter worse with he tongue _ treatment _ -- review and correct the method of feed a dog should be neither too gross nor too lean exercise perfect cleanliness the early morning sluice-down with cold water and a quassium tonic he may need a laxative as well _ locally _ -- dust with oxide of zinc or the violet powder of the nursery a lotion of lead or arnica fomentation follow by cold water and when dry dust as above a weak solution of boracic acid -lrb- any chemist -rrb- will sometimes do good -lrb- b -rrb- prurigo -- itch all over with or without scurf sometimes thicken _ treatment _ -- regulation of diet green vegetable fruit if he will take it brushing and groom but never roughly try for worm and for flea -lrb- c -rrb- eczema -- the name be not a happy one as apply to the usual itching skin disease of dog eczema proper be a eruption in which the form matter dry off into scale or scab and dog eczema so-called be as often as not a species of lichen then of course it be often accompany with vermin nearly always with dirt and it be irritated out of all character by the bite and scratch of the dog himself _ treatment _ -- must be both constitutional and local attend to the organ of digestion give a moderate dose of open medicine to clear away offend matter this simple aperient may be repeat occasionally say once a week and if diarrhoea be present it may be check by the addition of a little morphia or dilute sulphuric acid cream of tartar with sulphur be a excellent derivative be both diuretic and diaphoretic but it must not be give in dose large enough to purge at the same time we may give thrice daily a tonic pill like the following : -- sulphate of quinine 1\/8 to 3 grain sulphate of iron 1\/2 grain to 5 grain extract of hyoscyamus 1\/8 to 3 grain extract of taraxacum and glycerine enough to make a pill _ locally _ -- perfect cleanliness cool lotion pat on to the sore place spratt ' cure -lrb- nb -- i know what every remedy contain or i should not recommend it -rrb- benzoat zinc ointment after the lotion have dry in wash carefully once a week use the ointment when skin be dry or the lotion to allay irritation -lrb- 2 -rrb- contagious skin disease -- these be usually call mange proper and follicular mange or scabies i want to say a word on the latter first it depend upon a microscopic animalcule call the _ acarus folliculorum _ the trouble begin by the formation of patch from which the hair fall off and on which may be notice a few pimple scab form the patch extend or come out on other part of the body head leg belly or side skin become red in white-haired dog odour of this trouble very offensive more _ pain _ than itch seem to be the symptomatic rule whole body may become affected _ treatment _ -- dress the affected part twice a week with the following : -- creosote 2 drachm linseed oil 7 ounce solution of potash 1 ounce first mix the creosote and oil then add the solution and shake better to shave the hair off around the patch kennel must be keep clean with garden soap and hot water and all bedding burn after use from three month to six will be need to cure bad case mange proper be also cause by a parasite or acarus call the _ sarcop canus _ unlike eczema this mange be spread from dog to dog by touch or intercommunication just as one person catch the itch from another _ the symptom _ -- at first these may escape attention but there be vesicle which the dog scratch and break and thus the disease spread the hair get mat and fall off region of the body most commonly affect head chest back rump and extremity there may not be much constitutional disturbance from the actual injury to the skin but from he suffer so much from the irritation and the want of rest the health suffer _ treatment _ -- avoid the use of so-called disinfectant most of those sell as such be simply deodoriser and apply to the skin be useless nor be they of much use in clean the kennel nothing suit better for woodwork than first carbolic wash and then a thorough scrub with hot water and garden soap some ointment must be use to the skin and as i be write for layman only i feel chary in recommend such strong one as the green iodide of mercury if you do use it mix it with twice its bulk of the compound sulphur ointment do over only a part or two at a time the dog to be wash after three day but the compound sulphur ointment itself be a splendid application and it be not dangerous -lrb- 3 -rrb- skin complaint from vermin -- the treatment be obvious -- get rid of the cause _ as they diagnosis be so difficult whenever the dog-owner be in doubt make certain by treat the dog not only by local application but constitutionally as well _ in addition to good diet perfect cleanliness of coat kennel and all surroundings and the application of the ointment or oil let the dog have all the fresh air possible and exercise but never over-exciting or too fatiguing then a course of arsenic seldom fail to do good i do not believe in begin the exhibition of arsenic too soon i prefer pay my first attention to the digestive organ and state of the bowels the form of exhibition which i have find suit as well as any be the _ tasteless liquor arsenicali _ it be easily administer it ought to be give mixed with the food as it ought to enter the blood with the chyle from the diet it ought day by day to be gradually not hurriedly increase symptom of loathing of food and redness of conjunctiva call for the cessation of its use for two or three day at least when it be to be recommend at the same size of dose give when leave off there be two thing which assist the arsenic at least to go well with it they be iron in some form and virol the latter will be need when there be much loss of flesh a simple pill of sulphate of iron and extract of liquorice may be use dose of _ liquor arsenicali _ from 1 to 6 drop _ ter die _ to commence with gradually increase to 5 to 20 drop dandruff -- a scaly or scurfy condition of the skin with more or less of irritation it be really a shed of the scaly epidermis bring on by injudicious feeding or want of exercise as a primary cause the dog in case of this kind need cool medicine such as small dose of the nitrate and chlorate of potash perhaps less food bowels to be see to by give plenty of green food with a morsel of sheep 's melt or raw liver occasionally wash about once in three week a very little borax in the last water say a drachm to a gallon use mild soap never use a very hard brush or sharp comb tar soap -lrb- wright 's -rrb- may be try parasite -- internal worm we have roughly speak two kind of worm to treat in the dog : -lrb- 1 -rrb- the round and -lrb- 2 -rrb- the tape -lrb- 1 -rrb- _ round-worm _ -- they be in shape and size not unlike the garden worm but harder pale and pointed _ symptom _ -- sometimes these be alarming for the worm itself be occasionally seize with the mania for foreign travel and find its way into the throat or nostril cause the dog to become perfectly furious and induce such pain and agony that it may seem charity to end its life the worm may also crawl into the stomach and give rise to great irritation but be usually dislodge therefrom by the violence accompany the act of vomit they usual habitat however be the small intestine where they occasion great distress to they host the appetite be always depraved and voracious at times there be colic with sickness and perhaps vomit and the bowels be alternately constipate or loose the coat be harsh and stare there usually be short dry cough from reflex irritation of the bronchial mucous membrane a bad-smelling breath and emaciation or at least considerable poverty of flesh the disease be most common in puppy and in young dog the appearance of the ascari in the dog 's stool be of course _ the _ diagnostic symptom _ treatment _ -- i have cure many case with santonin and areca-nut powder -lrb- betel-nut -rrb- dose 10 grain to 2 drachm or turpentine dose from 10 drop to 1-1\/2 drachm beat up with yolk of egg but areca-nut do better for tape-worm so we can not do better than trust to pure santonin the dose be from 1 grain for a toy up to 6 grain for a mastiff mix it with a little butter and stick it well back in the roof of the dog 's mouth he must have fast previously for twelve hour and have a dose of castor oil the day before in four or five hour after he have swallow the santonin let he have a dose of either olive oil or decoction of aloe dose 2 drachm to 2 ounce or more repeat the treatment in five day spratt ' cure may be safely depend on for worm -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- 1 -rrb- many dog owner swear by the preparation call ruby which can be recommend as a cure for worm -- ed the perfect cleanliness of the kennel be of paramount importance the animal 's general health require look after and he may be bring once more into good condition by proper food and a course of vegetable tonic if want in show condition we have plasmon to fall back upon and burrough and wellcome 's extract of malt there be a round-worm which at time infest the dog 's bladder and may cause occlusion of the urethra a whip-worm inhabit the caecum another may occupy a position in the mucous membrane of the stomach some infest the blood and other the eye -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ tape-worm _ -- there be several kind but the treatment be the same in all case the commonest in the country be the cucumerine this be a tape-worm of about fifteen inch in average length although i have take they from newfoundland pup fully thirty inch long it be a semi-transparent entozoon each segment be long compare to its breadth and narrow at both end each joint have when detach a independent sexual existence the dog often become infested with this parasite from eat sheep ' brain and dog thus afflict and allow to roam at pleasure over field and hill where sheep be feed sow the seed of gid in we flock to any extent we know too well the great use of collie dog to the shepherd or grazier to advise that dog should not be employ as assistant but surely it would be to they owner ' advantage to see that they be keep in a state of health and cleanliness _ treatment _ -- we ought to endeavor to prevent as well as to cure we should never allow we dog to eat the entrails of hare or rabbit never allow they to be feed on raw sheep 's intestine nor the brain of sheep never permit they to lounge around butcher ' shop nor eat offal of any kind let they food be well cook and they skin and kennel keep scrupulously clean dog that be use for sheep and cattle ought twice a year at least to go under treatment for the expulsion of worm whether they be infested or not a anthelmintic would make sure and could hardly hurt they for the expulsion of tape-worm we depend mostly on areca-nut in order that the tape-worm should receive the full benefit of the remedy we order a dose of castor oil the day before in the morning and recommend no food to be give that day except beef-tea or mutton broth the bowels be thus empty next morning so that the parasite can not shelter itself anywhere and be therefore sure to be act on infusion of cusco be sometimes use as a anthelmintic so be wormwood and the liquid extract of male fern and in america spigelium root and pumpkin seed the best tonic to give in case of worm be the extract of quassium extract of quassium 1 to 10 grain extract of hyoscyamus 1\/2 to 5 grain to make one pill thrice daily parasite -- external flea wash with spratt ' medicated soap extra clean kennel dust with keating and afterwards wash this may not kill the flea but it drive they off take the dog on the grass while dust and begin along the spine never do it in the house tick i have notice these disagreeable bloodsucker only on the head and body of sport or collie dog who have be bore for some time through covert and thicket they soon make themselves visible as the body swell up with the blood they suck until they resemble small soft wart about as big as a pea they belong to the natural family _ ixodiada _ _ treatment _ -- if not very numerous they should be cut off and the part touch with a little turp the sulphuret of calcium will also kill they so will the more dangerous white precipitate or even a strong solution of carbolic acid which must be use sparingly however louse the louse be hatch from nit which we find clinging in row and very tenaciously too to the hair the insect themselves be more difficult to find but they be on puppy sometimes in thousand to destroy they i have try several plan oil be very effectual and have safety to recommend it common sweet oil be as good a cure as any and you may add a little oil of anise and some sublime sulphur which will increase the effect quassium water may be use to damp the coat the matted portion of a long-haired dog 's coat must be cut off with scissors for there the louse often lurk the oil dress will not kill the nit so that vinegar must be use after a few day the dress must be repeat and so on three or four time to do any good the whole of the dog 's coat must be drench in oil and the dog wash with good dog soap and warm water twelve hour afterwards chapter lii the dog and the law privilege of first bite it be popularly but rather erroneously suppose that _ every _ dog be entitle to one bite perhaps it would be more accurate to state that every dog may with impunity have one snap or one intended bite but only dog of hitherto irreproachable character be permit the honor of a genuine tasteful bite once a dog however have display dangerous propensity even though he have never have the satisfaction of effect a actual bite and once he owner or the person who harbor he become aware of these evil inclination -lrb- scienter -rrb- either of he own knowledge or by notice the law look upon such dog as a dangerous beast which the owner keep at he peril the onus of proof be on the victim to show that the owner have previous knowledge of the animal 's ferocity though in reality very little evidence of scienter be as a rule require and notice need not necessarily be give directly to the owner but to any person who have charge of the dog the person attack have yet another remedy he can if he be able kill the dog before it can bite he but he be not justified in shoot the animal as it run away even _ after _ be bite by 28 and 29 vict c 60 the owner of a dog which attack sheep or cattle -- and cattle include horse -- be responsible for all damage and there be no necessity to prove previous evil propensity this act be wholly repeal by the act call the dog ' act 1906 which come into force on January 1st 1907 but the new act re-enact the section have reference to damage to cattle and say that in such case it be not necessary for the person claim damages to show a previous mischievous propensity in the dog or the owner 's knowledge of such previous propensity or to show that the injury be attributable to neglect on the part of the owner the word cattle include horse ass sheep goat and swine the law look upon fight between dog as a natural and necessary incident in the career of every member of the canine race and give no redress to the owner of the vanquish animal provide the fight be a fair one and the contestant appear to consider it so the owner however of a peaceably disposed dog which be attack and injure or kill by one savage and unrestrained have a right of action against the owner of the latter the owner of the peaceably disposed animal may justifiably kill the savage brute in order to save he dog but he must run the risk of be able to prove that this be the only means of put a stop to the fight licence every dog owner must annually take out a licence for each dog he keep the licence which be obtainable at all post-office at the cost of 7 6d be date to run from the hour it be take out until the follow 31st December the person in whose
