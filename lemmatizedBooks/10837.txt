i the world tragedy we be live under the shadow of the greatest world tragedy in the history of mankind not even the overthrow of the old roman empire be so colossal a disaster as this inevitably we be bewilder by it utterly unanticipated at least in its world extent for we have believe mankind too far advance for such a chaos of brute force to recur it overwhelm we vision man have be go forward steadily invent and discover until in the last hundred year he whole world have be transform suddenly the entire range of invention be turn against man the machinery of comfort and progress become the enginery of devastation under such a shock we ask have civilization over-reached itself have the machine run away with its maker the imagination be stagger we be too much in the storm to see across the storm when the war begin it be over we mind as a dark cloud it be the last conscious thought as we go to sleep at night and the first to which we awaken in the morning : waken with a dumb sense of something wrong as if we have suffer a personal tragedy and then as we come to clear consciousness we say o yes the war the day have pass into week the week into month and year : inevitably we become benumb to the long continued disaster it be impossible to think death and mutilation in term of million even those who stand in the immediate presence of it and suffer most terribly become calloused to it : much more must we who stand so long apart and have not yet feel the brunt of it even we entrance into the whirling vortex drawing ever nearer we shore have fail to waken we to a realize sense of it nevertheless these year through which we be now live be the most important in the entire history of the world it be probable that the future will look back upon they as the year determine the destiny of mankind for age to come how this terrible fact of war fall across all philosophy complacent optimism so widely current recently be put out of court by it the pleasant interpretation mediocrity formulate of the universe be tear to tatters there be at least the refreshment of stand face to face with brute actuality though it crash all we little system to the ground philosophy must wait the interpretation can not be hasten while the fact be multiply with such bewildering rapidity the one certainty be that a entirely new world be be bear -- _ what _ it will be no one know nevertheless we have go far enough to recognize that all we thinking will be transform under the influence of the struggle it will be impossible for we after the war to do what we have do so widely hitherto : proclaim one range of ethical ideal and standard and live to something widely different in practice either we shall have to abandon the standard or bring we conduct measurably into harmony with they we shall be unable longer to hold unconsciously in solution christianity and the gospel of brute force one or the other must be reject or both consciously reconstruct the effect on the think life of the world will be even greater -- vastly greater -- than that of the french revolution the twentieth century will differ from the nineteenth more than that do from the eighteenth the effect on the relation of different social group throughout the world will be so far-reaching that possibly the democracy and socialism of the nineteenth century may look like remote historic phenomenon such as the athenian tribal system or mediaeval feudalism thus we whole social philosophy will have to be remold we american be still in the patent medicine period of politics trust to political device on the surface for the cure of any evil that arise all across the country like a epidemic of disease have go the notion -- if anything be the matter with we just pass another law thus we be suffer under a ill-considered mass of legislation while blindly trust to it to solve all problem legislation be no solution for moral evil it be possible to some extent to suppress vice by legislation but not to create virtue virtue can be develop only by conduct and education you can not drive man into the kingdom of heaven with the whip of legislation and if you could you would so change the atmosphere of the place that one would prefer to take the other road if we democracy be to survive we must think it through carry it down from these superficial political device into we industry and commerce still so largely dominate by feudal idea of the middle age into we science and art far more completely into we education into we social relationship and beyond all else into we fundamental attitude of mind democracy be at bottom not a series of political form but a way of life thus the war will be the supreme test of democracy the question it will settle be this : can free man by voluntary cooperation develop a efficiency and a endurance which will make it possible for they to stand and protect they liberty against the machinery and aggressive ambition of autocratic empire where everything be do paternally from the top if they can then democracy will survive and grow as the highest form of society for age to come if not then democracy will pass and be succeed by some other social order that be why this war have be we war from the beginning though we have enter it so late as we look back upon the struggle of athen and the other free greek city with the overwhelming horde of asia at marathon and salami as the conflict that save democracy for europe and make possible the civilization of the occident so it be probable that the world will look back upon this colossal war as the same struggle multiply a thousand time in the man and munitions employ the struggle determine the future of democracy and civilization for generation perhaps for all time ii the conflict of idea in the war the world have be confuse as to the issue in this war because of the multitude of its cause and of the antagonism it involve yet under all the national and racial hatred the economic jealousy certain great idea be be test out apologist for germany have tell we even with pride that in germany the supreme conception be the dedication of man to the state this be not true of old germany before the formation of the prussian empire she spirit be intensely individualistic she stand preeminently for freedom of thought and action it be this that give she noble spiritual heritage goethe be the most individualistic of world master froebel develop in the kindergarten one of the purest of democracy luther and german protestantism represent the affirmation of individual conscience as against hierarchical control it be this spirit that give germany she golden age of literature she unmatched group of spiritual philosopher she religious teacher she pre-eminence in music nevertheless the prussian state autocratic from its inception receive philosophic justification in a series of thinker culminate in hegel who regard the individual as a capricious egotist the state incarnate in its sovereign as the supreme spiritual entity he justify war regard it as a permanent necessity and practically make might right in argue that a conquer nation be justify by its more fruitful idea in annex the weaker while the conquer in be conquer be judge of god here be the philosophic justification of that prussian arrogance which in nietzsche be carry into glitter rhetoric thus the prussian state from afar back be oppose to the general spirit of old germany since 1870 it must be admit that spirit be go with the formation of the prussian empire and for the half century of its existence every force of social control -- press church state education social opinion -- be deliberately employ to stamp on the german people one idea -- the subordination of the individual to the state as the supreme and only virtue how far have the policy succeed apparently absolutely to the outside observer the old spirit seem utterly go how far this policy have be help by the cultivation of the fear of the slav one can not say look at the map of europe one see that the geographical relation of germany to the great slavic empire be not unlike the relation of holland to germany thus the deliberate foster of fear of the vast empire of the east have do much to strengthen the hand of the prussian regime in its choose task nevertheless when one recall the spiritual heritage of germany : when one think of herder schiller and goethe tauler luther and schleiermacher froebel herbart and richter kant fichte and novali mozart beethoven and wagner one feel that something of the old german heritage must survive when the german people find out what have happen to they and why that heritage surely ought to show in some reaction against the present autocratic regime after the war close if not before perhaps even to the extent of make germany a republic that would be some compensation for the waste and destruction of the war meantime germany stand now ruthlessly for the dedication of man to the state one can understand why a prussian minister forbid the teaching of froebel 's idea in prussium during the latter period of the educator 's life so one understand the hatred of goethe because he refuse allegiance to a narrow nationalism and remain cosmopolitan in he world-view similarly hegel with he justification of absolute monarchy and he theory of the german state as the acme of all spiritual evolution be the acclaimed orthodox philosopher of prussium while the individualist schopenhauer be neglect and despise one must have live in germany to realize the absolute control of the state over the individual -- the incessant surveillance the petty regulation the constant interference with private life it be to escape just this vexatious control with the arduous militarism in which it culminate that so vast a multitude of german leave they native land and come to the united state -- not all of whom have show appreciation and loyalty to the free land that welcome they iii the idea for which the ally nation fight in contrast to the idea for which germany now stand the anglo-saxon instinctively and tenaciously believe in the liberty and initiative of the individual we of course be no longer anglo-saxon when de tocqueville in 1831 visit we country survey we institution and after return home make he trenchant diagnosis of we democracy he could justly designate we anglo-american that time be past we be to-day everything and nothing : a great nation in the womb of time struggle to be bear nevertheless anglo-american idea still dominate and inspire we civilization it be indeed remarkable to what a extent this be true in the face of the mingling of heterogeneous race in we population as english be we speech so anglo-american idea be still the soul of we life and institution this be evident in the jealousy of authority we resent the intrusion of the government into affair of private life and prefer to submit to annoyance and even injustice on the part of other individual rather than to have protection at the price of paternalistic regulation by the state we resent any law that we do not see be necessary to the general welfare and be rather lawless even then this show clearly in we reaction on legislation in regard to drink the prohibition of intoxicating liquor be about the surest way to make a anglo-saxon want to go out and get drunk even when he have no other inclination in that direction in boston under the eleven o'clock close law man in public restaurant will at time order at ten minute of eleven eight or ten glass of beer or whiskey for fear they might want they whereas if the restriction have not be present two or three would have suffice not long ago we see the very labor leader who force the adamson law through congress threaten to disobey any legislation limit they own freedom of action even though vitally necessary to the freedom of all the general behavior under automobile and traffic regulation illustrate the tendency evenmore clearly think over the list of acquaintance who own automobile one find it hard to recall one who would not break the speed law at a convenient opportunity even a staid college professor who have walk the walled-in path all he life : let he get a ford runabout and in three month he be exultant in run as close as possible to every foot traveler and in exceed the speed limit at any favorable chance these be not beautiful expression of we national spirit but they serve to illustrate we instinctive individualism especially be we jealous of highly centralized authority de tocqueville argue that we would never be able to develop a strong central government and that we democracy would be menace with failure by that lack that he prophecy have prove false and we federal government have become so strong be due only to the accident of we history and the exigency of the tremendous problem we have have to solve the same individualistic spirit be strong in england it have be particularly evident during the war in the resentment of military authority as apply to labor condition the artisan and they leader dread to give up liberty for which they have struggle through generation for fear that those rights would not be readily accord they again after the war it must be admit that this fear be justified the same spirit be evident in the fight on conscription this attitude have be a handicap to england in successfully carry on the war as it be to we but it show how strong be the essential spirit of democracy in both land in france the revolution be at bottom a affirmation of individualism -- of the right of the people as against class and king to seek life liberty and happiness the great word _ liberty equality fraternity _ that the french place upon they public building in the period of the revolution be the essential battle-cry of true democracy -- as it be to be rather than as it be at present through she peculiar situation threaten and overshadow by potential enemy france have be force to a policy of militarism with a large subordination of the individual to the state the subordination however be voluntary that be touchingly evident in the beautiful fraternization of french officer and man in the present war with we anglo-saxon reserve we smile at the picture of grave general kiss bearded soldier in recognition of valor but it be a significant expression of the voluntary equality and brotherhood of frenchman in this war the reason france have rise with such splendid courage and unity be the consciousness of every frenchman that complete defeat in this war would mean that there would be no france in the future that pari would be a larger strassburg and france a greater alsace-lorraine while the subordination have be thus voluntary surely the french soldier man for man have prove themselves the equal of any soldier on earth the anomaly of the first two year of the war be the presence of the vast russian autocratic empire on the side of the ally democracy for russium however the war be of the people rather than of the autocracy at the top and one see that russium would emerge from the war change and purify what one could not foresee be that under the awakening of the people russium could pass in a day through a revolution as profound in its character and consequence as the great explosion in france it would be almost a miracle if so complete a revolution in such a vast benighted empire be not follow by decade of recurrent chaos and anarchy if russium avoid this fate she will present a unique experience in history the tendency to abrogate all authority the spectacle of regiment of soldier become debate society to discuss whether or not they shall obey order and fight be ominous sign for the next period emancipate russium must learn if necessary through bitter suffering that liberty be not license that democracy be not anarchy but voluntary and intelligent obedience to just law and the choose executor of those law meantime whatever she immediate future may be russium 's transformation have clarify the issue and justified she place with the ally democracy however long and confuse she struggle there can be no return to the past and in the end she revolution mean democracy thus in democracy the state exist for man other form of society seek the interest or welfare of a individual a group or a class democracy aim at the welfare that be the liberty happiness growth intelligence helpfulness of _ all the people _ under all the welter of this world struggle it be therefore these great contrasting idea that be be test out perhaps for all time what be they relative value for efficiency initiative invention endurance permanence beneath all what be they final value for the happiness and helpfulness of all human being iv moral standard and the moral order there be only one moral order of the universe -- one range of moral as of physical law for instance the law of gravitation -- simplest of physical principle -- hold the last star in the abyss of space round the dew-drop on the petal of a spring violet and determine the symmetry of live organism but it be one and unchanging a fundamental pull in the nature of matter itself so with moral law : they be not superad to life by some divine or other authority they be simply the fundamental principle in the nature of life itself which we must obey to grow and be happy if the moral order be one and unchanging man do change in relation to it and moral standard be relative to the stage of he growth history be fill with illustration of this relativity of ethical standard for instance : human slavery doubtless begin as a act of beneficence on the part of some philanthropist well in advance of he age the first man who in the dim dawn of history say to the captive he have make in war i will not kill you and eat you i will let you live and work for I the rest of you life : that man institute human slavery but it be distinctly a step upward from something that have be far worse homer represent ulyss as the favorite pupil of palla athena goddess of wisdom : why baldly state because ulyss be the shrewdest and most successful liar in classic antiquity if ulyss be to appear in a society of decent man to-day he would be exclude from they companionship and for the same reason that lead homer to glorify he as the favorite pupil of the goddess of wisdom thus what be a virtue at one stage of development become a vice as man climb to higher recognition of the moral order just because the moral standard be relative it be absolutely bind where it apply in other word if you see the light shine on you path you owe obedience to the light one who do not see it do not owe obedience in the same way if you do not obey you light you punishment be that you lose the light -- degenerate to a lower plane and it be the worst punishment imaginable thus the same act may be for the undeveloped life non-moral for the develop distinctly immoral before the instinct of personal modesty and purity be develop careless sex-promiscuity mean something entirely different from what a descent to it mean in we society when a man of some primitive tribe go out and kill a man of another tribe the action be totally different morally from the murder by a man of one community of a citizen of a neighboring town to-day this gradual elevation of moral standard or growth in the recognition of the sacredness of life and the obligation to other individual can be trace historically as a long and confused process there be a time in the remote past when no law be recognize except that of the strong arm the man who want anything take it if he be strong enough and other submit to he superior force then follow a age when the family be the supreme social unit each member of the family group feel the pain or pleasure of all the other as something like he own but all outside this circle be as the beast this be the condition among the veddah of ceylon study so interestingly by haeckel living in isolate family group scatter through the tropical wilderness : one man one woman and they child form the social unit : they as nearly represent primitive life as any other body of people now on the earth then follow a long roll of age when the tribe be the highest social unit each member of the tribe be conscious of the sacredness of life of all the other member and of some obligation toward they but man of other tribe may be slay as freely as the beast then come a period when appreciation of the sacredness of life be extend over all those of the same race test generally by they speaking somewhat the same language that be the condition in classic antiquity : it be jew and gentile greek and barbarian -- the very word barbarous come from the unintelligible sound to the greek of those who speak other than the hellenic tongue even plato with all he far-sighted humanism say in the _ republic _ that in the ideal state greek should deal with barbarian as greek now deal with one another if one remember what occur in the peloponnesian war -- how greek man vote to kill all the man of military age in a conquered greek city and sell all the woman and child into slavery -- one will see that plato 's dream of humanity be not so very wide from that time on there have be further extension of the appreciation of the sacredness of life and of the consciousness of moral obligation toward other human being we be far from the end of the path we sympathy be still limit by accident of time and place race and color but we have go far enough to see what the end would be be we to reach it : a sympathy so wide a appreciation of the sacredness of life so universal that each of we would feel the joy or sorrow of every other human be alive to-day or to be alive to-morrow as something like he own moreover in all civilized society we have go far enough to renounce the right to private vengeance and adjustment of quarrel : we live under established court of law with organize civil force to carry out they judgment this give relative peace and security and a general if imperfect application of the moral law v the present state of international relation the astounding anomaly of modern civilization be the way we have lag behind in apply to group and nation of man the moral law universally recognize as binding over individual for instance about twenty year ago we coin and use widely the phrase soulless corporation to designate we great combination of capital in industry and commerce why be that phrase use so widely the answer be illuminating : we take it for grant that a individual employer would treat he artisan to some extent as human being and not merely as cog-wheel in a productive machine but we also take it for grant that a impersonal corporation where no individual be dominantly responsible would regard its artisan merely as piece of machinery with no respect whatever for they humanity the supreme paradox however be in the relation of nation : it be there that we have most amazingly lag behind in apply the moral law universally accept in the relation of individual for instance long before this war begin we hear it proclaim even proudly by certain philosopher in more than one nation that the state be the supreme spiritual unit that there be no law higher than its interest that the state make the law and may break it at will when a great statesman in germany doubtless in a moment of intense anger and irritation use the phrase that have go all across the earth _ scrap of paper _ for a sacred treaty between nation he be only make a pungent practical application of the philosophy in question do we regard self-preservation as the highest law for the individual distinctly not here be a crowded theater and a sudden cry of fire with the ensue panic : if strong man trample down and kill woman and child in the effort to save they own life we regard they with loathing and contempt on the other hand it be just this plea of national self-preservation that the german regime have use in cynical justification of its every atrocity -- the initial violation of belgium the make war ruthlessly on civil population the atrocious spy and plot in the bosom of neutral and friendly nation the destruction of monument of art and devastation of the city field orchard and forest of northern france and finally the submarine warfare on the world 's shipping no civilized human be would for a moment think of use the plea of self-preservation to justify comparable conduct in individual life consider international diplomacy : much of it have be merely shrewd and skillful lie if you will review the list of the most famous diplomat of europe for the last thousand year you will find that a considerable portion of they win they fame and reputation by be a little more shrewd and successful liar than the diplomat with whom they have to deal in other land in other word they conduct have be exactly on the plane that ulyss represent in personal life afar back in classic antiquity take a illustration a little nearer home if you be do business on one side of the street and have two competitor in the same line across the way and a cyclone sweep the town destroy they establishment and spare yours : you as a individual would be ashamed to take advantage of the disaster under which you rival be suffer use the time while they be out of business to lure they customer away from they and bind those customer to you so securely that you competitor would never be able to get they back you would scorn such conduct as a individual but when it come to a relation of the nation : during the first two year of the war from the highest government circle down to the smallest country newspaper we be urge to take advantage of the disaster under which we european rival be suffer win they international customer away from they and bind those customer to we so securely that europe would never be able to get they back not that we be urge to industry and enterprise -- that be always right -- but actually to seek to profit by the suffering of other -- conduct we would regard as utterly unworthy in personal life if you neighbor be to say my personal aspiration demand this portion of you front yard and he be to attempt to fence it in : the situation be unimaginable but when a nation say my national aspiration demand this portion of you territory and proceed to annex it : if the nation be strong enough to carry it out a large part of the world acquiesce the relation of nation be thus still largely on the plane of primitive life among individual or since nation be make up of civilized and semi-civilized person it would be fairer to say that the relation of nation be comparable to those prevail among individual when a group of man go far out from civil society to the frontier beyond the reach of court of law and they police force : then nearly always there be a reversion to the rule of the strong arm that be what kiple mean in exclaim there be never a law of god or man run north of fifty-three that condition prevail all across we frontier in the early day for instance the cattle man come pasture they herd on the hill and plain use the great expanse of land not yet take up by private ownership a little later come the sheep man with vast flock of sheep which nibble every blade of grass and other edible plant down to the ground thus starve out the cattle what follow the cattle man get together by night ride down the sheep-herder shoot they or drive they out or be themselves drive out so on the frontier in the early day a weakling stake out a agricultural or mining claim a ruffian appear who be a sure shot jump the claim and drive the other out it be the rule of the strong arm and it be evident on the frontier all across the country this be exactly the state that a considerable part of the world have reach in international relationship to-day claim-jumping be still accept and widely practice among the nation that be in fact the way in which all empire have be build -- by a succession of successful claim-jumping consider the most impressive of they all the old roman empire rome be a city near the mouth of the tiber she reach out and conquer a few neighbor city in the latin plain bind they securely to herself by domestic and economic tie then she extend she power south and north cross into northern africa conquer gaul and spain sweep asia minor until a territory three thousand by two thousand mile in extent be under the sway of she all-conquering arm what justified rome as far as she have justification be the remarkable strength and wisdom with which she establish law and order and the protection of civil society over all the conquer territory until often the subject population be glad they have come under the all-dominant sway of rome since they situation be so much more peaceful and happy than before such justification however be after the fact : it be not moral justification of the building of the empire that represent a succession of claim-jumping for a illustration from more modern history take the greatest international crime of the last five hundred year with one exception -- the partition of poland it be true the polish noble be a nuisance to they neighbor ever quarrel among themselves with no central authority powerful enough to restrain they but that do not justify the action take three nation or rather the autocratic sovereign of those nation powerful enough to accomplish the crime agree to partition poland among themselves they do it with the result that there be plenty of pole in the world to-day but there be no poland consider the possession of silesium by prussium silesium be a integral part of the austrian domain long so recognize friedrich the great want it he annex it the deed cause he many year of recur devastating war again and again he be near the point of utter defeat but he succeed in bring the war to a successful conclusion and silesium be part of prussium to-day the strong arm conquest be the only reason so be it with germany 's possession of schleswig-holstein with austrium in herzegovina and bosnium france in algier italy in tripolus : they be all instance of claim-jumping reprehensible in vary degree i suppose no thoughtful englishman would attempt to justify on high moral grounds the building up of the british empire : for instance the possession of egypt and indium by britain how do indium happen to be a part of the british realm every one know the answer the east indium company be simply the most adventurous and enterprising trading company then in the world it grow rich trading with the orient establish the supremacy of the british merchant marine get into difficulty with french rival and native ruler fight brilliantly for its rights as it have every reason to do conquered territory and consolidated its possession rule chiefly through native prince it become so powerful that it do not seem wise to the british government to permit a private corporation to exercise such ever-growing political authority it be regulate and in the end abolish by act of parliament its possession be take over by the crown the conquest be extend and complete and indium today be a gem in the crown of the british empire what justify britain as far as she have justification be the remarkable wisdom and generosity with which she have extend not onlylaw and order and protection to life and property but freedom and autonomous self-government to she colony and subject population with certain tragic exception about as fast as this could safely be do it be that which hold the british empire together great irregular empire stretch over a large part of the globe : but for this it would fall to piece over night it would be impossible for force administer at the top to hold it together the splendid response of she colony in this war have be purely voluntary that canada have four hundred thousand train man at the front or ready to go be due wholly to she free response to the wise generosity of england 's policy and in no degree to compulsion which would have be impossible this justification of the british empire be nevertheless as in the case of rome after the fact and do not justify morally the building up of the empire we own hand be not entirely clean it be true we come late on the stage of history and start as a democracy be instinctively oppose to empire building thus we brief record be cleaner than that of the older nation nevertheless there be example of claim-jumping in we history the most tragic of all be a large part of we treatment of the american indian it be true with anglo-saxon hypocrisy we try to make every steal a bargain many a expanse of territory have be buy with a jug of rum the indian know nothing about the ownership of land we do so we make the deed and he accept it then to he surprise he find he have to move off from land where for generation he ancestor have hunt and fight with no idea of private ownership so we push he on and on of late decade we have become ashamed try in awkward fashion to render some compensation for the wrong do but the larger part of the story be sad indeed there be of course another side to all this : the more highly develop nation do owe leadership and service in help those below to climb the path of civilization but let one answer fairly how much of empire building have be due to this altruistic spirit and how much to selfishness and the lust for power and possession vi the ethic of international relationship we have see that all empire have be build up by a series of successful aggression and that claim-jumping still characterize the relation of the nation nevertheless there have be some progress in apply to group and nation the moral principle we recognize as binding upon individual consider again we internal life : it be twenty year ago that we coin and use so widely the phrase soulless corporation for we great combination of capital in industry to-day that phrase be rarely hear one see it seldom even in the page of survive muck-raking magazine why have a phrase use so widely in the past all but disappear again the answer be illuminating : there have be tremendous growth in twenty year on the part of we great corporation in treat they employee as human being and not merely as cog-wheel in a productive machine when the greatest corporation in the united state voluntarily raise the wages of all its employee in the country ten per cent five several time within a few month as the steel trust have recently do something have happen it may be say they do it because it be good business : twenty year ago they would not have recognize that it be good business it may be say they do it to avoid strike : twenty year ago they would have welcome the strike fight they through and gain what selfish advantage be possible the point be there have be vast increase in the consciousness of moral responsibility on the part of corporation toward they artisan this have be due partly to legislation but mainly to education and the awakening of public conscience if you wish to find the greatest arrogance and selfishness now you will discover it not among the capitalist : they be timid and submissive -- strangely so you will find it rather in certain leader of the labor movement with they consciousness of newly-gained power some growth there have be in the application of the same moral principle even to the relation of the nation for instance : a hundred year ago the napoleonic war have just come to a end in the day of napoleon man generally glory in war to-day most of they bitterly regret it and fight because they believe they be fight for high moral aim or for national self-preservation whether they be right or wrong when napoleon conquer a country often he push the weakling king off the throne and replace he with a member of he own family -- at time a worse weakling think of such a thing be attempt to-day : it be unimaginable unless the worst tyranny on earth get the upper hand for the next three hundred year of human history a more pungent illustration of progress be the feverish desire show by each of the combatant in this world struggle to prove that he do not begin it now some one begin it a hundred year ago belligerent would not have be so anxious to prove they innocence : then victory close all account and no one go behind the return the feverish anxiety each combatant have show to establish he innocence of initiate this devastating war be conclusive proof that even the worst of they recognize that they all must finally stand before the moral court of the world 's conscience and be judge the same tendency be show in the effort of germany -- grotesquely and tragically sophistical as they be -- to justify she ever-expanding freshly-invented atrocity at least she be aware that they require justification this explain why we react so bitterly even on what would have be accept a century ago what be take for grant yesterday be not tolerate to-day and what be take for grant to-day will not be tolerate in a to-morrow that maybe be not so distant as in we darker moment we imagine what would be the conclusion of this process it would be would it not the complete application to the relation of the nation of the moral principle universally accept as binding upon individual if it be true that the moral order of the universe be one and unchanging then _ what be right for a man be right for a nation of man and what be wrong for a man be wrong for a nation _ and no fallacious reasoning should be allow to blind we to that basic truth this would mean the end of all diplomacy of lie and deceit the relation of the nation would be place on the same plane of relative honesty and frankness now prevail among individual : not absolute truth -- few of we practice that -- but that general ability to trust each other in word and conduct that be the foundation of we business and social life it would mean the end of empire building those empire that exist would fall naturally into they component part if those part remain affiliate with the central government it would be only through the voluntary choice of the majority of the population dwelling upon the territory thus every people would be affiliate with the government to which it naturally belong and with which it wish to be affiliate it would mean finally a voluntary federation of the nation with the establishment of a world court of justice but no weak-kneed spineless arbitration court : rather a court of justice comparable to those establish over individual whose judgment would be enforce by a international military and naval police contribute by the federated nation people misunderstand this proposal they imagine it would mean the give over of the entire military and naval equipment of each federated nation to the central court far from it : each nation would retain for defense purpose the mass of its manhood and the larger fraction of its limited equipment while a minor fraction would be contribute to the world court when this be achieve there will be for the first time in the history of the world the dawn of the longed-for era of universal and relatively permanent peace for mankind it be a far-off dream be it not let we admit it frankly and it seem further off than it do four year ago for the approximation to it achieve through international law we have see go down in a blind welter through the invention of new instrument of destruction and the willful perpetration of illegal and immoral atrocity in this horrible war nevertheless it be not so far off as in ourdarker moment we fear if this world war end justly which mean if it end so that the people dwelling on any territory be affiliate with the government to which they naturally belong and with which they wish to be affiliate the dream will be bring appreciably nearer if the war end unjustly which mean if it end with the gratification of the ambition of aggressive tyranny the dream will be put remotely far off if a peace be patch up meantime with no solution it will mean europe sleep on its arm and the break out of the war with multiply devastation within twenty year that be why these blithely undertake peace mission and other effort at peace without victory even when not cloak for pro-german movement be such preposterous absurdity or else play directly into the hand of tyranny at best however the dream be a long way ahead man dislike to give up power nation equally it will take a long process of international moral education to induce the nation to renounce they arbitrary power they right to adjust all they own quarrel and lead they to enter voluntarily a federation under a world court of justice this nevertheless be the hope of the world toward which we should work with all we might vii america 's duty in international relation since the world solution be at best so remote we question be : what be we to do meantime we entrance into the war partially answer the question we have before we the immediate task of aid in overthrow autocracy and tyranny and of defend we liberty and those of the nation that stand for democracy this be the first duty but not the only one more definitely than any other nation we have throw down to the world the challenge of democracy we have say away with king we will have no more of they away with caste and rule class we will have no more of they as a matter of fact democracy have no ruler -- the word survive from a older order of society -- they have guide leader and representative if you wish to use the word in a democracy every man be the ruler -- and every woman too we hope before long to this ideal we be commit and it carry certain obligation for every right carry a duty and every duty a right often the best way to get a privilege be by assume a responsibility that be a truth it would be well for the leader of the feminist and labor movement to recognize the obligation carry by the challenge of we democracy be clear we american should have do once and for all time with the diplomacy of lie and deceit fortunately we recent tradition be in harmony with this demand but we should not depend upon the happy accident of a administration which take the right attitude it should be the open and universal demand of the american people that those who represent we shall place the relation we sustain to other nation permanently on the same plane of frank honesty generally prevail among individual incidentally any politician or statesman who at this heart-breaking crisis of the world 's life dare play party politics with we international relation should be damned forever by the vote of the american people further it be we duty to have do with all dream of empire building it be not for we : let we abandon it frankly and forever those dependency which have come to we through the accident of we history should be grant autonomous self-government at the earliest moment at which they can safely take it over -- which do not necessarily mean to-morrow if they remain affiliated with we it should be only through the voluntary choice of the majority of the population dwelling upon they it be moreover we duty to lead the world in the effort to form a federation of the nation and establish the aforesaid world court of justice with the international military and naval police to enforce its judgment more than this be demand : on the basis of the challenge of we democracy it be we duty to rise to the point of place justice higher than commercial interest it be a hard demand but with the latent idealism in we american life surely we can rise to it for instance the vexed puzzle of the tariff will never be justly and permanently settle till it be settle primarily as a problem of moral international relationship and not as one merely of economic interest and advantage for example a tariff wall between the united state and canada be as preposterous a absurdity as would be a long line of bristle fortification along the three thousand and more mile of international boundary we be not protect ourselves from slave labor over there they be not protect themselves from slave labor here bar a few line of industry there be the same condition of labor production and distribution both side of the line the only reason for a tariff wall be they wish or we wish or the wish of each to gain some advantage at the expense of the other party now every business man know that any trade that benefit one and injure the other party to it be bad business as well as bad ethic in the long run good business benefit both trader all the time on the other hand when it come to protect we labor from competition with slave labor in other quarter of the earth we have not only the right but the duty to do it so when it be a matter of protect we industry from be swamp by the unload of vast quantity of goods produce under the feverish and abnormal condition sure to prevail in europe after the war we have again not only the right but the duty to do it finally a still higher call be upon we : we must somehow rise to the point of place humanity above the nation it be true charity begin at home certainly justice should one should educate one 's own child before worry over the child of the neighborhood clean up one 's own town before trouble about the city further away often the whole be help best by serve the part but it be with national patriotism as it be with family affection the latter be a lovely quality and the source of much that be best in the world but when family affection be a instrument for gain special privilege at the expense of the good of society a means of attain debauch luxury and selfish aggrandisement it be a abomination the man who pray god 's blessing on himself he wife and he child and nobody else be a mean man and he never get bless -- not from god similarly the man who seek the interest of he own nation against the welfare of mankind who pray god 's blessing only on he own people be equally a mean man and he prayer also be never answer from the most high the world have advance too far for the spirit of a narrow nationalism the recrudescence of such a spirit be one of the sad consequence of this world war only in a spirit of international brotherhood in dedication to the welfare of humanity can democracy go towards its goal these be the obligation follow upon the challenge of democracy we have proclaim to the nation viii the gospel and the superstition of non-resistance the first condition of fulfil the responsibility impose upon we by the challenge of we democracy be now and hereafter readiness and willingness for self-respecting self-defense defense of we liberty and of the principle and ideal for which we stand there be much nonsense talk about non-resistance to evil it be a lovely thing in certain high place of the moral life it be well that socrate remain in the common criminal prison in athen and drink the hemlock poison but nine time out of ten it would have be better to run away as he have a opportunity to do it be good that jesus heal the ear of the servant of the high priest -- and good that st peter cut it off in other word act of non-resistance and self-sacrifice be fine flower of the moral life but you can not have flower unless they root be below ground otherwise they quickly wither thus to have sound value these act of non-resistance and self-sacrifice must rest on a solid foundation of self-affirmation and resistance to evil as with the individual so with the nation : there come high moment in a nation 's life when a strong people might resist and deliberately choose not to as a illustration take we mexican problem the announcement that under no circumstance would we intervene may have lead to misunderstand we purpose to let the mexican people work out they own problem may have be take to mean that we would not justly protect ourselves with consequent encouragement to border raiding nevertheless if there have be any error in handle the situation it have be on the better side -- on the side of patience generosity long-suffering give the other fellow another chance and another and another even though he do not deserve they now that be not the side on which human nature usually err the common temptation be to selfishness and unjust aggression since that be the case if we can not strike the just balance it be better to push too far on the other side and avoid the common mistake suppose after the war japan alone or in conjunction with one or another european power close the door to china : one can imagine circumstance where we with the right to insist that the door be keep open and perhaps by that time something of the strength to enforce that right might deliberately say no we will not resist not that with we present situation such action be desirable but that one can imagine condition arise where it might be the higher choice let I repeat that for the nation as with the individual these high moment must rest on something else they be the high mountain peak of the moral life but detach mountain peak be impossible -- except as a mirage they must rest upon the granite foundation of the hill and plateau below so these high virtue of non-resistance magnanimity and self-sacrifice must always rest upon the granite foundation of the masculine virtue of self-affirmation endurance heroism strong conflict with evil it take strength to make magnanimity and self-sacrifice possible if they lesson be not lose a weak man can not be magnanimous since he generosity be mistake for servile cowardice after all the best time to forgive you enemy for he good and yours be not when he have he foot on you neck : he be apt to misunderstand and think you be afraid it be often better to wait until you can get on you foot and face he man to man and then if you can forgive he it be so much the better for you for he and for all concerned thus there be two opposite line of error in the moral life the philosophy of the one be give by nietzsche while tolstoy in certain extreme of he teaching represent the other nietzsche i suppose should be regard as a symptom rather than a cause of anything important but the ancestor of nietzsche be goethe and ibsen with they splendid gospel of self-realization nietzsche on the contrary with he contempt for the morality of christianity as the morality of slave and weakling with he eulogy of the blond brute stride over forget multitude of he weaker fellow to a stultifying isolation apart -- nietzsche be self-realization in the mad-house it have always seem to I not without significance that he own life end there on the other hand when tolstoy respond to a inquirer that if he see a child be attack by a brutal ruffian he would not use force to intervene and protect the child : that too be non-resistance fit for the insane asylum one of these be just as far from sane balanced human morality as the other it be a terrible thing to suffer injustice it be far worse to perpetrate it if one have to choose between be victim or tyrant one would always choose to be victim : it be safer for the moral life and there be more recovery afterward if however it be better to suffer injustice than to perpetrate it better than either be to resist it fight it and if possible overthrow it it have be say so many time by extreme pacifist that even sane human being sometimes take it for grant that force never accomplish anything permanent in human history it be false and the reasoning by which it be support involve the most sophistical of fallacy all depend on who use the force and the purpose for which it be use the force employ by tyranny and injustice accomplish nothing permanent in history why because tyranny and injustice be in they very nature transient they be oppose to the moral order of the universe and in the end must pass on the other hand the force employ on the part of liberty and justice have attain most of the end of civilization we cherish to-day the force of the million of mercenary collect through asia and africa by darius and xerx to overwhelm a few greek city accomplish nothing permanent in history but the force of the ten thousand athenian who fight at marathon and of the other thousand at salami save democracy for europe and make possible the civilization of the occident the force employ by king loui of france to support a totter throne and continue the exploitation of the people by a idle and selfish aristocratic caste accomplish nothing permanent in history but the force of those frenchman who march upon pari singing the marseillaise make possible the freedom and culture of the last hundred year the force employ by king george of england to wring tax without representation from reluctant colony accomplish nothing permanent in history but the force which at bunker hill and concord bridge fire the shot hear round the world achieve the liberty and democracy of the american continent it may be freely admit that all use of force be a confession of failure to find a better way if you use force in the education of a child it be such a confession of failure so be it if force be use in control defective and criminal or in adjust the relation of the nation but note that the failure may be one for which the individual parent teacher society state or nation be in no degree responsible force be a tragic weapon -- and the ultimate one ix preparedness for self-defense since force be still the weapon of international justice readiness and willingness to use it for defense when necessary be then the first condition of fulfil the aim and serve the cause for which america stand in other word since the relation of the nation be still so largely those of individual under the condition of frontier life as with the honest man on the frontier so for the self-respecting peace-loving nation to-day it be well to carry a gun and know how to shoot carry a gun be a dangerous practice for two reason : it may go off in you pocket you may get drunk and shoot when you ought not those be the only two rational argument against national preparation for defense in the present state of the world let we see the gun may go off in you pocket : that be if a strong armament for defense be build up there be always danger that it may be use internally against the people unjustly that indeed have be one of the curse of europe for a thousand year it be a grave danger but recognize it be partly forestall it moreover we would better face that danger than one far worse so with the other menace : you may get drunk and shoot when you ought not nation get drunk : they get drunk with pride arrogance aggressive ambition revenge even with panic terror and so shoot when they should not this also be a grave danger but here as well recognize it be part way forestall it and this danger too we would better face than one far more terrible moreover it be armament for the gratification of aggressive ambition and under the control of the arbitrary authority of a despotic individual or group that tend to initiate war not armament solely to defend the liberty of a people thus under the condition cite it be well to be arm and prepare if a wolf be at large if a mad dog be loose if a madman be abroad with a ax it be the part of wisdom to have a adequate weapon and be prepare to use it if the athenian have not resist the horde of asia what would have be the history of europe if the french have not resist tyranny and injustice in the revolution what would have be the civilization of the last hundred year if the english colonist have not resist taxation without representation what would be the present status of america if the artisan group have not unite and fight economic exploitation what would be they life to-day if belgium have not resist germany what would be the future of democracy in europe thus now and after the war the need be for all necessary armament for self-respecting self-defense and not a atom to gratify aggressive ambition this do not mean that once involve in war the military tactic of democracy should be merely defensive as have often and wisely be say in war the best defense be a swift and hard attack it be widely argue however since we aim be peace and a world-court of justice to settle the dispute among the nation make general disarmament possible should not one great nation fortunately free from the quarrel of europe occupy the major portion of a continent its shore wash by two great ocean with peaceful friendship on the north and weak anarchy on the south -- should not such a nation take the lead disarm and set a example to mankind it be a beautiful dream would that those who really believe in non-resistance to evil would be logical and apply it to internal as well as external policy what be a police force it be a body of man train employ and pay to use force in resist evil if you wish to try out non-resistance why not let some city apply it let chicago do it : abolish its police force and set the example to the rest of the benighted city of the country what would happen as long as there be criminal in all city of the land how they would flock to that fat pasturage what devastation of property destruction of life injury to innocent woman and child until the best man of chicago would get together form a vigilance committee shoot some of the criminal hang other drive the rest out and chicago would get back to law and order with court of justice and a regular police body compose of man train employ and pay to use force in resist evil the example of canada and the united state be cite and a noble example it be : three thousand and more mile of international boundary with never a shine gun or bristling fortress on the entire frontier a glorious example prophetic of what be come all over the world perhaps more quickly than we dare hope to-day but what make it possible agreement in advance and that at a time when one of the party be too weak to be fear canada be get strong : she have at present four hundred thousand train man at the front or ready to go before the war close she will have over a half million now suppose canada fortify : we would be compel to there would be no other way thus one nation can not disarm while the other be strongly armed and among they be those whose autocratic ruler and imperialistic caste be watch for sign of weakness in order to perpetrate international claim-jumping it be true that on the frontier in the early day there be individual who go about unarmed among the gun man do it successfully and some of they die peacefully in they bed : christian minister -- sky-pilot they be call please note however that the sky-pilot never have any money he have no claim to be jump we be not sky-pilots -- far from it as to money : the wealth of the world have be flow into we coffer in a golden stream to the embarrassment of we financial institution to the exaltation of the cost of live to such a point that with more money than we ever dream of have we find it more difficult to buy enough to eat and wear as for claim to be jump : they be on every hand : panama canal hawaiian island philippine island port of new york and san francisco vast reach of unprotected coast no we be not sky-pilots we can not claim exemption on that ground suppose after the war we attempt to disarm without the protection of a world court and international police while the other nation retain war armament they the victor and perhaps the defeat would possess a great army and navy man with seasoned veteran and be burden with a intolerable debt for the war have go too far for any one to be able to pay adequate indemnity we rich young heedless sure that no one on earth could ever whip we chiefly because no one worth while have ever seriously try : suppose we be completely disarm it would require only a little meddle with mexico or brazil and we should have to give up the monroe doctrine or fight well perhaps we shall give it up : it have even be suggest in the hall of congress that we should -- to the shame of the suggester be it say people do not understand the monroe doctrine : they talk of it as if it be a law it be in no sense a law but be merely a rather arrogant expression of we desire we say to the other nation : we desire that none of you henceforth shall fence in any part of we front or back yard or the front or back yard of any of we neighbor dwelling on the north and south american continent that be the monroe doctrine and that be all that it be : a expression of we wish all very well if other choose to respect they but suppose some one do not perhaps as state we may abandon the monroe doctrine : that be the easiest way and the easiest way for a nation or a individual be usually the way of damnation even so suppose the nation in question to say my national aspiration demand the panama canal the philippine island or long island and the port of new york why not the atlantic ocean be only a mill-pond it be not half so wide as lake erie be fifty year ago in relation to modern means of transportation and communication people say do we want to give up we traditional isolation they be too late in ask the question : that isolation be irrecoverably go that should be now evident even to people dwelling in fatuously fancied security between the allegheny and the rocky we be inevitably draw into relation with the rest of mankind the question be no longer shall we take a part in world problem but what part shall we take the point be that if under the circumstance cite any one wish to do so we could quickly be drive to such a condition of abject humiliation that we should be compel to fight now suppose disarm we should enter the conflict utterly unprepared the result would be hundred of thousand of young man go out bravely in obedience to a ideal -- untrained and half equipped -- to be butcher a humiliating peace and a indemnity of many billion to be groan under for fifty year on the other hand if we be adequately arm for defense there would be much less temptation to any one to trouble we and if we be compel to fight would it not be better to fight reasonably prepare there be a story go the round of the press about the bandit jesse jame : tell how on one occasion he go to a lonely farm house to commandeer a meal enter he find one woman a widow alone and weep bitterly he ask she what be the matter and she reply that in one hour the landlord be come and if she do not have she mortgage money she would lose she little farm and home and be out in the world shelterless the heart of the bandit be touch he give she the money to pay off the mortgage hide in the brush and hold up the landlord on the way back need the moral be point we have be get the mortgage money during the first year of the war it roll in a ever-increasing golden stream until we hold a mortgage on numerous european nation we have the mortgage money but _ beware of the way back _ thus the agitation in one nation for disarmament unpreparedness and a patch up peace while the other nation be armed and embittered not only render the situation of the one people critically perilous but actually cripple its power to serve the cause of world peace and humanity if only the peace-at-any-price people have to pay the price one would be willing to wait and see what happen but they never pay it they take to cover it be those hundred of thousand of splendid young man go out blithely in obedience to duty to be butcher it be the million of woman and child who can not escape from a devastate area who pay that price every people in the past that turn to money and mercenary for defense have go down no people ever survive that be unable and unwilling to fight for its liberty and spend if necessary the last drop of its blood for the principle it believe x reconstruction from the war we have see how impossible it be to forecast the new world that will follow the war we know merely that it will be utterly new nevertheless the great tendency already at work we can partly discern and recognize something of what they promise it be well to try to see they that we may be not too unready to welcome the opportunity and accept the burden of the world that be be bear in pain peace and prosperity produce a peculiar type of conservatism people be then relatively free in action and expression thing be go well with they and they be instinctively incline to let well enough alone thus in think they tend to a conservative inertia on the other hand in period of great strain and suffering as in war time thought be stimulate all ordinary view be break down and the most radical notion be widely disseminate and even take for grant by those who shortly before would have be scandalize by they action and certain phase of free speech be in such a period much more widely restrain by authority there be a swift and strong development of social control urge by necessity thus in war time there be the curious paradox of ever widen radicalism in think with constantly decrease freedom in action and expression when the discrepancy become too great you have the explosion -- revolution this cause hasten and make more extreme the russian revolution which have be simmer for a century it have not yet appear in germany because of the forty year of successful work in drill the mind of the german people to march in goose-step yet the increase sign of question the infallibility of the exist regime and system in germany give evidence that there too the conflict be at work with ourselves the opposition appear as yet only in minor degree nevertheless it be here on the one hand be the registration conscription and espionage measure the effort to control news the governmental supervision of food supplies transportation production and corporation earnings the war tax on the other hand thought be so stimulate that everything be question : we political system we social institution -- marriage the family education as some one say nothing be radical now we probably shall escape a sudden revolution but the conflict must produce profound readjustment in every aspect of we life for thought and action must come measurably together since they be related as soul and body there be singular eddy in the main current both way for instance the exigency and suffering of war produce a reaction toward narrower orthodox form of religion and a harsher spirit of nationalism while in field of action apart from the struggle freedom and even license may increase as in sex-relation nevertheless these cross-current while they may obscure do not alter the main tendency which move swiftly and increasingly toward the essential conflict even before we actual entrance into the war its profound influence upon both we thinking and we conduct and institution be evident now that we be in the conflict that influence be multiply we be arouse to new seriousness of think the frivolity and selfish pleasure-seeking that have mark we life for recent decade be decrease we may reasonably hope that the literature of superficial cleverness and smart cynicism which have be in vogue for the last period will have have its day that the perpetrator of such literature will be measurably speak without audience at the conclusion of the war the philosophy of complacency at least will be at a end and the world will face with new earnestness the problem of life this generation will be tired perhaps exhaust by the titanic struggle but youth come on fresh and eager with exhaustless vital energy and the generation to come will take the heritage and work out the new philosophy as nature quickly and quietly cover the worst scar we make in she breast so man have a power of recovery beyond all that we could dream it be to that we must look across the time of demoniac destruction we may even dare to hope that the next half-century will see a great development of noble literature in we own land war for liberty justice and humanity always tend to create such a productive period in literature and the other fine art the struggle with persium be behind the periclean age in athen it be the conflict of england with the overshadow might of spain that so vitalize the elizabethan period the revolution be behind the one important school of literature we own country have produce hitherto since this war be wage on a scale far more colossal than any other in human history and since liberty and democracy be at stake not only in one land but throughout the world and for the entire future of humanity it be reasonable to expect that the stimulation to the creation of art and literature will be far greater than that follow any previous struggle where the sacrifice for high aim have be greatest the inspiration should be greatest as in france the literature currently produce as in the book of lotus maeterlinck and rolland be scrappy and disappointing it be true but that be to be expect when the whole nation be strain to its last energy and gasp for breath under the titanic struggle and be no test of what will be in spite of the destruction of so large a fraction of she manhood france will surely rise from the ash of this world conflagration regenerate and reinspire the pessimism of she late decade will be go the literature and other art she will produce will be instinct with new earnestness and exalted vision and she may excel even she own great past we too be awaken since the war begin all over the united state man and woman have be think more earnestly and have be more willing to listen to the expression of serious thought than ever before for the last quarter century now that the hour of sacrifice have strike this earnestness must greatly deepen perhaps we too may have we golden age of art the same inspiration carry naturally into the religious life it be true as we have see that there be a cross-current of reversion to narrower orthodoxy cause by the war the god of war be all national and tribal divinity while they rule the face of the god of humanity be veil the kaiser 's possessive attitude toward the divine be but the extreme case of what war do to the religious life even among ourselves the tendency show in such phenomenon as the current popular evangelism -- a eloquent if artfully calculate and vulgarize preaching of the purely personal virtue with a ignorance that there be a social problem in modern civilization profound as that display by a mediaeval churchman the evangelist 's list of inmate whom he relegate to the kingdom of the lose make the place singularly attractive to the lover of good intellectual society nevertheless the reversion to narrower creed but indicate the newly awaken hunger of the religious life man who sacrifice live with graver earnestness than those who be carelessly prosperous cynicism and pessimism be child of idleness and frivolity never of heroic sacrifice and nobly accept pain these latter foster faith in life and its infinite and eternal meaning thus with all the tragic submerging of we spiritual heritage the war involve we may hope that it will cause a revival not of emotional hysteria but of deepen faith in the spirit in the supreme worth of life until at last we may see the dawn of the religion of humanity xi the war and education equally far-reaching be the change the war must produce in we education temporarily we higher institution will be cripple by the draw off of the youth of the land for war this be one of the unfortunate sacrifice such a struggle involve we must see to it that it be not carry too far one still hear old man in the south pathetically say i miss my education because of the civil war let we strive to keep open we educational institution and continue all we cultural activity in spite of the drain and strain of the war for never be intellectual guidance and leadership more need than in the present crisis the paramount effect of the war on education be however in the multiply demand for efficiency this be the cry all across the country to-day and in the main it be just we education have be too academic too much mold by tradition it must be more closely related to life and to the changed condition of industry and commerce each boy and girl youth and maiden must leave the school able to take hold somewhere and make a significant contribution to the society of which he or she be a integral part vocational training must be greatly increase the problem of the school must be increasingly practical problem and thought and judgment must be train to the solution of those problem this be all a part of that socialization of democracy which must be achieve if democracy be to survive in the new world follow the war there be nevertheless a element of emotional hysteria in the demand for efficiency and only efficiency efficiency be too narrow a standard by which to estimate anything concern human conduct and character in the effort to meet and conquer germany let we beware of the mistake of germany one of the world tragedy of this epoch be the way in which germany have sacrifice she spiritual heritage first for economic then for purely military efficiency when we recall that spiritual heritage as previously describe when we think of schiller herder and goethe froebel herbart and richter tauler luther and schleiermacher kant fichte and schopenhauer mozart beethoven and wagner we stand aghast at the way in which she have plunge it all into the abyss -- for what shall it profit a people more than a man if it gain the whole world and lose its own soul in such a time then all of we who believe in the spirit must hold high the torch of humanistic culture education be for life and not merely for efficiency of what worth be life if one be only a cog-wheel in the economic machine it be to save the spiritual heritage of humanity that we be fight and it be that heritage that education must bring to every child and youth if it fulfil its supreme trust education for the purpose of autocratic imperialism seek to make a people a perfect economically productive and militarily aggressive machine education for democracy mean the development of each individual to the most intelligent self-directed and govern unselfish and devoted sane balanced and effective humanity xii socialism and the war one of the surprise of the war be the complete breakdown of international socialism not only socialist but those of we who have be thoughtfully watch the movement from without have come to believe that the measure of consciousness of international brotherhood it have develop in the artisan group of many land would be a powerful lever against war we be wrong : the superficial international sympathy evaporate like mist under the ray of a revive nationalism the socialist fall in line almost as completely as any other group with the purely nationalist aim in each land this must have gratify certain despot for one cause of the war not the cause be undoubtedly the preference on the part of various autocrat to face a external war rather than the rise tide of democracy within the nation temporarily they have be successful but surely only for a brief time the victory of democracy will vastly accelerate the growth of the spirit of brotherhood throughout the world the terrible waste of the war must of itself produce a reaction of the people on king and caste in all land the suffering that will follow the war in the period of economic readjustment will accentuate this surely the _ people _ in england france america italy russium and among the neutral nation will strive that no such war may come again even in germany when the people find out what they have pay and why inevitably they must struggle so to reform they institution that no ruler or class may again plunge they into such disaster for the selfish benefit or ambition of that ruler or class how we heart have warm to liebknecht the realignment of nation must work to the same end war like politics make strange bed-fellow germany and austrium for century rival and at time enemy we behold unite so completely that it be difficult to imagine they disentangle after the war france and england long regard each other as natural enemy be fuse heart and soul strangest of all we have see england struggle to win for russium that prize of constantinople which for generation it have be a main object of british diplomacy to keep from russian grasp most impressive of all have be the new consciousness of unity and common cause among the nation of the earth and the group within all nation stand for democracy thus the tide check for a time will inevitably break forth with renew force it be probable that the next fifty year will be a period of great change -- even of revolution peaceful or otherwise throughout the earth to understand the effect on the whole socialist movement one must distinguish clearly the two contrasting type of socialism it be the curse of the orthodox or marxian type of socialism that it be make in germany its economic state be model directly on the prussian bureaucratic and paternalistic state its dream realize would mean prussian efficiency carry to the _ nth _ power in a society of as merciless slavery as that prevail among the ant and the bee it be doubtless this characteristic that have make so many bureaucratic or orthodox socialist instinctively pro-german in sentiment and sympathy during the war the contrasting type of socialism be that which be really the full development of democracy its movement from a narrow individualism to ever wider voluntary co-operation it move not toward government ownership but toward ownership by the people of natural monopoly it mean not the turn over to a bureaucratic government of plant and instrument of production but the progressive cooperative ownership of they by the worker themselves it will end not in the overthrow of the capitalist regime but in all worker become co-operative capitalist and all capitalist productive worker since no idle rich -- or poor will be tolerate such socialism if it be so call will depend upon the highest individual initiative the most voluntary co-operation and will include the individualism which be the cherish boon of democracy it be significant that those who represent this type of socialism and who think for themselves be break away from the orthodox party under the courageous leadership and example of john spargo in increase number since we entrance into the war they be as instinctively american and democratic in sympathy as those of the opposite type be pro-german even in the most democratic country however the war have cause a vast increase of the undesirable type of socialism : that be one of its temporary penalty to carry on such a war successfully it be necessary to multiply the authority of the central government that have be the experience of england now be repeat here man who be _ citizen _ of a democracy become as soldier and in part as worker _ subject _ of the government in war to some extent we be force to imitate the tendency we deplore and seek to overthrow in germany to be able to meet and defeat germany even so the difference be profound the subordination to the government be for the people as a whole voluntary achieve through law pass by choose representative of the people and not by the arbitrary will of a kaiser and ruling caste thus the freedom voluntarily relinquish for a time can be quickly regain when the crisis be past subject will become citizen again when soldier return to civil life nevertheless there will be no return to the old selfishly individualistic regime the lesson of organize action will have be learn and a vast increase of voluntary co-operation that be of the socialism that be true democracy may be anticipate as a beneficent result of the war this will be one of the great compensation for the waste of we heritage spiritual and material through the war _ the voluntary socialization of previously individualistic democracy will be the next great forward movement of the human spirit _ xiii the war and feminism of all consequence of the war perhaps none be more significant than its effect upon the position of woman militarism and feminism be counter current in the tide of history all recrudescence of brute force carry the subjugation of woman in the degree to which professional militarism prevail in any society woman be force into hard industrial activity despise because fulfil by woman on the other hand a group of carefully protect woman be hold apart as a fine adornment of life both way militarism accentuate the property idea in reference to woman : the one type useful the other adorning property the one show in marriage by purchase the other in the dowry system it be hard to say which be more dishonor to woman it would perhaps seem preferable and less offensive to be buy as useful rather than accept with a money payment as a adorning but expensive possession where as with the automobile it be the upkeep that count surely however either attitude be degrade enough the accentuation in the present war of the notion of woman as property be evident in more brutal form in the horror of rape in the deliberate and organize use of woman as breeder with the same efficiency with which germany breed she swine nevertheless here too strong counter current be at work as this be a war of nation not of army it be the whole people that in each instance have have to be mobilize and organize in all the democracy woman have voluntarily rise to this need just as citizen have voluntarily become soldier thus woman by the legion be work in munition factory on the farm in productive plant of every kind in public service and commerce organization the noble way in which woman have accept the double burden have create a wave of reverent admiration throughout the world thus where professional militarism tend to despise the industrial activity into which it force woman war for defense and justice cause reverence for the same socially necessary activity and for the woman who so courageously undertake they for the sake of all moreover the increase freedom of action for woman will outlast its temporary cause once so admit to new field of industrial business and professional activity woman can never be generally exclude from they again thus when the soldier become citizen many of the woman will remain producer work beside man under new condition of equality the result with the general stimulation of radical thinking that the war involve will be a profound acceleration of the feminist movement throughout at least the democracy of the world already it be be recognize that all valid principle of democracy apply to woman equally with man regenerate if chaotic russium take for grant the farthest reach of feminism the regime in england that bitterly oppose suffrage for woman be now voluntarily grant it before the close of the war thus the victory of the ally nation will mean the fruition of much of the feminism that be a phase of humanism it will mean free woman from outgrow custom and tradition from unjust limitation in industrial social and political life it will mean man and woman work together on a plane of moral equality with free initiative and voluntary co-operation for the fruition of democracy just as that fruition will see the end of idle rich and poor so there will be no more woman slave or parasite none regard or possess as property but only free human being each self-directed and self-controlled and responsible for he or she own personality and conduct xiv the transformation of democracy the nineteenth century be the period of rapid growth in adhesion to those ideal of democracy for which the war be be fight it be not so well recognize that during the same hundred year democracy be so transform as to be to-day a new thing under the sun up to the time of the french and american revolution democracy rest largely upon certain abstract idea of human nature rousseau could argue that in primitive time man sit down together to form a state each give up a part of he natural right to a central authority and thus justify it we now know that nothing of the kind ever happen that society have undergo a long process of development before man begin to think about it at all we continue to repeat the splendid at all i refer of course to the woman of antiquity where respectable these be the head of the household slave scarcely remove from the condition of the latter the few woman who do achieve freedom of thought and action and become the companion of cultivate man -- the aspasia of antiquity -- buy they freedom at a sad price so rome be call a republic and it be true that during the first half of she long history freedom gradually broaden down from the patrician class to the plebeian multitude when rome reach out however to the mastery of the most impressive empire the world have see she never dream of extend that freedom to the conquer population if she do grant roman citizenship to a occasional community to enjoy the rights and exercise the privilege of that citizenship it be necessary to journey to rome it be the city and the world : the city rule the world as subject the same principle hold with the republic develop at the close of the middle age in italy in the town of the hanseatic league and elsewhere always the freedom achieve be for a city a group or a class never for all the people we dream on the contrary be to take all the man and woman in the land ultimately in the world and help they through the free and cooperative activity of each with all the rest on toward life liberty happiness intelligence -- all the end of life that be worth while if we demand life for ourselves we ask it only in harmony with the best life for all we want no special privilege no benefit apart buy at the price of the best welfare of humanity we unfortunately do not yet mean all of we but it do signify a increase multitude rally to this that be the standard of to-morrow a third transformation at least equally important with these be in the invention for it be no less of representative government political thinker such as john fiske have try to make we understand what this invention mean : we do not yet realize it the development of representative government be the cause first of all of the tremendous expansion of the area over which we apply democracy plato in the _ law _ limit the size of the ideal state -- the one realizable in this world -- to 5040 citizen why well the exact number have a certain mystical significance but the main reason be plato could not imagine a much larger body of citizen than 5000 meeting together in public assembly and fulfil the function of citizenship we have extend democracy over a hundred million of population dwelling on the larger part of a continent and if one travels north south east west to-day one be impressed that in spite of unassimilated element everywhere man and woman be proud first of all of be american citizen and only in subordinate way devote to the section or community to which they belong this have be make possible by the invention and development of representative government that be not all : it be representative government that take the sting out of all the older criticism of democracy plato devote one of the saddest portion of he _ republic _ to show how in a brief time democracy must inevitably fall and be replace by tyranny with the democracy plato know this be true it be impossible for athen to protect and make permanent she constitution she might pass a law declare the penalty of death on any one propose a change in the constitution it do no good let some demagogue arise sure of the suffrage of a majority of the citizen : he could call they into public assembly cause a repeal of the law and make any change in the constitution he desire there be no way to prevent it it be the invention and development of representative government that have change all that we chafe under the slow-moving character of we democracy -- over the time it take to get law enact and the longer time to get they execute we may well be patient : this slow-moving character of democracy be the other side of its greatest safe-guard it be because we can not immediately express in action the popular will and opinion but must think two three many time work through choose and responsible representative of the people that we democracy be not subject to the peril and criticism of those of antiquity the voice of the people in the day and hour under the impulse of sudden caprice or passion be anything but the voice of god : it be much more apt to be the voice of all the power of darkness it be common think sift through uncommon thought that approach as near the voice of god as we can hope to get in this world it be not the surface whim of public opinion it be its _ greatest common denominator _ that approximate the truth it behoove we to remember this at a time when change be come with such swiftness we life have develop so rapidly that the old political form prove inadequate to the solution of the new problem as a practical people we therefore quickly adopt or invent new form doubtless this be in the main right but we should understand clearly what we be do for instance one of the great change recently inaugurate be the election of national senator by popular vote we forefather plan that the national upper house should represent a double sifting of popular opinion we elect state legislature they in turn choose the national senator : thus these be twice remove from the popular will it prove easy to corrupt state legislature the national senate come to represent too much the moneyed interest and so through a amendment to the constitution we change the process and now elect we senator by direct vote of the people this make they more immediately representative of the popular will and perhaps the change be wise but we should recognize that we have remove one more safe-guard of democracy a story tell for a generation and fix upon various british statesman will illustrate my mean the last repetition attribute it to john burn on one occasion while he be a member of parliament it be say he be at a tea-party in the west end of london the hostess pour he cup of tea anxious to make talk and show she deep interest in politics say mr burn what be the use of the house of lord anyway the statesman without reply pour he tea from the cup into the saucer the hostess surprise at the breach of etiquette wait and then say but mr burn you do not answer my question he point to the tea cooling in the saucer : that be the function to cool the tea of legislation that be the function intend for we national senate the trouble be the tea of legislation often become so stone cold in the process that it be fit only for the political slop-pail and that be not what we want so we have change it all but one more safe-guard of democracy be go so with other reform loudly acclaimed as the initiative and referendum with the new problem and complication of a extraordinarily develop life it be doubtless wise that the people should be able to initiate legislation and should have the final word as to what legislation shall stand on the other hand if we be not to suffer under a mass of hasty and ill-considered legislation if law be to stand they must always be formulate by a body of trained legislator and not by the change whim of popular opinion so with the recall now so widely demand in many section of the country in the old day we candidate be most obsequious and profuse in promise to they constituent _ before _ election but once elect only too often they turn they back on they constituent go merrily they own way make deal and bargain in the spirit that to the victor belong the spoil therefore we justly demand some control of they after as before election : hence the recall again the movement be right but if the fundamental of democracy be to be permanent that body of man concern with the interpretation of the constitution and the fundamental law of the land must not be subject to the immediate whim of mob mind and the power to recall those judge occupy with this task would be a graver danger than advantage they will make mistake at time they will be ultra conservative and servant of special interest but that be one of the incidental price we have to pay for the permanence of free institution the problem be to keep the basic principle of democracy unchanged the form on the surface as fluid and adjustable as possible it be these three transformation -- the abandonment of the old abstract notion and the testing of democracy by its result the expansion of its application over the entire population and the invention and development of representative government -- it be these three change that make we democracy a new order of society new in its problem its menace its solution xv democracy and education all just government be a transient device to make order progress possible in the kingdom of heaven there would be no government for if all human being see the best love the best and will the best the function of government would be at a end obviously there be no hope or fear that we shall get into the kingdom of heaven soon and the necessity for government will exist for a indefinitely long time nevertheless government be due to the imperfection of human nature and as state its aim be order progress progress without order be anarchy order without progress be stagnation and death it must frankly be admit moreover that democracy be not the shortest road to good government nor to economic efficiency that we recognize this as a people be prove by the drift of we opinion and of the change in we lesser institution take for instance we city government a few decade ago we city be so notoriously misgovern that they be the scandal of the world we board of alderman or councilman represent ward constituency with all sort of local string tie to they be clumsy and unwieldy and easily subject to corruption so about twenty year ago all across the country go the cry get a good mayor and give he a free hand that be the way we great industry be conduct : a wise captain of industry be secure and give full control be a practical people and imagine ourselves to be much more practical than really we be we say let we conduct we city business in the same way why not plato show long ago that you can get the best government in the shortest time by get a good tyrant and give he a free hand there arc just two objection the first be incidental : it be exceedingly difficult to keep you tyrant good arbitrary authority over one 's fellow be about the most corrupting influence know to man no one be great and good enough to be entrust with it responsible power sober and educate irresponsible power corrupt nevertheless we pay the price of this error and learn the lesson the other objection be more significant it be the effect on the rank and file of the citizenship for the meaning of democracy be not immediate result in government but the education of the citizen and that education can come only by fulfil the function of citizenship thus it be better to be the free citizen of a democracy with all the waste and temporary inefficiency democracy involve than to be the inert slave of the most perfect paternal despotism ever devise by man thus the movement away from democratic city government be gravely to be question no matter what economic result it secure the same argument apply to more recent change as the commission form of city government as in the previous case react upon the scandalous situation we say let we choose the three to five best man in the community and let they run the city 's business for we nearly every time this change have be make the result have be a immediate cleaning up of the city government but why chiefly because a new broom sweep clean -- not so much for the reason that it be new as because you be interested in the instrument you can get a dirty room remarkably clean with a old broom if you will sweep hard enough the clean up be due not primarily to the instrument but to the hand that wield it to speak less figuratively : the cleaning up of the city government with the inauguration of the commission system come because the change be make by a awakening of the good people of the community good people have a habit however of go to sleep in a astoundingly short time but _ the gang never sleep _ now suppose while the good people be doze in semi-somnolence assure that the new broom will sweep of itself the gang get together and elect the three to five worst gangster in the city to be the commission be it not evident that the very add efficiency of the instrument mean greater graft and corruption equally the argument apply to the most recent device suggest -- the city manager plan as we have largely take we school out of politics and have a non-partisan educational expert as superintendent so it be suggest we should conduct we city business again suppose the gang appoint the city manager : he will be a expert in graft rather than in government the moment a people get to trust to a device it be head for danger there be just one safeguard of democracy and that be _ to keep the good people awake and at the task all the time _ some instrument be better and some be worse but the instrument never do the work it be the hand and brain that wield it if there be one field where we could reasonably expect to find pure democracy it be in we higher educational institution in a college or university where a group of young man and woman and a group of older man and woman be gather apart out of the severer economic struggle dedicate to ideal end : there surely we could expect pure democracy in organization and relationship yet the tendency have be steadily toward autocracy one can count the finger of both hand and not cover the list of college and university president who have take office during the last fifteen year only on condition that they have complete authority over the educational policy of the institution and often over its financial policy as well the reason be obvious : we run a railroad efficiently by get a good president and give he arbitrary control why not a university there be just the two objection cite above : even in a university it be difficult to keep you tyrant good this again be the minor objection the real evil be in the effect upon the rank and file of those govern by the autocrat there be man in university faculty to-day who say privately that if they could get any other opportunity they would resign to-morrow for they feel like clerk in a department store with no opportunity to help determine the educational policy of the institution of which they be integral part the german university under all the autocracy and bureaucracy of the german state be more democratic in its organization than we own its faculty be a self-governing body elect to its own membership the rectorship be a honor confer for the year on some faculty member for superior worth and scholarship each member of the faculty may thus feel the self-respect and dignity result from the power and initiative he possess as a free citizen of the institution let I suggest what would be the ideal democratic organization of a college or university why not apply the same division of function of government that have prove so successful in the state the board of trustee be the natural judiciary the president the executive the faculty be the legislative body with the student body as a sort of lower house cooperate in enact the legislation for its own government where have such a plan be try if the primary purpose of democracy be thus not immediate result in government but the education of the citizen on the other hand democracy rest for its safety and progress on the ever better education of the citizen under the older form of human society law may be pass and execute that be far in advance of public opinion that can not be do in a democracy the law may be a slight step in advance and so perhaps educate public opinion to its level but if it go beyond that step after the first flurry of interest in the law be past it remain a dead letter on the statute book -- worse than useless because cultivate that dangerous disrespect for all law which we have see grow upon we as a people thus from either side the problem of democracy be a problem of education it rest upon education its aim be education in a democracy the supreme function of the state be not to establish a military system for defense or a police system for protection it be not the enforcement of public and private contract : it be to take the child and youth of each generation and develop they into man and woman able to fulfill the responsibility and enjoy the opportunity of free citizenship in a free society xvi menace of democracy since modern democracy be a new thing under the sun so its menace be new or if old they take misleadingly new form for instance the greatest danger in the path of we democracy be the world-old evil of selfishness but it do take surprisingly new form it be not aggressive selfishness that we have primarily to dread there be those it be true who believe we may soon be endanger by the ambition of some arrogant leader in the nation the fear be unwarranted for we people be still so devoted to the fundamental principle of democracy that if any leader be to take one clear step toward over-riding the constitution and make himself despot that step would be he political death-blow no we be not yet endanger by the aggressive ambition of those at the front but we be in grave danger from the negative selfishness of indifference show in its worst form by just those people who imagine they be good because they be respectable whereas they may be merely good -- for nothing plato argue that society could never have patriotism in full measure until the family be abolish a singular notion that any school boy to-day can readily answer yet here be the curious situation family life among ourselves in its better aspect have reach a higher plane than ever before in any people more marriage be make on the only decent bast of any marriage this be the woman 's land child have they rights and privilege even to they physical mental and moral detriment it be here that man most willingly sacrifice for they family slave through the hot summer in the city to send wife and child to the seashore or the mountain yet it be just here that man most readily unhinge they conscience when they turn from private to public life some cynic have say that there be not a american citizen who would not smuggle to please he wife of course the statement be not true but if you have ever cross the ocean on a transatlantic liner and watch the device to which ordinarily decent man -- man who would be ashamed to steal you pocket handkerchief or to lie to you as a individual -- will resort in order to lie to the government or steal from the government you begin to wonder if the cynic be not right the law obviously may be unjust : if so protest against it and seek to have it change but while it be the law do it not deserve you respectful obedience unless you would add to the dangerously grow disrespect for all law next to the menace of selfishness be that of ignorance and this too take confusingly new form it be not ignorance of scientific fact and law dangerous as that be that threaten but ignorance of what we institution mean of what they have cost of the ideal for which we stand among the nation the celerity with which even during the past two decade the younger generation have abandon old standard and ideal be a ominous illustration it be true : new occasion teach new duty time make ancient goods uncouth ` they must upward still and onward who would keep abreast of truth those word of lowell 's be as fully applicable to the present crisis as to that for which lowell write they but to give up the past without know that you be let go be surely not the part of wisdom a third menace show in that fickleness of temper and false standard of life that cause we to admire the wrong type of leader probably one half of all the attack on man of unusual wealth and success come from other man who would like to be in the same situation with those they attack and have fail of they ambition part of the attack be sincere no doubt but if you assume that all the abuse heap upon conspicuous man come from moral conviction you would utterly misread the situation on the other hand man of moral excellence make we ashamed now it take a rarely magnanimous spirit to be shame and not resent it we be apt to feel that if we can pull another down we raise ourselves to realize this consider the growl of joy that come from the worse sort of citizen and newspaper when some public leader be catch in a private scandal as if pull he down raise we we be all tar with he disgrace there be indeed two way of state the ideal of democracy : you can say i be just as good as any one else which in the first place be not true and in the second would be unlovely of you to express be it true you can say on the contrary every other human be ought to have just as good a chance as i have which be right and yet you will hear the ideal of democracy phrase a dozen time the first way where it be express once in the second form that democracy be fickle be one of the oldest criticism upon they we have think that we be not subject to that criticism and in the old day we be not we have the country debate club and the village lyceum we be a agricultural people sober and slow-moving we have few book they be good book and we read they many time we have few newspaper we know the man who write in they and when we read a editorial we mind be actively challenge by the sincere thinking of another mind to-day everywhere we have move into the city the strength of the country-side be sobriety and slow incubation of the force of life its vice be stupidity the strength of the city be keen wittedness versatility quick response its vice be fickleness morbidity exhaustion we have we great blanket sheet newspaper represent a party a clique a financial interest with writer lend they brain out for money to write editorial for cause in which they do not believe we have the multitude of book incessantly and hastily produce we read much and scarcely think at all we have get rid of the old three decker novel reduce it to a single volume and then take out the climax of the story publishing it in the corner of the daily newspaper as the short story of the day so that he who run may read if he be a wise man he will run as fast as he can and not read that stuff at all we have we ever increase movie with they incessant titillation of the mind with swift pass impression as disintegrate to intellectual concentration as they be injurious to the eye the result of it all be a increase fickleness of temper so that the same people who shout most loudly when the popular hero go by the next week cover he very name with vituperation and abuse if he offend they slightest whim this evil breed another : fickleness in the people mean demagoguery in the leader inevitably we have say to we public man -- not in word but by the far more impressive language of we conduct -- get money power success and we will give you more money power and success and not ask you how you get they nor what end you serve in use they that so many have refuse the bribe be to they credit not ours we have do what we could to corrupt they finally we be the most irreverent people in the world we believe in youth we scorn age we have splendid enthusiasm we do not know what wisdom mean one hear college president say -- half jokingly of course -- that there be no use appoint a man over thirty to the faculty these day so one hear christian minister in those denomination where the minister be call by the particular church say there be no use try to get another call after one be fifty of course it be not true but it be true enough to be a serious criticism upon we for what other vocation be there where the mellowness that come only from time and long experience from preside at wedding and stand beside open grave share the joy and sorrow of innumerable person be so indispensable as in the pastor the physician of the spirit still we will turn out some wise shy mellow old man just ripen to the point of be the true minister to the soul of other and replace he with a recent graduate of a theological school because the latter can talk the language of the higher criticism or whatever else happen to interest we for the moment obviously we pay the price but think what it indicate of we civilization xvii the dilemma of democracy we have see that the gravest menace of democracy be the fault in mind and character in the multitude selfishness fickleness ignorance irreverence in the people with demagoguery in the leader -- these be the menace of american democracy how then can the people be trust since democracy depend upon trust they this be a old indictment search to the very heart of democracy plato make it of ancient athen while more recently and trenchantly ibsen have make it for all modern society the argument run thus : democracy mean the rule of the majority well there be more fool than wise man in the world more ignorant than intelligent thus the rule of the majority must mean the rule of the fool over the wise man of the ignorant over the intelligent such be the significant indictment and we be compel to admit that we political life be fill with illustration that would seem to substantiate it the ward boss the demagogue and grafter who be give power by the multitude one campaign after another would seem to justify the pessimism of plato and ibsen be there not however a subtle fallacy in the very phrasing of the indictment the majority do not rule : it elect representative who guide that be something entirely different when the worst be say of they those representative of the people be distinctly above the average of the majority elect they take the roll of we president for instance with all the corruption and vulgarity of we national politics that list from washington through such altitude as jefferson and lincoln to the present occupant of the white house be superior to any roster of king or emperor in the history of mankind what do this mean it mean that _ the hope of democracy be the instinctive power in the breast of common humanity to recognize the highest when it appear _ be this not true democracy would be the most hopeless of mistake and the sooner we abandon it with its vulgarity and waste the better it would be for we the instinctive power be there however : to recognize not to live the highest how many have follow the example of socrate remain in prison and accept the hemlock poison for the sake of truth yet all who know of he thrill to he sacrifice of all who have bear the name christian how many have follow consistently the footstep of jesus and obey literally and unvaryingly the precept of the sermon on the mount of the million perhaps ten or twenty individual -- to be generous in we view but _ all the world recognize he _ here then be the hope that take the sting from the indictment of plato ibsen and how many other critic of democracy plato say until philosopher be king city will never have rest from they evil -- no nor the human race as i believe once perhaps once only plato 's dream be realize : in that noblest of philosopher emperor wholly dedicate to the welfare of the world he rule with autocratic power yet the soul of marcus aurelius be burden with a impossible task it be one of the tragic irony of history that in this one realization of plato 's lofty dream the noble emperor could postpone he could not avert the colossal doom that threaten the world he rule so he wrap he roman cloak about he and lay down to sleep with stoic consciousness that he have do he part in the place where zeus have put he but relieve that he might not see the disaster he know must swiftly come how different we dream : it be no illusion of a happy accident of philosopher king we want no arbitrary monarch wise or brutal : from the noblest of emperor to the butcher of berlin we would sweep they all aside to the ash-heap of outworn tool we dream be the awakening and education of the multitude so that the majority will be able and glad to choose as its guide leader and representative the noblest and best when that day come there will be for the first time in the history of mankind the dawn of a true _ aristocracy _ or rule of the best and it will come through the fulfillment of democracy a long and troubled path with many fault and evil meantime yes but not so hopelessly long when one consider the age of slow struggle up the mountain and the swiftly multiply power of education over the mind of all xviii paternalism versus democracy the contrast between paternalism and democracy in aim and method be thus extreme paternalism seek directly organization order production and efficiency incidentally and occasionally the welfare of the subject population democracy seek directly the highest development of all man and woman they freedom happiness and culture in the end it hope this will give social order good government and productive power it be willing meantime to sacrifice some measure of order for freedom of good government for individual initiative of efficiency for life paternalism seek to achieve its aim quickly and effectively through the boss 's whip of social control democracy work by the slower but more permanently hopeful path of education never sacrifice life to material end paternalism end in a social hierarchy materially prosperous but caste-ridden and without soul democracy end in the abolishment of caste equality of opportunity with the freest individual initiative and finest flowering of the personal spirit which shall it be : god or mammon man or machine there be no doubt that efficiency can be achieve most quickly under a well-wielded boss 's whip but at the sacrifice of initiative and invention moreover remove the whip and the efficiency quickly go to piece on the other hand the efficiency achieve by voluntary effort and free cooperation come much more slowly but it last moreover it develop hand in hand with initiative and invention the negro doubtless have never be so generally efficient as before the civil war in the south under the overseer 's whip yet every negro who to-day have character enough to save up and buy a mule and a acre of ground till it with a consistent and permanent effectiveness of which slave labor be never capable in the one case moreover there be the average economic result in the other the gradual development of manhood organize a factory on the feudal line so prevalent in current industry get a strong dominate superintendent and give he autocratic authority quickly he will show result always however there be the danger of strike and if the strong hand falter the organization disintegrate on the other hand let a corporation take its artisan into its confidence give each a small proportionate share in the annual earnings each worker will feel increasingly that the business be he business he will take pride in he accomplishment gradually he will attain efficiency and work permanently without oversight with a consistent earnestness no boss 's whip ever attain the experience of the national cash register company at dayton ohio prove this the experiment of henry ford be a step toward the same solution so in lesser measure be the plan of the steel trust to permit and encourage its employee to purchase annually its stock somewhat below the current market price give a substantial bonus if the stock be hold over ten year if you wish a illustration on a larger scale consider the mass formation tactic of the german soldier in contrast to the individual courage initiative and action of the french there be the two type of efficiency in sheerest contrast but beyond be always the question of they effect on manhood france have save and regenerate she soul but germany -- further the breakdown of paternalistically achieve efficiency have be evident in germany 's utter failure to understand the mind of other people particularly of democracy she have voluminous datum gather by the most atrociously efficient spy system ever develop yet she utterly misread the mind of france england and the united state the same break-down be evident in germany 's failure in colonization in contrast to england 's success for offensive war it must be admit the efficiency under the boss 's whip will go further for defensive war or war for high moral aim it be desirable that the individual soldier should think for himself respond to the high appeal thus for such warfare the efficiency of voluntary effort and cooperation be superior a autocracy would better rule its soldier by a military caste there can be no excuse for such in a democracy thus the utmost possible fraternization of officer and man be desirable and social snobbery the snubbing of officer who come up from the rank and other anachronistic survival should be stamp out as utterly foreign to what should be the spirit of the military arm of democracy further in estimate the two type one must remember that paternalism may exercise its power in secret and that it accomplish much in the dark democracy on the other hand be afflict and bless with pitiless publicity thus its evil be all expose it wash all its dirty linen in public but the main thing be to get it clean when it come to invention and initiative as already indicate democracy have the advantage immediately as in the long run we be the most inventive people on earth and that quality be a direct result of we democratic individualism it be a significant fact that most of the startling invention use in this war be make in america -- but _ develop and apply in germany _ there again be evident the contrasting result of the two type of social organization the indefatigably industrious and docile german mind can work out and apply the invention furnish it with marvelous persistency and effectiveness under paternal control we have the problem of achieve by voluntary effort and cooperation a persistent thoroughness in work out the idea and invention that come to we in such abundant measure the path of democracy be education xix the solution for democracy when we say that the path of democracy be education we do not mean that there be a easy solution of its problem there be no patent medicine we can feed the american people and cure it of its disease there be no specific for the menace that threaten eternal vigilance and effort be the price not only of liberty but of every good of man let thing alone and they get bad to keep they good we must struggle everlastingly to make they better leave the pool of politics unstirred by put into it ever new individual thought and ideal and how quickly it become a stagnant ill-smelling pond leave a church unvitalized by ever fresh personal consecration and how quickly it become a dead form hamper the life of the spirit leave a university uninfluenced by ever new earnestness and devotion on the part of student and teacher and how soon it become a scholastic machine positively oppress the mind and spirit there be a true sense in which the universe exist momentarily by the grace of god take light away and you have darkness take darkness away and you have not necessarily light you might have chaos take health away and you have disease take disease away and you have not necessarily health you may have death take virtue away and you have vice take vice away and you have not necessarily virtue you might have negative respectability thus it be the continual affirmation of the good that keep the heritage of yesterday and take the step toward to-morrow nevertheless if there be no easy solution of the problem there be certain big line of attack if we be right in we diagnosis that the problem of democracy be a problem of education then we whole system of education for child youth and adult should be reconstruct to focus upon the building of positive and effective moral personality american education begin as a subsidiary process child get organic education in the home on the farm in the work shop they go to school to get certain formal discipline to learn to read write and cipher and to acquire formal grammar with the move into the city the industrial revolution and the entire transformation of we life the school have have to take over more and more of the process of organic education if child fail to get such education in the school they be apt to miss it altogether with this entire change in the meaning of the school old notion of its purpose still survive probably no one be so benighted to-day as to imagine that the chief function of the school be to fill the mind with information but there be many who still hold to the tradition that the chief purpose of education be to sharpen the intellectual tool of the individual for the sake of he personal success this notion be a misleading survival for tool be of value only in term of the character use they the same equipment may serve equally good or bad end only as education focuss on the development of positive and effective moral character can it aid in solve the problem of democracy need it be add that this do not mean teaching moral and manners to child thirty minute a day three time a week that be a minor fragment of moral education it mean that all phase of the process -- the relation of pupil and teacher school and home the government and discipline the lesson teach in every subject the environment the proportioning of the curriculum of physical emotional and intellectual culture -- all shall be focus and organize upon the one significant aim of the whole -- _ character _ further if education be to overcome the menace and solve the dilemma of democracy it must be carry beyond childhood and youth and outside the wall of academic institution the ever wider education of adult citizenship be indispensable to the progress and safety of democracy it be one of the glaring illustration of the inefficiency of we democracy that there be still community where school board build school house with public money open they five or six hour five day in the week and refuse to allow they to be open any other hour of the day or night for a civic forum parent ' meeting public lecture or other activity of adult education and yet we call ourselves a practical people surely in a democracy the state be as vitally interested in the education of the adult citizen as of the child herein be the significance of those various extension of education develop and spread so widely to-day university-extension and chautauqua movement civic forum free lecture to the people by board of education and public library summer school night school for adult -- all be illustration of this movement so vital to the progress of democracy through these instrumentality the popular ideal may be elevated the public mind may be train to more logical and earnest thought citizenship may be make more serious and intelligent and finally a most helpful influence may be exert on the academic institution themselves it be a easily verifiable truth that any academic institution that build around itself a enclose scholastic wall refuse to go outside and serve and learn in the larger world of humanity in the long run inevitably die of academic dry rot in the endeavor to solve the problem of democracy can not we do more than we have do hitherto in cultivate reverence for moral leadership -- the quality so much need in democracy at the present hour this may be achieve through many aspect of education but especially through contact with noble soul in literature and history history above all be the great opportunity and from this point of view be it not necessary to rewrite we history : instead of portray solely statesman and warrior to fill they with lofty example of leadership in all walk of life woman as well as man : for surely ideal of both should be foster a colleague interested in this problem recently take one of the most widely use text-book of american history and count the page on which a woman be mention of the five hundred page there be four : not four page devote to woman but four mention a woman what do it mean : that woman have contribute less than one part in a hundred and five to the development of american life surely no one would think that what then be the reason for the discrepancy there be several but one may be mention : man have write the history and they have write chiefly of the two field of action where man have be most important and woman least war and statesmanship surely however if american history be to reveal the american spirit exercise the contagion of noble ideal and develop reverence for true moral leadership it must present type of both manhood and womanhood in all field of action and endeavor one who have stand with socrate in the common criminal prison in athen and watch he drink the hemlock poison say no evil can happen to a good man in life or after death who have hear the oration of paul on mar hill or that of pericle over the athenian dead who have thrill to the heroism of joan of arc and edith cavell the noble service of elizabeth fry and florence nightingale the high appeal of helen hunt jackson and elizabeth barrett browning who have hear giordano bruno exclaim as the flame creep up about he i die a martyr and willingly who have respond to the calm elevation of marcus aurelius the cosmopolitan wisdom of goethe the sweet gentleness of maeterlinck 's spirit and the titan dream of ibsen can scarcely fail to appreciate the brotherhood of all man and to learn that reverence for the true moral leader that dignify alike giver and recipient xx training for moral leadership since the path of democracy be education moral leadership be more necessary to it than in any other form of society yet there be exceptional obstacle to its development we speak of the white light that beat upon a throne : it be nothing compare to the search light play upon every leader of democracy with we lack of reverence we delight in pull to piece the personality of those who lead we thus it be increasingly difficult to get man of sensitive spirit to pay the price of leadership for democracy be it not possible to do more than we have do consciously to develop such leadership where be it train in life the college and university the normal school the school of law medicine and theology yes but if not one boy and girl in ten graduate from the high school surely we want one man and woman in ten to fulfill some measure of moral leadership and the high school be directly concern with the task of furnish such leadership for american democracy if that be true be it not a pity that the high school be so largely dominate from above by the demand of the college upon the enter freshman it be not to be take for grant that the particular regimen of study best fitting the student to pass the entrance examination of a college or university be the best possible for the nine out of ten student who go directly from the high school into the world and must fulfill some measure of moral leadership for american democracy the presumption be to the contrary college professor be human -- some of they they want student prepare to enter as smoothly as possible into the somewhat artificial curriculum of academic study they have arrange the latin professor wish not to go back and start with the rudiment of he subject as the professor of mathematics with the beginning of algebra and geometry the result be they demand of the high school what fit most smoothly into they scheme now if it be not possible to serve equally the need of both group would it not be better to neglect the one tenth of the student go on to college even assume they be the pick of the flock which they be not always they have four more year to correct they mistake and round out they culture if any one must be subordinate it would be better to neglect they and focus upon the need of the nine out of ten who go directly from the high school into life and have not another chance yet there be state in the union where it be possible for a committee of the state university at the top to say to every high school teacher in the state conform to we requirement or leave the state or get out of the profession the threat moreover have be carry out more than once that situation be utterly wrong we want organization of the educational system with each unit cooperate with the next higher but if education be to solve the problem of democracy and furnish moral leadership for american life we want each unit to be free first of all to serve its own constituency to the best of its power the problem be not serious for the big city high school with its multiply elective course but for the small rural or town high school with its limited corps of teacher and its necessarily fix course the burden be onerous indeed be the american college and university do all that it might do in cultivate moral leadership for american democracy the last decade have see a astounding and unparalleled development of higher education in america in the old day the college be usually on a denominational foundation it be support by the dollar and penny of earnest religionist who believe that education be necessary to religion and morality the president be generally a clergyman of the denomination he teach the ethic course and all student be require to take it there be compulsory chapel attendance and once a day the entire student body gather together to listen to some moral and religious thought then come the immense expansion of higher education course be multiply and diversify university be establish or endow by the state academy become college and college university institution be generally secularize compulsory chapel attendance be rightly abandon each department serve its own interest apart until to-day certain of we great university be not unlike vast intellectual department store with each professor call he goods across the counter and the president a sort of superior floorwalker to see that no one clerk get too many customer it be a impressive illustration of what have happen to we higher institution that in certain of they the one regular meeting place of the entire student body in a common interest be the bleacher by the athletic field one continue to believe in college athletics in spite of the frequent absurdity and worse do in they name only if the number of those play the game and those exercise only they lung and throat from the bleacher be reverse better all-round athletic education would result be it not however a trenchant criticism on the situation in we higher education that so often the one common interest should be in something that be at least aside from the main business of the institution moreover no institution can rightly serve democracy unless it be itself democratic thus the growth of a aristocratic spirit in we college and university be a ominous sign for instance it be still true that any boy or girl with a sound body and a good mind and no family to support can get a college education money be not indispensable : it be possible to work one 's way through will this always be true one wonder it be significant that it be easiest to work you way through college and keep you self-respect and the respect of you fellow in the small meagerly endowed college on the frontier it be most difficult with a few exception one gladly recognize in the great rich university of the east what do that mean straw show the tide : it be announce some time ago by the president of one of we richest and oldest university that henceforth scholarship in that institution would be give solely on the basis of intellectual scholarship as test by examination and applause go up from the alumnus all across the country yet what do it mean it mean that the boy who have to work on a threshing machine sell book to a unsuspecting public or do some other semi-honorable work all summer to get back into college in the fall can not pass those examination equally with a rich man 's son of equal mind who can take a tutor to the seashore or the mountain and coach up all summer thus foundation establish by well-meaning people to help poor boy self-respectingly through college become intellectual prize for those who do not need they that be all wrong take the special student problem when a college or university be found it need student : they be the life-blood of the institution really all that be need to make a college be a teacher and some student : building be not indispensable but student the school must have thus it be apt to keep its bar down and its entrance requirement flexible special student often mature man and woman who be not prepare to pass the freshman examination be admit on the recommendation of head of d epartment to special course they be well fit to take student be admit freely and then sift out afterward if they prove unworthy of they opportunity : not a bad method by the way a dozen year pass and the institution want to become respectable it be just as with the individual : the man at first be absorb in money-getting and when he have it yearn for respectability now get respectable for a college or university be call raise the standard of scholarship let this not be misunderstand : painstaking infinitely laborious accurate scholarship be a noble aim well worth the consistent effort of a lifetime but there be two side to raise the standard of scholarship do a educational institution exist for the sake of its reputation or to serve its constituency if it seek to advance its reputation at the expense of its fullest and best service to those who need its help be it not recreant to its duty and opportunity well in the mood cite the institution raise and standardize its entrance-requirement and generally exclude special student one readily see why : it be much easier to work with the regularly prepared freshman he fit much more smoothly and comfortably into the machinery of the institution many a wise teacher will admit nevertheless that the best student he ever teach and the one whose life he be proudest of have influence be often man and woman thirty forty fifty year of age -- teacher who suddenly realize that the rut of they call have become so deep they could no longer see over they minister awaken to the fact that they have give all they store and must get a new supply business man aware of a call to another field of action -- work with a consistent earnestness the average fledgling freshman can not imagine -- he be not old enough yet generally the tendency be to exclude such student unless they will go back and do the arduous and often for they useless work of prepare to pass the examination for entrance to the freshman class that too be all wrong the american college and university stand to-day at the parting of the way : this generation will largely determine its future if the american college and university ever become a social club for the son and daughter of the rich a institution make it easy for they to secure business and professional opportunity and advancement to the exclusion of they poorer fellow it may be as necessary to disestablish the foundation of we great university as statesman in europe think it necessary to disestablish the monastic foundation at the close of the middle age they too begin as educational institution if on the other hand the american college and university remain true to its task if it keep its door open and its spirit democratic if it seek to render ever larger service to the great public and to develop moral leadership for american democracy then indeed it will go ever forward upon its noble path xxi democracy and sacrifice we have see the conflict of idea in the war : the german philosophy that man exist for the state the contrasting idea of democracy that the state exist for man we may well ask why any institution should be regard as sacred except as it have the adventitious sacredness come from time convention and hoary tradition it be say long ago that the sabbath be make for man and not man for the sabbath and the statement may be universalized every institution on earth -- marriage the family education the church the state -- be make for man and not man for the institution humanity must always be the end why should we perpetuate any institution that do not serve life kant voice the principle in he second imperative of duty : always treat humanity whether in thine own person or that of any other as a end withal and never as a means only kant be a prussian philosopher : one wonder what he would have think of the kanonen-futter theory of manhood a organization or institution be only a machine a instrument for a purpose thus always it be a means never a end : its value lie in serve its purpose -- the end of human life so the whole exist order must justify itself where it rest on form of injustice it must be break or destroy and there be no reason to fear the break thus there be no divine right of king they represent a vested interest survive from the past they must justify themselves by the service of those under they or pass similarly there be no divine right of a class or caste enjoy supremacy or special privilege it also be a survive vested interest that must justify itself or be sweep aside as a incubus the same test apply to a empire it too be a vested interest develop out of condition prevail in the past if it do not justify itself by the largest service of all within it then it too be a anachronistic survival no longer to be tolerate the principle be universal : the institution of private property the control power of captain of industry the capitalistic system finally the state itself in every form : all be vested interest that may be permit to continue in the exercise of power only as they prove they superiority to any other form of organization in serve the good of all this do not mean that under democracy the individual shall fail of sacrifice and the dedication to something higher than himself that be the glory of life transfigure human nature and without it life sink to sordid selfishness you life be worth not what you have but what you be and what you be be determine by that to which you dedicate yourself be it creature comfort pleasure selfish privilege or the largest life and the fullest service of humanity what you have be merely the condition the important question be what do you do with it be it wealth prosperity : do you sit down comfortably on the fact of it to secure all the selfish pleasure possible or do you regard you fortunate circumstance as so much more opportunity and obligation of leadership and service be it poverty even starvation : do you whine and grovel or stand erect with shut tooth andwr heroic manhood from the breast of suffer that be why peace can never be a end : it too be merely a condition or mean the question be what do you do with you peace for peace may mean merely sloth and cowardly ease where war may mean unselfish heroism that be what the peace promoter forget war have its brutality and terrible indeed they be : unleash hate lust cruelty and revenge but war have its heroism it call out the devotion to something higher than the individual from even the commonest of man to-day all over the earth ordinary man be quietly go out to probable death or mutilation in its most horrible form and go for the sake of a ideal larger than themselves woman be do even more than that for it be not so hard to die but to send out those you love dearer than life itself to almost certain death -- that indeed be difficult and woman be do it everywhere with a smile on they lip and choked-back tear peace on the other hand have its virtue : the softening and refining of life gradual development of sympathy achievement of comfort and beauty but peace have its vice in time of peace and prosperity there seem to be no great cause at stake of course always it be there but we do not see it we become increasingly absorb in selfish interest in the good of we immediate family thus petty time-serving selfishness be the vice peculiarly characteristic of time of peace and prosperity consider for instance the spirit of france during the closing year of the nineteenth century and at the present dark but pregnant hour of destiny thus the question be not whether you have peace or war but what you do with you peace or war it be not whether you be rich or poor but what you do with you riches or poverty suppose we be able to reconstruct we entire social and industrial world so that every human be would have plenty to eat plenty to wear and a comfortable house to live in : would we have the kingdom of heaven not necessarily : we might have merely a comfortable well-decorated pig-sty if man live to nothing higher than pig man can not live by bread alone important as bread be but by dedication to the thing of the spirit thus there must ever be the capacity for self-forgetfulness self-sacrifice the dedication of life to supreme aim but that do not mean the dedication of man to the institution rather it be the consecration to the welfare of humanity man for the state mean autocracy and imperialism man for mankind be the soul of democracy that be the ideal to which we must rise if democracy be to prove itself worthy to be the form of human society for the great future this ideal be realize through many lesser form and instrument but always with the same final test the family for instance be one of these lesser form and the subordination of the individual to the family unit be just thus there be a measure of right in seek first the interest of the family group but when this be seek to the end of special privilege and debauch luxury against the welfare of all it become as we have see a evil there be similarly a certain justice in the subordination of the individual to the social class or group interest it be right that artisan should unite in trade union that employer should get together in association for common benefit one need only contrast the condition where each workman have to bid in competition against all other and each manufacturer the same to realize the advance make through group union and cooperation when either group however seek to further its own interest at the expense of the welfare of the whole society as in secure class legislation achieve monopoly hold efficient worker to the level of production of the slowest and least capable of the group then the class or group spirit become a evil that must be fight for the good of all it be exactly the same with the nation its interest be justly serve only in harmony with the welfare of humanity any current problem will illustrate the principle as for instance that of immigration certainly the nation have the right to prohibit immigration which produce unassimilated plague-spot and threaten to cause racial deterioration as in phase of oriental immigration to the pacific coast similarly it be right to restrict immigration that would further economic prosperity at the expense of the manhood of the nation we must answer the question whether we want factory or man it be desirable to have some of both of course but when one be to be obtain at the expense of the other it be manhood that must be the decide end on the other hand when it come to refuse a refuge to the poor and oppressed who be physically and morally acceptable but lack a small amount of money or be unable to respond to a literary test then the welfare of humanity demand the opposite decision better give they the fifty dollar -- a healthy slave be worth more than that in the old day so teach they to read and write the nation can readily pay the small economic price and accept the incidental difficulty for the sake of the larger end thus the decide principle must always be the welfare happiness growth intelligence helpfulness of each individual in harmony with all other humanity be incarnatein each man while therefore the individual must dedicate and at time sacrifice himself it be for the sake not of the state church or other institution but for the welfare of all -- _ man for mankind _ from so many source the view find expression that modern life have be weaken by humanitarianism if there be truth in the view we would better take account of it and radically revise we ethical philosophy if it be false it be a damning error the reiteration of which tend to undermine all that have be achieve for the spirit a interesting comment on the view be the fact that in spite of all its horror this war have give _ no attest instance of arrant cowardice on any front _ cruelty lust brutality hate : these have appear in unspeakable guise but apparently no cowardice or weak timidity yet the mail clad hero of ancient war who meet they adversary face to face be subject to no such strain as the man stand in trench wait momentarily death or mutilation from a unseen foe no modern life have not lose strong fiber and be capable of supreme heroism the old society secure its leadership through _ noblesse oblige _ -- the obligation of nobility man of aristocratic family and rank feel that because they stand above the people they owe a certain leadership and service and they give it often in abundant measure but always condescendingly from above we have lose noblesse oblige : we may even be glad it be go if we can substitute for it something larger and better it be not the obligation of nobility but the obligation of humanity that be the need : to realize that all power be obligation as you can you owe and as you know you owe if you have money it be so much obligation of leadership and service if you have talent education social or political influence it be all so much obligation of leadership and service if as individual we can generally realize that and act upon it then indeed we may hope to carry to successful completion the experiment of democracy and see we beloved country fulfill the measure of moral leadership to which we believe she be call among the nation of the earth but fulfil it not as master over slave nor as one empire among other but as a more experienced brother toward other follow the same open path xxii the hour of sacrifice the supreme world crisis be on we have enter the war in the purest spirit of democracy we state frankly in advance that we want no indemnity no extension of territory we war with no people except as that people identify itself with aggressive autocracy and imperialism imperil we safety as of all democracy and seek to ride tyrannically and unjustly over the rights and liberty of other people thus we enter the war solely for the cause of democracy and humanity the hour of sacrifice have strike for the american people : will it rise to the test when one consider the characteristic of we surface life for recent decade -- the devotion to money-get the rapid increase of senseless and debauching luxury the reckless frivolity the unthinking haste and selfish pleasure-seeking -- one question underneath however be a tremendous latent idealism we be young enthusiastic capable of glorious consecration cynical disillusionment be all upon the surface -- the cult of the clique of cleverness uproot from the soil of common life and the deep of the eternal verity beneath in the great mass of the people be profound faith in life deep trust in the ideal belief in the great future of humanity democracy will justify itself we shall rise to the test but how we need to hear and heed the call awake america mean american awake for in democracy the individual be the soul on each person rest the responsibility let we accept the bitter burden and meet the supreme test give time money service life and those we love better than life for the sake of the safer freer nobler world that be to be since we stand apart so long and enter the horrible devastation so late it be we privilege to do all we can to save the spiritual heritage of humanity to keep we heart clean from the corrosive acid of national and racial hatred to do all in we power to remove it from the breast of other injustice in high place be possible only because there be injustice in the heart of man to overthrow tyranny be but the initial step of emancipation : unless the tyrant hate in the heart be dethrone the external tyrant in some form of social injustice will surely return he who conquer hate and the lust for revenge in he own breast be spiritually free and master of the tyrant that wrong he thus it be we privilege and duty to hate no one but to hate injustice greed tyranny aggressive selfishness the wicked ambition of autocratic imperialism to resist and help to overthrow they and so do we part in bring in the free brotherhood of the nation and people in one humanity that will be the dawn of the longed-for era of universal and permanent peace for mankind end of project gutenberg 's the soul of democracy by edward howard grigg
