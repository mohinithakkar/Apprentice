have become humiliating the supposition of such illegal violence on the part of m loui bonaparte vanish upon serious consideration the great question of the day be manifestly the devincq election it be clear that the government be only thinking of that matter as to a conspiracy against the republic and against the people how could any one premeditate such a plot where be the man capable of entertain such a dream for a tragedy there must be a actor and here assuredly the actor be want to outrage right to suppress the assembly to abolish the constitution to strangle the republic to overthrow the nation to sully the flag to dishonor the army to suborn the clergy and the magistracy to succeed to triumph to govern to administer to exile to banish to transport to ruin to assassinate to reign with such complicity that the law at last resemble a foul bed of corruption what all these enormity be to be commit and by whom by a colossus no by a dwarf people laugh at the notion they no longer say what a crime but what a farce for after all they reflect heinous crime require stature certain crime be too lofty for certain hand a man who would achieve a 18th brumaire must have arcolum in he past and austerlitz in he future the art of become a great scoundrel be not accord to the first comer people say to themselves who be this son of hortense he have strasbourg behind he instead of arcolum and boulogne in place of austerlitz he be a frenchman bear a dutchman and naturalized a swiss he be a bonaparte cross with a verhuell he be only celebrate for the ludicrousness of he imperial attitude and he who would pluck a feather from he eagle would risk find a goose 's quill in he hand this bonaparte do not pass currency in the array he be a counterfeit image less of gold than of lead and assuredly french soldier will not give we the change for this false napoleon in rebellion in atrocity in massacre in outrage in treason if he should attempt roguery it would miscarry not a regiment would stir besides why should he make such a attempt doubtless he have he suspicious side but why suppose he a absolute villain such extreme outrage be beyond he he be incapable of they physically why judge he capable of they morally have he not pledge honor have he not say no one in europe doubt my word let we fear nothing to this could be answer crime be commit either on a grand or on a mean scale in the first category there be caesar in the second there be mandrin caesar pass the rubicon mandrin bestride the gutter but wise man interpose be we not prejudice by offensive conjecture this man have be exile and unfortunate exile enlighten misfortune correct for he part loui bonaparte protest energetically fact abound in he favor why should he not act in good faith he have make remarkable promise towards the end of October 1848 then a candidate for the presidency he be call at no 37 rue de la tour d'auvergne on a certain personage to whom he remark i wish to have a explanation with you they slander I do i give you the impression of a madman they think that i wish to revivify napoleon there be two man whom a great ambition can take for its model napoleon and washington the one be a man of genius the other be a man of virtue it be ridiculous to say ' i will be a man of genius ' it be honest to say ' i will be a man of virtue ' which of these depend upon ourselves which can we accomplish by we will to be genius no to be probity yes the attainment of genius be not possible the attainment of probity be a possibility and what could i revive of napoleon one sole thing -- a crime truly a worthy ambition why should i be consider man the republic be establish i be not a great man i shall not copy napoleon but i be a honest man i shall imitate washington my name the name of bonaparte will be inscribe on two page of the history of france : on the first there will be crime and glory on the second probity and honor and the second will perhaps be worth the first why because if napoleon be the greater washington be the better man between the guilty hero and the good citizen i choose the good citizen such be my ambition from 1848 to 1851 three year elapsed people have long suspect loui bonaparte but long-continued suspicion blunt the intellect and wear itself out by fruitless alarm loui bonaparte have have dissimulate minister such as magne and rouher but he have also have straightforward minister such as léon faucher and odilon barrot and these last have affirm that he be upright and sincere he have be see to beat he breast before the door

house usher I into a drawing-room michel de bourge and alexander rey be there the latter a ex-constituent a eloquent writer a brave man at that time alexander rey edit the _ national _ we shake hand michel say to I -- hugo what will you do i answer he -- everything that also be my opinion say he numerous representative arrive and amongst other pierre lefranc labrousse théodore bac noël parfait arnauld -lrb- de l'ariége -rrb- demosthene ollivier a ex-constituent and charamaule there be deep and unutterable indignation but no useless word be speak all be imbue with that manly anger whence issue great resolution they talk they set forth the situation each bring forward the news which he have learn théodore bac come from léon faucher who live in the rue blanche it be he who have awaken léon faucher and have announce the news to he the first word of léon faucher be it be a infamous deed from the first moment charamaule display a courage which during the four day of the struggle never flag for a single instant charamaule be a very tall man possess of vigorous feature and convincing eloquence he vote with the left but sit with the right in the assembly he be the neighbor of montalembert and of riancey he sometimes have warm dispute with they which we watch from afar off and which amuse we charamaule have come to the meeting at no 70 dress in a sort of blue cloth military cloak and arm as we find out later on the situation be grave sixteen representative arrest all the general of the assembly and he who be more than a general charra all the journal suppress all the printing office occupy by soldier on the side of bonaparte a army of 80000 man which could be double in a few hour on we side nothing the people deceive and moreover disarm the telegraph at they command all the wall cover with they placard and at we disposal not a single printing case not one sheet of paper no means of raise the protest no means of begin the combat the _ coup d'état _ be clothe with mail the republic be naked the _ coup d'état _ have a speak trumpet the republic wear a gag what be to be do the raid against the republic against the assembly against right against law against progress against civilization be command by african general these hero have just prove that they be coward they have take they precaution well fear alone can engender so much skill they have arrest all the man of war of the assembly and all the man of action of the left baune charle lagrange miot valentin nadaud cholat add to this that all the possible chief of the barricade be in prison the organizer of the ambuscade have carefully leave at liberty jule favre michel de bourge and myself judge we to be less man of action than of the tribune wish to leave the left man capable of resistance but incapable of victory hope to dishonor we if we do not fight and to shoot we if we do fight nevertheless no one hesitate the deliberation begin other representative arrive every minute edgar quinet doutre pelletier cassal bruckner baudin chauffor the room be full some be seat most be stand in confusion but without tumult i be the first to speak i say that the struggle ought to be begin at once blow for blow that it be my opinion that the hundred and fifty representative of the left should put on they scarf of office should march in procession through the street and the boulevard as far as the madeleine and cry vive la république vive la constitution should appear before the troops and alone calm and unarmed should summon might to obey right if the soldier yield they should go to the assembly and make a end of loui bonaparte if the soldier fire upon they legislator they should disperse throughout paris cry to arm and resort to barricade resistance should be begin constitutionally and if that fail should be continue revolutionarily there be no time to be lose high treason say i should be seize red-handed be a great mistake to suffer such a outrage to be accept by the hour as they elapse each minute which pass be a accomplice and endorse the crime beware of that calamity call a ` accomplished fact ' to arm many warmly support this advice among other edgar quinet pelletier and doutre michel de bourge seriously object my instinct be to begin at once he advice be to wait and see accord to he there be danger in hasten the catastrophe the _ coup d'état _ be organize and the people be not they have be take unawares we must not indulge in illusion the mass could not stir yet perfect calm reign in the faubourg surprise exist yes anger no the people of pari although so intelligent do not understand michel add we be not in 1830 charle x in turn out the 221 expose himself to this blow the re-election of the 221 we be not in the same situation the 221 be popular the present assembly be not : a chamber which have be insultingly dissolve be always sure to conquer if the people support it thus the people rise in 1830 to-day they wait they be dupe until they shall be victim michel de bourge conclude the people must be give time to understand to grow angry to rise as for we representative we should be rash to precipitate the situation if we be to march immediately straight upon the troops we should only be shoot to no purpose and the glorious insurrection for right would thus be beforehand deprive of its natural leader -- the representative of the people we should decapitate the popular army temporary delay on the contrary would be beneficial too much zeal must be guard against self-restraint be necessary to give way would be to lose the battle before have begin it thus for example we must not attend the meeting announce by the right for noon all those who go there would be arrest we must remain free we must remain in readiness we must remain calm and must act wait the advent of the people four day of this agitation without fight would weary the army michel however advise a beginning but simply by placard article 68 of the constitution but where should a printer be find michel de bourge speak with a experience of revolutionary procedure which be want in I for many year past he have acquire a certain practical knowledge of the mass he council be wise it must be add that all the information which come to we second he and appear conclusive against I pari be deject the army of the _ coup d'état _ invade she peaceably even the placard be not tear down nearly all the representative present even the most daring agree with michel 's counsel to wait and see what would happen at night say they the agitation will begin and they conclude like michel de bourge that the people must be give time to understand there would be a risk of be alone in too hasty a beginning we should not carry the people with we in the first moment let we leave the indignation to increase little by little in they heart if it be begin prematurely we manifestation would miscarry these be the sentiment of all for myself while listen to they i feel shake perhaps they be right it would be a mistake to give the signal for the combat in vain what good be the lightning which be not follow by the thunderbolt to raise a voice to give vent to a cry to find a printer there be the first question but be there still a free press the brave old ex-chief of the 6th legion colonel forestier come in he take michel de bourge and myself aside listen say he to we i come to you i have be dismiss i no longer command my legion but appoint I in the name of the left colonel of the 6th sign I a order and i will go at once and call they to arm in a hour the regiment will be on foot colonel answer i i will do more than sign a order i will accompany you and i turn towards charamaule who have a carriage in wait come with we say i forestier be sure of two major of the 6th we decide to drive to they at once while michel and the other representative should await we at bonvalet 's in the boulevard du temple near the café turc there they could consult together we start we traverse paris where people be already begin to swarm in a threatening manner the boulevard be throng with a uneasy crowd people walk to and fro passer-by accost each other without any previous acquaintance a noteworthy sign of public anxiety and group talk in loud voice at the corner of the street the shop be be shut come this look better cry charamaule he have be wander about the town since the morning and he have notice with sadness the apathy of the mass we find the two major at home upon whom colonel forestier count they be two rich linendraper who receive we with some embarrassment the shopman have gather together at the window and watch we pass by it be mere curiosity in the meanwhile one of the two major countermand a journey which he be go to undertake on that day and promise we he co-operation but add he do not deceive yourselve one can foresee that we shall be cut to piece few man will march out colonel forestier say to we watrin the present colonel of the 6th do not care for fight perhaps he will resign I the command amicably i will go and find he alone so as to startle he the less and will join you at bonvalet 's near the porte st martin we leave we carriage and charamaule and myself proceed along the boulevard on foot in order to observe the group more closely and more easily to judge the aspect of the crowd the recent levelling of the road have convert the boulevard of the porte st martin into a deep cut command by two embankment on the summit of these embankment be the footway furnish with railing the carriage drive along the cut the foot passenger walk along the footway just as we reach the boulevard a long column of infantry file into this ravine with drummer at they head the thick wave of bayonet fill the square of st martin and lose themselves in the depths of the boulevard bonne nouvelle a enormous and compact crowd cover the two pavement of the boulevard st martin large number of workman in they blouse be there lean upon the railing at the moment when the head of the column enter the defile before the theater of the porte st martin a tremendous shout of vive la république come forth from every mouth as though shout by one man the soldier continue to advance in silence but it might have be say that they pace slacken and many of they regard the crowd with a air of indecision what do this cry of vive la république mean be it a token of applause be it a shout of defiance it seem to I at that moment that the republic raise its brow and that the _ coup d'état _ hang its head meanwhile charamaule say to I you be recognize in fact near the château d'eau the crowd surround I some young man cry out vive victor hugo one of they ask I citizen victor hugo what ought we to do i answer tear down the seditious placard of the _ coup d'état _ and cry ` vive la constitution ' and suppose they fire on we say a young workman you will hasten to arm bravo shout the crowd i add loui bonaparte be a rebel he have steep himself to-day in every crime we representative of the people declare he a outlaw but there be no need for we declaration since he be a outlaw by the mere fact of he treason citizen you have two hand take in one you right and in the other you gun and fall upon bonaparte bravo bravo again shout the people a tradesman who be shut up he shop say to I do not speak so loud if they hear you talk like that they would shoot you well then i reply you would parade my body and my death would be a boon if the justice of god could result from it all shout long live victor hugo shout ` long live the constitution ' say i a great cry of vive la constitution vive la république come forth from every breast enthusiasm indignation anger flash in the face of all i think then and i still think that this perhaps be the supreme moment i be tempt to carry off all that crowd and to begin the battle charamaule restrain I he whisper to I -- you will bring about a useless fusillade every one be unarmed the infantry be only two pace from we and see here come the artillery i look round in truth several piece of cannon emerge at a quick trot from the rue de bondy behind

not succeed in find it each one regret to himself the choice of the room they wish to hide the high court they have succeed too well it be grievous to think that perhaps when the police and the armed force should arrive matter would have go too far and the high court would be too deeply compromise they have appoint a recorder now they must organize a court a second step more serious than the first the judge delay hope that fortune would end by decide on one side or the other either for the assembly or for the president either against the _ coup d'état _ or for it and that there might thus be a vanquished party so that the high court could then with all safety lay its hand upon somebody they lengthily argue the question whether they should immediately decree the accusation of the president or whether they should draw up a simple order of inquiry the latter course be adopt they draw up a judgment not the honest and outspoken judgment which be placard by the effort of the representative of the left and publish in which be find these word of bad taste _ crime _ and _ high treason _ this judgment a weapon of war have never exist otherwise than as a projectile wisdom in a judge sometimes consist in draw up a judgment which be not one one of those judgment which have no binding force in which everything be conditional in which no one be incriminate and nothing be call by its right name there be species of intermediate course which allow of wait and see in delicate crisis man who be in earnest must not inconsiderately mingle with possible event that bluntness which be call justice the high court take advantage of this it draw up a prudent judgment this judgment be not know it be publish here for the first time here it be it be a masterpiece of equivocal style : -- extract from the registry of the high court of justice the high court of justice accord to article 68 of the constitution consider that print placard begin with these word ` the president of the republic ' and end with the signature ` loui napoléon bonaparte ' and ` de morny minister of the interior ' the say placard ordain amongst other measure the dissolution of the national assembly have be post to-day on the wall of pari that this fact of the dissolution of the national assembly by the president of the republic would be of the nature to constitute the case provide for by article 68 of the constitution and render in the term of the aforesaid article the meeting of the high court indispensable it be declare that the high court of justice be organize that it appoint -lrb- 4 -rrb- to fulfil with it the function of the public ministry that m bernard the recorder of the court of cassation should fulfil the duty of recorder and in order to proceed further accord to the term of the aforesaid article 68 of the constitution the court will adjourn until to-morrow the 3d of December at noon draw up and discuss in the council chamber where be sit mm hardouin president pataille moreau delapalme and cauchy judge December 2 1851 the two assistant mm grandet and quesnault offer to sign the decree but the president rule that it would be more correct only to accept the signature of the

have be draw up by a part of the assembly one of the judge who have go out during the debate bring back this rumor to he colleague this coincide with a outburst of energy the president observe that it would be to the purpose to appoint a procureur-general there be a difficulty whom should they appoint in all precede trial they have always choose for a procureur-general at the high court the procureur-general at the court of appeal of paris why should they introduce a innovation they determine upon this procureur-general of the court of appeal this procureur-general be at the time m de royer who have be keeper of the seal for m bonaparte thence a new difficulty and a long debate would m de royer consent m hardouin undertake to go and make the offer to he he have only to cross the mercière gallery m de royer be in he study the proposal greatly embarrass he he remain speechless from the shock to accept be serious to refuse be still more serious there be risk of treason on the 2d December a hour after noon the _ coup d'état _ be still a crime m de royer not know whether the high treason would succeed venture to stigmatize the deed as such in private and cast down he eye with a noble shame before this violation of the law which three month later numerous purple robe include he own endorse with they oath but he indignation do not go to the extent of support the indictment a indictment speak aloud m de royer as yet only murmur he be perplexed m hardouin understand this state of conscience persistence would have be unreasonable he withdraw he return to the room where he colleague be await he in the meantime the commissary of the arsenal police have come back he have end by succeed in unearth -- such be he expression -- the high court he penetrate as far as the council chamber of the civil chamber at that moment he have still no other escort than the few police agent of the morning a boy be pass by the commissary ask he the whereabouts of the high court the

say that he be only accompany at that time by a few police agent the high court be in truth in session the president be relate to the judge he visit to the procureur general suddenly a tumultuous sound of footstep be hear in the lobby which lead from the council chamber to the room where they be deliberate the door open abruptly bayonet appear and in the midst of the bayonet a man in a buttoned-up overcoat with a tricolored sash upon he coat the magistrate stare stupefied gentleman say the man dissolve you meeting immediately president hardouin rise what do this mean who be you be you aware to whom you be speak i be aware you be the high court and i be the commissary of the police well then be off there be there thirty-five municipal guard command by a lieutenant and with a drum at they head but -- say the president the commissary interrupt he with these word which be literally give -- mr president i be not go to enter upon a oratorical combat with you i have my order and i transmit they to you obey whom the prefect of police the president ask this strange question which imply the acceptance of a order -- have you a warrant the commissary answer -- yes and he hand

some mistake these be not we name mm béranger rocher and de boissieux have serve they time and be no longer judge of the high court as for m hello he be dead the high court in reality be temporary and renewable the _ coup d'état _ overthrow the constitution but do not understand it the warrant sign maupa be applicable to the precede high court the _ coup d'état _ have be mislead by a old list such be the heedlessness of assassin mr commissary of police continue the president you see that these name be not ours that do not matter to I reply the commissary whether this warrant do or do not apply to you disperse or i shall arrest all of you and he add -- at once the judge be silence one of they pick up from the table a loose sheet of paper which be the judgment they have draw up and put the paper in he pocket then they go away the commissary point to the door where the bayonet be and say -- that way they go out by the lobby between two rank of soldier the detachment of republican guard escort they as far as the st loui gallery there they set they free they head bow down it be about three o'clock while these event be take place in the library close by in the former great chamber of the parliament the court of cassation be sit in judgment as usual without notice what be happen so near at hand it would appear then that the police exhale no odor let we at once have do with this high court in the evening at half-past seven the seven judge meet together at the house of one of they number he who have take away the decree they frame a official report draw up a protest and recognize the necessity of fill in the line leave blank in they decree on the proposition of m quesnault appoint as procureur-general m renouard they colleague at the court of cessation m renouard who be immediately inform consent they meet together for the last time on the next day the 3d at eleven o'clock in the morning a hour before the time mention in the judgment which we have read above -- again in the library of the court of cassation m renouard be present a official minute be give to he record he appointment as well as certain detail with which he ask to be supply the judgment which have be draw up be take by m quesnault to the recorder 's office and immediately enter upon the register of the secret deliberation of the court of cassation the high court not have a special register and have decide from its creation to use the register of the court of cassation after the decree they also transcribe the two document describe as follow on the register : -- i a official report record the interference of the police during the discussion upon the precede decree ii a minute of the appointment of m renouard to the office of procureur-general in addition seven copy of these different document draw up by the hand of the judge themselves and sign by they all be put in a place of safety as also it be say a note-book in which be write five other secret decision relate to the _ coup d'état _ do this page of the register of the court of cassation exist at the present time be it true as have be state that the prefect maupa send for the register and tear out the leaf contain the decree we have not be able to clear up this point the register now be show to no one and those employ at the recorder 's office be dumb such be the fact let we summarize they if this court so call high have be of a character to conceive such a idea as that of do its duty -- when it have once meet together the mere organization of itself be a matter of a few minute -- it would have proceed resolutely and rapidly it would have appoint as procureur-general some energetic man belong to the court of cassation either from the body of magistrate such as freslon or from the bar like martin -lrb- of strasbourg -rrb- by virtue of article 68 and without wait the initiative of the assembly it would have draw up a judgment stigmatize the crime it would have launch a order of arrest against the president and he accomplice and have order the removal of the person of loui bonaparte to jail as for the procureur-general he would have issue a warrant of arrest all this could have be do by half-past eleven and at that time no attempt have be make to dissolve the high court these preliminary proceedings conclude the high court by go out through a nailed-up door lead into the salle des pas perdus could have descend into the street and there have proclaim its judgment to the people at this time it would have meet with no hindrance finally and this in any case it should have sit robe on the judge ' bench with all magisterial state and when the police agent and he soldier appear should have order the soldier who perhaps would have obey they to arrest the agent and if the soldier have disobey should have allow themselves to be formally drag to prison so that the people could see under they own eye out in the open street the filthy hoof of the _ coup d'état _ trample upon the robe of justice instead of this what step do the high court take we have just see be off with you we be go we can imagine after a very different fashion the dialogue between mathieu molé and vidocq -lrb- 4 -rrb- this line be leave blank it be fill in later on with the name of m renouard councillor of the court of cassation chapter xii the mairie of the tenth arrondissement the representative have come out from m daru rejoin each other and assemble in the street there they consult briefly from group to group there be a large number of they in less than a hour by send notice to the house on the left bank of the seine alone on account of the extreme urgency more than three hundred member could be call together but where should they meet at lemardelay 's the rue richelieu be guard at the salle martel it be a long way off they rely upon the tenth legion of which general lauriston be colonel they show a preference for the mairie of the tenth arrondissement besides the distance be short and there be no need to cross any bridge they form themselves into column and set forth m daru as we have say live in the rue de lille close by the assembly the section of the rue de lille lie between he house and the palais bourbon be occupy by infantry the last detachment bar he door but it only bar it on the right not on the leave the representative on quit m daru bent they step on the side of the rue des saints-pères and leave the soldier behind they at that moment the soldier have only be instruct to prevent they meeting in the palace of the assembly they could quietly form themselves into a column in the street and set forth if they have turn to the right instead of to the leave they would have be oppose but there be no order for the other alternative they pass through a gap in the instruction a hour afterwards this throw st arnaud into a fit of fury on they way fresh representative come up and swell the column as the member of the right live for the most part in the faubourg st germain the column be compose almost entirely of man belong to the majority at the corner of the quaus d'orsay they meet a group of member of the left who have reunite after they exit from the palace of the assembly and who be consult together there be the representative esquiro marc dufraisse victor hennequin colfavru and chamiot those who be march at the head of the column leave they place go up to the group and say come with we where be you go ask marc dufraisse to the mairie of the tenth arrondissement what do you intend to do there to decree the deposition of loui bonaparte and afterwards afterwards we shall go in a body to the palace of the assembly we will force we way in spite of all resistance and from the top of the step we will read out the decree of deposition to the soldier very good we will join you say mare dufraisse the five member of the left march at some distance from the column several of they friend who be mingle with the member of the right rejoin they and we may here mention a fact without give it more importance than it possess namely that the two fraction of the assembly represent in this unpremeditated gathering march towards the mairie without be mingle together one on each side of the street it chance that the man of the majority keep on the right side of the street and the man of the minority on the leave no one have a scarf of office no outward token cause they to be recognize the passer-by stare at they with surprise and do not understand what be the meaning of this procession of silent man through the solitary street of the faubourg st germain one district of pari be as yet unaware of the _ coup d'état _ strategically speak from a defensive point of view the mairie of the tenth arrondissement be badly choose situate in a narrow street in that short section of the rue de grenelle-st-germain which lie between the rue des saints-pères and the rue du sépulcre close by the cross-road of the croix-rouge where the troops could arrive from so many different point the mairie of the tenth arrondissement confine command and blockade on every side be a pitiful citadel for the assail national representation it be true that they no longer have the choice of a citadel any more than later on they have the choice of a general they arrival at the mairie might have seem a good omen the great gate which lead into a square courtyard be shut it open the post of the national guard compose of some twenty man take up they arm and render military honor to the assembly the representative enter a deputy mayor receive they with respect on the threshold of the mairie the palace of the assembly be close by the troops say the representative we have come to deliberate here the deputy mayor lead they to the first story and admit they to the great municipal hall the national guard cry long live the national assembly the representative have enter the door be shut a crowd begin to gather in the street and shout long live the assembly a certain number of stranger to the assembly enter the mairie at the same time as the representative overcrowding be fear and two sentry be place at a little side-door which be leave open with order only to allow member of the assembly who might come afterwards to enter m howyn tranchère station himself at this door and undertake to identify they on they arrival at the mairie the representative number somewhat under three hundred they exceed this number later on it be about eleven o'clock in the morning all do not go up at once into the hall where the meeting be to take place several those of the leave in particular remain in the courtyard mingle with the national guard and citizen they talk of what they be go to do this be the first difficulty the father of the meeting be m de kératry be he go to preside the representative who be assemble in the great hall be in he favor the representative remain in the courtyard hesitate marc dufraisse go up to mm jule de lasteyrie and léon de maleville who have stay behind with the representative of the left and say to they what be they think of upstairs to make kératry president the name of kératry would frighten the people as thoroughly as mine would frighten the middle class a member of the right m de keranflech come up and intend to support the objection add and then think of kératry 's age it be madness to pit a man of eighty against this hour of danger but esquiro exclaim -- that be a bad reason eighty year they constitute a force yes where they be well bear say colfavru kératry bear they badly nothing be greater resume esquiro than great octogenarian it be glorious add chamiot to be preside over by nestor no by geronte -lrb- 5 -rrb- say victor hennequin these word put a end to the debate kératry be throw out mm léon de maleville and jules de lasteyrie two man respect by all party undertake to make the member of the right listen to reason it be decide that the bureau -lrb- 6 -rrb- should preside five member of the bureau be present two vice-president mm benoist d'azy and vitet and three secretary mm griumult chapot and moulin of the two other vice-president one general bedrau be at maza the other m daru be under guard in he own house of the three other secretary two mm peapin and lacaze man of the elysée be absentee the other m yvan a member of the left be at the meeting of the leave in the rue blanche which be take place almost at the same moment in the meantime a usher appear on the step of the mairie and cry out as on the most peaceful day of the assembly representative to the sit this usher who belong to the assembly and who have follow it share its fortune throughout this day the sequestration on the quaus d'orsay include at the summons of the usher all the representative in the courtyard and amongst whom be one of the vice-president m viteus go upstairs to the hall and the sit be open this sit be the last which the assembly hold under regular condition the left which as we have see have on its side boldly recapture the legislative power and have add to it that which circumstance require -- as be the duty of revolutionist the left without a bureau without a usher and without secretary hold sitting in which the accurate and passionless record of shorthand be want but which live in we memory and which history will gather up two shorthand writer of the assembly mm grosselet and lagache be present at the sit at the mairie of the tenth arrondissement they have be able to record it the censorship of the victorious _ coup d'état _ have mutilate they report and have publish through its historian this mangled version as the true version one lie more that do not matter this shorthand recital belong to the brief of the 2d December it be one of the lead document in the trial which the future will institute in the note of this book will be find this document complete the passage in inverted comma be those which the censorship of m bonaparte have suppress this suppression be a proof of they significance and importance shorthand reproduce everything except life stenography be a ear it hear and see not it be therefore necessary to fill in here the inevitable blank of the shorthand account in order to obtain a complete idea of this sit of the tenth arrondissement we must picture the great hall of the mairie a sort of parallelogram light on the right by four or five window overlook the courtyard on the leave along the wall furnish with several row of bench which have be hastily bring thither on which be pile up the three hundred representative assemble together by chance no one be sit down those in front be stand those behind be mount on the bench here and there be a few small table in the center people walk to and fro at the bottom at the end opposite the door be a long table furnish with bench which occupy the whole width of the wall behind which sit the bureau sit be merely the conventional term the bureau do not sit like the rest of the assembly it be on its foot the secretary mm chapot moulin and grimault write standing at certain moment the two vice-president mount on the bench so as to be better see from all point of the room the table be cover by a old green tablecloth stain with ink three or four inkstand have be bring in and a quire of paper be scatter about there the decree be write as soon as they be draw up they multiply the copy some representative become secretary on the spur of the moment and help the official secretary this great hall be on a level with the landing it be situate as we have say on the first floor it be reach by a very narrow staircase we must recollect that nearly the whole of the member present be member of the right the first moment be a serious one berryer come out to advantage berryer like all those extemporizer without style will only be remember as a name and a much disputed name berryer have be rather a special pleader than a orator who believe what he say on that day berryer be to the point logical and earnest they begin by this cry what shall we do draw up a declaration say m de falloux a protest say m de flavigny a decree say berryer in truth a declaration be empty air a protest be noise a decree be action they cry out what decree deposition say berryer deposition be the extreme limit of the energy of the right beyond deposition there be outlawry deposition be practicable for the right outlawry be only possible for the leave in fact it be the left who outlaw loui bonaparte they do it at they first meeting in the rue blanche we shall see this later on at deposition legality come to a end at outlawry the revolution begin the recurrence of revolution be the logical consequence of _ coup d'état _ the deposition have be vote a man who later on turn traitor quentin bauchart exclaim let we all sign it all sign it odilon barrot come in and sign it antony thouret come in and sign it suddenly m piscatory announce that the mayor be refuse to allow representative who have arrive to enter the hall order he to do so by decree say berryer and the decree be vote thanks to this decree mm favreau and monet enter they come from the legislative palace they relate the cowardice of dupin m dahirel one of the leader of the right be exasperated and say we have receive bayonet thrust voice be raise let we summon the tenth legion let the call to arm be beat lauriston hesitate let we order he to protect the assembly let we order he by decree say berryer this decree be draw up which however do not prevent lauriston from refuse another decree again propose by berryer pronounce any one who have outrage the parliamentary inviolability to be a traitor and order the immediate release of those representative who have be wrongfully make prisoner all this be vote at once without debate in a sort of great unanimous confusion and in the midst of a storm of fierce conversation from time to time berryer impose silence then the angry outcry break forth again the _ coup d'état _ will not dare to come here we be master here we be at home it would be impossible to attack we here these wretch will not dare to do so if the uproar have be less violent the representative might have hear through the open window close at hand the sound of soldier load they gun a regiment of chasseur of vincenne have just enter silently into the garden of the mairie and while wait for order be load they gun little by little the sit at first disorderly and tumultuous have assume a ordinary aspect the uproar have relapse into a murmur the voice of the usher

tocqueville add i say to myself every night ' i lie down to sleep a minister what if i should awake a prisoner ' some of those man who be term man of order mutter while sign the degree of deposition beware of the red republic and seem to entertain a equal fear of failure and of success m de vatimesnil press the hand of the man of the left and thank they for they presence you make we popular say he and antony thouret answer he i know neither right nor left to-day i only see the assembly the younger of the two shorthand writer hand they write sheet to the representative who have speak and ask they to revise they at once say we shall not have the time to read they over some representative go down into the street and show the people copy of the decree of deposition sign by the member of the

feel themselves fall they become affectionate towards republican the republic be call to-morrow each speak from he place this member upon a bench that member on a chair a few on the table all contradictory opinion burst forth at once in a corner some ex-leader of order be scare at the possible triumph of the red in another the man of the right surround the man of the left and ask they : be not the faubourg go to rise the narrator have but one duty to tell he story he relate everything the bad as well as the good whatever may have take place however and notwithstanding all these detail of which it be we duty to speak apart from the exception which we have mention the attitude of the man of the right who compose the large majority of this meeting be in many respects honorable and worthy some of they as we have just mention even pride themselves upon they resolution and they energy almost as though they have wish to rival the member of the leave we may here remark -- for in the course of this narrative we shall more than once see the gaze of some member of the right turn towards the people and in this no mistake should be make -- that these monarchical man who talk of popular insurrection and who invoke the faubourg be a minority in the majority -- a imperceptible minority antony thouret propose to those who be leader there to go in a body through the working-class neighborhood with the decree of deposition in they hand bring to bay they refuse they declare that they would only protect themselves by organize power not by the people it be a strange thing to say but it must be note that with they habit of political shortsightedness the popular armed resistance even in the name of the law seem sedition to they the utmost appearance of revolution which they could endure be a regiment of the national guard with they drum at they head they shrink from the barricade right in a blouse be no longer right truth arm with a pike be no longer truth law unpave a street give they the impression of a fury in the main however and take they for what they be and consider they position as politician these member of the right be well-advised what would they have do with the people and what would the people have do with they how would they have proceed to set fire to the mass imagine falloux as a tribune fan the faubourg st antoine into a flame alas in the midst of this dense gloom in these fatal complication of circumstance by which the _ coup d'état _ profit so odiously and so perfidiously in that mighty misunderstanding which comprise the whole situation for kindle the revolutionary spark in the heart of the people danton himself would not have suffice the _ coup d'état _ enter into this meeting impudently with its convict 's cap on its head it possess a infamous assurance there as well as everywhere else there be in this majority three hundred representative of the people loui napoleon send a sergeant to drive they away the assembly have resist the sergeant he send a officer the temporary commander of the sixth battalion of the chasseur de vincenne this officer young fair-haired a scoffer half laugh half threatening pointed with he finger to the stair fill with bayonet and defy the assembly who be this young spark ask a member of the right a national guard who be there say throw he out of the window kick he downstairs cry one of the people this assembly grievous as be its offence against the principle of the revolution -- and with these wrong democracy alone have the right to reproach it -- this assembly i repeat be the national assembly that be to say the republic incarnate the living universal suffrage the majesty of the nation upright and visible loui bonaparte assassinate this assembly and moreover insult it a slap on the face be worse than a poniard thrust the garden of the neighborhood occupy by the troops be full of broken bottle they have ply the soldier with drink they obey the epaulette unconditionally and accord to the expression of eyewitness appear dazed-drunk the representative appeal to they and say to they it be a crime they answer we be not aware of it one soldier be hear to say to another what have you do with you ten franc of this morning the sergeant hustle the officer with the exception of the commander who probably earn he cross of honor the officer be respectful the sergeant brutal a lieutenant showing sign of flinch a sergeant cry out to he you be not the only one who command here come therefore march m de vatimesnil ask a soldier will you dare to arrest we -- we the representative of the people assuredly say the soldier several soldier hear some representative say that they have eat nothing since the morning offer they they ration bread some representative accept m de tocqueville who be unwell and who be notice to be pale and lean on the sill of a window receive from a soldier a piece of this bread which he share with m chambolle two commissary of police appear in full dress in black coat gird with they sash-girdle and they black corded hat one be a old man the other a young man the first be name lemoine-tacherat and not bacherel as have be wrongly print : the second be name barlet these name should be note the unprecedented assurance of this barlet be remark nothing be want in he -- cynical speech provoke gesture sardonic intonation it be with a inexpressible air of insolence that barlet when summon the meeting to dissolve itself add rightly or wrongly they murmur on the bench of the assembly who be this scoundrel the other compare to he seem moderate and inoffensive emile péan exclaim the old man be simply work in he profession but the young man be work out he promotion before this tacherat and this barlet enter before the butt of the musket have be hear ring on the stone of the staircase this assembly have talk of resistance of what kind of resistance we have just state the majority could only listen to a regular organized resistance a military resistance in uniform and in epaulet such a resistance be easy to decree but it be difficult to organize the general on whom the assembly be accustom to rely have be arrest there only remain two possible general oudinot and lauriston general marquis de lauriston ex-peer of france and at the same time colonel of the tenth legion and representative of the people draw a distinction between he duty as representative and he duty as colonel summon by some of he friend of the right to beat to arm and call together the tenth legion he answer as representative of the people i ought to indict the executive power but as colonel i ought to obey it it appear that he obstinately shut himself up in this singular reasoning and that it be impossible to draw he out of it how stupid he be say piscatory how sharp he be say falloux the first officer of the national guard who appear in uniform seem to be recognize by two member of the right who say it be m de perigord they make a mistake it be m guilbot major of the third battalion of the tenth legion he declare that he be ready to march on the first order from he colonel general lauriston general lauriston go down into the courtyard and come up a moment afterwards say they do not recognize my authority i have just resign moreover the name of lauriston be not familiar to the soldier oudinot be better know in the army but how at the moment when the name of oudinot be pronounce a shudder run through this meeting almost exclusively compose of member of the right in fact at this critical time at this fatal name of oudinot reflection crowd upon each other in every mind what be the _ coup d'état _ it be the roman expedition at home which be undertake against whom against those who have undertake the roman expedition abroad the national assembly of france dissolve by violence could find only one single general to defend it in its die hour and whom precisely he who in the name of the national assembly of france have dissolve by violence the national assembly of rome what power could oudinot the strangler of a republic possess to save a republic be it not evident that he own soldier would answer he what do you want with we that which we have do at rome we now do at paris what a story be this story of treason the french legislature have write the first chapter with the blood of the roman constituent assembly : providence write the second chapter with the blood of the french legislature loui bonaparte hold the pen in 1849 loui bonaparte have assassinate the sovereignty of the people in the person of its roman representative in 1851 he assassinate it in the person of its french representative it be logical and although it be infamous it be just the legislative assembly bear at the same time the weight of two crime it be the accomplice of the first the victim of the second all these man of the majority feel this and be humble or rather it be the same crime the crime of the second of July 1849 ever erect ever alive which have only change its name which now call itself the second of December and which the offspring of this assembly stab it to the heart nearly all crime be parricidal on a certain day they recoil upon those who have commit they and slay they at this moment so full of anxiety m de falloux must have glance round for m de montalembert m de montalembert be at the elysée when tamisier rise and pronounce this terrifying word the roman question distract m de dampierre shout to he silence you kill we it be not tamisier who be kill they -- it be oudinot m de dampierre do not perceive that he cry silence to history and then without even reckon the fatal remembrance which at such a moment would have crush a man endow in the highest degree with great military quality general oudinot in other respects a excellent officer and a worthy son of he brave father possess none of those striking quality which in the critical hour of revolution stir the soldier and carry with they the people at that instant to win back a army of a hundred thousand man to withdraw the ball from the cannon ' mouth to find beneath the wine pour out to the praetorian the true soul of the french soldier half drown and nearly dead to tear the flag from the _ coup d'état _ and restore it to the law to surround the assembly with thunder and lightning it would have need one of those man who exist no longer it would have need the firm hand the calm oratory the cold and search glance of desaix that french phocion it would have need the huge shoulder the commanding stature the thundering voice the abusive insolent cynical gay and sublime eloquence of kléber that military mirabeau desaix the countenance of a just man or kléber the face of the lion general oudinot little awkward embarrassed with a indecisive and dull gaze red cheek low forehead with grizzled and lank hair polite tone of voice a humble smile without oratory without gesture without power brave before the enemy timid before the first comer have assuredly the bearing of a soldier but have also the bearing of a priest he cause the mind to hesitate between the sword and the taper he have in he eye a sort of aman he have the best intention in the world but what could he do alone without prestige without true glory without personal authority and drag rome after he he feel all this himself and he be as it be paralyze by it as soon as they have appoint he he get upon a chair and thank the assembly doubtless with a firm heart but with hesitate speech when the little fair-haired officer dare to look he in the face and insult he he hold the sword of the people he general of the sovereign assembly he only know how to stammer out such wretched phrase as these i have just declare to you that we be unable ` unless compel and constrain ' to obey the order which prohibit we from remain assemble together he speak of obey he who ought to command they have gird he with he scarf and it seem to make he uncomfortable he incline he head alternately first to one shoulder and then to the other he hold he hat and cane in he hand he have a benevolent aspect a legitimist member mutter in a low voice to he neighbor one might imagine he be a bailiff speechifying at a wedding and he neighbor a legitimist also reply he remind I of the duc d'angoulême what a contrast to tamisier tamisier frank earnest confident although a mere captain of artillery have the bearing of a general have tamisier with he grave and gentle countenance high intelligence and dauntless heart a species of soldier-philosopher be better know he could have render decisive service no one can tell what would have happen if providence have give the soul of tamisier to oudinot or the epaulet of oudinot to tamisier in this bloody enterprise of December we fail to find a general 's uniform becomingly wear a book might be write on the part which gold lace play in the destiny of nation tamisier appoint chief of the staff some instant before the invasion of the hall place himself at the disposal of the assembly he be stand on a table he speak with a resonant and hearty voice the most downcast become reassure by this modest honest devoted attitude suddenly he draw himself up and look all that royalist majority in the face exclaim yes i accept the charge you offer I i accept the charge of defend the republic nothing but the republic do you perfectly understand a unanimous shout answer he long live the republic ah say beslay the voice come back to you as on the fourth of may long live the republic nothing but the republic repeat the man of the right oudinot louder than the other all arm be stretch towards tamisier every hand press he oh danger irresistible converter in he last hour the atheist invoke god and the royalist the republic they cling to that which they have repudiate the official historian of the _ coup d'état _ have state that at the beginning of the sit two representative have be send by the assembly to the ministry of the interior to negotiate what be certain be that these two representative have no authority they present themselves not on behalf of the assembly but in they own name they offer themselves as intermediary to procure a peaceable termination of the catastrophe which have begin with a honesty which border on simplicity they summon morny to yield himself a prisoner and to return within the law declare that in case of refusal the assembly would do its duty and call the people to the defense of the constitution and of the republic marny answer they with a smile accompany by these plain word if you appeal to arm and if i find any representative on the barricade i will have they all shoot to the last man the meeting in the tenth arrondissement yield to force president vitet insist that they should forcibly arrest he a police agent who seize he turn pale and tremble in certain circumstance to lay violent hand upon a man be to lay they upon right and those who dare to do so be make to tremble by outraged law the exodus from the mairie be long and beset with obstruction half-an-hour elapse while the soldier be form a line and while the commissary of police all the time appear solely occupy with the care of drive back the crowd in the street send for order to the ministry of the interior during that time some of the

little infantry soldier be terrible fellow at the siege of rome they fling themselves at the assault like madman these lad be very devil the officer avoid the gaze of the representative on leave the mairie m de coislin pass by a officer and exclaim what a disgrace for the uniform the officer retaliate with angry word and incensed m de coislin shortly afterwards during the march he come up to m de coislin and say to he sir i have reflect it be i who be wrong they proceed on the way slowly at a few step from the mairie the precession meet m chegaray the representative call out to he come he answer while make a expressive gesture with he hand and he shoulder oh i dare say as they have not arrest I and he feign as though he would pass on he be ashamed however and go with they he name be

prisoner hold out its arm and call to he the mother weep in the background it be at first intend to take the assembly in a body straight to maza but this be counter-ordered by the ministry of the interior it be fear that this long walk in broad daylight through populous and easily arouse street might prove dangerous the d'orsay barracks be close at hand they select these as a temporary prison one of the commander insolently point out with he sword the arrest representative to the passer-by and say in a fond voice these be the whites we have order to spare they now it be the turn of the red representative let they look out for themselves wherever the procession pass the populace shout from the pavement at the door at the window long live the national assembly when they perceive a few representative of the left sprinkle in the column they cry vive la république vive la constitution and vive la loi the shop be not shut and passer-by go to and fro some people say wait until the evening this be not the end of it a staff-officer on horseback in full uniform meet the procession recognize m de vatimesnil and come up to greet he in the rue de beaune as they pass the house of the _ démocratic pacifique _ a group shout down with the traitor of the elysée on the quaus d'orsay the shouting be redouble there be a great crowd there on either side of the quay a file of soldier of the line elbow to elbow keep back the spectator in the middle of the space leave vacant the member of the assembly slowly advance between a double file of soldier the one stationary which threaten the people the other on the march which threaten tire representative serious reflection arise in the presence of all the detail of the great crime which this book be design to relate every honest man who set himself face to face with the _ coup d'état _ of loui bonaparte hear nothing but a tumult of indignant thought in he conscience whoever read we work to the end will assuredly not credit we with the intention of extenuate this monstrous deed nevertheless as the deep logic of action ought always to be italicize by the historian it be necessary here to call to mind and to repeat even to satiety that apart from the member of the left of whom a very small number be present and whom we have mention by name the three hundred representative who thus defile before the eye of the crowd constitute the old royalist and reactionary majority of the assembly if it be possible to forget that -- whatever be they error whatever be they fault and we venture to add whatever be they illusion -- these person thus treat be the representative of the lead civilized nation be sovereign legislator senator of the people inviolable deputy and sacred by the great law of democracy and that in the same manner as each man bear in himself something of the mind of god so each of these nominee of universal suffrage bear something of the soul of france if it be possible to forget this for a moment it assuredly would be a spectacle perhaps more laughable than sad and certainly more philosophical than lamentable to see on this December morning after so many law of repression after so many exceptional measure after so many vote of censure and of the state of siege after so many refusal of amnesty after so many affront to equity to justice to the human conscience to the public good faith to right after so many favor to the police after so many smile bestow on absolution the entire party of order arrest in a body and take to prison by the _ sergent de ville _ one day or rather one night the moment have come to save society the _ coup d'état _ abruptly seize the demagogue and find that it hold by the collar whom the royalist they arrive at the barracks formerly the barracks of the royal guard and on the pediment of which be a carve escutcheon whereon be still visible the trace of the three _ fleur de lis _ efface in 1830 they halt the door be open why say m de broglie here we be at that moment a great placard post on the barrack wall by the side of the door bear in big letter -- revision of the constitution it be the advertisement of a pamphlet publish two or three day previous to the _ coup d'état _ without any author 's name demand the empire and be attribute to the president of the republic the representative enter and the door be close upon they the shout cease the crowd which occasionally have its meditative moment remain for some time on the quay dumb motionless gaze alternately at the closed gate of the barracks and at the silent front of the palace of the assembly dimly visible in the misty December twilight two hundred pace distant the two commissary of police go to report they success to m de morny m de morny say now the struggle have begin excellent these be the last representative who will be make prisoner -lrb- 5 -rrb- the geronte or gerontium be the elder of sparta who constitute the senate -lrb- 6 -rrb- the bureau of the assembly

officially payable to the member of the assembly chapter xiii loui bonaparte 's side-face the mind of all these man we repeat be very differently affect the extreme legitimist party which represent the white of the flag be not it must be say highly exasperate at the _ coup d'état _ upon many face might be read the say of m de falloux : i be so satisfied that i have considerable difficulty in affect to be only resign the ingenuous spirit cast down they eye -- that be become to purity more daring spirit raise they head they feel a impartial indignation which permit a little admiration how cleverly these general have be ensnare the country assassinate -- it be a horrible crime but they be enrapture at the jugglery blended with the parricide one of the leader say with a sigh of envy and regret we do not possess a man of such talent another mutter it be order and he add alas another exclaim it be a frightful crime but well carry out some waver attract on one side by the lawful power which rest in the assembly and on the other by the abomination which be in bonaparte honest soul poise between duty and infamy there be a m thomine desmazure who go as far as the door of the great hall of the mairie halted look inside look outside and do not enter it would be unjust not to record that other amongst the pure royalist and above all m de vatimesnil have the sincere intonation and the upright wrath of justice be it as it may the legitimist party take as a whole entertain no horror of the _ coup d'état _ it fear nothing in truth should the royalist fear loui bonaparte why indifference do not inspire fear loui bonaparte be indifferent he only recognize one thing he object to break through the road in order to reach it that be quite plain the rest might be leave alone there lay the whole of he policy to crush the republican to disdain the royalist loui bonaparte have no passion he who write these line talk one day about loui bonaparte with the ex-king of westphalium remark in he the dutchman tone down the corsican -- if there be any corsican answer jérome loui bonaparte have never be other than a man who have lie wait for fortune a spy try to dupe god he have that livid dreaminess of the gambler who cheat cheating admit audacity but exclude anger in he prison at ham he only read one book the prince he belong to no family as he could hesitate between bonaparte and verhuell he have no country as he could hesitate between france and holland this napoleon have take st helena in good part he admire england resentment to what purpose for he on earth there only exist he interest he pardon because he speculate he forget everything because he calculate upon everything what do he uncle matter to he he do not serve he he make use of he he rest he shabby enterprise upon austerlitz he stuff the eagle malice be a unproductive outlay loui bonaparte only possess as much memory as be useful hudson lowe do not prevent he from smile upon englishman the marquis of montchenu do not prevent he from smile upon the royalist he be a man of earnest politics of good company wrap in he own scheming not impulsive do nothing beyond that which he intend without abruptness without hard word discreet accurate learn talk smoothly of a necessary massacre a slaughterer because it serve he purpose all this we repeat without passion and without anger loui bonaparte be one of those man who have be influence by the profound iciness of machiavellus it be through be a man of that nature that he succeed in submerge the name of napoleon by superad December

they and answer to the call out of they name this draw the other after they everybody answer amongst the legitimist some serio-comic scene be enact they who alone be not threaten insist on believe that they be in danger they would not let one of they orator go they embrace he and hold he back almost with tear cry out do not go away do you know where they be take you think of the trench of vincenne the representative have be summon two by two as we have just say file in the parlor before the police agent and then they be order to get into the robber ' box the stowage be apparently make at haphazard and promiscuously nevertheless later by the difference of the treatment accord to the representative in the various prison it be apparent that this promiscuous loading have perhaps be somewhat prearranged when the first vehicle be full a second of a similar construction draw up the police agent pencil and pocket-book in hand note down the contents of each vehicle these man know the representative when marc dufraisse call in he turn enter the parlor he be accompany by benoist -lrb- du rhône -rrb- ah here be marc dufraisse say the attendant who hold the pencil when ask for he name benoist reply benoist du rhône add the police agent and he continue for there be also benoist d'azy and benoist-champy the loading of each vehicle occupy nearly half a hour the successive arrival have raise the number of imprison representative to two hundred and thirty-two they embarkation or to use the expression of m de vatimesnil they barrel up which begin a little after ten in the evening be not finish until nearly seven o'clock in the morning when there be no more police-vans available omnibus be bring in these various vehicle be portion off into three detachment each escort by lancer the first detachment leave towards one o'clock in the morning and be drive to mont valérien the second towards five o'clock and be drive to maza the third towards half-past six to vincenne as this business occupy a long time those who have not yet be call benefit by the mattress and try to sleep thus from time to time silence reign in the upper room in the midst of one of these pause m bixio sit upright and raise he voice cry out gentleman what do you think of ` passive obedience ' a unanimous burst of laughter be the reply again during one of these pause another voice exclaim -- romieu will be a senator emile péan ask -- what will become of the red spectre he will enter the priesthood answer antony thouret and will turn into the black spectre other exclamation which the historian of the second of December have spread abroad be not utter thus marc dufraisse never make the remark with which the man of loui bonaparte have wish to excuse they crime : if the president do not shoot all those among we who resist he do not understand he business for the _ coup d'état _ such a remark might be convenient but for history it be false the interior of the police-van be light while the representative be enter the air-hole of each compartment be not close in this manner marc dufraisse through the aperture could see m du rémusat in the opposite cell to he own m du rémusat have enter the van couple with m duvergier de hauranne upon my word monsieur marc dufraisse exclaim duvergier de hauranne when they jostle each other in the gangway of the vehicle upon my word if any one have say to I ` you will go to marza in a police-van ' i should have say ` it be improbable ' but if they have add ` you will go with marc dufraisse ' i should have say ` it be impossible ' as soon as the vehicle be full five or six policeman enter and stand in the gangway the door be shut the step be throw up and they drive off when all the police-van have be fill there be still some representative leave as we have say omnibus be bring into requisition into these representative be thrust one upon the other rudely without deference for either age or name colonel feray on horseback superintend and direct operation as he mount the step of the last vehicle but one the duc de montebello cry out to he to-day be the anniversary of the battle of austerlitz and the son-in-law of marshal bugeaud compel the son of marshal lanne to enter a convict 's van when the last omnibus be reach there be only seventeen place for eighteen representative the most active mount first antony thouret who himself alone equal the whole of the right for he have as much mind as thier and as much stomach as murat antony thouret corpulent and lethargic be the last when he appear on the threshold of the omnibus in all he hugeness a cry of alarm arise -- where be he go to sit antony thouret notice berryer at the bottom of the omnibus go straight up to he sit down on he knee and quietly say to he you want ` compression ' monsieur berryer now you have it -lrb- 8 -rrb- michel de bourge have thus characterize loui bonaparte as the guardian of the republic against the monarchical party chapter xv maza the police-van escort as far as maza by lancer find another squadron of lancer ready to receive they at maza the representative descend from the vehicle one by one the officer command the lancer stand by the door and watch they pass with a dull curiosity maza which have take the place of the prison of la force now pull down be a lofty reddish building close to the terminus of the lyon railway and stand on the waste land of the faubourg st antoine from a distance the building appear as though build of brick but on closer examination it be see to be construct of flint set in cement six large detach building three story high all radiate from a rotunda which serve as the common center and touch each other at the starting-point separate by courtyard which grow broader in proportion as the building spread out pierce with a thousand little dormer window which give light to the cell surround by a high wall and present from a bird 's - eye point of view the drape of a fan -- such be maza from the rotunda which form the center spring a sort of minaret which be the alarm-tower the ground floor be a round room which serve as the registrar 's office on the first story be a chapel where a single priest say mass for all and the observatory where a single attendant keep watch over all the door of all the gallery at the same time each building be term a division the courtyard be intersect by high wall into a multitude of little oblong walk as each representative descend from the vehicle he be conduct into the rotunda where the registry office be situate there he name be take down and in exchange for he name he be assign a number whether the prisoner be a thief or a legislator such be always the rule in this prison the _ coup d'état _ reduce all to a footing of equality as soon as a representative be register and number he be order to file off they say to he go upstairs or go on and they announce he at the end of the corridor to which he be allot by call out receive number so-and-so the jailer in that particular corridor answer send he on the prisoner mount alone go straight on and on he arrival find the jailer standing near a open door the jailer say here it be sir the prisoner enter the jailer shut the door and they pass on to another the _ coup d'état _ act in a very different manner towards the various representative those whom it desire to conciliate the man of the bight be place in vincenne those whom it detest the man of the leave be place in maza those at vincenne have the quarter of m montpensier which be expressly reopen for they a excellent dinner eat in company wax candle fire and the smile and bow of the governor general courtigi this be how it treat those at mazas a police-van deposit they at the prison they be transfer from one box to another at maza a clerk register they weigh they measure they and enter they into the jail book as convict have pass through the office each of they be conduct along a gallery shroud in darkness through a long damp vault to a narrow door which be suddenly open this reach a jailer push the representative in by the shoulder and the door be shut the representative thus immured find himself in a little long narrow dark room it be this which the prudent language of modern legislation term a cell here the full daylight of a December noon only produce a dusky twilight at one end there be a door with a little grate at the other close to the ceiling at a height of ten or twelve foot there be a loophole with a fluted glass window this window dim the eye and prevent it from see the blue or gray of the sky or from distinguish the cloud from the sun 's ray and invest the wan daylight of winter with a indescribable uncertainty it be even less than a dim light it be a turbid light the inventor of this fluted window succeed in make the heaven squint after a few moment the prisoner begin to distinguish object confusedly and this be what he find : white-washed wall here and there turn green by various exhalation in one corner a round hole guard by iron bar and exhale a disgusting smell in another corner a slab turn upon a hinge like the bracket seat of a _ fiacre _ and thus capable of be use as a table no bed a straw-bottomed chair under foot a brick floor gloom be the first impression cold be the second there then the prisoner find himself alone chill in this semi-darkness be able to walk up and down the space of eight square foot like a caged wolf or to remain seat on he chair like a idiot at bicêtre in this situation a ex-republican of the eve who have become a member of the majority and on occasion side somewhat with the bonapartist m emile leroux who have moreover be throw into maza by mistake have doubtless be take for some other leroux begin to weep with rage three four five hour thus pass away in the meanwhile they have not eat since the morning some of they in the excitement cause by the _ coup d'état _ have not even breakfast hunger come upon they be they to be forget there no a bell ring in the prison the grate of the door open and a arm hold out to the prisoner a pewter porringer and a piece of bread the prisoner greedily seize the bread and the porringer the bread be black and sticky the porringer contain a sort of thick water warm and reddish nothing can be compare to the smell of this soup as for the bread it only smell of mouldiness however great they hunger most of the prisoner during the first moment throw down they bread on the floor and empty the porringer down the hole with the iron bar nevertheless the stomach crave the hour pass by they pick up the bread and end by eat it one prisoner go so far as to pick up the porringer and to attempt to wipe out the bottom with he bread which he afterwards devour subsequently this prisoner a representative set at liberty in exile describe to I this dietary and say to I a hungry stomach have no nose meanwhile there be absolute solitude and profound silence however in the course of a few hour m emile leroux -- he himself have tell the fact to m versigny -- hear on the other side of the wall on he right a sort of curious knock space out and intermittent at irregular interval he listen and almost at the same moment on the other side of the wall to he leave a similar rap respond m emile leroux enrapture -- what a pleasure it be to hear a noise of some kind -- thought of he colleague prisoner like himself and cry out in a tremendous voice oh oh you be there also you fellow he have scarcely utter this sentence when the door of he cell be open with a creaking of hinge and bolt a man -- the jailer -- appear in a great rage and say to he -- hold you tongue the representative of the people somewhat bewildered ask for a explanation hold you tongue reply the jailer or i will pitch you into a dungeon this jailer speak to the prisoner as the _ coup d'état _ speak to the nation m emile leroux with he persistent parliamentary habit nevertheless attempt to insist what say he can i not answer the signal which two of my colleague be make to I two of you colleague indeed answer the jailer they be two thief and he shut the door shout with laughter they be in fact two thief between whom m emile leroux be not crucify but lock up the maza prison be so ingeniously build that the least word can be hear from one cell to another consequently there be no isolation notwithstanding the cellular system thence this rigorous silence impose by the perfect and cruel logic of the rule what do the thief do they have invent a telegraphic system of rap and the rule gain nothing by they stringency m emile leroux have simply interrupt a conversation which have be begin do not interfere with we friendly patter cry out he thief neighbor who for this exclamation be throw into the dungeon such be the life of the representative at maza moreover as they be in secret confinement not a book not a sheet of paper not a pen not even a hour 's exercise in the courtyard be allow to they the thief also go to maza as we have see but those who know a trade be permit to work those who know how to read be supply with book those who know how to write be grant a desk and paper all be permit the hour 's exercise require by the law of health and authorize by the rule the representative be allow nothing whatever isolation close confinement silence darkness cold the amount of _ ennui _ which engender madness as linguet have say when speaking of the bastille to remain seat on a chair all day long with arm and leg cross : such be the situation but the bed could they lie down no there be no bed at eight o'clock in the evening the jailer come into the cell and reach down and remove something which be roll up on a plank near the ceiling this something be a hammock the hammock have be fix hook up and spread out the jailer wish he prisoner good-night there be a blanket on the hammock sometimes a mattress some two inch thick the prisoner wrapt in this cover try to sleep and only succeed in shiver but on the morrow he could at least remain lie down all day in he hammock not at all at seven o'clock in the morning the jailer come in wish the representative good-morning make he get up and roll up the hammock on its shelf near the ceiling but in this case could not the prisoner take down the authorize hammock unroll it hook it up and lie down again yes he could but then there be the dungeon this be the routine the hammock for the night the chair for the day let we be just however some obtain bed amongst other mm thier and roger -lrb- du nord -rrb- m grévy do not have one maza be a model prison of progress it be certain that maza be preferable to the _ piombus _ of venice and to the under-water dungeon of the châtelet theoretical philanthropy have build maza nevertheless as have be see maza leave plenty to be desire let we acknowledge that from a certain point of view the temporary solitary confinement of the law-maker at maza do not displease we there be perhaps something of providence in the _ coup d'état _ providence in place the legislator at maza have perform a act of good education eat of you own cooking it be not a bad thing that those who own prison should try they chapter xvi the episode of the boulevard st martin when charamaule and i reach no 70 rue blanche a steep lonely street a man in a sort of naval sub-officer 's uniform be walk up and

charamaule to go to my house and wait for I there and i walk out with noël parfait and lafon we reach the then still uninhabited district which skirt the rampart as we come to the corner of the rue pigalle we see at a hundred pace from we in the desert street which cross it soldier glide all along the house bend they step towards the rue blanche at three o'clock the member of the left rejoin each other in the rue de la cérisaie but the alarm have be give and the inhabitant of these lonely street station themselves at the window to see the representative pass the place of meeting situate and hem in at the bottom of a back yard be badly choose in the event of be surround : all these disadvantage be at once perceive and the meeting only last a few seconds it be preside over by joly xavier durrieu and jule gouache who be editor of the _ révolution _ also take part as well as several italian exile amongst other colonel carinus and montanellus ex-minister of the grand duke of

workman terrify no money a hat be send round and each throw into it what money he have about he they collect in this manner a few hundred franc xavier durrieu whose fiery courage never flag for a single moment reiterate that he would undertake the printing and promise that by eight o'clock that evening there should be 40000 copy of the proclamation time press they separated after fix as a rendezvous the premise of the society of cabinet-maker in the rue de charonne at eight o'clock in the evening so as to allow time for the situation to reveal itself as we go out and cross the rue beautreillis i saw pierre leroux come up to I he have take no part in we meeting he say to I -- i believe this struggle to be useless although my point of view be different from yours i be you friend beware there be yet time to stop you be enter into the catacomb the catacomb be death they be also life answer i all the same i think with joy that my two son be in prison and that this gloomy duty of street fighting be impose upon I alone there yet remain five hour until the time fix for the rendezvous i wish to go home and once more embrace my wife and daughter before precipitate myself into that abyss of the unknown which be there yawn and gloomy and which several of we be about to enter never to return arnauld -lrb- de l'ariége -rrb- give I he arm the two italian exile carini aril montanellus accompany I montanelli take my hand and say to I right will conquer you will conquer oh that this time france may not be selfish as in 1848 and that she may deliver italy i answer he she will deliver europe those be we illusion at that moment but this however do not prevent they from be we hope to-day faith be thus constitute shadow demonstrate to it the light there be a cabstand before the front gate of st paul we go there the rue st antoine be alive with that indescribable uneasy swarm which precede those strange battle of idea against deed which be call revolution i seem to catch in this great working-class district a glimpse of a gleam of light which alas die out speedily the cabstand before st paul be desert the driver have foresee the possibility of barricade and have flee three mile separated arnauld and myself from we house it be impossible to walk there through the middle of pari without be recognize at each step two passer-by extricate we from we difficulty one of they say to the other the omnibus be still run on the boulevard we profit by this information and go to look for a bastille omnibus all four of we get in i entertain at heart i repeat wrongly or rightly a bitter reproach for the opportunity lose during the morning i say to myself that on critical day such moment come but do not return there be two theory of revolution : to arouse the people or to let they come of themselves the first theory be mine but through force of discipline i have obey the second i reproach myself with this i say to myself the people offer themselves and we do not accept they it be for we now not to offer ourselves but to do more to give ourselves meanwhile the omnibus have start it be full i have take my place at the bottom on the left arnauld -lrb- de l'ariége -rrb- sit next to I carini opposite montanellus next to arnauld we do not speak arnauld and myself silently exchange that pressure of hand which be a means of exchange thought as the omnibus proceed towards the center of paris the crowd become denser on the boulevard as the omnibus enter into the cutting of the porte st martin a regiment of heavy cavalry arrive in the opposite direction in a few seconds this regiment pass by the side of we they be cuirassier they file by at a sharp trot and with draw sword the people lean over from the height of the pavement to see they pass not a single cry on the one side the people deject on the other the soldier triumphant all this stir I suddenly the regiment halt i do not know what obstruction momentarily impede its advance in this narrow cutting of the boulevard in which we be hem in by its halt it stop the omnibus there be the soldier we have they under we eye before we at two pace distance they horse touch the horse of we vehicle these frenchman who have become mameluke these citizen soldier of the great republic transform into supporter of the degraded empire from the place where i sit i almost touch they i could no longer restrain myself i lower the window of the omnibus i put out my head and look fixedly at the dense line of soldier which face I i call out down with loui bonaparte those who serve traitor be traitor those nearest to I turn they head towards I and look at I with a tipsy air the other do not stir and remain at shoulder arm the peak of they helmet over they eye they eye fix upon the ear of they horse in great affair there be the immobility of statue in petty mean affair there be the immobility of puppet at the shout which i raise arnauld turn sharply round he also have lower he window and he be lean half out of the omnibus with he arm extend towards the soldier and he shout down with the traitor to see he thus with he dauntless gesture he handsome head pale and calm he fervent expression he beard and he long chestnut hair one seem to behold the radiant and fulminate face of a angry christ the example be contagious and electrical down with the traitor shout carinus and montanellus down with the dictator down with the traitor repeat a gallant young man with whom we be not acquaint and who be sit next to carinus with the exception of this young man the whole omnibus seem seize with terror hold you tongue exclaim these poor frightened people you will cause we all to be massacre one still more terrify lower the window and begin to shout to the soldier long live prince napoléon long live the emperor there be five of we and we overpower this cry by we persistent protest down with loui bonaparte down with the traitor the soldier listen in gloomy silence a corporal turn with a threatening air towards we and shake he sword the crowd look on in bewilderment what pass within I at that moment i can not tell i be in a whirlwind i have at the same time yield to a calculation find the opportunity good and to a burst of rage find the encounter insolent a woman cry out to we from the pavement you will get yourselve cut to piece i vaguely imagine that some collision be about to ensue and that either from the crowd or from the army the spark would fly out i hope for a sword-cut from the soldier or a shout of anger from the people in short i have obey rather a instinct than a idea but nothing come of it neither the sword-cut nor the shout of anger the soldier do not bestir themselves and the people maintain silence be it too late be it too soon the mysterious man of the elysée have not foresee the event of a insult to he name be throw in the very face of the soldier the soldier have no order they receive they that evening this be see on the morrow in another moment the regiment break into a gallop and the omnibus resume its journey as the cuirassier file past we arnauld -lrb- de l'ariége -rrb- still lean out of the vehicle continue to shout in they ear for as i have just say they horse touch we down with the dictator down with the traitor we alight in the rue lafitte carini montanellus and arnauld leave I and i go on alone towards the rue de la tour d'auvergne night be come on as i turn the corner of the street a man pass close by I by the light of a street lamp i recognize a workman at a neighbor tannery and he say to I in a low tone and quickly do not return home the police surround you house i go back again towards the boulevard through the street lay out but not then build which make a y under my window behind my house not be able to embrace my wife and daughter i think over what i could do during the moment which remain to I a remembrance come into my mind chapter xvii the rebound of the 24th June 1848 on the 2d December 1851 on

look towards the gloomy loneliness of the quaus maza several harnessed artillery battery be dimly visible in the darkness some light torch here and there show up the black outline of the cannon i have some trouble in find auguste 's door in the rue de la roquette nearly all the shop be shut thus make the street very dark at length through a glass shop-front i notice a light which gleam on a pewter counter beyond the counter through a partition also of glass and ornament with white curtain another light and the shadow of two or three man at table could be vaguely distinguish this be the place i enter the door on open ring a bell at the sound the door of the glaze partition which separate the shop from the parlor open and auguste appear he know I at once and come up to I ah sir say he it be you do you know what be go on i ask he yes sir this yes sir utter with calmness and even with a certain embarrassment tell I all where i expect a indignant outcry i find this peaceable answer it seem to I that i be speak to the faubourg st antoine itself i understand that all be at a end in this district and that we have nothing to expect from it the people this wonderful people have resign themselves nevertheless i make a effort loui bonaparte betray the republic say i without notice that i raise my voice he touch my arm and point with he finger to the shadow which be picture on the glaze partition of the parlor take care sir do not talk so loudly what i exclaimed you have come to this -- you dare not speak you dare not utter the name of ` bonaparte ' aloud you barely mumble a few word in a whisper here in this street in the faubourg st antoine where from all the door from all the window from all the pavement from all the very stone ought to be hear the cry ` to arm ' auguste demonstrate to I what i already see too clearly and what girard have shadow forth in the morning -- the moral situation of the faubourg -- that the people be daze -- that it seem to all of they that universal suffrage be restore that the downfall of the law of the 31st of may be a good thing here i interrupted he but this law of the 31st of may it be loui bonaparte who instigate it it be rouher who make it it be baroche who propose it and the bonapartist who vote it you be dazzle by a thief who have take you purse and who restore it to you not i say auguste but the other and he continue to tell the whole truth people do not care much for the constitution they like the republic but the republic be maintain too much by force for they taste in all this they could only see one thing clearly the cannon ready to slaughter they -- they remember June 1848 -- there be some poor people who have suffer greatly -- cavaignac have do much evil -- woman cling to the man 's blouse to prevent they from go to the barricade -- nevertheless with all this when see man like ourselves at they head they would perhaps fight but this hinder they they do not know for what he conclude by say the upper part of the faubourg be do nothing the lower end will do better round about here they will fight the rue de la roquette be good the rue de charonne be good but on the side of père la chaise they ask ` what good will that do we ' they only recognize the forty sous of they day 's work they will not bestir themselves do not reckon upon the mason he add with a smile here we do not say ` cold as a stone ' but ` cold as a mason ' -- and he resume as for I if i be alive it be to you that i owe my life dispose of I i will lay down my life and will do what you wish while he be speak i see the white curtain of the glaze partition behind he move a little he young wife uneasy be peep through at we ah my god say i to he what we want be not the life of one man but the effort of all he be silent i continue -- listen to I auguste you who be good and intelligent so then the faubourg of paris -- which be hero even when they err -- the faubourg of pari for a misunderstanding for a question of salary wrongly construe for a bad definition of socialism rise in June 1848 against the assembly elect by themselves against universal suffrage against they own vote and yet they will not rise in December 1851 for right for the law for the people for liberty for the republic you say that there be perplexity and that you do not understand but on the contrary it be in June that all be obscure and it be to-day that everything be clear while i be say these last word the door of the parlor be softly open and some one come in it be a young man fair as auguste in a overcoat and wear a workman 's cap i start auguste turn round and say to I you can trust he the young man take off he cap come close up to I carefully turn he back on the glaze partition and say to I in a low voice i know you

beyond the rue de chemin vert we turn to the right and reach the rue popincourt there all be desert extinguish closed and silent as in the faubourg st antoine this street be of great length we walk for a long time we pass by the barracks cournet be no longer with we he have remain behind to inform some of he friend and we be tell to take defensive measure in case he house be attack we look for no 82 the darkness be such that we could not distinguish the number on the house at length at the end of the street on the right we see a light it be a grocer 's shop the only one open throughout the street one of we enter and ask the grocer who be sit behind he counter to show we m cournet 's house opposite say the grocer point to a old and low carriage entrance which could be see on the other

portress be in bed all in the house sleep we go in have enter and the gate be shut behind we we find ourselves in a little square courtyard which form the center of a sort of a two-storied ruin the silence of a convent prevail not a light be to be see at the window near a shed be see a low entrance to a narrow dark and wind staircase we have make some mistake say charamaule it be impossible that it can be here meanwhile the portress hear all these trample step beneath she doorway have become wide awake have light she lamp and we could see she in she lodge she face press against the window

render we we go out to the great relief of the poor portress and we resume we search xavier durrieu succeed in ascertain we whereabouts and extricate we from we difficulty a few moment afterwards we turn to the left and we enter into a blind alley of considerable length and dimly light by a old oil lamp -- one of those with which paris be formerly light -- then again to the left and we enter through a narrow passage into a large courtyard encumber with shed and building material this time we have reach cournet 's chapter xix one foot in the tomb cournet be wait for we he receive we on the ground floor in a parlor where there be a fire a table and some chair but the room be so small that a quarter of we fill it to overflow and the other remain in the courtyard it be impossible to deliberate here say bancel i have a larger room on the first floor answer cournet but it be a building in course of construction which be not yet furnished and where there be no fire -- what do it matter they answer he let we go up to the first floor we go up to the first floor by a steep and narrow wooden staircase and we take possession of two room with very low ceiling but of which one be sufficiently large the wall be whitewashed and a few straw-covered stool form the whole of its furniture they call out to I preside i sit down on one of the stool in the corner of the first room with the fire place on my right and on my leave the door open upon the staircase baudin say to I i have a pencil and paper i will act as secretary to you he sit down on a stool next to I the representative and those present amongst whom be several man in blouse remain standing form in front of baudin and myself a sort of square back by the two wall of the room opposite to we this crowd extend as far as the staircase a light candle be place on the chimney-piece a common spirit animated this meet the face be pale but in every eye could be see the same firm resolution in all these shadow glisten the same flame several simultaneously ask permission to speak i request they to give they name to baudin who write they down and then pass I the list the first speaker be a workman he begin by apologize for mingle with the representative he a stranger to the assembly the representative interrupt he no no they say the people and representative be all one speak -- he declare that if he speak it be in order to clear from all suspicion the honor of he brethren the workman of pari that he have hear some representative express doubt about they he assert that this be unjust that the workman realize the whole crime of m bonaparte and the whole duty of the people that they would not be deaf to the appeal of the republican representative and that this would be clearly show he say all this simply with a sort of proud shyness and of honest bluntness he keep he word i find he the next day fight on the rambuteau barricade mathieu -lrb- de la drôme -rrb- come in as the workman conclude i bring news he exclaim a profound silence ensue as i have already say we vaguely know since the morning that the right be to have assemble and that a certain number of we friend have probably take part in the meeting and that be all mathieu -lrb- de la drôme -rrb- bring we the event of the day the detail of the arrest at they own house carry out without any obstacle of the meeting which have take place at m daru 's house and its rough treatment in the rue de bourgogne of the representative expel from the hall of the assembly of the meanness of president dupin of the melting away of the high court of the total inaction of the council of state of the sad sit hold at the mairie of the tenth arrondissement of the oudinot _ fiasco _ of the decree of the deposition of the president and of the two hundred and twenty forcibly arrest and take to the quaus d'orsay he conclude in a manly style : the duty of the left be increase hourly the morrow would probably prove decisive he implore the meeting to take this into consideration a workman add a fact he have happen in the morning to be in the rue de grenelle during the passage of the arrest member of the assembly he be there at the moment when one of the commander of the chasseur de vincenne have utter these word now it be the turn of those gentleman -- the red representative let they look out for themselves one of the editor of the _ révolution _ hennett de kesler who afterwards become a intrepid exile complete the information of mathieu -lrb- de la drôme -rrb- he recount the action take by two member of the assembly with regard to the so-called minister of the interior morny and the answer of the say morny : if i find any of the representative behind the barricade i will have they shoot to the last man and that other say of the same witty vagabond respect the member take to the quaus d'orsay these be the last representative who will be make prisoner he tell we that a placard be at that very moment be print which declare that any one who should be find at a secret meeting would be immediately shoot the placard in truth appear the next morning baudin rise up the _ coup d'état _ redouble its rage exclaim he citizen let we redouble we energy suddenly a man in a blouse enter he be out of breath he have run hard he tell we that he have just see and he repeat have see with he own eye in the rue popincourt a regiment march in silence and wend its way towards the blind alley of no 82 that we be surround and that we be about to be attack he beg we to disperse immediately citizen representative call out cournet i have place scout in the blind alley who will fall back and warn we if the regiment penetrate thither the door be narrow and will be barricade in the twinkling of a eye we be here with you fifty armed and resolute man and at the first shot we shall be two hundred we be provide with ammunition you can deliberate calmly and as he conclude he raise he right arm and from he sleeve fall a large poniard which he have conceal and with the other hand he rattle in he pocket the butt of a pair of pistol very well say i let we continue three of the youngest and most eloquent orator of the left bancel arnauld -lrb- de l'ariége -rrb- and victor chauffor deliver they opinion in succession all three be imbue with this notion that we appeal to arm not have yet be placard the different incident of the boulevarde du temple and of the café bonvalet have bring about no result none of we decree owe to the repressive measure of bonaparte have yet succeed in appear while the event at the mairie of the tenth arrondissement begin to be spread abroad through pari it seem as though the right have commence active resistance before the leave a generous rivalry for the public safety spur they on it be delightful to they to know that a regiment ready to attack be close by within a few step and that perhaps in a few moment they blood would flow moreover advice abound and with advice uncertainty some illusion be still entertain a workman lean close to I against the fireplace say in a low voice to one of he comrade that the people must not be reckon upon and that if we fight we should perpetrate a madness the incident and event of the day have in some degree modify my opinion as to the course to be follow in this grave crisis the silence of the crowd at the moment when arnauld -lrb- de l'ariége -rrb- and i have apostrophize the troops have destroy the impression which a few hour before the enthusiasm of the people on the boulevard du temple have leave with I the hesitation of auguste have impressed I the society of cabinet maker appear to shun we the torpor of the faubourg st antoine be manifest the inertness of the faubourg st marceau be not less so i ought to have receive notice from the engineer before eleven o'clock and eleven o'clock be past we hope die away one after another nevertheless all the more reason in my opinion to astonish and awaken pari by a extraordinary spectacle by a daring act of life and collective power on the part of the representative of the leave by the daring of a immense devotion it will be see later on what a combination of accidental circumstance prevent this idea from be realize as i then purpose the representative have do they whole duty providence perhaps have not do all on its side be it as it may suppose that we be not at once carry off by some nocturnal and immediate combat and that at the hour at which i be speak we have still a to-morrow i feel the necessity of fix every eye upon the course which should be adopt on the day which be about to follow -- i speak i begin by completely unveil the situation i paint the picture in four word : the constitution throw into the gutter the assembly drive to prison with the butt-end of a musket the council of state disperse the high court expel by a galley-sergeant a manifest beginning of victory for loui bonaparte pari ensnare in the army as though in a net bewilderment everywhere all authority overthrow all compact annul two thing only remain stand the _ coup d'état _ and ourselves ourselves and who be we we be say i we be truth and justice we be the supreme and sovereign power the people incarnate -- right i continue -- loui bonaparte at every minute which elapse advance a step further in he crime for he nothing be inviolable nothing be sacred this morning he violate the palace of the representative of the nation a few hour later he lay violent hand on they person to-morrow perhaps in a few moment he will shed they blood well then he march upon we let we march upon he the danger grow greater let we grow greater with the danger a movement of assent pass through the assembly i continue -- i repeat and insist let we show no mercy to this wretched bonaparte for any of the enormity which he outrage contain as he have draw the wine -- i should say the blood -- he must drink it up we be not individual we be the nation each of we walk forth clothe with the sovereignty of the people he can not strike we person without rend that let we compel he volley to pierce we sash as well as we breast this man be on a road where logic grasp he and lead he to parricide what he be kill in this moment be the country well then when the ball of executive power pierce the sash of legislative power it be visible parricide it be this that must be understand we be quite ready they cry out what measure would you advise we to adopt no half measure answer i a deed of grandeur to-morrow -- if we leave here this night -- let we all meet in the faubourg st antoine they interpose why the faubourg st antoine yes resume i the faubourg st antoine i can not believe that the heart of the people have cease to beat there let we all meet to-morrow in the faubourg st

this salle roysin but at what time not too early in the morning in broad day it be necessary that the shop should be open that people should be come and go that the population should be move about that there should be plenty of people in the street that they should see we that they should recognize we that the grandeur of we example should strike every eye and stir every heart let we all be there between nine and ten o'clock in the morning if we can not obtain the salle roysin we will take the first church at hand a stable a shed some enclosure where we can deliberate at need as michel de bourge have say we will hold we sitting in a square bound by four barricade but provisionally i suggest the salle roysin do not forget that in such a crisis there must be no vacuum before the nation that alarm it there must be a government somewhere and it must be know the rebellion at the elysée the government at the faubourg st antoine the leave the government the faubourg st antoine the citadel such be the idea which from to-morrow we must impress upon the mind of pari to the salle roysin then thence in the midst of the dauntless throng of workman of that great district of pari enclose in the faubourg as in a fortress be both legislator and general multiply and invent means of defense and of attack launch proclamation and unearth the pavement employ the woman in write out placard while the man be fight we will issue a warrant against loui bonaparte we will issue warrant against he accomplice we will declare the military chief traitor we will outlaw in a body all the crime and all the criminal we will summon the citizen to arm we will recall the army to duty we will rise up before loui bonaparte terrible as the living republic we will fight on the one hand with

the center we be the committee of resistance the soul of the insurrection if we be to go to the faubourg st antoine which be occupy by a considerable force we should give ourselves up to loui bonaparte they remind I of what i myself have say on the subject the previous evening in the rue blanche we must immediately organize the insurrection against the _ coup d'état _ and organize it in practicable district that be to say in the old labyrinth of the street st deni and st martin we must draw up proclamation prepare decree create some method of publicity they be wait for important communication from workman 's association and secret society the great blow which i wish to strike by we solemn meeting at the salle roysin would prove a failure they think it they duty to remain

for myself i could not fail to go to the rendezvous which i myself have fix all the reason which they have give I be good nevertheless i could have oppose some doubt but the discussion would have take

emotion which i have feel on the previous day before a regiment of cuirassier again seize I to see before I the assassin of the country at a few step stand upright in the insolence of a peaceful triumph be beyond my strength : i could not contain myself i draw out my sash i hold it in my hand and put my arm and head out of the window of the _ fiacre _ and shake the sash i shout -- soldier

this incident and characterize it as a insensate and culpable provocation state that the moderation show by the military leader on this occasion do honor to general -- : we leave to the author of this

faubourg on the curb of the pavement the soldier be station at every five pace with the butt of they musket rest on they hip they chest draw in they right hand on the trigger ready to bring to the present keep silence in the attitude of expectation from that point a piece of cannon be station at the mouth of each of the side street which open out of the main road of the faubourg occasionally there be a mortar to obtain a clear idea of this military arrangement one must imagine two rosary extend along the two side of the faubourg st antoine of which the soldier should form the link and the cannon the bead meanwhile my driver become uneasy he turn round to I and say it look as though we should find barricade out there sir shall we turn back keep on i reply he continue to drive straight on suddenly it become impossible to do so a company of infantry range three deep occupy the whole of the street from one pavement to the other on the right there be a small street i say to the driver

paving-stone for the first barricade but nothing be stir de flotte alone in the midst of this desert and sleep faubourg wander from street to street throughout the night day break late in December before the first streak of dawn de flotte be at the rendezvous opposite the lenoir market this spot be only weakly guard the only troops in the neighborhood be the post itself of the lenoir market and another post at a short distance which occupy the guard-house at the corner of the faubourg and the rue de montreuil close to the old tree of liberty plant in 1793 by santerre neither of these post be command by officer de flotte reconnoitr the position he walk some time up and down the pavement and then see no one come as yet and fear to excite attention he go away and return to the side-street of

aubry to leave he house before daylight he walk to the faubourg st antoine as he reach the place of rendezvous he meet cournet and the other from the rue popincourt they be almost immediately join by malardier it be dawn the faubourg be solitary they walk along wrapt in thought and speaking in a low voice suddenly a impetuous and singular procession pass they they look round it be a detachment of lancer which surround something which in the dim light they recognize to be a police-van the vehicle roll noiselessly along the macadamize road they be debate what this could mean when a second and similar group appear then a third and then a fourth ten police van pass in this manner follow each other very closely and almost touch those be we colleague exclaim aubry -lrb- du nord -rrb- in truth the last batch of the representative prisoner of the quaus d'orsay the batch destine for vincenne be pass through the faubourg it be about seven o'clock in the morning some shop be be open and be light inside and a few passer-by come out of the house three carriage defile one after the other closed guard dreary dumb no voice come out no cry no whisper they be carry off in the midst of sword of sabre and of lance with the rapidity and fury of the whirlwind something which keep silence and that something which they be carry off and which maintain this sinister silence be the broken tribune the sovereignty of the assembly the supreme initiative whence all civilization be derive it be the word which contain the future of the world it be the speech of france a last carriage arrive which by some chance have be delay it be about two or three hundred yard behind the principal convoy and be only escort by three lancer it be not a police-van it be a omnibus the only one in the convoy behind the conductor who be a police agent there could distinctly be see the representative heap up in the interior it seem easy to rescue they cournet appeal to the passer-by citizen he cry these be you representative who be be carry off you have just see they pass in the van of convict bonaparte arrest they contrary to every law let we rescue they to arm a knot form of man in blouse and of workman go to work a shout come from the knot long live the republic and some man rush towards the vehicle the carriage and the lancer break into a gallop to arm repeat cournet to arm repeat the man of the people there be a moment of impulse who know what might have happen it would have be a singular accident if the first barricade against the _ coup d'état _ have be make with this omnibus which after have aid in the crime would this have aid in the punishment but at the moment when the people throw themselves on the vehicle they see several of the representative-prisoner which it contain sign to they with both hand to refrain eh say a workman they do not wish it a second repeat they do not wish for liberty another add they do not wish we to have it they do not wish it for themselves all be say and the omnibus be allow to pass on a moment afterwards the rear-guard of the escort come up and pass by at a sharp trot and the group which surround aubry -lrb- du nord -rrb- malardier and cournet disperse the café roysin have just open it may be remember that the large hall of this _ café _ have serve for the meeting of a famous club in 1848 it be there it may also be remember that the rendezvous have be settle the café roysin be enter by a passage open out upon the street a lobby of some yard in length be next cross and then come a large hall with high window and looking-glass on the wall contain in the center several billiard-table some small marble-topped table chair and velvet-covered bench it be this hall badly arrange however for a meeting where we could have deliberate which have be the hall of the roysin club cournet aubry and malardier install themselves there on enter they do not disguise who they be they be welcome and show a exit through the garden in case of necessity de flotte have just join they eight o'clock be striking when the representative begin to arrive bruckner maigne and brillier first and then successively charamaule cassal dulac bourzat madier de montjau and baudin bourzat on account of the mud as be he custom wear wooden shoe whoever think bourzat a peasant would be mistaken he rather resemble a benedictine monk bourzat with he southern imagination he quick intelligence keen lettered refined possess a encyclopedia in he head and wooden shoe on he foot why not he be mind and people the ex-constituent bastide come in with madier de montjau baudin shake the hand of all with warmth but he do not speak he be pensive what be the matter with you baudin ask aubry -lrb- du nord -rrb- be you mournful i say baudin raise he head i have never be more happy do he feel himself already choose when we be so near death all radiant with glory which smile upon we through the gloom perhaps we be conscious of it a certain number of man stranger to the assembly all as determine as the representative themselves accompany they and surround they cournet be the leader amongst they there be workman but no blouse in order not to alarm the middle class the workman have be request notably those employ by derosne and cail to come in coat baudin have with he a copy of the proclamation which i have dictate to he on the previous day cournet unfold it and read it let we at once post it up in the faubourg say he the people must know that loui bonaparte be outlaw a lithographic workman who be there offer to print it without delay all the representative present sign it and they add my name to they signature aubry -lrb- du nord -rrb- head it with these word national assembly the workman carry off the proclamation and keep he word some

maupas placard which threaten the penalty of death to any one who should be find post a appeal to arm group read the two bill at the same time we may mention a incident which ought to be note a sergeant of the line in uniform in red trousers accompany he and protect he he be doubtless a soldier who have lately leave the service the time fix on the precede evening for the general rendezvous be from nine to ten in the morning this hour have be choose so that there should be time to give notice to all the member of the leave it be expedient to wait until the representative should arrive so that the group should the more resemble a assembly and that its manifestation should have more authority on the faubourg several of the representative who have already arrive have no sash of office some be make hastily in a neighbor house with strip of red white and blue calico and be bring to they baudin and de flotte be amongst those who gird on these improvise sash meanwhile it be not yet nine o'clock when impatience already begin to be manifest around they -lrb- 9 -rrb- many share this glorious impatience baudin wish to wait do not anticipate the hour say he let we allow we colleague time to arrive but they murmur round baudin no begin give the signal go outside the faubourg only wait to see you sash to rise you be few in number but they know that you friend will rejoin you that be sufficient begin the result prove that this undue haste could only produce a failure meanwhile they consider that the first example which the representative of the people ought to set be personal courage the spark must not be allow to die out to march the first to march at the head such be they duty the semblance of any hesitation would have be in truth more disastrous than any degree of rashness schoelcher be of a heroic nature he have the grand impatience of danger let we go he cry we friend will join we let we go outside they have no arm let we disarm the post which be over there say schoelcher they leave the salle roysin in order two by two arm in arm fifteen or twenty man of the people escort they they go before they cry long live the republic to arm some child precede and follow they shout long live the mountain the entrance of the closed shop be half open a few man appear at the door a few woman show themselves at the window knot of workman go to they work watch they pass they cry long live we representative long live the republic sympathy be everywhere but insurrection nowhere the procession gather few adherent on the way a man who be lead a saddle horse join they they do not know this man nor whence this horse come it seem as if the man offer he service to any one who wish to fly representative dulac order this man to be off in this manner they reach the guard-house of the rue de montrenil at they approach the sentry give the alarm and the soldier come out of the guard-house in disorder schoelcher calm impassive in ruffle and a white tie clothe as usual in black button to the neck in he tight frock coat with the intrepid and brotherly air of a quaker walk straight up to they comrade he say to they we be the representative of the people and come in the name of the people to demand you arm for the defense of the constitution and of the law the post allow itself to be disarm the sergeant alone make any show of resistance but they say to he you be alone and he yield the representative distribute the gun and the cartridge to the resolute band which surround they some soldier exclaim why do you take away we musket we would fight for you and with you the representative consult whether they should accept this offer schoelcher be incline to do so but one of they remark that some mobile guard have make the same overture to the insurgent of June and have turn against the insurrection the arm which the insurrection have leave they the musket therefore be not restore the disarm have be accomplish the musket be count there be fifteen of they we be a hundred and fifty say cournet we have not enough musket well then say schoelcher where be there a post at the lenoir market let we disarm it with schoelcher at they head and escort by fifteen armed man the representative proceed to the lenoir market the post of the lenoir market allow themselves to be disarm even more willingly than the post in the rue de montreuil the soldier turn themselves round so that the cartridge might be take from they pouch the musket be immediately load now exclaim de flotte we have thirty gun let we look for a street corner and raise a barricade there be at that time about two hundred combatant they go up the rue de montreuil after some fifty step schoelcher say where be we go we be turn we back on the bastille we be turn we back upon the conflict they return towards the faubourg they shout to arm they where answer by long live we representative but only a few young man join they it be evident that the breeze of insurrection be not blow never mind say de flotte let we begin the battle let we achieve the glory of be the first kill as they reach the point where the street ste marguerite and de cotte open out and divide the faubourg a peasant 's cart laden with dung enter the rue ste marguerite here exclaim de flotte they stop the dung-cart and overturn it in the middle of the faubourg st antoine a milkwoman come up they overturn the milk-cart a baker be pass in he bread-cart he see what be be do attempt to escape and urge he horse to a gallop two or three street arab -- those child of pari brave as lion and agile as cat -- speed after the baker run past he horse which be still gallop stop it and bring back the cart to the barricade which have be begin they overturn the bread-cart a omnibus come up on the road from the bastille very well say the conductor i see what be go on he descend with a good grace and tell he passenger to get down while the coachman unharnessed he horse and go away shake he cloak they overturn the omnibus the four vehicle place end to end barely bar the street of the faubourg which in this part be very wide while put they in line the man of the barricade say -- let we not injure the cart more than we can help this form a indifferent barricade very low too short and which leave the pavement free on either side at this moment a staff officer pass by follow by a orderly see the barricade and flee at a gallop schoelcher calmly inspect the overturn vehicle when he reach the peasant 's cart which make a higher heap than the other he say that be the only good one the barricade grow larger they throw a few empty basket upon it which make it thicker and larger without strengthen it they be still work when a child come up to they shout the soldier in truth two company arrive from the bastille at the double through the faubourg tell off in squad at short distance apart and bar the whole of the street the door and the window be hastily close during this time at a corner of the barricade bastide impassive be gravely tell a story to madier de montjau madier say he nearly two hundred year ago the prince de condé ready to give battle in this very faubourg st antoine where we now be ask a officer who be accompany he ` have you ever see a battle lose ' -- ` no sire ' ` well then you will see one now ' -- madier i tell you to-day -- you will speedily see a barricade take in the meanwhile those who be arm have assume they place for the conflict behind the barricade the critical moment draw nigh citizen cry schoelcher do not fire a shot when the army and the faubourg fight the blood of the people be shed on both side let we speak to the soldier first he mount on one of the basket which heighten the barricade the other representative arrange themselves near he on the omnibus malardier and dulac be on he right dulac say to he you scarcely know I citizen schoelcher but i love you let I have the charge of remain by you side i only belong to the second rank in the assembly but i want to be in the first rank of the battle at this moment some man in blouse those whom the second of December have enlist appear at the corner of the rue ste marguerite close to the barricade and shout down with the ` twenty-five franc ' baudin who have already select he post for the combat and who be stand on the barricade look fixedly at these man and say to they -- you shall see how one can die for ` twenty-five franc ' there be a noise in the street some few door which have remain half open be close the two attack column have arrive in sight of the barricade further on could be see confusedly other line of bayonet they be those which have bar my passage schoelcher raise he arm with authority sign to the captain who command the first squad to halt the captain make a negative sign with he sword the whole of the second of December be in these two gesture the law say halt the sabre answer no the two company continue to advance but slowly and keep at the same distance from each other schoelcher come down from the barricade into the street de flotte dulac malardier brillier maigne and bruckner follow he then be see a grand spectacle seven representative of the people arm only with they sash that be to say majestically clothe with law and right advance in the street beyond the barricade and march straight to the soldier who await they with they gun point at they the other representative who have remain at the barricade make they last preparation for resistance the combatant maintain a intrepid bear the naval lieutenant cournet tower above they all with he tall stature baudin still stand on the overturn omnibus lean half over the barricade on see the representative approach the soldier and they officer be for the moment bewildered meanwhile the captain sign to the representative to stop they stop and schoelcher say in a impressive voice -- soldier we be the representative of the sovereign people we be you representative we be the elect of universal suffrage in the name of the constitution in the name of universal suffrage in the name of the republic we who be the national assembly we who be the law order you to join we we summon you to obey we ourselves be you leader the army belong to the people and the representative of the people be the chief of the army soldier loui bonaparte violate the constitution we have outlaw he obey we the officer who be in command a captain name petit do not allow he to finish gentleman he say i have my order i belong to the people i be a republican as you be but i be only a instrument you know the constitution say schoelcher i only know my instruction there be a instruction above all other instruction continue schoelcher obligatory upon the soldier as upon the citizen -- the law he turn again towards the soldier to harangue they but the captain cry out to he -- not another word you shall not go on if you add one word i shall give the order to fire what do that matter to we say schoelcher at this moment a officer arrive on horseback it be the major of the regiment he whisper for a moment to the captain gentleman representative continue the captain wave he sword withdraw or i shall fire fire shout de flotte the representative -- strange and heroic copy of fontenoy -- take off they hat and face the musket schoelcher alone keep he hat on he head and wait with he arm cross fix bayonet say the captain and turn towards the squad charge vive la république cry out the representative the bayonet be lower the company move forward the soldier come on at the double upon the motionless representative it be a terrible and superb moment the seven representative see the bayonet at they breast without a word without a gesture without one step backwards but the hesitation which be not in they soul be in the heart of the soldier the soldier feel distinctly that this be a double stain upon they uniform -- the outrage upon the representative of the people -- which be treason and the slaughter of unarmed man which be cowardice now treason and cowardice be two epaulet to which a general sometimes become reconcile the soldier -- never when the bayonet be so close to the representative that they touch they breast they turn aside of they own accord and the soldier 's by a unanimous movement pass between the representative without do they any harm schoelcher alone have he coat pierce in two place and in he opinion this be awkwardness instead of intention one of the soldier who face he wish to push he away from the captain and touch he with he bayonet the point encounter the book of the address of the representative which schoelcher have in he pocket and only pierce he clothing a soldier say to de flotte citizen we do not wish to hurt you nevertheless a soldier come up to bruckner and point he gun at he well say bruckner fire the soldier touch lower he arm and shake bruckner 's hand it be singular that notwithstanding the order give by the officer the two company successively come up to the representative charge with the bayonet and turn aside instruction may order but instinct prevail instruction may be crime but instinct be honor major p -- say afterwards they have tell we that we should have to deal with brigand we have to deal with hero meanwhile those on the barricade be grow uneasy and see they colleague surround and wish to succor they they fire a musket shot this unfortunate shot kill a soldier between de flotte and schoelcher the officer who command the second attack squad pass close to schoelcher as the poor soldier fall schoelcher point out the fall man to the officer and say to he lieutenant look the officer answer by a gesture of despair -- what would you have we do the two company reply to the shoot by a general volley and rush to the assault of the barricade leave behind they the seven representative astounded at be still alive the barricade reply by a volley but it could not hold out it be carry baudin be kill he have remain standing in he position on the omnibus three ball reach he one strike he in the right eye and penetrate into the brain he fall he never regain consciousness half-an-hour afterwards he be dead he body be take to the ste marguerite hospital bourzat who be close to baudin with aubry -lrb- du nord -rrb- have he coat pierce by a ball we must again remark a curious incident -- the soldier make no prisoner on this barricade those who defend it disperse through the street of the faubourg or take refuge in the neighbor house representative maigne push by some affrighted woman behind a door be shut in with one of the soldier who have just take the barricade a moment afterwards the soldier and the representative go out together the representative could freely leave this first field of battle at this solemn moment of the struggle a last glimmer of justice and of right still flicker and military honesty recoil with a sort of dread anxiety before the outrage upon which they be enter there be the intoxication of good and there be a intoxication of evil : this intoxication later on drown the conscience of the army the french army be not make to commit crime when the struggle become prolonged and ferocious order of the day have to be execute the soldier must have be madden they obey not coldly which would have be monstrous but with anger and this history will invoke as they excuse and with many perhaps despair be at the root of they anger the fall soldier have remain on the ground it be schoelcher who raise he a few woman weep but brave come out of a house some soldier come up they carry he schoelcher hold he head first to a fruiterer 's shop then to the ste marguerite hospital where they have already take baudin he be a conscript the ball have enter he side through he gray overcoat button to the collar could be see a hole stain with blood he head have sink on he shoulder he pale countenance encircle by the chinstrap of he shako have no longer any expression the blood ooze out of he mouth he seem barely eighteen year old already a soldier and still a boy he be dead this poor soldier be the first victim of the _ coup d'état _ baudin be the second before be a republican baudin have be a tutor he come from that intelligent and brave race of schoolmaster ever persecute who have fall from the guizot law into the falloux law and from the falloux law into the dupanloup law the crime of the schoolmaster be to hold a book open that suffice the church condemn he there be now in france in each village a light torch -- the schoolmaster -- and a mouth which blow upon it -- the curé the schoolmaster of france who know how to die of hunger for truth and for science be worthy that one of they race should be kill for liberty the first time that i see baudin be at the assembly on January 13 1850 i wish to speak against the law of instruction i have not put my name down baudin 's name stand second he offer I he turn i accept and i be able to speak two day afterwards on the 15th baudin be one of the target of sieur dupin for call to order and official annoyance he share this honor with the representative miot and valentin baudin ascend the tribune several time he mode of speak outwardly hesitate be energetic in the main he sit on the crest of the mountain he have a firm spirit and timid manners thence there be in he constitution a indescribable embarrassment mingle with decision he be a man of middle height he face ruddy and full he broad chest he wide shoulder announce the robust man the laborer-schoolmaster the peasant-thinker in this he resemble bourzat baudin lean he head on he shoulder listen with intelligence and speak with a gentle and grave voice he have the melancholy air and the bitter smile of the doom on the evening of the second of December i have ask he how old be you he have answer I not quite thirty-three year and you say he forty-nine and he reply -- to-day we be of the same age he think in truth of that to-morrow which await we and in which be hide that perhaps which be the great leveller the first shot have be fire a representative have fall and the people do not rise what bandage have they on they eye what weight have they on they heart alas the gloom which loui bonaparte have know how to cast over he crime far from lift grow denser for the first time in the sixty year that the providential era of revolution have be open pari the city of intelligence seem not to understand on leave the barricade of the rue ste marguerite de flotte go to the faubourg st marceau madier de montjau go to belleville charamaule and maigne proceed to the boulevard schoelcher dulac malardier and brillier again go up the faubourg st antoine by the side street which the soldier have not yet occupy they shout vive la république they harangue the people on the doorstep : be it the empire that you want exclaimed schoelcher they even go as far as to sing the marseillaise people take off they hat as they pass and shout long live the representative but that be all they be thirsty and weary in the rue de reuilly a man come out of a door with a bottle in he hand and offer they drink sartin join they on the way in the rue de charonne they enter the meeting-place of the association of cabinet maker hope to find there the committee of the association in session there be no one there but nothing discourage they as they reach the place de la bastille dulac say to schoelcher i will ask permission to leave you for a hour or two for this reason : i be alone in pari with my little daughter who be seven year old for the past week she have have scarlet fever yesterday when the _ coup d'état _ burst forth she be at death 's door i have no one but this child in the world i leave she this morning to come with you and she say to I ` papa where be you go ' as i be not kill i will go and see if she be not dead two hour afterwards the child be still live and we be hold a permanent sit at no 15 rue richelieu jule favre carnot michel de bourge and myself when dulac enter and say to we i have come to place myself at you disposal -lrb- 9 -rrb- there be also a misunderstanding respect the appoint time some make a mistake and think it be nine o'clock the first arrival impatiently await they colleague they be as we have say some twelve or fifteen in number at half-past eight ` time be be lose ' exclaim one of they who have hardly enter ` let we gird on we sash let we show the representative to the people let we join it in raise barricade ' we shall perhaps save the country at all event we shall save the honor of we party ` come let we to the barricade ' this advice be immediately and unanimously acclaimed : one alone citizen baudin interpose the forcible objection ` we be not sufficiently numerous to adopt such a resolution ' but he spiritedly join in the general enthusiasm and with a calm conscience after have reserve the principle he be not the last to gird on he sash -- schoelcher _ histoire des crime du 2d decembre _ pp 130-131 chapter iv the workman 's society ask we for the order to fight in presence of the fact of the barricade of the faubourg st antoine so heroically construct by the representative so sadly neglect by the populace the last illusion even mine should have be disperse baudin kill the faubourg cold such thing speak aloud it be a supreme manifest absolute demonstration of that fact the inaction of the people to which i could not resign myself -- a deplorable inaction if they understand a self-treason if they do not understand a fatal neutrality in every case a calamity of which all the responsibility we repeat recoil not upon the people but upon those who in June 1848 after have promise they amnesty have refuse it and who have unhinge the great soul of the people of pari by break faith with they what the constituent assembly have sow the legislative assembly harvest we innocent of the fault have to submit to the consequence the spark which we have see flash for a instant through the crowd -- michel de bourge from the height of bonvalet 's balcony myself from the boulevard du temple -- this spark seem extinguish maigne firstly then brillier then bruckner later on charmaule madier de montjau bastide and dulac come to report to we what have pass at the barricade of st antoine the motive which have decide the representative present not to await the hour appoint for the rendezvous and baudin 's death the report which i make myself of what i have see and which cassal and alexander rey complete by add new circumstance enable we to ascertain the situation the committee could no longer hesitate : i myself renounce the hope which i have base upon a grand manifestation upon a powerful reply to the _ coup d'état _ upon a sort of pitched battle wage by the guardian of the republic against the bandit of the elysée the faubourg fail we we possess the lever -- right but the mass to be raise the people we do not possess there be nothing more to hope for as those two great orator michel de bourge and jule favre with they keen political perception have declare from the first save a slow long struggle avoid decisive engagement change quarter keep pari on the alert say to each it be not at a end leave time for the department to prepare they resistance weary the troops out and in which struggle the parisian people who do not long smell powder with impunity would perhaps ultimately take fire barricade raise everywhere barely defend re-made immediately disappear and multiply themselves at the same time such be the strategy indicate by the situation the committee adopt it and send order in every direction to this effect at that moment we be sit at no 15 rue richelieu at the house of we colleague grévy who have be arrest in the tenth arrondissement on the precede day who be at maza he brother have offer we he house for we deliberation the representative we natural emissary flock around we and

the deposition vote by the right with the outlawry vote by we we come back into the large room to read it to the assemble representative and for they to sign it at this moment the door open and emile de girardin appear we have not see he since the previous evening emile de girardin -- after disperse from around he that mist which envelope every combatant in party warfare and which at a distance change or obscure the appearance of a man -- emile de girardin be a extraordinary thinker a accurate writer energetic logical skilful hearty a journalist in whom as in all great journalist can be see the statesman we owe to emile de girardin this great work of progress the cheap press emile de girardin have this great gift a clearheaded stubbornness emile de girardin be a public watchman he journal be he sentry-box he wait he watch he spy out he enlighten he lie in wait he cry who go there at the slightest alarm he fire volley with he pen he be ready for every form of combat a sentinel to-day a general to-morrow like all earnest mind he understand he see he recognize he handle so to speak the great and magnificent identity embrace under these three word revolution progress liberty he wish for the revolution but above all through progress he wish for progress but solely through liberty one can and accord to we opinion sometimes rightly differ from he as to the road to be take as to the attitude to be assume and the position to be maintain but no one can deny he courage which he have prove in every form nor reject he object which be the moral and physical amelioration of the lot of all emile de girardin be more democratic than republican more socialist than democratic on the day when these three idea democracy republicanism socialism that be to say the principle the form and the application be balance in he mind the oscillation which still exist in he will cease he have already power he will have stability in the course of this sit as we shall see i do not always agree with emile de girardin all the more reason that i should record here how greatly i appreciate the mind form of light and of courage emile de girardin whatever he failing may be be one of those man who do honor to the press of to-day he unite in the highest degree the dexterity of the combatant with the serenity of the thinker i go up to he and i ask he -- have you any workman of the _ presse _ still remain he answer I -- we press be under seal and guard by the _ gendarmerie mobile _ but i have five or six willing workman they can produce a few placard with the brush well then say i print we decree and we proclamation i will print anything answer he as long as it be not a appeal to arm he add address himself to I i know you proclamation it be a war-cry i can not print that they remonstrate at this he then declare that he for he part make proclamation but in a different sense from ours that accord to he loui bonaparte should not be combate by force of arm but by create a vacuum by a armed conflict he would be the conqueror by a vacuum he would be conquer he urge we to aid he in isolate the depose of the second December let we bring about a vacuum around he cry emile de girardin let we proclaim a universal strike let the merchant cease to sell let the consumer cease from buy let the workman cease from work let the butcher cease from kill let the baker cease from bake let everything keep holiday even to the national printing office so that loui bonaparte may not find a compositor to compose the _ moniteur _ not a pressman to machine it not a bill-sticker to placard it isolation solitude a void space round this man let the nation withdraw from he every power from which the nation withdraw fall like a tree from which the root be divide loui bonaparte abandon by all in he crime will vanish away by simply folding we arm as we stand around he he will fall on the other hand fire on he and you will consolidate he the army be intoxicate the people be daze and do not interfere the middle class be afraid of the president of the people of you of every one no victory be possible you will go straight before you like brave man you risk you head very good you will carry with you two or three thousand daring man whose blood mingle with yours already flow it be heroic i grant you it be not politic as for I i will not print a appeal to arm and i reject the combat let we organize a universal strike this point of view be haughty and superb but unfortunately i feel it to be unattainable two aspect of the truth seize girardin the logical side and the practical side here in my opinion the practical side be want michel de bourges answer he michel de bourge with he sound logic and quick reasoning put he finger on what be for we the immediate question the crime of loui bonaparte the necessity to rise up erect before this crime it be rather a conversation than a debate but michel de bourge and jule favre who speak next raise it to the highest eloquence jule favre worthy to understand the powerful mind of girardin would willingly have adopt this idea if it have seem practicable of the universal strike of the void around the man he find it great but impossible a nation do not pull up short even when strike to the heart it still move on social movement which be the animal life of society survive all political movement whatever emile de girardin might hope there would always be a butcher who would kill a baker who would bake man must eat to make universal labor fold its arm be a chimera say jule favre a dream the people fight for three day for four day for a week society will not wait indefinitely as to the situation it be doubtless terrible it be doubtless tragical and blood flow but who have bring about this situation loui bonaparte for ourselves we would accept it such as it be and nothing more emile de girardin steadfast logical absolute in he idea persist some might be shake argument which be so abundant in this vigorous and inexhaustible mind crowd upon he as for I i see duty before I like a torch i interrupted he i cry out it be too late to deliberate what we be to do we have not get to do it it be do the gauntlet of the _ coup d'état _ be throw down the left take it up the matter be as simple as this the outrage of the second December be a infamous insolent unprecedented defiance to democracy to civilization to liberty to the people to france i repeat that we have take up this gauntlet we be the law but the living law which at need can arm itself and fight a gun in we hand be a protest i do not know whether we shall conquer but it be we duty to protest to protest first in parliament when parliament be close to protest in the street when the street be close to protest in exile when exile be fulfil to protest in the tomb such be we part we office we mission the authority of the representative be elastic the people bestow it event extend it while we be deliberate we colleague napoleon bonaparte son of the ex-king of westphalium come in he listen he speak he energetically blame in a tone of sincere and generous indignation he cousin 's crime but he declare that in he opinion a write protest would suffice a protest of the representative a protest of the council of state a protest of the magistracy a protest of the press that this protest would be unanimous and would enlighten france but that no other form of resistance would obtain unanimity that as for himself have always consider the constitution worthless have contend against it from the first in the constituent assembly he would not defend it at the last that he assuredly would not give one drop of blood for it that the constitution be dead but that the republic be live and that we must save not the constitution a corpse but the republic the principle remonstrance burst forth bancel young glowing eloquent impetuous overflow with self-confidence cry out that we ought not to look at the shortcoming of the constitution but at the enormity of the crime which have be commit the flagrant treason the violate oath he declare that we might have vote against the constitution in the constituent assembly and yet defend it to-day in the presence of a usurper that this be logical and that many amongst we be in this position he cite I as a example victor hugo say he be a proof of this he conclude thus : you have be present at the construction of a vessel you have consider it badly build you have give advice which have not be listen to nevertheless you have be oblige to embark on board this vessel you child and you brother be there with you you mother be on board a pirate range up axe in one hand to scuttle the vessel a torch in the other to fire it the crew be resolve to defend themselves and run to arm would you say to this crew ` for my part i consider this vessel badly build and i will let it be destroy ' in such a case add edgar quinet whoever be not on the side of the vessel be on the side of the pirate they shout on all side the decree read the decree i be stand lean against the fire place napoleon bonaparte come up to I and whisper in my ear -- you be undertake say he a battle which be lose beforehand i answer he i do not look at success i look at duty he reply you be a politician consequently you ought to look forward to success i repeat before you go any further that the battle be lose beforehand i resume if we enter upon the conflict the battle be lose you say so i believe it but if we do not enter upon it honor be lose i would rather lose the battle than honor he remain silent for a moment then he take my hand be it so continue he but listen to I you run you yourself personally great dancer of all the man in the assembly you be the one whom the president hate the most you have from the height of the tribune nickname he ` napoleon the little ' you understand that will never be forget besides it be you who dictate the appeal to arm and that be know if you be take you be lose you will be shoot on the spot or at least transport have you a safe place where you can sleep to-night i have not as yet think of this in truth no answer i he continue well then come to my house there be perhaps only one house in paris where you would be in safety that be mine they will not come to look for you there come day or night at what hour you please i will await you and i will open the door to you myself i live at no 5 rue d'alger i thank he it be a noble and cordial offer i be touch by it i do not make use of it but i have not forget it

request that in the first place the meeting should declare itself to be the national assembly and constitute itself by immediately appoint a president and secretary i remark that there be no need to declare ourselves the assembly that we be the assembly by right as well as in fact and the whole assembly we absent colleague be detain by force that the national assembly although mutilate by the _ coup d'état _ ought to preserve its entity and remain constitute afterwards in the same manner as before that to appoint another president and another staff of secretary would be to give loui bonaparte a advantage over we and to acknowledge in some manner the dissolution that we ought to do nothing of the sort that we decree should be publish not with the signature of a president whoever he might be but with the signature of all the member of the left who have not be arrest that they would thus carry with they full authority over the people and full effect they relinquish the idea of appoint a president noël parfait propose that we decree and we resolution should be draw up not with the formulum : the national assembly decree etc but with the formulum : the representative of the people remain at liberty decree etc in this manner we should preserve all the authority attach to the office of the representative of the people without associate the arrest representative with the

the most formidable means of destruction against the life and property of the citizen of pari that he have trample under foot every law that he have annihilate all the guarantee of civilized nation : consider that these criminal madness only serve to augment the violent denunciation of every conscience and to hasten the hour of national vengeance but that it be important to proclaim the right :

not rise if they do not understand that it be for they for they rights that we the representative that we risk we head at this moment -- if they leave we alone at the breach in the presence of the _ coup d'état _ -- it be because they be not worthy of liberty bancel remark that the abolition of the _ octrous _ duty and the duty on liquor be not caress to the people but succor to the poor a great economical and reparatory measure a satisfaction to the public demand -- a satisfaction which the right have always obstinately refuse and that the left master of the situation ought hasten to accord

only two or three little child seat round a lamp laughing and look at picture in a book -lrb- 11 -rrb- this list which belong to history have serve as the base of the proscription list will be find complete in the sequel to this book to be publish hereafter chapter vii the archbishop on this gloomy and tragical day a idea strike one of the people he be a workman belong to the honest but almost imperceptible minority of catholic democrat the double exaltation of he mind revolutionary on one side mystical on the other cause he to be somewhat distrust by the people even by he comrade and he friend sufficiently devout to be call a jesuit by the socialist sufficiently republican to be call a red by the reactionist he form a exception in the workshop of the faubourg now what be need in these supreme crisis to seize and govern the mass be man of exceptional genius not man of exceptional opinion there be no revolutionary originality in order to be something in the time of regeneration and in the day of social combat one must bathe fully in those powerful homogeneous medium which be call party great current of man follow great current of idea and the true revolutionary leader be he who know how best to drive the former in accordance with the latter now the gospel be in accordance with the revolution but catholicism be not this be due to the fact that in the main the papacy be not in accordance with the gospel one can easily understand a christian republican one can not understand a catholic democrat it be a combination of two opposite it be a mind in which the negative bar the way to the affirmative it be a neuter now in time revolution whoever be neuter of be impotent nevertheless during the first hour of resistance against the _ coup d'état _ the democratic catholic workman whose noble effort we be here relate throw himself so resolutely into the cause of justice and of truth that in a few moment he transform distrust into confidence and be hail by the people he show such gallantry at the rising of the barricade of the rue aumaire that with a unanimous voice they appoint he they leader at the moment of the attack he defend it as he have build it with ardor that be a sad but glorious battle-field most of he companion be kill and he escape only by a miracle however he succeed in return home say to himself bitterly all be lose it seem evident to he that the great mass of the people would not rise thenceforward it appear impossible to conquer the _ coup d'état _ by a revolution it could be only combate by legality what have be the risk at the begin become the hope at the end for he believe the end to be fatal and at hand in he opinion it be necessary as the people be defaulter to try now to arouse the middle class let one legion of national guard go out in arm and the elysée be lose for this a decisive blow must be strike -- the heart of the middle class must be reach -- the bourgeois must be inspire by a grand spectacle which should not be a terrifying spectacle it be then that this thought come to this workman write to the archbishop of paris the workman take a pen and from he humble garret he write to the archbishop of paris a enthusiastic and earnest letter in which he a man of the people and a believer say this to he bishop we give the substance of he letter : -- this be a solemn hour civil war set by the ear the army and people blood be be shed when blood flow the bishop go forth m sibor should follow in the path of m affre the example be great the opportunity be still greater let the archbishop of pari follow by all he clergy the pontifical cross before he he mitre on he head go forth in procession through the street let he summon to he the national assembly and the high court the legislator in they sash the judge in they scarlet robe let he summon to he the citizen let he summon to he the soldier let he go straight to the elysée let he raise he hand in the name of justice against the man who be violate the law and in the name of jesus against the man who be shed blood simply with he raise hand he will crush the _ coup d'état _ and he will place he statue by the side of m affre and it will be say that twice two archbishop of pari have trample civil war beneath they foot the church be holy but the country be sacred there be time when the church should succor the country the letter be finish he sign it with he workman 's signature but now a difficulty arise how should it be convey to its destination take it himself but would he a mere workman in a blouse be allow to penetrate to the archbishop and then in order to reach the archiepiscopal palace he would have to cross those very quarter in insurrection and where perhaps the resistance be still active he would have to pass through street obstruct by troops he would be arrest and search he hand smell of powder he would be shoot and the letter would not reach its destination what be to be do at the moment when he have almost despaired of a solution the name of arnauld de l'ariége come to he mind arnauld de l'ariége be a representative after he own heart arnauld de l'ariége be a noble character he be a catholic democrat like the workman at the assembly he raise aloft but he bear nearly alone that banner so little follow which aspire to ally the democracy with the church arnauld de l'ariége young handsome eloquent

obtain a fleeting glimpse he could no longer resist arrest maza the cell the hulk the firing party all vanish the idea of danger be obliterate he go home it be precisely at that moment that the workman arrive there arnauld de l'ariége receive he read he letter and approve of it arnauld de l'ariége know the archbishop of pari personally m sibor a republican priest appoint archbishop of pari by general cavaignac be the true chief of the church dream of by the liberal catholicism of arnauld de l'ariége on behalf of the archbishop arnauld de l'ariége represent in the assembly that catholicism which m de montalembert pervert the democratic representative and the republic archbishop have at time frequent conference in which act as intermediatory the abbé maret a intelligent

of the encroachment of the clerical party upon the episcopal authority and he even propose shortly to interpellate the ministry on this subject and to take the question into the tribune arnauld add to the workman 's letter a letter of introduction sign by himself and enclose the two letter in the same envelope but here the same question arise how be the letter to be deliver arnauld for still weightier reason than those of the workman could not take it himself and time press he wife see he difficulty and quietly say -- i will take charge of it madame arnauld de l'ariége handsome and quite young married scarcely two year be the daughter of the republican ex-constituent guichard worthy daughter of such a father and worthy wife of such a husband they be fight in paris it be necessary to face the danger of the street to pass among musket-ball to risk she life arnauld de l'ariége hesitate what do you want to do he ask i will take this letter you yourself i myself but there be danger she raise she eye and answer -- do i make that objection to you when you leave I the day before yesterday he kiss she with tear in he eye and answer go but the police of the _ coup d'état _ be

read they and remain thoughtful what answer be i to take back to my husband ask madame arnauld madame reply the archbishop it be too late this should have be do before the struggle begin now it would be only to risk the shed of more blood than perhaps have yet be spill the abbé deguerry be silent the abbé maret try respectfully to turn the mind of he bishop towards the grand effort unsoiled by the workman he speak eloquently he lay great stress open this argument that the appearance of the archbishop would bring about a manifestation of the national guard and that a manifestation of the national guard would compel the elysée to draw back no say the archbishop you hope for the impossible the elysée will not draw back now you believe that i should stop the bloodshed -- not at all i should cause it to flow and that in torrent the national guard have no longer any influence if the legion appear the elysée could crush the legion by the regiment and then what be a archbishop in the presence of the man of the _ coup d'état _ where be the oath where be the swear faith where be the respect for right a man do not turn back when he have make three step in such a crime no no do not hope this man will do all he have strike the law in the hand of the representative he will strike god in mine and he dismiss madame arnauld with the look of a man overwhelm with sorrow let we do the

association of the rights of man be in the street the ex-constituent beslay have assemble in the passage du caire six or seven hundred workman from the marai and have post they in the street surround the bank new barricade would probably be construct during the evening the forward movement of the resistance be be precipitate the hand-to-hand struggle which the committee have wish to delay seem imminent all be rush forward with a sort of irresistible impulse should we follow it or should we stop should we run the risk of bring matter to a end with one blow which should be the last and which would manifestly leave one adversary on the ground -- either the empire or the republic the workman 's society ask for we instruction they still hold in reserve they three or four thousand combatant and they could accord to the order which the committee should give they either continue to restrain they or send they under fire without delay they believe themselves curtain of they adherent they would do whatever we should decide upon while not hide from we that the workman wish for a immediate conflict and that it would be somewhat hazardous to leave they time to become calm the majority of the member of the committee be still in favor of a certain slacken of action which should tend to prolong the struggle and it be difficult to say that they be in the wrong it be certain that if they could protract the situation in which the _ coup d'état _ have throw pari until the next week loui bonaparte be lose pari do not allow herself to be trample upon by a army for a whole week nevertheless i be for my own part impress with the following : -- the workman 's society offer we three or four thousand combatant a powerful assistance -- the workman do not understand strategy he live on enthusiasm abatement of ardor discourage he he zeal be not extinguish but it cool : -- three thousand to-day would be five hundred to-morrow and then some serious incident have just take place on the boulevard we be still ignorant of what it actually be : we could not foresee what consequence it might bring about but seem to I impossible that the still unknown but yet violent event which have just take place would not modify the situation and consequently change we plan of battle i begin to speak to this effect i state that we ought to accept the offer of the association and to throw they at once into the struggle i add that revolutionary warfare often necessitate sudden change of tactic that a general in the open country and before the enemy operate as he wish it be all clear around he he know the effective strength of he soldier the number of he regiment so many man so many horse so many cannon he know he strength and the strength of he enemy he choose he hour and he ground he have a map under he eye he see what he be do he be sure of he reserve he possess they he keep they back he utilize they when he wish he always have they by he but for ourselves cry i we be in a undefined and inconceivable position we be step at a venture upon unknown risk who be against we we hardly know who be with we we be ignorant how many soldier how many gun how many cartridge nothing but the darkness perhaps the entire people perhaps no one keep a reserve but who would answer for this reserve it be a army to-day it will be a handful of dust to-morrow we only can plainly distinguish we duty as regard all the rest it be black darkness we be guess at everything we be ignorant of everything we be fight a blind battle let we strike all the blow that can be strike let we advance straight before we at random let we rush upon the danger and let we have faith for as we be justice and the law god must be with we in this obscurity let we accept this glorious and gloomy enterprise of right disarm yet still fight the ex-constituent leblond and the delegate king be consult by the committee second my advice the committee decide that the society should be request in we name to come down into the street immediately and to call out they force but we be keep nothing for to-morrow object a member of the committee what ally shall we have to-morrow victory say jule favre carnot and michel de bourge remark that it would be advisable for those member of the association who belong to the national guard to wear they uniform this be accordingly settle the delegate king rise -- citizen representative say he these order will be immediately transmit we friend be ready in a few hour they will assemble to-night barricade and the combat i ask he would it be useful to you if a representative a member of the committee be with you to-night with he sash gird doubtless he answer well then resume i here i be take I we will all go exclaimed jule favre the delegate observe that it would suffice for one of we to be there at the moment when the society should make they appearance and that he could then notify the other member of the committee to come and join he it be settle that as soon as the place of meeting and the rallying-point should be agree upon he would send some one to let I know and to take I wherever the society might be before a hour 's time you shall hear from I say he on leave we as the delegate be go away mathieu de la drôme arrive on come in he halt on the threshold of the door he be pale he cry out to we you be no longer in paris you be no longer under the republic you be in naple and under king bomba he have come from the boulevard later on i again see mathieu de la drôme i say to he worse than bomba -- satan chapter xviii the verification of moral law the carnage of the boulevard montmartre constitute the originality of the _ coup d'état _ without this butchery the 2d of December would only be a 18th brumaire owe to the massacre loui bonaparte escape the charge of plagiarism up to that time he have only be a imitator the little hat at boulogne the gray overcoat the tame eagle appear grotesque what do this parody mean people ask he make they laugh suddenly he make they tremble he who become detestable cease to be ridiculous loui bonaparte be more than detestable he be execrable he envy the hugeness of great crime he wish to equal the worst this strive after the horrible have give he a special place to himself in the menagerie of tyrant petty rascality try to emulate deep villainy a little nero swell himself to a huge lacénaire such be this phenomenon art for art assassination for assassination loui bonaparte have create a special genus it be in this manner that loui bonaparte make he entry into the unexpected this reveal he certain brain be abyss manifestly for a long time past bonaparte have harbor the design of assassinate in order to reign premeditation haunt criminal and it be in this manner that treason begin the crime be a long time present in they but shapeless and shadowy they be scarcely conscious of it soul only blacken gradually such abominable deed be not invent in a moment they do not attain perfection at once and at a single bind they increase and ripen shapeless and indecisive and the center of the idea in which they exist keep they live ready for the appoint day and vaguely terrible this design the massacre for a throne we feel sure exist for a long time in loui bonaparte 's mind it be class among the possible event of this soul it dart hither and thither like a _ larva _ in a aquarium mingle with shadow with doubt with desire with expedient with dream of one know not what caesarian socialism like a hydra dimly visible in a transparency of chaos hardly be he aware that he be foster this hideous idea when he need it he find it armed and ready to serve he he unfathomable brain have darkly nourished it abyss be the nursery of monster up to this formidable day of the 4th December loui bonaparte do not perhaps quite know himself those who study this curious imperial animal do not believe he capable of such pure and simple ferocity they see in he a indescribable mongrel apply the talent of a swindler to the dream of a empire who even when crown would be a thief who would say of a parricide what roguery incapable of gain a footing on any height even of infamy always remain half-way uphill a little above petty rascal a little below great malefactor they believe he clever at effect all that be do in gambling-hell and in robber ' cave but with this transposition that he would cheat in the cave and that he would assassinate in the gambling-hell the massacre of the boulevard suddenly unveil this spirit they see it such as it really be : the ridiculous nickname big-beak badinguet vanish they see the bandit they see the true _ contraffatto _ hide under the false bonaparte there be a shudder it be this then which this man hold in reserve apology have be attempt they could but fail it be easy to praise bonaparte for people have praise dupin but it be a exceedingly complicated operation to cleanse he what be to be do with the 4th of December how will that difficulty be surmount it be far more troublesome to justify than to glorify the sponge work with greater difficulty than the censer the panegyrist of the _ coup d'état _ have lose they labor madame sand herself although a woman of lofty intellect have fail miserably in she attempt to rehabilitate bonaparte for the simple reason that whatever one may do the death-roll reappear through this whitewashing no no no extenuation whatever be possible unfortunate bonaparte the blood be draw it must be drunk the deed of the 4th of December be the most colossal dagger-thrust that a brigand let loose upon civilization have ever effect we will not say upon a people but upon the entire human race the stroke be most monstrous and strike paris to the ground pari on the ground be conscience be reason be all human liberty on the ground it be the progress of century lie on the pavement it be the torch of justice of truth and of life reverse and extinguish this be what loui bonaparte effect the day when he effect this the success of the wretch be complete the 2d of December be lose the 4th of December save the 2d of December it be something like erostratus saving juda pari understand that all have not yet be tell as regard deed of horror and that beneath the oppressor there be the garbage-picker it be the case of a swindler steal césar 's mantle this man be little it be true but terrifying pari consent to this terror renounce the right to have the last word go to bed and simulated death suffocation have its share in the matter this crime resemble too no previous achievement even after century have pass and though he should be a aeschylus or a tacitus any one raise the cover would smell the stench pari resigned herself pari abdicated pari surrender the novelty of the treason prove its chief strength pari almost cease to be pari on the next day the chattering of this terrify titan 's tooth could be hear in the shadow let we lay a stress upon this for we must verify the law of morality loui bonaparte remain even after the 4th of December napoleon the little this enormity still leave he a dwarf the size of the crime do not change the stature of the criminal and the pettiness of the assassin withstand the immensity of the assassination be that as it may the pigmy have the better of the colossus this avowal humiliating as it be can not be

resistance that the meeting-place of the society have not yet be settle but that they would be during the evening that my presence be desire and that if i would be under the colbert arcade at nine o'clock either himself or another of they man would be there and would serve I as guide we decide that in order to make himself know the messenger when accost I should give the password what be joseph

under the arcade i feel that it be impossible to remain there and have the appearance of wait about near the colbert arcade there be a police-station and the patrol be pass every moment i plunge into the street i find no one there i go as far as the rue vivienne at the corner of the rue vivienne a man be stop before a placard and be try to deface it or to tear it down i draw near this man who probably take I for a police agent and who flee at the top of he speed i retrace my step near the colbert arcade and just as i reach the point in the street where they post the theatrical bill a workman pass I and say quickly what be joseph do i recognize the last-maker come he say to I we set out without speak and without appear to know each other he walk some step before I we first go to two address which i can not mention here without point out victim for the proscription in these two house we get no news no one have come there on the part of the society let we go to the third place say the last-maker and he explain to I that they have settle among they three successive meeting-place in case of need so as to be always sure of find each other if perchance the police discover the first or even the second meeting-place a precaution which for we part we adopt as much as possible with regard to we meeting of the left end of the committee we have reach the market quarter fight have be go on there throughout the day there be no longer any gas-lamp in the street we stop from time to time and listen so as not to run headlong into the arm of a patrol we get over a paling of plank almost completely destroy and of which barricade have probably be make and we cross the extensive area of half-demolished house which at that epoch encumber the lower portion of the rue montmartre and rue montorgueil on the peak of the high dismantle gable could be see a flicker red glow doubtless the reflection of the bivouac-fire of the soldier encamp in the market and in the neighborhood of saint eustache this reflection light we way the last-maker however narrowly escape fall into a deep hole which be no less than the cellar of a demolish house on come out of this region cover with ruin amongst which here and there a few tree might be perceive the remains of garden which have now disappear we enter into narrow wind and completely dark street where it be impossible to recognize one 's whereabouts nevertheless the last-maker walk on as much at he ease as in broad daylight and like a man who be go straight to he destination once he turn round to I and say to I -- the whole of this quarter be barricade and if as i hope we friend come down i will answer that they will hold it for a long time suddenly he stop here be one say he in truth seven or eight pace before we be a barricade entirely construct of paving-stone not exceed a man 's height and which in the darkness appear like a ruin wall a narrow passage have be form at one end we pass through it there be no one behind the barricade there have already be fight here a short time ago say the last-maker in a low voice and he add after a pause we be get near the unpaving have leave hole of which we have to be careful we stride and sometimes jump from paving-stone to paving-stone notwithstanding the intense darkness there yet hover about a indefinable glimmer on we way we notice before we on the ground close to the foot-pavement something which look like a stretched-out form the devil mutter my guide we be just go to walk upon it he take a little wax match from he pocket and strike it on he sleeve the flame flash out the light fall upon a pallid face which look at we with fix eye it be a corpse lie there it be a old man the last-maker rapidly wave the match from he head to he foot the dead man be almost in the attitude of a crucified man he two arm be stretch out he white hair red at the end be soak in the mud a pool of blood be beneath he a large blackish patch on he waistcoat mark the place where the ball have pierce he breast one of he brace be undo he have thick lace boot on he foot the last-maker lift up one of he arm and say he collar-bone be break the movement shake the head and the open mouth turn towards we as though about to speak to we i gaze at this vision i almost listen suddenly it disappear this face re-enter the gloom the match have just go out we go away in silence after walk about twenty pace the last-maker as though talk to himself say in a whisper do not know he we still push forward from the cellar to the roof from the ground-floor to the garret there be not a light in the house we appear to be grope in a immense tomb a man 's voice firm and sonorous suddenly issue out of the darkness and shout to we who go there ah there they be say the last-maker and he utter a peculiar whistle come on resume the voice it be another barricade this one a little higher than the first and separate from it by a distance of about a hundred pace be as far as could be see construct of barrel fill with paving-stone on the top could be see the wheel of a truck entangled between the barrel plank and beam be intermingle a passage have be contrived still narrower than the gangway of the other barricade citizen say the last-maker as he go into the barricade how many of you be there here the voice which have shout who go there answer -- there be two of we be that all that be all they be in truth two -- two man who alone during that night in that solitary street behind that heap of paving-stone await the onslaught of a regiment both wear blouse they be two workman with a few cartridge in they pocket and a musket upon each of they shoulder so then resume the last-maker in a impatient tone we friend have not yet come well then i say to he let we wait for they the last-maker speak for a short time in a low tone and probably tell my name to one of the two defender of the barricade who come up to I and salute I citizen representative say he it will be very warm here shortly in the meantime answer i laughingly it be cold it be very cold in truth the street which be completely unpaved behind the barricade be nothing better than a sewer ankle deep in water i say that it will be warm resume the workman and that you would do well to go farther off the last-maker put he hand on he shoulder : comrade it be necessary that we should remain here the meeting-place be close by in the ambulance all the same resume the other workman who be very short and who stand up on a paving-stone the citizen representative would do well to go farther off i can very well be where you be say i to he the street be quite dark nothing could be see of the sky inside the barricade on the leave on the side where the passage be could be see a high paling of badly join plank through which shone in place a feeble light above the paling rise out lose in the darkness a house of six or seven story the ground floor which be be repair and which be under-pinned be close in by these plank a ray of light issue from between the plank fall on the opposite wall and light up a old torn placard on which could be read asnières water tournament grand ball have you another gun ask the last-maker of the taller of the two workman if we have three gun we should be three man answer the workman the little one add do you think that the good will be want there be plenty of musician but there be no clarionet by the side of the wooden paling could be see a little narrow and low door which look more like the door of a stall than the door of a shop the shop to which this door belong be hermetically seal the door seem to be equally close the last-maker go up to it and push it gently it be open let we go in he say i go in first he follow I and shut the door behind I we be in a room on the ground floor at the end on the leave a half-opened door emit the reflection of a light the room be only light by this reflection a counter and a species of stove paint in black and white could be dimly distinguish a short half-suffocated intermittent gurgle could be hear which seem to come from a adjoining room on the same side as the light the last-maker walk quickly to the half-opened door i cross the room after he and we find ourselves in a sort of vast shed light by one candle we be on the other side of the plank paling there be only the plank paling

attack that on he arrival he have hear the noise of footstep in the direction of the crossway that it be the soldier who be advance that we could do nothing further there that we must be off that this house be stupidly choose that there be no outlet in the rear that perhaps we should already find it difficult to get out of the street and that we have only just time he tell this all pant briefly jerkily and interrupt at every moment with this ejaculation and to think that they have no arm and to think that i have no gun as he finish we hear from the barricade a shout of attention and almost immediately a shot be fire a violent discharge reply to this shot several ball strike the paling of the ambulance but they be too obliquely aim and none pierce it we hear the glass of several broken window fall noisily into the street there be no longer time say the last-maker calmly the barricade be attack he take a chair and sit down the two workman be evidently excellent marksman two volley assail the barricade one after the other the barricade answer with animation then the fire cease there be a pause now they be come at we with the bayonet they be come at the double say a voice in the barricade the other voice say let we be off a last musket-shot be fire then a violent blow which we interpret as a warning shake we wooden wall it be in reality one of the workman who have throw down he gun when go away the gun in fall have strike the paling of the ambulance we hear the rapid step of the two combatant as they run off almost at the same moment a tumult of voice and of butt end of musket strike the paving-stone fill the barricade it be take say the last-maker and he blow out the candle to the silence which envelop this street a moment before succeed a sort of ill-omened tumult the soldier knock at the door of the house with the butt-end of they musket it be by a miracle that the shop-door escape they if they have merely push against it they would have see that it be not shut and would have enter a voice probably the voice of a officer cry out light up the window the soldier swear we hear they say where be those blackguard red let we search the house the ambulance be plunge in darkness not a word be speak not a breath could be hear even the die man as though he divine the danger have cease to gurgle i feel the little girl press herself against my leg a soldier strike the barrel and say laughingly -- here be something to make a fire with to-night another resume -- which way have they go they be at least thirty let we search the house we hear one raise objection to this -- nonsense what do you want to do on a night like this enter the house of the ` middle class ' indeed there be some waste ground over yonder they have take refuge there all the same repeat the other let we search the house at this moment a musket-shot be fire from the end of the street this shot save we in fact it be probably one of the two workman who have fire in order to draw off they attention from we that come from over there cry the soldier they be over there and all start off at once in the direction from which the shot have be fire they leave the barricade and run down the street at the top of they speed the last-maker and myself get up they be no longer there whisper he quick let we be off but this poor woman say i be we go to leave she here oh she say do not be afraid i have nothing to fear as for I i be a ambulance i be take care of the wound i shall even relight my candle when you be go what trouble I be that my poor husband have not yet come back we cross the shop on tiptoe the last-maker gently open the door and glance out into the street some inhabitant have obey the order to light up they window and four or five light candle here and there flicker in the wind upon the sill of the window the street be no longer completely dark there be no one about now say the last-maker but let we make haste for they will probably come back we go out : the old woman close the door behind we and we find ourselves in the street we get over the barricade and hurry away as quickly as possible we pass by the dead old man he be still there lie on the pavement indistinctly reveal by the flicker glimmer from the window he look as though he be sleep as we reach the second barricade we hear behind we the soldier who be return we succeed in regain the street in course of demolition there we be in safety the sound of musketry still reach we the last-maker say they be fight in the direction of the rue de cléry leave the street in course of demolition we go round the market not without risk of fall into the hand of the patrol by a number of zigzag and from one little street to another little street we reach the rue saint honoré at the corner of the rue de l'arbre sec the last-maker and i separate for in truth say he to I two run more danger than one and i regain no 19 rue richelieu while cross the rue des bourdonnais we have notice the bivouac of the place saint eustache the troops who have be dispatch for the attack have not yet come back only a few company be guard it we could hear shout of laughter the soldier be warm themselves at large fire light here and there in the fire which be nearest to we we could distinguish in the middle of the brazier the wheel of the vehicle which have serve for the barricade of some there only remain a great hoop of red-hot iron -lrb- 27 -rrb- we may now after twenty-six year give the name of this loyal and courageous man he name be galoy -lrb- and not galloix as certain historian of the _ coup d'état _ have print it while recount after they fashion the incident which we be about to read -rrb- chapter iii what happen during the night -- the petit carreau on the same night almost at the same moment at a few pace distant a villainous deed be be perpetrate after the taking of the barricade where pierre tissié be kill seventy or eighty combatant have retire in good order by the rue saint sauveur they have reach the rue montorgueil and have rejoin each other at the junction of the rue du petit carreau and the rue du cadran at this point the street rise at the corner of the rue du petit carreau and the rue de cléry there be a desert barricade fairly high and well build there have be fight there during the morning the soldier have take it but have not demolish it why as we have say there be several riddle of this nature during this day the armed band which come from the rue saint denis have halt there and have wait these man be astonish at not be pursue have the soldier fear to follow they into the little narrow street where each corner of the house might conceal a ambuscade have a counter order be give they hazard various conjecture moreover they hear close by evidently on the boulevard a terrific noise of musketry and a cannonade which resemble continuous thunder have no more ammunition they be reduce to listen if they have know what be take place there they would have understand why they be not pursue the butchery of the boulevard be begin the general employ in the massacre have suspend fight for awhile the fugitive of the boulevard stream in they direction but when they perceive the barricade they turn back some however join they indignant and cry out for vengeance one who live in the neighborhood run home and bring back a little tin barrel full of cartridge these be sufficient for a hour 's fight they begin to construct a barricade at the corner of the rue du cadran in this manner the rue du petit carreau close by two barricade one towards the rue de cléry the other at the corner of the rue du cadran command the whole of the rue montorgueil the space between these two barricade form a perfect citadel the second barricade be stronger than the first these man nearly all wear coat some of they roll the paving-stone with glove on few workman be amongst they but those who be there be intelligent and energetic these workman be what might be term the pick of the crowd jeanty sarre have rejoin they he at once become they leader charpentier accompany he too brave to abandon the enterprise but too much a dreamer to become a commander two barricade enclose in the same manner some forty yard of the rue montorgueil have just be construct at the top of the rue mauconseil three other barricade extremely feebly construct again intersect the rue montorgueil in the space which separate the rue mauconseil from saint eustache evening be close in the fusillade be cease upon the boulevard a surprise be possible they establish a sentry-post at the corner of the rue du cadran and send a main-guard in the direction of the rue montmartre they scout come in to report some item of information a regiment seem to be prepare to bivouac in the place des victoires they position to all appearance strong be not so in reality there be too few in number to defend at the same time the two barricade on the rue de cléry and the rue montorgueil and the soldier arrive in the rear hide by the second barricade would have be upon they without be even notice this determine they to establish a post in the rue de cléry they put themselves in communication with the barricade of the rue du cadran and with the two mauconseil barricade these two last barricade be only separate from they by a space of about 150 pace they be about six foot high fairly solid but only guard by six workman who have build they towards half-past four in the twilight -- the twilight begin early in December -- jeanty sarre take four man with he and go out to reconnoitre he think also of raise a advanced barricade in one of the little neighboring street on the way they find one which have be abandon and which have be build with barrel the barrel however be empty only one contain any paving-stone and the barricade could not have be hold for two minute as they leave this barricade they be assail by a sharp discharge of musketry a company of infantry hardly visible in the dusk be close upon they they fall back hastily but one of they who be a shoemaker of the faubourg du temple be hit and have remain on the pavement they go back and bring he away he have the thumb of the right hand smash thank god say jeanty sarre they have not kill he no say the poor man it be my bread which they have kill and he add i can no longer work who will maintain my child they go back carry the wounded man one of they a medical student bind up he wound the sentry whom it be necessary to post in every direction and who be choose from the most trustworthy man thin and exhaust the little central land there be scarcely thirty in the barricade itself there as in the quarter of the temple all the streetlamp be extinguish the gas-pipes cut the window close and unlight no moon not even star the night be profoundly dark they could hear distant fusillade the soldier be firing from around saint eustache and every three minute send a ball in they direction as much as to say we be here nevertheless they do not expect a attack before the morning dialogue like the follow take place amongst they : -- i wish i have a truss of straw say charpentier i have a notion that we shall sleep here to-night will you be able to get to sleep asked jeanty sarre i certainly i shall go to sleep he do go to sleep in fact a few moment later in this gloomy network of narrow street intersect with barricade and blockade by soldier two wine-shop have remain open they make more lint there however than they drink wine the order of the chief be only to drink reddened water the doorway of one of these wine-shop open exactly between the two barricade of the petit cancan in it be a clock by which they regulate the sentry ' relief in a back room they have lock up two suspicious-looking person who have intermingle with the combatant one of these man at the moment when he be arrest say i have come to fight for henrus v they keep they under lock and key and place a sentry at the door a ambulance have be establish in a adjoining room there the wound shoemaker be lie upon a mattress throw upon the ground they have establish in case of need another ambulance in the rue du cadran a opening have be effect at the corner of the barricade on this side so that the wound could be easily carry away towards half-past nine in the evening a man come up to the barricade jeanty sarre recognize he good day deni say he call I gaston say the man why because -- be you you brother yes i be my brother for to-day very well good-day gaston they heartily shake hand it be denis dussoub he be pale calm and bleeding he have already be fight during the morning at the barricade of the faubourg saint martin a ball have graze he breast but have be turn off by some money in he pocket and have only break the skin he have have the rare good fortune of be scratch by a ball it be like the first touch from the claw of death he wear a cap he hat have be leave behind in the barricade where he have fight : and he have replace he bullet-pierced overcoat which be make of belleisle cloth by a pea-jacket buy at a slop-shop how have he reach the barricade of the petit carreau he could not say he have walk straight before he he have glide from street to street chance take the predestine by the hand and lead they straight to they goal through the thick darkness at the moment when he enter the barricade they cry out to he who go there he answer the republic they see jeanty sarre shake he by the hand they ask jeanty sarre -- who be he jeanty sarre answer -- it be some one and he add -- we be only sixty a short time since we be a hundred now all press round the new-comer jeanty sarre offer he the command no say he i do not understand the tactic of barricade fighting i should be a bad chief but i be a good soldier give I a gun they seat themselves on the paving-stone they exchange they experience of what have be do deni describe to they the fight on the faubourg saint martin jeanty sarre tell deni of the fighting in the rue saint denis during all this time the general be prepare a final assault -- what the marquis of clermont-tonnerre in 1822 call the coup de collier and what in 1789 the prince of lambese have call the coup de bas throughout all paris there be now only this point which offer any resistance this knot of barricade this labyrinth of street embattled like a redoubt be the last citadel of the people and of right the general invest it leisurely step by step and on all side they concentrate they force they the combatant of this fateful hour know nothing of what be be do only from time to time they interrupt they recital of event and they listen from the right and from the leave from the front from the rear from every side at the same time a unmistakable murmur grow every moment louder and more distinct hoarse pierce fear-inspiring reach they through the darkness it be the sound of the battalion march and charge at the trumpet-command in all the adjoining street they resume they gallant conversation and then in another moment they stop again and listen to that species of ill-omened chant chant by death which be approach nevertheless some still think that they would not be attack till the next morning night combat be rare in street-warfare they be more risky than all the other conflict few general venture upon they but amongst the old hand of the barricade from certain never-failing sign they believe that a assault be imminent in fact at half-past ten at night and not at eight o'clock as general magnan have say in the despicable document which he call he report -- a special movement be hear in the direction of the market this be the march of the troops colonel de lourmel have determine to make the attack the 51st of the line post at saint eustache enter the rue montorgueil the 2d battalion form the advanced guard the grenadier and the light infantry hurl forward at the double quickly carry the three little barricade which be on the other side of the vacant space of the rue mauconseil and the feebly defend barricade of the adjoining street it be at that very moment that the barricade near which i be happen to be carry from the barricade of the petit carreau they hear the night-strife draw near through the darkness with a fitful noise strange and appalling first a great tumult then volley then silence and then all begin again the flash of the fusillade suddenly delineate in the darkness the outline of the house which appear as though they themselves be affright the decisive moment draw near the outpost have fall back upon the barricade the advanced post of the rue de cléry and the rue du cadran have come back they call over the roll not one of those of the morning be miss they be as we have say about sixty combatant and not a hundred as the magnan report have state from the upper extremity of the street where they be station it be difficult to ascertain what be happen they do not exactly know how many barricade they be in the rue montorgueil between they and saint eustache whence the troops be come they only know that they nearest point of resistance be the double mauconseil barricade and that when all be at a end there it would be they turn deni have post himself on the inner side of the barricade in such a manner that half he body be above the top and from there he watch the glimmer which come from the doorway of the wine-shop render he gesture visible suddenly he make a sign the attack on the mauconseil redoubt be begin the soldier in fact after have some time hesitate before this double wall of paving-stone lofty well-built and which they suppose be well defend have end by rush upon it and attack it with blow of they gun they be not mistaken it be well defend we have already say that there be only six man in this barricade the six workman who have build it of the six one only have three cartridge the other have only two shot to fire these six man hear the regiment advance and the roll of the battery which be follow on it and do not stir each remain silent at he post of battle the barrel of he gun between two paving-stone when the soldier be within range they fire and the battalion reply that be right rage away red breeches say laughingly the man who have three shot to fire behind they the man of the petit carreau be crowd round deni and jeanty sarre and lean on the crest of they barricade stretch they neck towards the mauconseil redoubt they watch they like the gladiator of the next combat the six man of this mauconseil redoubt resist the onslaught of the battalion for nearly a quarter of a hour they do not fire together in order one of they say to make the pleasure last the longer the pleasure of be kill for duty a noble sentence in this workman 's mouth they do not fall back into the adjoining street until after have exhaust they ammunition the last he who have three cartridge do not leave until the soldier be actually scale the summit of the barricade in the barricade of the petit carreau not a word be speak they follow all the phase of this struggle and they press each other 's hand suddenly the noise cease the last musket-shot be fire a moment afterwards they see the light candle be place in all the window which look on on the mauconseil redoubt the bayonet and the brass ornament on the shako sparkle there the barricade be take the commander of the battalion as be always the custom in similar circumstance have send order into the adjoining house to light up all the window this be do at the mauconseil redoubt see that they hour have come the sixty combatant of the barricade of the petit carreau mount they heap of paving-stone and shout with one voice in the midst of the darkness this piercing cry long live the republic no one answer they they could only hear the battalion load they gun this act upon they as a species of signal for action they be all wear out with fatigue have be on they foot since the precede day carry paving-stone or fight the greater part have neither eat nor sleep charpentier say to jeanty sarre -- we shall all be kill shall we really say jeanty sarre jeanty sarre order the door of the wine-shop to be close so that they barricade completely shroud in darkness would give they some advantage over the barricade which be occupy by the soldier and light up in the meantime the 51st search the street carry the wound into the ambulance and take up they position in the double barricade of the rue mauconseil half a hour thus elapse now in order to clearly understand what be about to follow the reader must picture to himself in this silent street in this darkness of the night at from sixty to eighty yard apart within speak distance these two redoubt face each other and able as in a iliad to address each other on one side the army on the other side the people the darkness over all the species of truce which always precede decisive encounter draw to a close the preparation be complete on both side the soldier could be hear form into order of battle and the captain give out they command it be evident that the struggle be at hand let we begin say charpentier and he raise he gun deni hold he arm back wait he say then a epic incident be see deni slowly mount the paving-stone of the barricade ascend to the top and stand there erect unarmed and bareheaded thence he raise he voice and face the soldier he shout to they citizen at this word a sort of electric shudder ensue which be feel from one barricade to the other every sound be hushed every voice be silent on both side reign a deep religious and solemn silence by the distant glimmer of a few light window the soldier could vaguely distinguish a man standing above a mass of shadow like a phantom who be speak to they in the night deni continue -- citizen of the army listen to I the silence grow still more profound he resume -- what have you come to do here you and ourselves all of we who be in this street at this hour with the sword or gun in hand what be we about to do to kill each other to kill each other citizen why because they have raise a misunderstanding between we because we obey -- you you discipline -- we we right you believe that you be carry out you instruction as for we we know that we be do we duty yes it be universal suffrage it be the right of the republic it be we right that we be defend and we right soldier be you right the army be the people as the people be the army we be the same nation the some country the same man my god see be there any russian blood in my vein in I who be speak to you be there any prussian blood in you vein in you who be listen to I no why then should we fight it be always a unfortunate thing for a man to fire upon a man nevertheless a gun-shot between a frenchman and a englishman can be understand but between a frenchman and a frenchman ah that wound reason that wound france that wound we mother all anxiously listen to he at this moment from the opposite barricade a voice shout to he -- go home then at this coarse interruption a angry murmur run through deni 's companion and several gun could be hear be load deni restrain they by a sign this sign possess a strange authority who be this man the combatant behind the barricade ask each other suddenly they cry out -- he be a representative of the people deni have in fact suddenly assume he brother gaston 's sash what he have premeditate be about to be accomplish the hour of the heroic falsehood have arrive he cry out -- soldier do you know what the man be who be speak to you at this moment he be not only a citizen he be a legislator he be a representative choose by universal suffrage my name be dussoub and i be a representative of the people it be in the name of the national assembly it be in the name of the sovereign assembly it be in the name of the people and in the name of the law that i summon you to hear I soldier you be the armed force well then when the law speak the armed force listen this time the silence be not break we reproduce these word almost literally such as they be and such as they have remain graven on the memory of those who hear they but what we can not reproduce and what should be add to these word in order to realize the effect be the attitude the accent the thrill of emotion the vibration of the word issue from this noble breast the intense impression produce by the terrible hour and place deni dussoub continue : he speak for some twenty minute a eye-witness have tell I another have say he speak with a loud voice the whole street hear he he be vehement eloquent earnest a judge for bonaparte a friend for the soldier he seek to rouse they by everything which could still vibrate in they he recall to they they true war they true victory the national glory the ancient military honor the flag he tell they that all this be about to be slay by the bullet from they gun he adjure they he order they to join themselves to the people and to the law and then suddenly come back to the first word which he have pronounced carry away by that fraternity with which he soul overflow he interrupt himself in the middle of a half-completed sentence and cry out : -- but to what purpose be all these word it be not all this that be want it be a shake of the hand between brother soldier you be there opposite we at a hundred pace from we in a barricade with the sword draw with gun point you be aim directly at I well then all of we who be here love you there be not one of we who would not give he life for one of you you be the peasant of the field of france we be the workman of pari what then be in question simply to see each other to speak to each other and not to cut each other 's throat shall we try this say ah as for myself in this frightful battle-field of civil war i would rather die than kill look now i be go to get off this barricade and come to you i be unarmed i only know that you be my brother i be confident i be calm and if one of you present he bayonet at I i will offer he my hand he finish speak a voice cry out from the opposite barricade advance in order then they see he slowly descend the dimly-lighted crest of the barricade paving-stone by paving-stone and plunge with head erect into the dark street from the barricade all eye follow he with a inexpressible anxiety heart cease beat mouth no longer breathe no one attempt to restrain deni dussoub each feel that he be go where he ought to go charpentier wish to accompany he would you like I to go with you he cry out to he dussoub refuse with a shake of the head dussoub alone and grave advanced towards the mauconseil barricade the night be so dark that they lose sight of he immediately they could distinguish only for a few seconds he peaceable and intrepid bearing then he disappear they could no longer see anything it be a inauspicious moment the night be dark and dumb there could only be hear in this thick darkness the sound of a measure and firm step die away in the distance after some time how long no one could reckon so completely do emotion eclipse think amongst the witness of this marvellous scene a glimmer of light appear in the barricade of the soldier it be probably a lantern which be be bring or take away by the flash they again see dussoub he be close to the barricade he have almost reach it he be walk towards it with he arm stretch out like christ suddenly the word of command fire be hear a fusillade burst forth they have fire upon dussoub when he be at the muzzle of they gun dussoub fall then he raise himself and cry long live the republic another bullet strike he he fall again then they see he raise himself once more and hear he shout in a loud voice i die with the republic these be he last word in this manner die deni dussoub it be not vainly that he have say to he brother you sash will be there he be anxious that this sash should do its duty he determine in the depths of he great soul that this sash should triumph either through the law or through death that be to say in the first case it would save right in the second save honor die he could say i have succeed of the two possible triumph of which he have dream the gloomy triumph be not the less splendid the insurgent of the elysée think that he have kill a representative of the people and boast of it the sole journal publish by the _ coup d'état _ under these different title _ patrie _ _ univer _ _ moniteur _ _ parisien _ etc announce on the next day Friday the 5th that the ex-representative dussoub -lrb- gaston -rrb- have be kill at the barricade of the rue neuve saint eustache and that he bear ' a red flag in he hand ' chapter iv what be do during the night -- the passage du saumon when those on the barricade of the petit carreau see dussoub fall so gloriously for he friend so shamefully for he murderer a moment of stupor ensue be it possible do they really see this before they such a crime commit by we soldier horror fill every soul this moment of surprise do not last long long live the republic shout the barricade with one voice and it reply to the ambuscade by a formidable fire the conflict begin a mad conflict on the part of the _ coup d'état _ a struggle of despair on the side of the republic on the side of the soldier a appalling and cold blood resolution a passive and ferocious obedience number good arm absolute chief pouch fill with cartridge on the side of the people no ammunition disorder weariness exhaustion no discipline indignation serve for a leader it appear that while dussoub be speak fifteen grenadier command by a sergeant name pitroi have succeed in glide in the darkness along the house and unperceived and unheard have take up they position close to the barricade these fifteen man suddenly form themselves together with lowered bayonet at twenty pace from the barricade ready to scale it a volley receive they they fall back leave several corpse in the gutter major jeannin cry out finish they off the entire battalion which occupy the mauconseil barricade then appear with raise bayonet upon the uneven crest of this barricade and from there without break they line with a sudden but regulated and inexorable movement spring into the street the four company in close order and as though mingled and hardly visible seem like a wave precipitate itself with a great noise from the height of the barricade at the barricade of the petit carreau they note the maneuver and have pause in they fire present cry jeanty sarre but do not fire wait for the order each put he gun to he shoulder then place the barrel between the paving-stone ready to fire and wait as soon as it have quit the mauconseil redoubt the battalion rapidly form itself into a attack column and a moment afterwards they hear the intermittent sound of a advance at the double it be the battalion which be come upon they charpentier say jeanty sarre you have good eye be they midway yes say charpentier fire say jeanty sarre the barricade fire the whole street be fill with smoke several soldier fall they could hear the cry of the wound the battalion riddled with ball halt and reply by platoon firing seven or eight combatant whose body reach above the barricade which have be make hastily and be too low be hit three be kill on the spot one fall wound by a ball in he stomach between jeanty sarre and charpentier he shriek out with pain quick to the ambulance : say jeanty sarre where in the rue du cadran jeanty sarre and charpentier pick up the wounded man the one by the foot the other by the head and carry he to the du cadran through the passage in the barricade during all this time there be continue file firing there no longer seem anything in the street but smoke the ball whistle and cross each other the brief and repeat command some plaintive cry and the flash of the gun light up the darkness suddenly a loud void die out forwards the battalion resume its double-quick march and throw itself upon the barricade then ensue a horrible scene they fight hand to hand four hundred on the one side fifty on the other they seize each other by the collar by the throat by the mouth by the hair there be no longer a cartridge in the barricade but there remain despair a workman pierce through and through snatch the bayonet from he belly and stab a soldier with it they do not see each other but they devour each other it be a desperate scuffle in the dark the barricade do not hold out for two minute in several place it may be remember it be low it be rather stride over than scale that be all the more heroic one of the survivor -lrb- 28 -rrb- tell the writer of these line the barricade defend itself very badly but the man die very well all this take place while jeanty sarre and charpentier be carry the wounded man to the ambulance in the rue du cadran he wound have be attend to they come back to the barricade they have just reach it when they hear themselves call by name a feeble voice close by say to they jeanty sarre charpentier they turn round and see one of they man who be die lean against a wall and he knee give way beneath he he be a combatant who have leave the barricade he have only be able to take a few step down the street he hold he hand over he breast where he have receive a ball fire at close quarter he say to they in a scarcely audible voice the barricade be take save yourselve no say jeanty sarre i must unload my gun jeanty sarre re-enter the barricade fire a last shot and go away nothing could be more frightful than the interior of the capture barricade the republican overpower by number no longer offer any resistance the officer cry out no prisoner the soldier bill those who be stand and despatch those who have fall many await they death with they head erect the die raise themselves up and shout long live the republic some soldier grind they heel upon the face of the dead so that they should not be recognize there stretch out amongst the corpse in the middle of the barricade with he hair in the gutter be see the all-but namesake of charpentier carpentier the delegate of the committee of the tenth arrondissement who have be kill and have fall backwards with two ball in he breast a light candle which the soldier have take from the wine-shop be place on a paving stone the soldier be infuriate one would say that they be reveng themselves on whom a workman name paturel receive three ball and six bayonet-thrust four of which be in the head they think that he be dead and they do not renew the attack he feel they search he they take ten franc which he have about he he do not die till six day later and he be able to relate the detail which be give here we may note by the way that the name of paturel do not figure upon any of the list of the corpse publish by m bonaparte sixty republican be shut up in this redoubt of the petit carreau forty-six be kill there these man have come there that morning free proud to fight and joyous to die at midnight all be at a end the night wagon carry away on the next day nine corpse to the hospital cemetery and thirty-seven to montmartre jeanty sarre escape by a miracle as well as charpentier and a third whose name we have not be able to ascertain they glide along the house and reach the passage du saumon the grated door which close the passage during the night only reach to the center of the archway they climb it and get over the spike at the risk of tear themselves jeanty sarre be the first to climb it have reach the summit one of the spike pierce he trousers hook they and jeanty sarre fall headforemost upon the pavement he get up again he be only stunned the other two follow he and glide along the bar all three find themselves in the passage it be dimly light by a lamp which shine at one end in the meanwhile they hear the soldier who be pursue they come up in order to escape by the rue montmartre they would have to climb the grate gateway at the other end of the passage they hand be graze they knee be bleed they be die of weariness they be in no condition to recommence a similar ascent jeanty sarre know where the keeper of the passage live he knock at he window and beg he to open the keeper refuse at this moment the detachment which have be send in pursuit of they reach the grate gateway which they have just climb the soldier hear a noise in the passage pass the barrel of they gun through the bar jeanty sarre squeeze himself against the wall behind one of those project column which decorate the passage but the column be very thin and only half cover he the soldier fire and smoke fill the passage when it clear away jeanty sarre see charpentier stretch on the stone with he face to the ground he have be shoot through the heart they other companion lay a few pace from he mortally wound the soldier do not scale the grate gateway but they post a sentinel before it jeanty sarre hear they go away by the rue montmartre they would doubtless come back no means of flight he feel all the door round he prison successively one of they at length open this appear to he like a miracle whoever could have forget to shut the door providence doubtless he hide himself behind it and remain there for more than a hour standing motionless scarcely breathe he no longer hear any sound he venture out the sentinel be no longer there the detachment have rejoin the battalion one of he old friend a man to whom he have render service such as be not forget live in this very passage du saumon jeanty sarre look for the number wake the porter tell he the name of he friend be admit go up the stair and knock at the door the door be open he friend appear in he nightshirt with a candle in he hand he recognize jeanty sarre and cry out you here what a state you be in where heave you come from from what riot from what madness and then you come to compromise we all here to have we murder to have we shoot now then what do you want with I i want you to give I a brush down say jeanty sarre he friend take a brush and brush he and jeanty sarre go away while go down the stair jeanty sarre cry out to he friend thanks such be the kind of hospitality which

the prisoner who be sleep wake with a start a officer order they to get up they make they go out anyhow as they have come in as they go out they couple they two by two at random and a sergeant count they in a loud voice they ask neither they name nor they profession nor they family nor who they be nor whence they come they contented themselves with the number the number suffice for what they be about to do in this manner they count 337 the counting have come to a end they range they in close column still two by two and arm-in-arm they be not tie together but on each side of the column on the right and on the leave there be three file of soldier keep they within they rank with gun load a battalion be at they head a battalion in they rear they begin to march press together and enclose in

can hardly see here it be a dark spot on the leave there be tree be off but say the prisoner they will fire at I they will miss you but suppose they kill I it will be no worse than what await you the prisoner understand shake the sergeant 's hand and take advantage of the space between the line of soldier and rear-ground rush with a single bind outside the column and disappear in the darkness beneath the tree a man be escape cry out the officer who command the last company halt fire the column halt the rear-guard company fire at random in the direction take by the fugitive and as the

which be go out the tide have come in gloriously it go out disastrously gloomy ebb and flow of the people and who be the power who say to this ocean thou shalt go no farther alas a pigmy these hiding-place of the abyss be fathomless the abyss be afraid of what of something deeper than itself of the crime the people draw back they draw back on the 5th on the 6th they disappear on the horizon there could be see nothing but the beginning of a species of vast night this night have be the empire we find ourselves on the 5th what we be on the 2d alone but we persevere we mental condition be this -- desperate yes discourage no item of bad news come to we as good news have come to we on the evening of the 3d one after another aubry du nord be at the concièrgerie we dear and eloquent crémieux be at maza loui blanc who although banish be come to the assistance of france and be bring to we the great power of he name and of he mind have be compel like ledru rollin to halt before the catastrophe of the 4th he have not be able to get beyond tournay as for general neumayer he have not march upon pari but he have come there for what purpose to give in he submission we no longer possess a refuge no 15 rue richelieu be watch no 11 rue monthabor have be denounce we wander about paris meeting each other here and there and exchange a few word in a whisper not know where we should sleep or whether we should get a meal and amongst those head which do not know what pillow they should have at night there be at least one upon which a price be set they accost each other and this be the sort of conversation they hold : -- what have become of so-and-so he be arrest and so-and-so dead and so-and-so disappear we hold however one other meeting this be on the 6th at the house of the representative raymond in the place de la madeleine nearly all of we meet there i be enable to shake the hand of edgar quinet of chauffor of clément dulac of bancel of versigny of emile péan and i again meet we energetic and honest host of the rue blanche coppen and we courageous colleague pon stande whom we have lose sight of in the smoke of the battle from the window of the room where we be deliberate we could see the place de la madeleine and the boulevard militarily occupy and cover with a fierce and deep mass of soldier draw up in battle order and which still seem to face a possible combat charamaule come in he draw two pistol from he great cloak place they on the table and say all be at a end nothing feasible and sensible remains except a deed of rashness i propose it be you of my opinion victor hugo yes i answer i do not know what he be go to say but i know that he would only say that which be noble this be he proposition we number resume he about fifty representative of the people still stand and assemble together we be all that remain of the national assembly of universal suffrage of the law of right to-morrow where shall we be we do not know scattered or dead the hour of to-day be ours this hour go and past we have nothing leave but the shadow the opportunity be unique let we profit by it he stop look at we fixedly with he steadfast gaze and resume -- let we take the advantage of this chance of be alive and the good fortune of be together the group which be here be the whole of the republic well then let we offer in we person all the republic to the army and let we make the army fall back before the republic and might fall back before right in that supreme moment one of the two must tremble might or right and if right do not tremble might will tremble if we do not tremble the soldier will tremble let we march upon the crime if the law advance the crime will draw back in either case we shall have do we duty live we shall be preserver dead we shall be hero this be what i propose a profound silence ensue let we put on we sash and let we all go down in a procession two by two into the place de la madeleine you can see that colonel before that large flight of step with he regiment in battle array we will go to he and there before he soldier i will summon he to come over to the side of duty and to restore he regiment to the republic if he refuse charamaule take he two pistol in he hand i will blow out he brain charamaule say i i will be by you side i know that well charamaule say to I he add -- this explosion will awaken the people but several cry out suppose it do not awaken they we shall die i be on you side say i to he we each press the other 's hand but objection burst forth no one tremble but all criticise the proposal would it not be madness and useless madness would it not be to play the last card of the republic without any possible chance of success what good fortune for bonaparte to crush with one blow all that remain of those who be resist and of those who be combate to finish with they once for all we be beat grant but be it necessary to add annihilation to defeat no possible chance of success the brain of a army can not be blow out to do what charamaule advise would be to open the tomb nothing more it would be a magnificent suicide but it would be a suicide under certain circumstance it be selfish to be merely a hero a man accomplish it at once he become illustrious he enter into history all that be very easy he leave to other behind he the laborious work of a long protest the immovable resistance of the exile the bitter hard life of the conquer who continue to combat the victory some degree of patience form a part of politics to know how to await revenge be sometimes more difficult than to hurry on its catastrophe there be two kind of courage -- bravery and perseverance the first belong to the soldier the second belong to the citizen a hap-hazard end however dauntless do not suffice to extricate oneself from the difficulty by death it be only too easily do : what be require what be the reverse of easy be to extricate one 's country from the difficulty no say those high-minded man who oppose charamaule and myself this to-day which you propose to we be the suppression of to-morrow take care there be a certain amount of desertion in suicide the word desertion grievously wound charamaule very well say he i abandon the idea this scene be exceedingly grand and quinet later on when in exile speak to I of it with deep emotion we separate we do not meet again i wander about the street where should i sleep that be the question i think that no 19 rue richelieu would probably be as much watch as no 15 but the night be cold and i decide at all hazard to re-enter this refuge although perhaps a hazardous one i be right to trust myself to it i sup on a morsel of bread and i pass a very good night the next morning at daybreak on waking i thought of the duty which await I i think that i be abut to go out and that i should probably not come back to the room i take a little bread which remain and i crumble it on the window-sill for the bird chapter x duty can have two aspect have it be in the power of the leave at any moment to prevent the _ coup d'état _ we do not think so nevertheless here be a fact which we believe we ought not to pass by in silence on the 16th November 1851 i be in my study at home at 37 rue de la tour d'auvergne it be about midnight i be work my servant open the door will you see m -- sir and he mention a name yes i say some one come in i shall only speak reservedly of this eminent and distinguished man let it suffice to state that he have the right to say when mention the bonaparte my family it be know that the bonaparte family be divide into two branch the imperial family and the private family the imperial family have the tradition of napoleon the private family have the tradition of lucien : a shade of difference which however have no reality about it my midnight visitor take the other corner of the fireplace he begin by speak to I of the memoirs of a very highminded and virtuous woman the princess -- he mother the manuscript of which he have confide to I ask my advice as to the utility or the suitability of they publication this manuscript besides be full of interest possess for I a special charm because the handwriting of the princess resemble my mother 's handwriting my visitor to whom i give it back turn over the leaf for a few moment and then suddenly interrupt himself he turn to I and say -- the republic be lose i answer -- almost he resume -- unless you save it i you how so listen to I then he set forth with that clearness complicate at time with paradox which be one of the resource of he remarkable mind the situation at the same time desperate and strong in which we be place this situation which moreover i realize as well as he himself be this : -- the right of the assembly be compose of about 400 member and the left of about 180 the four hundred of the majority belong by third to three party the legitimist party the orleanist party the bonapartist party and in a body to the clerical party the 180 of the minority belong to the republic the right mistrust the left and have take a precaution against the minority a vigilance committee compose of sixteen member of the right charge with impress unity upon this trinity of party and charge with the task of carefully watch the left such be this precaution the leave at first have confine itself to irony and borrowing from I a word to which people then attach though wrongly the idea of decrepitude have call the sixteen commissioner the burgrave the irony subsequently turn into suspicion the left have on its side end by create a committee of sixteen member to direct the left and observe the right these the right have hasten to name the red burgrave a harmless rejoinder the result be that the right watch the left and that the left watch the right but that no one watch bonaparte they be two flock of sheep so distrustful of one another that they forget the wolf during that time in he den at the elysée bonaparte be work he be busily employ the time which the assembly the majority and the minority be lose in mistrust itself as people feel the loosening of the avalanche so they feel the catastrophe totter in the gloom they keep watch upon the enemy but they do not turn they attention in the true direction to know where to fix one 's mistrust be the secret of a great politician the assembly of 1851 do not possess this shrewd certainty of eyesight they perspective be bad each see the future after he own fashion and a sort of political short-sightedness blind the leave as well as the right they be afraid but not where fear be advisable they be in the presence of a mystery they have a ambuscade before they but they seek it where it do not exist and they do not perceive where it really lay thus it be that these two flock of sheep the majority and the minority face each other affrightedly and while the leader on one side and the guide on the other grave and attentive ask themselves anxiously what could be the mewing of the grumbling of the leave on the one side of the bleating of the right on the other they run the risk of suddenly feel the four claw of the _ coup d'état _ fasten in they shoulder my visitor say to I - you be one of the sixteen yes answer i smile a ` red burgrave ' like I a ` red prince ' and he smile respond to mine he resume -- you have full power yes like the other and i add -- not more than the other the left have no leader he continue -- yon the commissary of police be a republican ' yes he would obey a order sign by you possibly _ i _ say without doubt he look at I fixedly well then have the president arrest this night it be now my turn to look at he what do you mean what i say i ought to state that he language be frank resolute and self-convinced and that during the whole of this conversation and now and always it have give I the impression of honesty arrest the president i cry then he set forth that this extraordinary enterprise be a easy matter that the army be undecided that in the army the african general counterpoise the president that the national guard favor the assembly and in the assembly the leave that colonel forestier answer for the 8th legion colonel gressier for the 6th and colonel howyne for the 5th that at the order of the sixteen of the leave there would be a immediate take up of arm that my signature would suffice that nevertheless if i prefer to call together the committee in secret session we could wait till the next day that on the order from the sixteen a battalion would march upon the elysée that the elysée apprehend nothing think only of offensive and not of defensive measure and accordingly would be take by surprise that the soldier would not resist the national guard that the thing would be do without strike a blow that vincenne would open and close while pari sleep that the president would finish he night there and that france on awaken would learn the twofold good tiding : that bonaparte be out of the fight and france out of danger he add -- you can count on two general : neumayer at lyon and lawoëstyne at paris he get up and lean against the chimney-piece i can still see he there stand thoughtfully and he continue : i do not feel myself strong enough to begin exile all over again but i feel the wish to save my family and my country he probably think he notice a movement of surprise in I for he accentuate and italicize these word i will explain myself yes i wish to save my family and my country i bear the name of napoleon but as you know without fanaticism i be a bonaparte but not a bonapartist i respect the name but i judge it it already have one stain the eighteenth brumaire be it about to have another the old stain disappear beneath the glory austerlitz cover brumaire napoleon be absolved by he genius the people admire he so greatly that it forgive he napoleon be upon the column there be a end of it let they leave he there in peace let they not resuscitate he through he bad quality let they not compel france to remember too much this glory of napoleon be vulnerable it have a wound close i admit do not let they reopen it whatever apologist may say and do it be none the less true that by the eighteenth of brumaire napoleon strike himself a first blow in truth say i it be ever against ourselves that we commit a crime well then he continue he glory have survive a first blow a second will kill it i do not wish it i hate the first eighteenth brumaire i fear the second i wish to prevent it he pause again and continue -- that be why i have come to you to-night i wish to succor this great wounded glory by the advice which i be give you if you can carry it out if the left carry it out i save the first napoleon for if a second crime be superpose upon he glory this glory would disappear yes this name would founder and history would no longer own it i will go farther and complete my idea i also save the present napoleon for he who as yet have no glory will only have come i save he memory from a eternal pillory therefore arrest he he be truly and deeply move he resume -- as to the republic the arrest of loui bonaparte be deliverance for she i be right therefore in say that by what i be propose to you i be save my family and my country but i say to he what you propose to I be a _ coup d'état _ do you think so without doubt we be the minority and we should commit a act which belong to the majority we be a part of the assembly we should be act as though we be the entire assembly we who condemn all usurpation should ourselves become usurper we should put we hand upon a functionary whom the assembly alone have the right of arrest we the defender of the constitution we should break the constitution we the man of the law we should violate the law it be a _ coup d'état _ yes but a _ coup d'état _ for a good purpose evil commit for a good purpose remain evil even when it succeed above all when it succeed why because it then become a example you do not then approve of the eighteenth fructidor no but eighteenth fructidor prevent eighteenth brumaire no they prepare the way for they but reason of state exist no what exist be the law the eighteenth fructidor have be accept by exceedingly honest mind i know that blanquus be in its favor with michelet i be against it with barbès from the moral aspect i pass to the practical aspect this say resume i let we examine you plan this plan bristle with difficulty i point they out to he count on the national guard why general lawoëstyne have not yet get command of it count on the army why general neumayer be at lyon and not at paris would he march to the assistance of the assembly what do we know about this as for lawoëstyne be he not double-faced be they sure of he call to arm the 8th legion forestier be no longer colonel the 5th and 6th but gressier and howyne be only lieutenant-colonel would these legion follow they order the commissary yon but would he obey the left alone he be the agent of the assembly and consequently of the majority but not of the minority these be so many question but these question suppose they answer and answer in the sense of success be success itself the question the question be never success it be always right but here even if we have obtain success we should not have right in order to arrest the president a order of the assembly be necessary we should replace the order of the assembly by a act of violence of the leave a scaling and a burglary a assault by scaling-ladder on the constitute authority a burglary on the law now let we suppose resistance we should shed blood the law violate lead to the shed of blood what be all this it be a crime no indeed he exclaim it be the _ salus populi _ and he add -- _ suprema lex _ not for I i say i continue -- i would not kill a child to save a people cato do so jesus do not do so and i add -- you have on you side all ancient history you be act accord to the uprightness of the greek and accord to the uprightness of the roman for I i be act accord to the uprightness of humanity the new horizon be of wider range than the old there be a pause he break it then he will be the one to attack let it be so you be about to engage in a battle which be almost lose beforehand i fear so and this unequal combat can only end for you victor hugo in death or exile i believe it death be the affair of a moment but exile be long it be a habit to be learn he continue -- you will not only be proscribe you will be calumniate it be a habit already learn he continue -- do you know what they be say already what they say that you be irritated against he because he have refuse to make you a minister why you know yourself that -- i know that it be just the reverse it be he who have ask you and it be you who have refuse well then -- they lie what do it matter he exclaim -- thus you will have cause the bonaparte to re-enter france and you will be banish from france by a bonaparte -lrb- 32 -rrb- who know say i if i have not commit a fault this injustice be perhaps a justice we be both silent he resume -- could you bear exile i will try could you live without paris i should have the ocean you would then go to the seaside i think so it be sad it be grand there be another pause he break it you do not know what exile be i do know it it be terrible assuredly i would not begin it again death be a bourne whence no one come back exile be a place whither no one return if necessary i say to he i will go and i will return to it better die to quit life be nothing but to quit one 's country -- alas say i that be every thing well then why accept exile when it be in you power to avoid it what do you place above you country conscience this answer make he thoughtful however he resume but on reflection you conscience will approve of what you will have do no why i have tell you because my conscience be so constitute that it put nothing above itself i feel it upon I as the headland can feel the lighthouse which be upon it all life be a abyss and conscience illuminate it around I and i also he exclaim -- and i affirm that nothing could be more sincere or more loyal than he tone -- and i also feel and see my conscience it approve of what i be do i appear to be betray loui but i be really do he a service to save he from a crime be to save he i have try every means there only remain this one to arrest he in come to you in act as i do i conspire at the same time against he and for he against he power and for he honor what i be do be right it be true i say to he you have a generous and a lofty aim and i resume -- but we two duty be different i could not hinder loui bonaparte from commit a crime unless i commit one myself i wish neither for a eighteenth brumaire for he nor for a eighteenth fructidor for myself i would rather be proscribe than be a proscriber i have the choice between two crime my crime and the crime of loui bonaparte i will not choose my crime but then you will have to endure he i would rather endure a crime than commit one he remain thoughtful and say to I -- let it be so and he add -- perhaps we be both in the right i think so i say and i press he hand he take he mother 's manuscript and go away it be three o'clock in the morning the conversation have last more than two hour i do not go to bed until i have write it out -lrb- 32 -rrb-

people and a proscript they give he a special passport for a compulsory route as far as belgium for himself and he wife furnish with this passport he leave with a woman this woman be a man préveraud a land proprietor at donjon one of the most prominent man in the department of allier be terrier 's brother-in-law when the _ coup d'état _ break out at donjon préveraud have take up arm and fulfil he duty have combate the outrage and defend the law for this he have be condemn to death the justice of that time as we know justice execute justice for this crime of be a honest man they have guillotine charlet guillotine cuisinier guillotine cirasse the guillotine be a instrument of the reign assassination by the guillotine be one of the means of order of that time it be necessary to save préveraud he be little and slim : they dress he as a woman he be not sufficiently pretty for they not to cover he face with a thick veil they put the brave and sturdy hand of the combatant in a muff thus veil and a little fill out with padding préveraud make a charming woman he become madame terrier and he brother-in-law take he away they cross paris peaceably and without any other adventure than a imprudence commit by préveraud who see that the shaft-horse of a wagon have fall down throw aside he muff lift he veil and he petticoat and if terrier in dire alarm have not stop he he would have help the carter to raise he horse have a _ sergent de ville _ be there préveraud would have be capture terrier hasten to thrust préveraud into a carriage and at nightfall they leave for brussels they be alone in the carriage each in a corner and face to face all go well as far as amien at amien station the door be open and a gendarme enter and seat himself by the side of préveraud the gendarme ask

as far as the frontier the train after the ordinary delay of a few minute again start the night be dark terrier have fall asleep suddenly préveraud feel a knee press against he it be the knee of the policeman a boot place itself softly on he foot it be a horse-soldier 's boot a idyll have just germinate in the gendarme 's soul he first tenderly press préveraud 's knee and then embolden by the darkness of the hour and by the slumbering husband he venture he hand as far as she dress a circumstance foresee by molière but the fair veil one be virtuous préveraud full of surprise and rage gently push back the gendarme 's hand the danger be extreme too much love on the part of the gendarme one audacious step further would bring about the unexpected would abruptly change the eclogue into a official indictment would reconvert the amorous satyr into a stony-hearted policeman would transform tirci into vidocq and then this strange thing would be see a passenger guillotine because a gendarme have commit a outrage the danger increase every moment terrier be sleep suddenly the train stop a voice cry quièvrain and the door be open they be in belgium the gendarme oblige to stop here and to re-enter france rise to get out and at the moment when he step on to the ground he hear behind he these expressive word come from beneath the lace veil be off or i 'll break you jaw -lrb- 34

the german-speaking territory in the south netherland from dunkirk to malmedy in rhenish prussium chapter xiii the military commission and the mixed commission justice sometime meet with strange adventure this old phrase assume a new sense the code cease to be a safeguard the law become something which have swear fealty to a crime loui bonaparte appoint judge by whom one feel oneself stop as in the corner of a wood in the same manner as the forest be a accomplice through its density so the legislation be a accomplice by its obscurity what it lack at certain point in order to make it perfectly dark they add how by force purely and simply by decree _ sic jubeo _ the decree of the 17th of February be a masterpiece this decree complete the proscription of the person by the proscription of the name domitian could not have do better human conscience be bewildered right equity reason feel that the master have over they the authority that a thief have over a purse no reply obey nothing resemble those infamous time every iniquity be possible legislative body supervene and instil so much gloom into legislation that it be easy to achieve a baseness in this darkness a successful _ coup d'état _ do not stand upon ceremony this kind of success permit itself everything fact abound but we must abridge we will only present they briefly there be two species of justice the military commission and the mixed commission the military commission sit in judgment with closed door a colonel preside in pari alone there be three military commission : each receive a thousand bill of indictment the judge of instruction send these accusation to the procureur of the republic lascoux who transmit they to the colonel president the commission summon the accuse to appear the accuse himself be he own bill of indictment they search he that be to say they thumb he the accuse document be short two or three line such as this for example -- name christian name profession a sharp fellow go to the café read the papers speak dangerous the accusation be laconic the judgment be still less prolix it be a simple sign the bill of indictment have be examine the judge have be consult the colonel take a pen and put at the end of the accuse line one of three sign : -- - + o - signify consignment to lambessa + signify transportation to cayenne -lrb- the dry guillotine death -rrb- o signify acquittal while this justice be at work the man on whose case they be work be sometimes still at liberty he be go and come at he ease suddenly they arrest he and without know what they want with he he leave for lambessa or for cayenne he family be often ignorant of what have become of he people ask of a wife of a sister of a daughter of a mother -- where be you husband where be you brother where be you father where be you son the wife the sister the daughter the mother answer -- i do not know in the allier eleven member of one family alone the préveraud family of donjon be strike down one by the penalty of death the other by banishment and transportation a wine-seller of the batignolle name brisadoux be transport to cayenne for this line in he deed of accusation : _ he shop be frequent by socialist _ here be a dialogue word for word and take from life between a colonel and he convict prisoner : -- you be condemn indeed why in truth i do not exactly know myself examine you conscience think what you have do i yes you how i you must have do something no i have do nothing i have not even do my duty i ought to have take my gun go down into the street harangue the people raise barricade i remain at home stupidly like a sluggard -lrb- the accuse laugh -rrb- that be the offence of which i accuse myself you have not be condemn for that offence think carefully i can think of nothing what you have not be to the _ café _ yes i have breakfast there have you not chat there yes perhaps have you not laugh perhaps i have laugh at whom at what at what be go on it be true i be wrong to laugh at the same time you talk yes of whom of the president what do you say indeed what may be say with justice that he have break he oath and then that he have not the right to arrest the representative you say that yes and i add that he have not the right to kill people on the boulevard here the condemn man interrupted himself and exclaim -- and thereupon they send I to cayenne the judge look fixedly at the prisoner and answer -- well then another form of justice : -- three miscellaneous personage three removable functionary a prefect a soldier a public prosecutor whose only conscience be the sound of loui bonaparte 's bell seat themselves at a table and judge whom you I we everybody for what crime they invent crime in the name of what law they invent law what penalty do they inflict they invent penalty do they know the accuse no do they listen to he no what advocate do they listen to none what witness do they question none what deliberation do they enter upon none what public do they call in none thus no public no deliberation no counsellor no witness judge who be not magistrate a jury where none be swear in a tribunal which be not a tribunal imaginary offence invent penalty the accuse absent the law absent from all these thing which resemble a dream there come forth a reality : the condemnation of the innocent exile banishment transportation ruin home-sickness death and despair for 40000 family that be what history call the mixed commission ordinarily the great crime of state strike the great head and content themselves with this destruction they roll like block of stone all in one piece and break the great resistance illustrious victim suffice for they but the second of December have its refinement of cruelty it require in addition petty victim its appetite for extermination extend to the poor and to the obscure its anger and animosity penetrate as far as the lowest class it create fissure in the social subsoil in order to diffuse the proscription there the local triumvirate nickname mixed mixture serve it for that not one head escape however humble and puny they find mean to impoverish the indigent to ruin those die of hunger to spoil the disinherit the _ coup d'état _ achieve this wonderful feat of add misfortune to misery bonaparte it seem take the trouble to hate a mere peasant the vine-dresser be tear from he vine the laborer from he furrow the mason from he scaffold the weaver from he loom man accept this mission of cause the immense public calamity to fall morsel by morsel upon the humblest walk of life detestable task to crumble a catastrophe upon the little and on the weak chapter xiv a religious incident a little religion can be mingle with this justice here be a example frederick morin like arnauld de l'ariège be a catholic republican he think that the soul of the victim of the 4th of December suddenly cast by the volley of the _ coup d'état _ into the infinite and the unknown might need some assistance and he undertake the laborious task of have a mass say for the repose of these soul but the priest wish to keep the mass for they friend the group of catholic republican which frederick morin head apply successively to all the priest of pari but meet with a refusal they apply to the archbishop : again a refusal as many mass for the assassin as they like but far the assassinate not one to pray for dead man of this sort would be a scandal the refusal be determine how should it be overcome to do without a mass would have appear easy to other but not to these staunch believer the worthy catholic democrat with great difficulty at length unearth in a tiny suburban parish a poor old vicar who consent to mumble in a whisper this mass in the ear of the almighty while beg he to say nothing about it chapter xv how they come out of ham on the night of the 7th and 8th of January charra be sleep the noise of he bolt be draw awake he so then say he they be go to put we in close confinement and he go to sleep again a hour afterwards the door be open the commandant of the fort enter in full uniform accompany by a police agent carry a torch

eye charra continue -- you come on the part of some one whom they call ` minister of the interior ' m de morny i believe i know m de morny a bald young man he have play the game where people lose they hair and now he be play the game where people risk they head the conversation be painful the young man be deeply interested in the toe of he boot after a pause however he venture to speak -- m charras i be instruct to say that if you want money -- charra interrupt he impetuously hold you tongue sir not another word i have serve my country five-and-twenty year as a officer under fire at the peril of my life always for honor never for gain keep you money for you own set but sir -- silence money which pass through you hand would soil mine another pause ensue which the private secretary again break -- colonel you will be accompany by two police agent who have special instruction and i should inform you that you be order to travel with a false passport and under the name of vincent good heaven say charra this be really too much who be it imagine that they will make I travel by order with a false passport and under a false name and look steadily at m léopold lehon know sir that my name be charra and not vincent and that i belong to a family whose member have always bear the name of they father they set out they journey by carriage as far as creil which be on the railway at creil

probably do with you these vagabond be make I travel under the name of vincent and I say changarnier under the name of leblanc in that case they ought at least to have call I lerouge say charra with a burst of laughter in the meantime a group keep at a distance by the police agent have form round they people have recognize they and salute they a little child whose mother could not hold he back run quickly to charra and take he hand they get into the train apparently as free as other traveller only they isolate they in empty compartment and each be accompany by two man who sit one at the side and the other face he and who never take they eye off he the keeper of general changarnier be of ordinary strength and stature those of charra be almost giant charra be exceedingly tall they top he by a entire head these man who be galley sergeant have be carabineer these spy have be hero charra question they they have serve when quite young from 1813 thus they have share the bivouac of napoleon now they eat the same bread as vidocq the soldier bring to such a sorry pass as this be a sad sight the pocket of one of they be bulge out with something which he be hide there when this man cross the station in company with charras a lady traveller say -- have he get m thier in he pocket what the police agent be hide be a pair of pistol under they long buttoned-up and doubled-breasted frock coat these man be arm they be order to treat those gentleman with the most profound respect but in certain circumstance to blow out they brain the prisoner have each be inform that in the eye of the different authority whom they would meet on the road they would pass for foreigner swiss or belgian expel on account of they political opinion and that the police agent would keep they title of police agent and would represent themselves as charge with reconduct these foreigner to the frontier two-third of the journey be accomplish without any hindrance at valencienne a incident occur the _ coup d'état _ have succeed zeal reign paramount no task be any longer consider despicable to denounce be to please zeal be one of the form of servitude towards which people lean the most willingly the general become a common soldier the prefect become a commissary of police the commissary of police become a police spy the commissary of police at valencienne himself superintend the inspection of passport for nothing in the world would he have depute this important office to a subordinate inspector when they present he the passport of the so-called leblanc he look the so-called leblanc full in the face start and exclaim -- you be general changarnier that be no affair of mine say the general upon this the two keeper of the general protest and exhibit they papers perfectly draw up in due form mr commissary we be government agent here be we proper passport improper one say the general the commissary shake he head he have be employ in pari and have be frequently send to the headquarters of the staff at the tuilery to general changarnier he know he very well this be too much exclaim the police agent they bluster declare that they be police functionary on a special service that they have instruction to conduct to the frontier this leblanc expel for political reason swear by all the god and give they word of honor that the so-called leblanc be really name leblanc i do not much believe in word of honor say the commissary honest commissary mutter changarnier you be right since the 2d of December word of honor and oath be no more than worthless paper money and then he begin to smile the commissary become more and more perplexed the police agent end by invoke the testimony of the prisoner himself now sir tell he you name yourself get out of the difficulty yourselve answer changarnier all this appear most irregular to the mind of a provincial alguazil it seem evident to the commissary of valencienne that general changarnier be escape from ham under a false name with a false passport and with false agent of police in order to mislead the authority and that it be a plot to escape which be on the point of succeed come down all three of you exclaim the commissary the general get down and on put foot to the ground notice charra in the depths of he compartment between he two bully oho charra you be there he cry charra exclaim the commissary charra there quick the passport of these gentleman and look charra in the face -- be you colonel charra egad say charra yet another complication it be now the turn of charra 's bully to bluster they declare that charra be the man call vincent display passport and papers swear and protest the commissary 's suspicion be fully confirm very well say he i arrest everybody and he hand over changarnier charra and the four police agent to the gendarme the commissary see the cross of honor shine in the distance he be radiant the police arrest the police it happen sometimes that the wolf think he have seize a victim and bite he own tail the six prisoner -- for now there be six prisoner -- be take into a parlor at the railway station the commissary inform the town authority the town authority hasten hither head by the sub-prefect the sub-prefect who be name censier come in and do not know whether he ought to salute or to question to grovel in the dust or to keep he hat on he head these poor devil of magistrate and local official be very much exercise in they mind general changarnier have be too near the dictatorship not to make they thoughtful who can foresee the course of event everything be possible yesterday call itself cavaignac to-day call itself bonaparte to-morrow may call itself changarnier providence be really cruel not to let sub-prefect have a peep at the future it be sad for a respectable functionary who would ask for nothing better than to be servile or arrogant accord to circumstance to be in danger of lavish he platitude on a person who be perhaps go to rot forever in exile and who be nothing more than a rascal or to risk be insolent to a vagabond of a postscript who be capable of come back a conqueror in six month ' time and of become the government in he turn what be to be do and then they be spy upon this take place between official the slightest word would be maliciously interpret the slightest gesture would be lay to they discredit how should he keep on good term at the same time this cabbage which be call to-day and that goat which be call to-morrow to ask too many question would offend the general to render to many salutation would annoy the president how could he be at the same time very much a sub-prefect and in some degree a lacquey how could he combine the appearance of obsequiousness which would please changarnier with the appearance of authority which would please bonaparte the sub-prefect thought to get out of the difficulty by say general you be my prisoner and by add with a smile do I the honor of breakfast with I he address the same word to charra the general refuse curtly charras look at he fixedly and do not answer he doubt regard the identity of the prisoner come to the mind of the sub-prefect he whisper to the commissary be you quite sure certainly say the commissary the sub-prefect decide to address himself to charra and dissatisfy with the manner in which he advance have be receive ask he somewhat sharply but in short who be you charras answer we be package and turn to he keeper who be now in they turn in keep : -- apply to we exporter ask we custom house officer it be a mere matter of goods traffic they set the electric telegraph to work valencienne alarm question pari the sub-prefect inform the minister of the interior that thanks to a strict supervision which he have trust to no one but himself he have just effect a important capture that he have just discover a plot have save the president have save society have save religion etc that in one word he have just arrest general changarnier and colonel charra who have escape that morning from the fort of ham with false passport doubtless for the purpose of head a rise etc and that in short he ask the government what be to be do with the two prisoner at the end of a hour the answer arrive : -- let they go on they way the police perceive that in a burst of zeal they have push profundity to the point of stupidity that sometimes happen the next train carry away the prisoner restore not to liberty but to they keeper they pass quiévrain they get down from the carriage and get in again when the train again start charra heave the deep joyous sigh of a free man

grace and all this grandeur shed a golden dawn into my soul suddenly a fellow-traveller ask -- what place be this another answer -- sedan i shudder this paradise be a tomb i look around the valley be circular and hollow like the bottom of a crater the wind river resemble a serpent the high hill range one behind the other surround this mysterious spot like a triple line of inexorable wall once there there be no means of exit it remind I of the amphitheatre a indescribable disquieting vegetation which seem to be a extension of the black forest overran all the height and lose itself in the horizon like a huge impenetrable snare the sun shine the bird sing carter pass by whistle sheep lamb and pigeon be scatter about leaf quiver and rustle the grass a densely thick grass be full of flower it be appalling i seem to see wave over this valley the flash of the avenge angel 's sword this word sedan have be like a veil abruptly tear aside the landscape have become suddenly fill with tragedy those shapeless eye which the bark of tree delineate on the trunk be gaze -- at what at something terrible and lose to view in truth that be the place and at the moment when i be pass by thirteen month all but a few day have elapse that be the place where the monstrous enterprise of the 2d of December have burst asunder a fearful shipwreck the gloomy pathway of fate can not be study without profound anguish of the heart chapter ii on the 31st of August 1870 a army be reassemble and be as it be mass together under the wall of sedan in a place call the givonne valley this army be a french army -- twenty-nine brigade fifteen division four army corps -- 90000 man this army be in this place without any one be able to divine the reason without order without a object scatter about -- a species of heap of man throw down there as though with the view of be seize by some huge hand this army either do not entertain or appear not to entertain for the moment any immediate uneasiness they know or at least they think they know that the enemy be a long way off on calculate the stage at four league daily it be three day ' march distant nevertheless towards evening the leader take some wise strategic precaution they protect the army which rest in the rear on sedan and the meuse by two battle front one compose of the 7th corps and extend from flo to givonne the other compose of the 12th corps extend from givonne to bazeille a triangle of which the meuse form the hypothenuse the 12th corps form of the three division of lacretelle lartigue and wolf range on the right with the artillery between the brigade form a veritable barrier have bazeille and givonne at each end and daigny in its center the two division of petit and lhéritier mass in the rear upon two line support this barrier general lebrun command the 12th corps the 7th corps command by general douay only possess two division -- dumont 's division and gilbert 's division -- and form the other battle front cover the army of givonne to flo on the side of illy this battle front be comparatively weak too open on the side of givonne and only protect on the side of the meuse by the two cavalry division of margueritte and bonnemain and by guyomar 's brigade rest in square upon flo within this triangle be encamp the 5th corps command by general wimpfen and the 1st corps command by general ducrot michel 's cavalry division cover the 1st corps on the side of daigny the 5th support itself upon sedan four division each disposed upon two line -- the division of lhéritier grandchamp goze and conseil-duménil -- form a sort of horseshoe turn towards sedan and unite the first battle front with the second the cavalry division of ameil and the brigade of fontange serve as a reserve for these four division the whole of the artillery be upon the two battle front two portion of the army be in confusion one to the right of sedan beyond balan the other to the left of sedan on this side of ige beyond balan be the division of vassoigne and the brigade of reboul on this side of ige be the two cavalry division of margueritte and bonnemain these arrangement indicate a profound feeling of security in the first place the emperor napoleon iii would not have come there if he have not be perfectly tranquil this givonne valley be what napoleon i call a washhand basin there could not be a more complete enclosure a army be so much at home there that it be too much so it run the risk of no longer be able to get out this disquiet some brave and prudent leader such as wimpfen but they be not listen to if absolutely necessary say the people of the imperial circle they could always be sure of be able to reach mézières and at the worst the belgian frontier be it however needful to provide for such extreme eventuality in certain case foresight be almost a offence they be all of one mind therefore to be at they ease if they have be uneasy they would have cut the bridge of the meuse but they do not even think of it to what purpose the enemy be a long way off the emperor who evidently be well inform affirm it the army bivouac somewhat in confusion as we have say and sleep peaceably throughout this night of August 31 have whatever might happen or believe that they have the retreat upon mézières open behind it they disdain to take the most ordinary precaution they make no cavalry reconnaissance they do not even place outpost a german military writer have state this -lrb- 37 -rrb- fourteen league at least separated they from the german army three day ' march they do not exactly know where it be they believe it scatter possess little unity badly inform lead somewhat at random upon several point at once incapable of a movement converge upon one single point like sedan they believe that the crown prince of saxony be march on chalon and that the crown prince of prussium be march on metz they be ignorant of everything appertaining to this army its leader its plan its armament its effective force be it still follow the strategy of gustavus adolphus be it still follow the tactic of frederick ii no one know they feel sure of be at berlin in a few week what nonsense the prussian army they talk of this war as of a dream and of this army as of a phantom during this very night while the french army be sleep this be what be take place -lrb- 37 -rrb- m harwik

the 2d bavarian army all this be carry out in a ghostly manner in order without a whisper without a sound through forest ravine and valley a tortuous and ill-omened march a stealthy glide onward of reptile scarcely could a murmur be hear beneath the thick foliage the silent battle swarm in the darkness await the day the french army be sleep suddenly it awake it be a prisoner the sun rise brilliant on the side of god -- terrible on the side of man chapter iv let we review the situation the german have number on they side they be three against one perhaps four they own to 250000 man and it be certain that they attack front extend for 30 kilomètres they have on they side the position they crown the height they fill the forest they be cover by all these escarpment they be mask by all this shade they possess a incomparable artillery the french army be in a valley almost without artillery and without supplies utterly naked beneath they hail of lead the german have on they side the ambuscade and the french have only on they side heroism death be glorious but surprise be profitable a surprise that be the true description of this brilliant exploit be it fair warfare yes but if this be fair what be unfair warfare it be the same thing this say the story of the battle of sedan have be tell i should have wish to stop there but i can not whatever horror the historian may feel history be a duty and this duty must be fulfil there be no incline more inexorable than this : to tell the truth he who venture on it roll to the very bottom it must be so the guardian of justice be doom to justice the battle of sedan be more than a battle which have be fight it be a syllogism which be complete a formidable premeditation of destiny destiny never hurry but it always come at its hour there it be it allow year to pass by and at the moment when man be least think of it it appear of this character be the fatal the unexpected catastrophe name sedan from time to time in history divine logic make a onslaught sedan be one of those onslaught thus on the 1st of September at five o'clock in the morning the world awake under the sun and the french army under the thunderbolt chapter v bazeille take fire givonne take fire floing take fire the battle begin with a furnace the whole horizon be aflame the french camp be in this crater stupefy affrighted start up from sleep -- a funereal swarm a circle of thunder surround the army they be encircle by annihilation this mighty slaughter be carry on on all side simultaneously the french resist and they be terrible have nothing leave but despair we cannon almost all old-fashioned and of short range be at once dismount by the fearful and exact aim of the prussian the density of the rain of shell upon the valley be so great that the earth be completely furrow say a eye-witness as though by a rake how many cannon eleven hundred at least twelve german battery upon la moncelle alone the 3d and 4th _ abtheilung _ a awe-striking artillery upon the crest of givonne with the 2d horse battery in reserve opposite doigny ten saxon and two wurtemburg battery the curtain of tree of the wood to the north of villers-cernay mask the mount _ abtheilung _ which be there with the 3d heavy artillery in reserve and from this gloomy copse issue a formidable fire the twenty-four piece of the 1st heavy artillery be range in the glade skirt the road from la moncelle to la chapelle the battery of the royal guard set fire to the garenne wood the shell and the ball riddle suchy francheval fouru-saint-remy and the valley between heibe and givonne and the third and fourth rank of cannon extend without break of continuity as far as the calvary of illy the extreme point of the horizon the german soldier seat or lie before the battery watch the artillery at work the french soldier fall and die amongst the body which cover the plain there be one the body of a officer on which they will find after the battle a sealed note contain this order sign napoleon : to-day September 1st rest for the whole army the gallant 35th of the line almost completely disappear under the overwhelming shower of shell the brave marine infantry hold at bay for a moment the saxon join by the bavarian but outflank on every side draw back all the admirable cavalry of the targueritte division hurl against the german infantry halt and sink down midway annihilate say the prussian report by well-aimed and cool firing -lrb- 38 -rrb- this field of carnage have three outlet all three bar : the bouillon road by the prussian guard the carignan road by the bavarian the mézières road by the wurtemburger the french have not think of barricade the railway viaduct three german battalion have occupy it during the night two isolate house on the balan road could be make the pivot of a long resistance but the german be there the wood from monvillier to bazeille bushy and dense might prevent the junction of the saxon master of la moncelle and the bavarian master of bazeille but the french have be forestall : they find the bavarian cut the underwood with they bill-hook the german army move in one piece in one absolute unity the crown prince of saxony be on the height of mairy whence he survey the whole action the command oscillate in the french army at the beginning of the battle at a quarter to six macmahon be wound by the bursting of a shell at seven o'clock ducrot replace he at ten o'clock wimpfen replace ducrot every instant the wall of fire be draw closer in the roll of the thunder be continuous a dismal pulverization of 90000 man never before have anything equal to this be see never before have a army be overwhelm beneath such a downpour of lead and iron at one o'clock all be lose the regiment fly helter-skelter into sedan but sedan begin to burn dijonval burn the ambulance burn there be nothing now possible but to cut they way out wimpfen brave and resolute propose this to the emperor the 3d zouave desperate have set the example cut off from the rest of the army they have force a passage and have reach belgium a flight of lion suddenly above the disaster above the huge pile of dead and die above all this unfortunate heroism appear disgrace the white flag be hoist turenne and vauban be both present one in he statue the other in he citadel the statue and the citadel witness the awe-striking capitulation these two virgin one of bronze the other of granite feel themselves prostitute o noble face of we country oh eternal blush -lrb- 38 -rrb- the franco-german war of 1870-71 report of the prussian staff page 1087 chapter vi this disaster of sedan be easy of avoidance by any other man but impossible of avoidance for loui bonaparte he avoid it so little that he seek it _ lex fatus _ we army seem expressly arrange for the catastrophe the soldier be uneasy ignorant of he whereabouts famish on the 31st of August in the street of sedan soldier be seek they regiment and go from door to door ask for bread we have see the emperor 's order announce the next day September 1st as a day of rest in truth the army be wear out with fatigue and yet it have only march by short stage the soldier be almost lose the habit of march one corps the 1st for example only accomplish two league per day -lrb- on the 29th of August from stonne to raucourt -rrb- during that time the german army inexorably command and drive at the stick 's end like the army of the xerx achieve march of fourteen league in fifteen hour which enable it to arrive unexpectedly and to surround the french army while asleep it be customary to allow oneself to be surprised general failly allow himself to be surprise at beaumont during the day the soldier take they gun to piece to clean they at night they sleep without even cut the bridge which deliver they to the enemy thus they neglect to blow up the bridge of mouzon and bazeille on September 1st daylight have not yet appear when a advance guard of seven battalion command by general schultz capture la rulle and insure the junction of the army of the meuse with the royal guard almost at the same minute with german precision the wurtemburger seize the bridge of la platinerie and hide by the chevalier wood the saxon battalion spread out into company column occupy the whole of the road from la moncelle to villers-cernay thus as we have see the awakening of the french army be horrible at bazeille a fog be add to the smoke we soldier attack in this gloom know not what death require of they they fight from room to room and from house to house -lrb- 39 -rrb- it be in vain that the reboul brigade come to support the martin des pallières brigade they be oblige to yield at the same time ducrot be compel to concentrate he force in the garenne wood before the calvary of illy douay shatter fall back lebrun alone stand firm on the plateau of stenay we troops occupy a line of five kilomètres the front of the french army face the east the left face the north the extreme left -lrb- the guyomar brigade -rrb- face the west but they do not know whether they face the enemy they do not see he annihilation strike without show itself they have to deal with a mask medusa we cavalry be excellent but useless the field of battle obstruct by a large wood cut up by clump of tree by house and by farm and by enclosure wall be excellent for artillery and infantry but bad for cavalry the rivulet of givonne which flow at the bottom of the valley and cross it for three day run with more blood than water among other place of carnage saint-menge be appalling for a moment it appear possible to cut a way out by carignan towards montmédy and then this outlet reclose this refuge only remain sedan sedan encumber with cart with wagon with carriage with hospital hut a heap of combustible matter this die agony of hero last ten hour they refuse to surrender they grow indignant they wish to complete they death so bravely begin they be deliver up to it as we have say three man three dauntless soldier have succeed each other in the command macmahon ducrot wimpfen macmahon have only time to be wound ducrot have only time to commit a blunder wimpfen have only time to conceive a heroic idea and he conceive it but macmahon be not responsible for he wound ducrot be not responsible for he blunder and wimpfen be not responsible for the impossibility of he suggestion to cut they way out the shell which strike macmahon withdraw he from the catastrophe ducrot 's blunder the inopportune order to retreat give to general lebrun be explain by the confused horror of the situation and be rather a error than a fault wimpfen desperate need 20000 soldier to cut he way out and could only get together 2000 history exculpate these three man in this disaster of sedan there be but one sole and fatal general the emperor that which be knit together on the 2d December 1851 come apart on the 2d September 1870 the carnage on the boulevard montmartre and the capitulation of sedan be we maintain the two part of a syllogism logic and justice have the same balance it be loui bonaparte 's dismal destiny to begin with the black flag of massacre and to end with the white flag of disgrace -lrb- 39 -rrb- the french be literally awaken from sleep by we attack -- helvic chapter vii there be no alternative between death and opprobrium either soul or sword must be surrender loui bonaparte surrender he sword he write to william : sire my brother not have be able to die in the midst of my troops it only remain for I to place my sword in you majesty 's hand i be you majesty you good brother napoleon sedan 1st September 1870 william answer sire my brother i accept you sword and on the 2d of September at six o'clock in the morning this plain streaming with blood and cover with dead saw pass by a gilded open carriage and four the horse harness after daumont fashion and in this carriage a man cigarette in mouth it be the emperor of the french go to surrender he sword to the king of prussium the king keep the emperor wait it be too early he send m de bismarck to loui bonaparte to say that he would not receive he yet awhile loui bonaparte enter into a hovel by the side of the road a table and two chair be there bismarck and he lean they arm on the table and converse a mournful conversation at the hour which suit the king towards noon the emperor get back into he carriage and go to the castle of bellevue half way to the castle of vandresse there he wait until the king come at one o'clock william arrive from vandresse and consent to receive bonaparte he receive he badly attilum have not a light hand the king a blunt straightforward man show the emperor a pity involuntarily cruel there be pity which overwhelm the conqueror upbraid the conquer with the victory bluntness handle a open wound badly whatever be you reason for declare this war the conquer excuse himself accuse france the distant hurrah of the victorious german army cut short this dialogue the king cause the emperor to be reconduct by a detachment of the royal guard this excess of ignominy be call a escort of honor after the sword the army on the 3d of September loui bonaparte hand over to germany 88000 french soldier in addition -lrb- say the prussian report -rrb- : -- one eagle and two flag 419 field-gun and mitrailleus 139 heavy piece 1079 vehicle of all kind 60000 musket 6000 horse still good for service these german figure be not wholly to be depend upon accord to what seem useful at the moment the aulic chancellor swell or reduce the disaster there be about 13000 wound amongst the prisoner the number vary in the official document a prussian report reckon up the french soldier kill and wound in the battle of sedan publish this total : _ sixteen thousand four hundred _ man this number cause a shudder for it be that very number _ sixteen thousand four hundred _ man which saint arnaud have set to work on the boulevard montmartre upon the 4th of December 1851 half a league to the north-west of sedan near ige the bend of the meuse almost form a island a canal cross the isthmus so that the peninsula become a island it be there that there be pen under the stick of the prussian corporal 83000 french soldier a few sentinel watch over this army they place but few insolently these conquer man remain there ten day the wound almost without care the able-bodied almost without nourishment the german army sneer around they the heaven take part against they the weather be fearful neither hut nor tent not a fire not a truss of straw for ten day and ten night these 83000 prisoner bivouac with they head beneath the rain they foot in the mud many die of fever regret the hail of bullet at length ox-wagon come and take they away the king place the emperor in some place or other wilhelmshöhe what a thing of rag and tatters a emperor draw like a fowl chapter viii i be there thoughtful i look on these field these ravine these hill shudder i would willingly have insult this terrible place but sacred horror hold I back the station-master of sedan come to my carriage and explain to I what i have before my eye i seem to see through he word the pale lightning of the battle all these distant cottage scatter about and charming in the sun have be burn they be rebuild nature so quickly divert have repair everything have clean everything have sweep everything have replace everything the ferocious convulsion of man have vanish eternal order have resume its sway but as i have say the sun be there in vain all this valley be smoke and darkness in the distance upon a eminence to my left i see a huge castle it be vandresse there lodge the king of prussium halfway up this height along the road i distinguish above the tree three pointed gable it be another castle bellevue there loui bonaparte surrender to william there he have give and deliver up we army it be there that not be immediately admit and request to exercise a little patience he have remain for nearly a hour silent and wan before the door bring he disgrace and wait until it should please william to open the door to he it be there that before receive it the king of prussium have make the sword of france dangle about in a ante-chamber lower down nearer in the valley at the beginning of a road lead to vandresse they point out to I a species of hovel there they tell I while wait for the king of prussium the emperor napoleon iii have get down livid he have go into a little courtyard which they point out to I and where a dog growl on the chain he have seat himself on a stone close by a dunghill and he have say i be thirsty a prussian soldier have bring he a glass of water terrible end of the _ coup d'état _ blood when it be drunk do not quench the thirst a hour be to come when the unhappy one should utter the cry of fever and of agony disgrace reserve for he this thirst and prussium this glass of water fearful dregs of destiny beyond the road at a few step from I five tremble and pale poplar sheltered the front of the house the single story of which be surmount by a sign on this sign be write in great letter this name : drouet i become haggard _ drouet _ i read _ varenne _ tragical chance which mingle varenne with sedan seem to wish to bring the two catastrophe face to face and to couple in a manner with the same chain the emperor a prisoner of the foreigner to the king a prisoner of he people the mist of reverie veil this plain from I the meuse appear to I to wear a ruddy reflection the neighbor isle whose verdure i have admire have for its subsoil a tomb : fifteen hundred horse and as many man be bury there : thence the thick grass here and there as far as could be see mound cover with ill-favored vegetation dot the valley each of these patch of vegetation mark the place of a bury regiment there guyomar 's brigade have be annihilate there the lhéritier division have be exterminate here the 7th corps have perish there without have even reach the enemy 's infantry have fall beneath the cool and well-aimed firing as the prussian report state the whole of general margueritte 's cavalry from these two height the most elevated of this circle of hill daigny opposite givonne which be 266 mètres high fleigneux opposite illy 296 mètres high the battery of the prussian royal guard have crush the french army it be do from above with the terrible authority of destiny it seem as though they have come there purposely these to kill the other to die a valley for a mortar the german army for a pestle such be the battle of sedan i gaze powerless to avert my eye at this field of disaster at this undulating country which have prove no protection to we regiment at this ravine where all we cavalry be demolish at all this amphitheatre where the catastrophe be spread out at the gloomy escarpment of la marphée at these thicket at these declivity at these precipice at these forest fill with ambush and in this terrible shadow o thou the invisible i see thee chapter ix never be there a more dismal fall no expiation can be compare with this the unprecedented drama be in five act so fierce that aeschylus himself would not have dare to dream of they the ambush the struggle the massacre the victory the fall what a tangle and what a unwind a poet who would have predict it would have seem a traitor god alone could permit himself sedan everything in proportion such be he law far worse than brumaire it need a more crush retribution than waterloo the first napoleon as we have say elsewhere -lrb- 40 -rrb- have face he destiny he have not be dishonor by he punishment he fall while steadfastly regard god he come back to paris appraise the desert of those man who overthrow he proudly distinguish amongst they esteem lafayette and despise dupin he have at the last moment wish to see clearly into he destiny he have not allow he eye to be bandage he have accept the catastrophe while make he condition with it here there be nothing of the kind one might almost say that the traitor be strike treacherously in this case there be a bad man who feel himself in the grasp of destiny and who do not know what it be do to he he be at the summit of he power the blind master of a idiot world he have wish for a _ plebiscitum _ he have have one he have at he foot this very william it be at this moment that he crime suddenly seize he he do not struggle against it he be the condemn man who obey he sentence he submit to everything which terrible fate exact from
