governor of jamaica governor-general of canada envoy to china viceroy of indium edit by theodore walrond cb with a preface by arthur penrhyn stanley dd dean of westminster preface have be consult by the family and friend of the late lord elgin as to the best mode of give to the world some record of he life and have thus contract a certain responsibility in the work now lay before the public i have consider it my duty to prefix a few word by way of preface to the follow page on lord elgin 's death it be think that a career intimately connect with so many critical point in the history of the british empire and contain in itself so much of intrinsic interest ought not to be leave without a enduring memorial the need of this be the more feel because lord elgin be prevent by the peculiar circumstance of he public course from enjoy the familiar recognition to which he would else have be entitle amongst he contemporary in england ` for ' -lrb- if i may use the word which i have employ on a former occasion -rrb- ` it be one of the sad consequence of a statesman 's life spend like he in the constant service of he country on arduous foreign mission that in he own land in he own circle almost in he own home he place be occupy by other he very face be forget he can maintain no permanent tie with those who rule the opinion or obtain the mastery of the day he have identify himself with no exist party he have make himself feel in none of those domestic and personal struggle which attract the attention and fix the interest of the many who contribute in large measure to form the public opinion of the time for twenty year the few interval of lord elgin 's residence in these island be to be count not by year but by month and the majority of those who might be reckon amongst he friend and acquaintance remember he chiefly as the eager and accomplished oxford student at christ church or at merton ' the material for supply this blank be in some respects abundant besides the official despatch and other communication which have pass between himself and the home government during he successive absence in jamaica canada china and indium he have in the two latter position keep up a constant correspondence almost of the nature of a journal with lady elgin which combine with he reflection on public event the expression of he more personal feeling and thus reveal not only he own genial and affectionate nature but also indicate something of that singularly poetic and philosophic turn of mind that union of grace and power which have he course lain in the more tranquil walk of life would have achieve no mean place amongst english thinker and writer these material he family at my suggestion commit to my friend mr theodore walrond whose sound judgment comprehensive view and official experience be know to many besides myself and who seem not less fit to act as interpreter to the public at large of such a life and character because not have be personally acquaint with lord elgin or connect with any of the public transaction record in the follow page he be able to speak with the sobriety of calm appreciation rather than the warmth of personal attachment in this spirit he kindly undertake in the interval of constant public occupation to select from the vast mass of material place at he disposal such extract as most vividly bring out the main feature of lord elgin 's career add such illustration as could be glean from private or publish document or from the remembrance of friend if the work have unavoidably be delay beyond the expect term yet it be hope that the interest in those great colonial dependency for which lord elgin labor have not diminish with the lapse of year it be believe also that there be no time when it will not be good for he countryman to have bring before they those statesmanlike gift which accomplish the successful accommodation of a more varied series of novel and entangled situation than have perhaps fall to the lot of any other public man within we own memory especially might be name that rare quality of a strong overrule sense of the justice due from man to man from nation to nation that ` combination of speculative and practical ability ' -lrb- so write one who have deep experience of he mind -rrb- ` which peculiarly fit he to solve the problem how the subject race of a civilised empire be to be govern ' that firm courageous and far-sighted confidence in the triumph of those liberal and constitutional principle -lrb- in the best sense of the word -rrb- which have secure the greatness of england be in he judgment also applicable under other form to the difficult circumstance of new country and diverse time ` it be a singular coincidence ' say lord elgin in a speech at benare a few month before he end ` that three successive governors-general of indium should have stand towards each other in the relationship of contemporary friend lord dalhousie when name to the government of indium be the youngest man who have ever be appoint to a situation of such high responsibility and trust lord canning be in the prime of life and i if i be not already on the decline be nearer to the verge of it than either of my contemporary who have precede I when i be leave england for indium lord ellenborough who be now alas the only survive ex-governor-general say to I ` you be not a very old man but depend upon it you will find yourself by far the oldest man in indium ' to that mournful catalogue be add he own name within the brief space of one year and now a fourth not indeed bind to the other by tie of personal or political friendship but like in energetic discharge of he duty and in the prime of usefulness in which he be cut off have fall by a fate yet more untimely these tragical incident invest the high office to which such precious life have be sacrifice with a new and solemn interest there be something especially pathetic when the gallant vessel as it be go down within very sight of the

mother lord elgin 's second wife be a daughter of mr oswald of dunnikier in fifeshire she deep piety unite with wide reach of mind and vary culture make she admirably qualify to be the depositary of the ardent thought and aspiration of he boyhood and as he grow up he find a second mother in he elder sister matilda who become the wife of sir john maxwell of pollok to the influence of such a mother and such a sister he probably owe the pliancy and power of sympathy with other for which he be remarkable and which be not often find in character of so tough a fiber to they from he earliest year he confide the outpouring of he deeper religious feeling one expression of such feeling date June 1821 may be worth record as a example of that strong sense of duty and affection towards he brother which begin at that early age mark he whole subsequent career ` be with I this week in my study my amusement in everything when at my lesson may i think only of they play when i play : when dress may i be quick and never put off time and never amuse myself but in playhor oh may i set a good example to nay brother let I not teach they anything that be bad and may they not learn wickedness from see I may

lord canning jame ramsay -lrb- afterwards lord dalhousie -rrb- the late duke of newcastle sidney herbert and mr gladstone there be little to record respect this period of he life but a touching interest attach to the following extract from a letter write by he brother sir frederick bruce in November 1865 ` my recollection of elgin 's early life be owe to circumstance almost nothing in the year 1820 he go abroad with my father and mother and be away for two year from that time i recollect nothing until he go to eton and he holiday be then divide between torquay where my eldest brother be and broomhall -lrb- 1 -rrb- and of they my memory have retain nothing but the assistance in he later holiday he use to give I in classical study we be together for about a year and a half at oxford but he be so far advance in he study that we have very little in common to bring we together and i hardly remember any striking fact connect with he except one or two speech at the union club when in eloquence and originality he far outshine he competitor -lrb- 2 -rrb- ' i do not know whether mr welland be still alive : he probably better than anyone could give some sketch of he intellectual growth and of that beautiful trait in he character the devotion and abnegation he show o poor bruce -lrb- 3 -rrb- in he long and painful illness ` he be always reserve about he own feeling and aspiration owe to the shortness of he stay at oxford he have to work very hard and he friend like newcastle and hamilton be man who seek he for the soundness of he judgment which lead they to seek he advice in all matter he always stand to they in the relation of a much older man he have none of the frailty of youth and though very capable of enjoy its diversion life with he from a very early date be sickly o'er with the pale cast of think its practical aspect to he be one of anxiety and difficulty while he intellect be attract to high and abstract speculation and take little interest in the every-day routine which be sufficient occupation for ordinary mind like all man of original mind he live a life apart from he fellow ` he look upon the family estate rather as a trust than as a inheritance -- as far more valuable than money on account of the family tradition and the position which in we state of society be give to a family connect historically with the country elgin feel this deeply and he cling to it in spite of difficulty which would have deter a man of more purely selfish view ' ` it be melancholy to reflect ' add sir f bruce ` how those have disappear who could have fill up this gap in he history ' it be a reflection even more melancholy that the loved and trust brother who share so many of he labor and he aspiration no longer live to write that history and to illustrate in he own person the spirit by which it be animated the sense of the difficulty above refer to strongly impressed he mind even before he go to oxford and lay the foundation of that habit of self-denial in all personal matter which enable he through life to retain a feeling of independence and at the same time to give effect to the prompting of a generous nature ` you tell I ' he write to he father from college ' i coin money i uncoined you last order by put it into the fire have already supply myself ' about the middle of he oxford career a studentship fall vacant which accord to the strange system then prevalent be in the gift of dr bull one of the canon of christ church instead of bestow it as be too commonly do on grounds of private interest dr bull place the valuable prize at the disposal of the dean and censor to be confer on the most worthy of the undergraduate they choice fall on jame bruce in announce this to a member of the bruce family dr bull write : ` dr smith no less than the present college officer assure I that there be no young man of whatever rank who could be more acceptable to the society and none whose appointment as the reward of excellent deportment diligence and right-mindedness would do more good among the young man ' a letter write about this time to he father show that the young student with a sagacity beyond he year discern the germ of a evil which have since grow to a great height and now lie at the root of some of the most troublesome question connect with university education in my own mind i confess i be much of opinion that college be put off in general till too late -lrb- 4 -rrb- and the gain of _ honor _ therefore become too severe to be useful to man who be to enter into profession it be certainly originally intend that the degree which require only a knowledge of the classic should be take at a earlier age in order to admit of a residence after they be take during which the student might devote himself to science or composition and those habit of reflection by which the mind might be form and a practical advantage draw from the store of knowledge already acquire by put they off to so late a age the consequence have be that it have be necessary proportionably to increase the difficulty of they attainment and to mix up in college examination -lrb- which be suppose to depend upon study alone -rrb- essay in many case of a nature that demand the most prolonged and deep reflection the effect of this be evident those who from circumstance have neither opportunity nor leisure thus to reflect must in order to secure they success acquire that kind of superficial information which may enable they to draw sufficiently plausible conclusion upon very slight grounds and -lrb- of -rrb- many who have this _ form _ of knowledge most will eventually be prove -lrb- if this system be carry to a excess -rrb- to have but little of the _ substance _ of it he have mean to read for double honor but illness bring on by over - work oblige he to confine himself to classic all who know oxford be aware that the term ` classic ' as there use embrace not only greek and latin scholarship but also ancient history and philosophy in these latter study the natural taste and previous education of jame bruce lead he to take a special interest and he throw himself into the work in no niggard spirit -lrb- 5 -rrb- at the michaelma examination of 1832 he be place in the first class in classic and common report speak of he as ` the best first of he ` year ' not long afterwards he be elect fellow of merton he appear to have be a candidate also for the eldon scholarship but without success in a contest for a legal prize it be no discredit to be defeat by roundell palmer -lrb- sidenote : taste for philosophy -rrb- some of he contemporary have a lively remembrance of the eagerness with which while still a student he travel into field at that period beyond the somewhat narrow range of academic study professor maurice at one time dr pusey at another be he delighted companion in explore the dialogue of plato mr gladstone ` remember he speaking of milton 's prose work with great fervor when they be at eton together ' and add the confession -- interesting alike as regard both the young student -- ' i think it be from he mouth i first learn that milton have write any prose ' this affection for those soul-stirring treatise of the great advocate of free speech and inquiry he always retain : they form he constant companion wherever he travel and there be many occasion in which they influence may be trace on he thought and language ' i would rather swallow a bushel of chaff than lose the precious grain of truth which may somewhere or other be scatter in it ' be a sentiment which though express in much later life be characteristic of he whole career in this spirit he listen with deep interest to the roll of theological controversy then rage at oxford though he be never carry away by its violence in after life he have little leisure to pursue the philosophic study commence at oxford but they take deep and permanent hold on he mind and form in fact the groundwork of he great practical ability this be well state by sir frederick bruce : -- in elgin -lrb- to use the distinction of coleridge whose philosophy he have thoroughly master -rrb- the reason and understanding be both largely developed and both admirably balanced and in this combination lay the secret of he success in so many sphere of action so different in they characteristic so alike in they difficulty the process he go through be always the same he set himself to work to form in he own mind a clear idea of each of the constituent part of the problem with which he have to deal this he effect partly by read but still more by conversation with special man and by that extraordinary logical power of mind and penetration which not only enable he to get out of every man all he have in he but which reveal to those man themselves a knowledge of they own imperfect and crude conception and make they constantly unwilling witness or reluctant adherent to view which originally they be prepare to oppose to test the accuracy of they statement and observation and to discriminate between what be fact and what be prejudice or misconception he make use of the higher faculty of cultivate reason which enable he by he deep insight into the universal principle of human nature of form of government & c to bring to the consideration of particular fact the light of a a priori knowledge of what be to be expect under particular circumstance the result be that in a incredibly short time and with little apparent study or effort he attain a accurate and clear conception of the essential fact before he and be thus enable to strike out a course which he could consistently pursue amidst all difficulty because it be in harmony with the actual fact and the permanent condition of the problem he have to solve -lrb- sidenote : training for public life -rrb- the year which follow the completion of he academical study -- those golden year which generally determine the complexion of a man 's future life -- be not devote in he case to any definite pursuit for though he enter himself of lincoln 's inn in June 1835 he do not appear to have ever embark in the professional study of law the scanty notice which remain of this period show he chiefly reside at broomhall where in he father 's absence he take he place in the affair of the county of fife command he troop of yeomanry now preside at a farmer ' dinner for which be have write a appropriate song now at the request of dr chalmer speak at a public meeting in favor of church extension at one time we hear of long solitary ride over field and fall during which the thought and feeling that stir in he would take the shape of a sonnet or a poem to be confide to one of he sister at another time he be keep up a regular correspondence on abstruse question of philosophy with he brother frederick still at oxford in these pursuit as well as in the somewhat harass occupation of disentangle the family property from its embarrassment be be prepare himself for future usefulness by the exercise of the same industry and patience the same grasp both of detail and of general purpose which be show in the political career gradually dawn upon he it be observe that whatsoever he hand find to do he do it with all he might as well as with a judgment and discretion beyond he year and a tact akin to genius he be undergo perhaps the best training for the varied duty to which he be to be call -- that peculiarly british ` discipline of mind body and heart ' to which observer like bunsen attribute the effectiveness of england 's public man as early as 1834 when he have barely complete he twenty-third year he publish a letter to the elector of great britain with the view of vindicate the policy and the position of the tory leader more especially of the duke of wellington a similar motive the desire of protest against a monopoly of liberal sentiment by the whig and show in he own person that a tory be not necessarily a narrow

conservative not upon principle of exclusionism -- not from narrowness of view or illiberality of sentiment -- but because i believe that we admirable constitution on principle more exalted and under

here and a common hope hereafter i be a conservative not because i be adverse to improvement not because i be unwilling to repair what be waste or to supply what be defective in the political fabric but because i be satisfied that in order to improve effectually you must be resolve most religiously to preserve i be a conservative because i believe that the institution of we country religious as well as civil be wisely adapt when duly and faithfully administer to promote not the interest of any class or class exclusively but the happiness and welfare of the great body of the people and

reciprocity due regard be have to the interest which have grow up under we present commercial system without which as he conceive the rights of the labor class could not be protect much have be on various occasion say about the interest of the capitalist and the landlord but unless the measure of a government be direct equally to secure the rights of the work class they never should be support by a vote of he it be true that the landlord might derive some increase value to he property from the increase of factory and other building upon it and that the capitalist might more advantageously invest he capital or he might withdraw it from a sinking concern but the only capital of the labourer be he skill in he own particular walk and it be a mockery to tell he that he could find a satisfactory compensation elsewhere but the most characteristic part of he speech be that in which he comment on the ` harsh severe and unjust term ' in which it have be the fashion to designate those who have take a opposite view on these question to that take by she majesty 's government : -- in a day -lrb- he say -rrb- when all monopoly be denounce i must he permit to say that to my mind the

elma thurlow she be seize with violent convulsion which be nearly fatal and though to the surprise of the medical man she rally from this attack she health be seriously impaired and she die in the summer of the following year -lrb- sidenote : position of a governor in a west indian colony -rrb- there be probably few situation of greater difficulty and delicacy than that of the governor of a british colony which possess representative institution a constitutional sovereign but with frail and temporary tenure he be expect not to reign only but to govern and to govern under the order of a distant minister who if he have one eye on the colony must keep the other on home politics thus without any power in himself he be a meeting-point of two different and generally antagonistic force -- the will of the imperial government and the will of the local legislature to act in harmony with both these force and to bring they into something of harmony with each other require under the most favourable circumstance a rare union of firmness with patience and tact but the difficulty be much aggravate in a west indian colony in the early day of emancipation -lrb- sidenote : such as jamaica -rrb- here the local legislature be a democratic oligarchy partly compose of landowner but chiefly of overseer with no permanent stake in the country and this legislature have to be induce to pass measure for the benefit of those very black of whose enforced service they have be deprive and whose pay labor they find it difficult to obtain add to this that in jamaica a long period of contention with the mother-country have leave a feeling of bitter resentment for the past and sullen despondency as regard the future moreover the balance have to be hold between the church of england on the one hand which be in possession of all the ecclesiastical endowment and probably of all the learning and cultivation of the island and on the other hand the various sect especially that of the baptist who have fight vigorously for the negro in the battle of emancipation now hold undisputed sway over they mind and who as be natural find it difficult to abandon the position of demagogue and agitator lord elgin be at once fortunate and unfortunate in come after the most conciliatory and popular of governor sir c metcalfe the island be in a state of peace and harmony which have be long unknown to it but the singular affection which metcalfe have inspire in all class make they look forward with the most gloomy foreboding to the advent of he successor -lrb- sidenote : state of opinion in the island -rrb- moreover to use lord elgin 's own language a tone of despondency with reference to the prospects of the owner of property have long be consider the test of a sincere regard for the welfare of jamaica he who have be most successful in proclaim the depression under which the land and trading interest labor have be hold to be in the popular acceptation of the term the truest friend to the colony nothing could be more alien to the spirit of inquiry and enterprise which lead to practical improvement in a enervating climate with a proprietary for the most part non-resident and a peasantry generally independent of they employer much encouragement be requisite to induce manager to encounter the labor and responsibility which attend the introduction of new system but by reason of the unfortunate prepossession above describe the announcement of a belief that the planter have not exhaust the resource within they reach have be consider a declaration of hostility towards that class and truly -lrb- write lord elgin himself -rrb- the _ onus probandus _ lay and pretty heavily too upon the propounder of the obnoxious doctrine of hope be it not show on the face of unquestioned official return that the export of the island have dwindle to one-third of they former amount be it not attest even in parliament that estate which use to produce thousand annually be sink money year after year be it not apparent that the labourer stand in a relation of independence towards the owner of capital and land totally unknown to a similar class in any fully peopled country all these be fact and indisputable and again be it not equally certain that undeserved aspersion be cast upon the planter be they not hold responsible for result over which they could exercise no manner of control and be it not natural that have be thus calumniate they should be somewhat impatient of advice from the day of lord elgin 's arrival in the colony he be convince that the endeavor to work a change on public opinion in this respect would constitute one of he first and most important duty but he be not insensible to the difficulty with which the experiment be surround he feel that a new governor rash enough to assert that all be not yet accomplish which ingenuity and perseverance could achieve might have perill he chance of benefit the colony man would have say and with some truth ` he know nothing of the matter he information be derive from a or b he be a tool in they hand he will undo all the good which other have effect by enlist the sympathy of england in we favor ' he would have be deem a party man and become a object of suspicion and distrust it be soon find however that the new governor be as anxious as he predecessor have be to conciliate the good will and promote the interest of all rank of the community in a spirit of perfect fairness and moderation the agitation of vex constitutional question he earnestly deprecate as likely to interrupt the harmony happily prevail between the several branch of the legislature and to divert the attention of influential member of the community from the material interest of the colony to the consideration of more exciting subject ' i do not underrate ' he say ` the importance of constitutional question nor be i insensible to the honor which may be acquire by they satisfactory adjustment in the present crisis of we fortune however i be impressed with the belief that he be the best friend to jamaica who concentrate he energy on the promotion of the moral well-being of the population and the restoration of the economical prosperity of the island ' -lrb- sidenote : question of finance -rrb- the finances of the colony be at this time in a state to require the most careful treatment at a moment when the recent violent change in the distribution of the wealth of the community have leave the proprietary body generally in a depressed condition the legislature have to provide for the want of the newly emancipate population by increase at great cost the ecclesiastical and judicial establishment and at the same time it be necessary that a quantity of inconvertible paper recently set afloat should be redeem if the currency be to be fix on a sound basis under these condition it be not easy to equalise the receipt and expenditure of the island treasury and the difficulty be not diminish by the necessity of satisfy critic at home before long a occasion arise to test lord elgin 's tact and discretion in mediate on such question between the colony and the mother-country towards the end of 1842 a new tariff be enact by the legislature of the island when the act embody it be send home it be find to violate certain economical principle recently adopt in this country a angry despatch from down street inform lord elgin that it be disapprove and that nothing but a apprehension of the financial embarrassment that must ensue prevent its be formally disallow in term almost amount to a reprimand it be intimate that the adoption of such objectionable enactment might be prevent if the governor would exercise the legitimate influence of he office in oppose they and it be add ` if unfortunately you effort should be unsuccessful and if any such bill should be present for you acceptance it be she majesty 's pleasure and command that you withhold you assent from it ' lord elgin reply by a temperate representation that it be but natural that trace of a policy long sanction by the mother-country should remain in the legislation of the colony that the duty in question be not find injuriously to check trade while they be need to meet the expenditure : moreover that the assembly be and always have be extremely jealous of any interference in the matter of self-taxation : lastly that ` while sensible that the service of a governor must be unprofitable if he fail to acquire and exercise a legitimate moral influence in the general conduct of affair he be at the same time convinced that a just appreciation of the difficulty with which the legislature of the island have yet to contend and of the sacrifice and exertion already make under the pressure of no ordinary embarrassment be a indispensable condition to he usefulness ' the home government feel the weight of these consideration and the correspondence close with the revocation of the peremptory command above quote -lrb- sidenote : education -rrb- the object which lord elgin have most at heart be to improve the moral and social condition of the negro and to fit they by education for the freedom which have be thrust upon they but with characteristic tact and sagacity he prefer to compass this end through the agency of the planter themselves by encourage the application of mechanical contrivance to agriculture he seek to make it the interest not only of the peasant to acquire but of the planter to give they the education necessary for use machinery while he lose no opportunity of impress on the land-owning class that if they wish to secure a constant supply of labor they could not do so better than by create in the labor class the want which belong to educate being the following extract from private letter write at the time to the secretary of state contain the freshest and best expression of he view on these and similar question of island politics : -- in some quarter i be inform that less desire for education be show now by the negro than during the apprenticeship and the reason assign be that it be then suppose that certain social and political advantage would accrue to those who be able to read but that now when all be gain and all be on a par in these respects the same zeal for learn no longer prevail it have be suggest that a great impulse might be give in this direction by work on the feeling which exist formerly confine the franchise for instance to qualify person who could read or by some other expedient of the same nature this be a important constitutional question i have not think it right to give the notion any encouragement but i submit it as come from person who be i believe sincere well-wisher to the negro it be not very easy to keep child steadily at school or to enforce a very rigid discipline on they when they be there parent who have never be themselves educate can not be expect to attach a very high value to education the system of slavery be not calculate to strengthen the family tie and parent do not i apprehend exercise generally a very steady and consistent control in they family the consequence be that child be pretty generally at liberty to attend school or not as they please if the rise generation however be not educate what be to become of this island that they have withdraw themselves to a considerable extent from field labor be i think generally admit it be therefore undoubtedly desirable that all legitimate inducement should be hold out both to parent and child to encourage the latter to attend school in urge the adoption of machinery in aid of manual labor one main object i have have in view have ever be the creation of a aristocracy among the labourer themselves the substitution of a give amount of skilled labor for a larger amount of unskilled my hope be that we may thus engender a healthy emulation among the labourer a desire to obtain situation of eminence and mark among they fellow and also to push they child forwards in the same career where labor be so scarce as it be here it be undoubtedly a great object to be able to effect at a cheaper rate by machinery what you now attempt to execute very unsatisfactorily by the hand of man but it seem to I to be a still more important object to awaken this honorable ambition in the breast of the peasant and i do not see how this can be effect by any other means so long as labor mean nothing more than digging cane hole or carry load on the head physical strength be the only thing require no moral or intellectual quality come into play but in deal with mechanical appliance the case be different knowledge acuteness steadiness be at a premium the negro will soon appreciate the worth of these quality when they give he position among he own class a indirect value will thus attach to education every successful effort make by enterprising and intelligent individual to substitute skilled for unskilled labor every premium award by society in acknowledgment of superior honesty carefulness or ability have a tendency to afford a remedy the most salutary and effectual which can be devise for the evil here set forth -lrb- sidenote : agriculture -rrb- with the view of awaken a interest in the subject of agricultural improvement lord elgin himself offer a premium of 100_l _ for the best practical treatise on the cultivation of the cane with a special reference to the adoption of mechanical aid and appliance in aid or in lieu of mechanical labor in forwarding to lord stanley print copy of eight of the essay which compete for the prize he write as follow : -- much i believe be involve in the issue of this and similar experiment so long as the planter despair -- so long as he assume that the cane can be cultivate and sugar manufacture at profit only on the system adopt during slavery -- so long as he look to external aid -lrb- among which i class immigration -rrb- as he sole hope of salvation from ruin -- with what feeling must he contemplate all earnest effort to civilise the mass of the population be education necessary to qualify the peasantry to carry on the rude field operation of slavery may not some person even entertain the apprehension that it will indispose they to such pursuit but let he on the other hand believe that by the substitution of more artificial method for those hitherto employ he may materially abridge the expense of raise he produce and he can not fail to perceive that a intelligent well-educated labourer with something of a character to lose and a reasonable ambition to stimulate he to exertion be likely to prove a instrument more apt for he purpose than the ignorant drudge who differ from the slave only in be no longer amenable to personal restraint -lrb- 1 -rrb- one of the measure in which lord elgin take the most active interest be the establishment of a ` general agricultural society for the island of jamaica ' and he be much gratify by receive she majesty 's permission to give to it the sanction of she name as patroness i be confident -lrb- he write to lord stanley -rrb- that the notice which she majesty be pleased to take of the institution will be duly appreciate and will be productive of much good you must allow I to remark -lrb- he add -rrb- that moral result of much moment be involve in the issue of the effort which we be now make for the improvement of agriculture in this colony not only have the impulse which have be impart to the public mind in jamaica be beneficial in itself and in its direct effect but it have i be firmly persuade check oppose tendency which threaten very injurious consequence to negro civilisation to reconcile the planter to the heavy burden which he be call to bear for the improvement of we establishment and the benefit of the mass of the population it be necessary to persuade he that he have a interest in raise the standard of education and moral among the peasantry and this belief could be impart only by inspiring a taste for a more artificial system of husbandry by the silent operation of such salutary conviction prejudice of old standing be remove the friend of the negro and of the proprietary class find themselves almost unconsciously act in concert and conspire to complete that great and holy work of which the emancipation of the slave be but the commencement -lrb- sidenote : the labor class -rrb- on a general survey of the state of the labor class take after he have be a little more than a year in the island he be able to give a most favourable report of they condition in all that concern material prosperity and comfort of live the truth be -lrb- he write -rrb- that we labourer be for the most part in the position of person who live habitually within they income they be generally sober and frugal and accustomed to a low standard of live they garden supply they in great measure with the necessaries of life the chief part therefore of what they receive in money whether as wages or as the price of the surplus produce of they provision grounds they can lay aside for occasional call and when they set they mind on a acquisition or a indulgence they do not stickle at the cost i be tell that in the shop at kingston expensive article of dress be not unusually purchase by member of the family of black labourer whether the lady be good judge of the merit of silk and cambric i do not pretend to decide but they pay ready money and it be not for the seller to cavil at they discrimination the purchase of land as you well know be go on rapidly throughout the island and the money thus invest must have be chiefly though not entirely accumulate by the labor class since slavery be abolish a proprietor tell I the other day that he have within twelve month sell ten acre of land in small lot for the sum of 900_l _ the land sell at so high a price be situate near a town and the purchaser pay he a annual rent of 50_s _ per acre for provision grounds on the more distant part of the estate again in most district the labourer be possess of horse for which they often pay handsomely a farm servant not unfrequently give from 12_l _ to 20_l _ for a animal which he intend to employ not for purpose of profit but in ride to church or on occasion of festivity whence then be these fund derive that the peasantry be generally frugal and sober i have already observe but they be assuredly not call to tax they physical power unduly in order to achieve the independence i have describe although the estate i lately visit be well manage and the best understanding subsist between employer and labourer the latter seldom make they appearance in the field until some time after i have sally forth for my morning walk they work on the estate only nine day in the fortnight devote the alternate friday to the cultivation of they provision grounds and the saturday to marketing and amusement on the whole see that the climate be suit to they constitution that they experience none of the drawback to which new settler even in the most fertile country be subject that they be by disposition and temperament a cheerful race i much doubt whether any people on the face of the globe enjoy as large a share of happiness as the creole peasantry of this island and this be a representation not over-charged or highly color but draw in all truth and sobriety of the actual condition of a population which be a very few year ago subject to the degrading depressing influence of slavery well may you and other who take part in the work of emancipation rejoice in the success of you great experiment but be it possible to indulge the same feeling of exultation when contemplate they condition morally and mark the indication of advance towards a higher state of civilisation in the island itself controversy be rife as to the degree in which such result have be already achieve and the promise of further progress some of the more enthusiastic and ardent of that class of person who have be the zealous advocate of the interest of the negro population at a former period be now dispose to judge most hardly of they conduct they very sympathy with the victim of the system formerly prevail lead they to conceive unbounded hope of the benefit moral and social alike which a change would effect the admirable behavior of the peasantry at the time of emancipation confirm such anticipation and they be now begin to experience disappointment on finding that all they look for be not immediately realize these feeling however lord elgin do not share on the whole -lrb- he say -rrb- i feel confident that the moral result consequent on the introduction of freedom have be as satisfactory as could in reason have be expect and notwithstanding the very serious pecuniary loss which this measure have entail in many quarter few indeed even if they have the power to do so would consent to return to the system which have be abandon it be gratify in the highest degree to observe the feeling now subsist between those who lately stand to each other in the relation of master and slave past wrong be forget and in the every-day dealings between man and man the humanity of the labourer be unhesitatingly recognize -lrb- sidenote : religion -rrb- we have see how zealously lord elgin exert himself to realize he own hope for the prosperity of the colony by encourage the spread of secular and industrial education not that he regard secular education as all-sufficient he sympathy -lrb- 2 -rrb- be entirely with those who believe that while ` it be a great and a good thing to know the law that govern this world it be better still to have some sort of faith in the relation of this world with another that the knowledge of cause and effect can never replace the motive to do right and avoid wrong that we clergyman and minister be more useful than we schoolmaster that religion be the motive power the faculty be the machine : and the machine be useless without the motive power ' -lrb- 3 -rrb- but as a practical statesman he feel that the one kind of education he have it in he power to forward directly by measure fall within he own legitimate province while the other he could only promote indirectly by point out the need for it and draw attention to the peculiar circumstance of the island respect it the follow be a few of the passage in which he refer to the subject : -- -lrb- sidenote : the church -rrb- much have be do by the island legislature -- more i think than could reasonably have be look for under the circumstance -- towards make provision for the religious necessity of the population but the daily formation of small mountain settlement and the consequent dispersion of large number in district remote from the established place of worship add greatly to the difficulty of extend to all these humanise and civilise influence the church can keep its footing here only by the exhibition of missionary zeal and devotion temper by a spirit of christian benevolence and conciliation i regret to say that some of the unhappy controversy which be vex the church in england have break out here of late discussion of this nature be singularly unprofitable where the people need to be instruct in the very rudiment of christian knowledge and where it be so desirable to keep well with all who profess to have a similar object in view a single bishop in a colony where large fund be provide by the state for church purpose and where he be beyond the reach of the public opinion of england exercise a very great and irresponsible authority if a zealous man of extreme view on point of doctrine the clergy of the diocese look to he alone for advancement in they profession be apt to echo he sentiment and the wide folding door of we mother church which she fling open for the reception of so many to use milton 's word ` brotherly dissimilitude that be not vastly disproportioned ' be contract to the exclusion perchance of some whom it be desirable to retain in we communion if on the other hand he be a man of but moderate piety ability and firmness the importunity of friend at a distance who may wish to provide for dependent or connection and other consideration which need not be enumerate may tempt he to lower the standard of ministerial qualification of which he be of course the sole judge it require a person of much christian principle and singular moderation discretion and tact to administer power of this nature well i have every hope that the bishop whom you have send we will prove equal to the task for the sake of humanity and civilisation as well as for the interest of the island i fervently trust that i may not be disappoint in my expectation on this head the complex and thwart current of interest and opinion that may exist in a colony respect the maintenance of a state church be well illustrate in the following extract : -- very soon after i arrive here i feel satisfied that the conflict of party in the colony would ere long assume a new character i perceive that the hostility to the proprietary interest which be suppose to actuate certain class of person who have much influence with the peasantry be on the decline should a state of quiescence prove incompatible with the maintenance of they hold on they flock analogy lead I to anticipate that the established church would in all probability become a object of attack consider the facility with which the franchise may be acquire it be not a little remarkable that the constituency should have hitherto increase so slowly this phenomenon have not escape the notice of the opponent of the union of church and state and they have ascribe it to the true cause they be sensible that all uneducated population in easy circumstance without practical grievance be not likely to be intent on the acquisition of political privilege they have therefore undertake to supply they with a grievance in order to whet they appetite for the franchise and also to provide they with guide who shall instruct they in the proper use of it but in attempt to carry this scheme into effect they have encounter a obstacle which have for the time entirely frustrate they intention the more educate and intelligent of the brown party listen with disapprobation to the tone in which the baptist minister and they adherent arrogate to themselves exclusively the title of friend and leader of the black population many person of this class have already embark in public life some as member of assembly have take part in those transaction which be the object of the bitterest denunciation of the anti-church party a few be churchman other wesleyan the prospect of a baptist oligarchy ruling in undivided sway disquiet they they have they doubt as to whether in the present stage of we civilisation the peasantry of this island would evince much discrimination in they selection of a religion if leave in that matter entirely to themselves in the chequered array of color which we religious world even now present comprise every shade from roman catholicism and judaism to myalism and provide spiritual gratification for every eye they still think it on the whole desirable that predominance should be give to some one over the rest many have experience the bounty of the legislature which have be most liberal in afford aid to all sect who have apply for it they be not therefore as yet ready for the overthrow of the church establishment but i will not take upon myself to affirm that as a body they be prepare to incur political martyrdom in its defense but apart from the difficulty -- social moral and religious -- at which we have glance there be enough in the political aspect of affair to fill the governor of jamaica with anxiety the franchise be within the reach of every one who choose to stretch out a hand and grasp it might at any time be claim by vast number of person who have recently be slave and be still generally illiterate and the assembly for which this constituency have to provide member exercise great authority within its own sphere it discharge a large portion of the function which usually devolve upon a executive government it initiate all legislative measure besides vote the supplies from year to year what hope be there that a body so constitute would wield such power with discretion -lrb- sidenote : harmonise influence of british institution -rrb- lord elgin 's answer to this question show that he already cherish that faith in the harmonise influence of british institution on a mixed population which afterwards at a critical period of canadian history be the mainspring of he policy a sojourner in this sea of the antille who be watch with heartfelt anxiety the progress of the great experiment of negro emancipation -lrb- a experiment which must result in failure unless religion and civilisation minister to the mind that freedom which the enactment of law have secure for the body -rrb- might well be tempt to view the prospect to which i have now introduce you with some feeling of misgiving be he not reassure by he firm reliance on the harmonise influence of british connexion and the power of self - adaptation inherent in we institution on the one side he see the model republic of haytus -- a color community which have enjoy nearly half a century of entire independence and self-rule and with what issue as respects moral and intellectual culture stagnation : in all that concern material development a fatal retrogression he behold there at this day a miserable parody of european and american institution without the spirit that animate either : the tinsel of french sentiment on the ground of negro ignorance : even the ` sacred right of ` insurrection ' burlesque : a people which have for its only living belief a ill-defined apprehension of the superiority of the white man and for the rest blunder on without faith in what regard this world or that which be to come he turn he eye to another quarter and perceive the cluster of state which have form themselves from the breakup of the spanish continental dominion what ground of consolation or hope do he discover there these illustration of the working of free system construct out of the wreck of a broken-down african slave trade be not indeed encouraging but neither do they in my opinion warrant despair i believe that by great caution and diligence by firmness and gentleness on the part of the parent state and much prudence in the instrument which it employ a people with a heart and soul may be build up out of the material in we hand i regard we local constitution as a _ fait accompli _ and have no desire to remove a stone of the fabric i think that a popular representative system be perhaps the best expedient that can be devise for blend into one harmonious whole a community compose of diverse race and color and this conviction be strengthen when i read the observation of sir h macleod and governor light on the color class in demerara and trinidad in colony which have no assembly it would appear that aspire intellect have not the same opportunity of find they level and pen up ambition lack a vent in study the play of the various force at work around he and in endeavor to direct they to good issue lord elgin find the best solace for the domestic sorrow which darken this period of he life he live chiefly in retirement at a country-house call craigton in the blue mountain with he sister now lady charlotte locker and he brother robert who be also he most able and efficient secretary see little society beyond that occasion by official intercourse and reception which be never intermit at spanish town the seat of government the isolation and monotony of this position break only once by a conference hold with some of the neighbouring governor on a question of common interest respect immigration could not fail to be distasteful to he active spirit and when it have last over three year it be not unnatural that he should seek to be relieve from it early in 1845 we find he write to lord stanley as follow : -- -lrb- sidenote : resignation -rrb- i be warn by the commencement of the year 1845 that i have fill the situation of governor of jamaica for as long a time as any of my predecessor since the duke of manchester the period of my administration have not be mark by striking incident but it have be one of considerable social progress uninterrupted harmony have prevail between the colonist and the local government and it may perhaps without exaggeration be affirm that the spirit of enterprise which have proceed from jamaica during the past two year have enable the british west indian colony to endure with comparative fortitude apprehension and difficulty which might otherwise have depress they beyond measure circumstance have however occur since my arrival in the colony unconnected with public affair which have materially affect my view in life and which make I contemplate with much repugnance the prospect of a indefinitely prolonged sojourn in this place without dwelling at any greater length on these painful topic i venture to trust that you will acquit I of undue presumption when i assure you that in my present forlorn and isolate position nothing enable I to persevere in the discharge of my duty except the hope that my humble service may earn for I you confidence and the approbation of my sovereign and prove not altogether unprofitable to the community over whose interest i be appoint to watch he remain however at he post for more than a year longer and quit it in the spring of 1846 on leave of absence with the understanding that he should not be require to return to jamaica -lrb- sidenote : appointment to canada -rrb- during nearly the whole period of he government the seal of the colonial office have be hold by lord stanley to whom he owe he appointment and at the break-up of the tory party in the beginning of 1846 they pass into the hand of he old schoolfellow and college friend mr gladstone but he have scarcely arrive in england when a new secretary arise in the person of lord gray to whom he be unknown except by reputation it be all the more creditable to both party that in spite of they political difference lord gray should first have endeavor to induce he on public grounds alone to retain the government of jamaica with the promise of he unreserved confidence and most cordial support and shortly afterwards should have offer to he the still more important post of governor-general of british north america ' i believe ' write he lordship in make the offer ` that it would be difficult to point out any situation in which great talent would find more scope for useful exertion or be more want at this moment and i be sure that i could not hope to find anyone whom i could recommend to she majesty for that office with so much confidence as yourself ' so splendid a offer make in a manner so gratifying might well overcome any reluctance which lord elgin feel to embark at once on a fresh period of expatriation and to resume labor which however cordially they may be appreciate by a minister be apt to meet with little recognition from the public he accept it not in the spirit of mere selfish ambition but with a deep sense of the responsibility attach to it which he portray in earnest and forcible word at a public dinner at dunfermline : -- to watch over the interest of those great offshoot of the british race which plant themselves in distant land to aid they in they effort to extend the domain of civilisation and to fulfil that first behest of a benevolent creator to he intelligent creature -- ` subdue the earth ' to abet the generous endeavor to impart to these rise community the full advantage of british law british institution and british freedom to assist they in maintain unimpaired it may be in strengthen and confirm those bond of mutual affection which unite the parent and

of action but to one of infinitely greater complication for in canada there be two civilised population of nearly equal power view each other with traditionary dislike and distrust : the french _ habitan _ of the lower province strong in they connexion with the past and the british settler whose energy and enterprise give unmistakable promise of predominance in the future canada have within a few mile of she capital a powerful and restless neighbor whose friendly intention be not always sufficient to restrain the unruly spirit on she frontier from act of aggression which might at any time

rebellion be such as england would have gladly grant two or three hundred year before and they be in fact subsequently concede one after another ` not from terror but because on seriously look at the case it be find that after all we have no possible interest in withhold they ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- but at the time it be necessary to put down the rebel by force and to establish military government in 1838 lord durham be send out as high commissioner for the adjustment of the affair of the colony and he celebrated ` report ' sow the seed of all the beneficial change which follow so early as October 1839 when poulett thomson afterwards lord sydenham go out as governor lord john russell take the first step towards the introduction of ` responsible government ' by announce that the principal office of the colony ` would not be consider as be hold by a tenure equivalent to one during good behavior but that the holder would be liable to be call upon to retire whenever from motive of public policy or for other reason this should be find expedient ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- but the insurrection be then too recent to allow of constitutional government be establish at least in lower canada and after the union in 1840 lord sydenham exercise partly owe to he great ability much more power than be usually enjoy by constitutional governor he exercise it however in such a manner as to pave the way for a freer system which be carry out to a great extent by he successor sir charle bagot who though bear the reputation of a old-fashioned tory do not scruple to admit to he counsel person who have be active in oppose the crown during the recent rebellion act on ` the broad principle that the constitutional majority have the right to rule under the constitution ' -lrb- 3 -rrb- towards the end of 1842 sir c bagot find himself oblige by continue ill-health to resign and he be succeed by lord metcalfe -- a man as have be before notice of singularly popular manners and conciliatory disposition but whose

on a question of patronage the minister resign though support by a large majority in the assembly with great difficulty he form a conservative administration and immediately dissolve he parliament the new election give a small majority to the conservative chiefly due it be say to the exertion of he personal influence but the success be purchase at a ruinous cost for he be now in the position fatal to a governor of a party man even from this situation he might perhaps have be able to extricate himself : so great be the respect feel for he rare quality of mind and character but a distressing malady almost incapacitate he for the discharge of public business and at length in November 1845 force he to resign at this time there be some apprehension of difficulty with america arise from the oregon question and in view of the possibility of war mr gladstone who be then at the colonial office appoint lord cathcart the commander of the force to be governor-general -lrb- sidenote : lord cathcart -rrb- when the whig party come into power and lord gray become secretary for the colony the oregon difficulty have be happily settle and it be no longer necessary or desirable that the colony should be govern by a military officer what be want be a person possess a intimate knowledge of the principle and practice of the constitution of england some experience of popular assembly and considerable familiarity with the political question of the day ' -lrb- 4 -rrb- after much consideration it be decide to offer the post to lord elgin though personally unknown at the time both to the premier and to the secretary for the colony -lrb- sidenote : principle of colonial government -rrb- the principle on which lord elgin undertake to conduct the affair of the colony be that he should identify himself with no party but make himself a mediator and moderator between the influential of all party that he should have no minister who do not enjoy the confidence of the assembly or in the last resort of the people and that he should not refuse he consent to any measure propose by he ministry unless it be of a extreme party character such as the assembly or the people would be sure to disapprove -lrb- 4 -rrb- happily these principle be not in lord elgin 's case of yesterday 's growth he have act upon they as far as be possible even in jamaica and in they soundness as apply to a colony like canada he have that firm faith ground on original conviction which alone could have enable he to maintain they as he afterwards do single-handed in face of the most violent opposition and in circumstance by which they be most severely test -lrb- sidenote : cross the atlantic -rrb- it be fortunate that lord elgin have arrange to leave he bride in england to follow at a less inclement

boisterous passage on the 13th we have a hurricane and be oblige to lie to -- a rare occurrence with these vessel it be almost impossible to be on deck but i creep out of a hole for a short time to behold the sea which be truly grand in its wrath the wave roll mountain high and the wind sweep the foam off they crest and drive it together with the snow and sleet almost horizontally over the ocean we lay thus for some hour we mast cover with snow pitching and toss now in the trough of the sea and now on the summit of the billow without anxiety or alarm so gallantly do we craft bear itself

of government and i think that i have do all that could be do to prevent its be pervert to vile purpose of faction various circumstance combine to smooth for the time the water on which lord elgin have embark the state of political party be favourable for the old tory of the british ` family compact ' party be in good humor be in enjoyment of the power to which they claim a prescriptive right while the ` liberal ' of the opposition be full of hope that the removal of lord metcalfe 's disturbing influence would restore they proper preponderance something also be due to he own personal

liberty if not as a martyr in they cause -lrb- sidenote : provincial politics -rrb- but though the surface be smooth there be much beneath to disquiet a observant governor it be not only that the ministry be so weak and so conscious of its weakness as to be incapable even of propose any measure of importance this evil might be remedy by a change of administration but there be no real political life only that pale and distorted reflection of it which be apt to exist in a colony before it have learn ` to look within itself for the center of power ' party form themselves not on broad issue of principle but with reference to petty local and personal interest and when they seek the support of a more widespread sentiment they fall back on those antipathy of race which it be the main object of every wise governor to extinguish the following extract from private letter to lord gray write within a few month of he arrival reflect this state of thing though the circumstance to which they refer be past and go they may not be without interest as afford a insight into a common phase of colonial government hitherto thing have go on well with I much better than i hope for when we part i should have be very willing to meet the assembly at once and throw myself with useful measure on the good sense of the people but my minister be too weak for this they seem to be impress with the belief that the regular opposition will of course resist whatever they propose and that any fragment of they own side who happen not to be able at the moment to get what they want will join they when i advise they therefore to go down to parliament with good measure and the prestige of a new governor and rely on the support of public opinion they smile and shake they head it be clear that they be not very credulous of the existence of such a control power and that they faith in the efficiency of appeal to selfish and sordid motive be greater than mine nevertheless we must take the world as we find it and if new element of strength be require to enable the government to go on it be i think very advisable to give the french a fair opportunity of enter the ministry in the first instance it be also more prudent to enter upon these delicate negotiation cautiously and slowly in order to avoid if possible give the impression that i be ready to jump down everybody 's throat the moment i touch the soil of canada i believe that the problem of how to govern united canada would be solve if the french would split into a liberal and a conservative party and join the upper canada party which bear corresponding name the great difficulty hitherto have be that a conservative government have mean a government of upper canadian which be intolerable to the french and a radical government a government of french which be no less hateful to the british no doubt the party title be misnomer for the radical party comprise the political section most averse to progress of any in the country nevertheless so it have be hitherto the national element would be merge in the political if the split to which i refer be accomplish the totter ministry attempt to strengthen its position by a junction with some of the leader of the ` french ' party but the attempt be unsuccessful : i can not say that i be surprised or dishearten by the result of these negotiation with the french in a community like this where there be little if anything of public principle to divide man political party will shape themselves under the influence of circumstance and of a great variety of affection and antipathy national sectarian and personal and i never propose to attempt to force they into a mould of my own form you will observe that no question of principle or of public policy have be moot by either party during the negotiation the whole discussion have turn upon personal consideration this be i fancy a pretty fair sample of canadian politics it be not even pretend that the division of party represent corresponding division of sentiment on question which occupy the public mind such as voluntaryism free trade & c & c responsible government be the only subject on which this coincidence be allege to exist the opponent of the administration be suppose to dissent from the view hold by lord metcalfe upon it though it be not so clear that its supporter altogether adopt they that this delicate and most debatable subject should furnish the watchword of party be most inconvenient in enumerate the difficulty which surround such question as union of the province emigration & c you omit the greatest of they all viz : the material with which i have to work in carry out any measure for the public advantage there be half a dozen party here stand on no principle and all intent on make political capital out of whatever turn up it be exceedingly difficult under such circumstance to induce public man to run the risk of adopt any scheme that be bold or novel keenly alive to the evil of this state of thing lord elgin be not less sensible that the blame of it do not rest with the exist generation of canadian politician but that it be the result of a variety of circumstance some of which it be impossible to regret several cause -lrb- he write -rrb- co-operate together to give to personal and party interest the overweening importance which attach to they in the estimation of local politician there be no real grievance here to stir the depths of the popular mind we be a comfortable people with plenty to eat and drink no privileged class to excite envy or tax to produce irritation it be ungrateful to view these blessing with regret and yet i believe that they account in some measure for the selfishness of public man and they indifference to the higher aim of statesmanship -lrb- sidenote : responsible government -rrb- the comparatively small number of member of which the popular body who determine the fate of provincial administration consist be also i be incline to think unfavourable to the existence of a high order of principle and feeling among official personage a majority of ten in a assembly of seventy may probably be accord to cocker equivalent to a majority of 100 in a assembly of 700 in practice however it be far otherwise the defection of two or three individual from the majority of ten put the administration in peril thence the perpetual patchwork and trafficking to secure this vote and that which -lrb- not to mention other evil -rrb- so engross the time and thought of minister that they have not leisure for matter of greater moment it must also be remember that it be only of late that the popular assembly in this part of the world have acquire the right of determine who shall govern they -- of insist as we phrase it that the administration of affair shall be conduct by person enjoy they confidence it be not wonderful that a privilege of this kind should be exercise at first with some degree of recklessness and that while no great principle of policy be at stake method of a more questionable character for win and retain the confidence of these arbiter of destiny should be resort to my course in these circumstance be i think clear and plain it may be somewhat difficult to follow occasionally but i feel no doubt as to the direction in which it lie i give to my minister all constitutional support frankly and without reserve and the benefit of the best advice that i can afford they in they difficulty in return for this i expect that they will in so far as it be possible for they to do so carry out my view for the maintenance of the connexion with great britain and the advancement of the interest of the province on this tacit understanding we have act together harmoniously up to this time although i have never conceal from they that i intend to do nothing which may prevent I from work cordially with they opponent if they be force upon I that ministry and opposition should occasionally change place be of the very essence of we constitutional system and it be probably the most conservative element which it contain by subject all section of politician in they turn to official responsibility it oblige heated partisan to place some restraint on passion and to confine within the bound of decency the patriotic zeal with which when out of place they be wont to be animated in order however to secure these advantage it be indispensable that the head of the government should show that he have confidence in the loyalty of all the influential party with which he have to deal and that he should have no personal antipathy to prevent he from act with lead man i feel very strongly that a governor-general by act upon these view with tact and firmness may hope to establish a moral influence in the province which will go far to compensate for the loss of power consequent on the surrender of patronage to a executive responsible to the local parliament until however the function of he office under we amend colonial constitution be more clearly define -- until that middle term which shall reconcile the faithful discharge of he responsibility to the imperial government and the province with the maintenance of the quasi-monarchical relation in which he now stand towards the community over which he preside be discover and agree upon he must be content to tread along a path which be somewhat narrow and slippery and to find that incessant watchfulness and some dexterity be requisite to prevent he from fall on the one side into the _ néant _ of mock sovereignty or on the other into the dirt and confusion of local faction many of he letter exhibit the same conviction that the remedy for the evil which he regret be to be find in the principle of government first assert by lord durham but there be a special interest in the expression of this sentiment when address as in the follow extract to lord durham 's daughter : -- i still adhere to my opinion that the real and effectual vindication of lord durham 's memory and proceedings will be _ the success of a governor-general of canada who work out he view of government fairly _ depend upon it if this country be govern for a few year satisfactorily lord durham 's reputation as a statesman will be raise beyond the reach of cavil i do not indeed know whether i be to be the instrument to carry out this work or be destine like other who have go before I to break down in the attempt but i be still of opinion that the thing may be do though it require some good fortune and some quality not of the lowest order i find on my arrival here a very weak government almost as much abuse by they friend as by they foe no civil or private secretary and a immense quantity of arrears of business it be possible therefore that i may not be able to bear up against the difficulty of my situation and that it may remain for some one else to effect that object which many reason would render I so desirous to achieve -lrb- sidenote

there be a general belief that great britain must make good to the province the expense entail on it by this visitation ` it be enough ' say the inhabitant ` that we house should be make a receptacle of this mass of want and misery : it can not surely be intend that we be to be mulct in heavy pecuniary damages besides ' the reasonableness of these sentiment can hardly be question -- bitter

a great deal of forbearance and good feeling have be show by the colonist under this trial nothing can exceed the devotion of the nun and roman catholic priest and the conduct of the clergy and of many of the laity of other denomination have be most exemplary many life have be sacrifice in attendance on the sick and administer to they temporal and spiritual need but the aspect of affair be become more and more alarming the panic which prevail in montreal and quebec be begin to manifest itself in the upper province and farmer be unwilling to hire even the healthy immigrant because it appear that since the warm weather set in typhus have break out in many case among those who be take into service at the commencement of the season as be perfectly free from disease i think it most

with at least a portion of the expense i readily admit the justice of the latter branch of this argument but i be dispose to question the force of the former the benefit which the province will derive from this year 's immigration be at best problematical and it be certain that they who be to profit by it would willingly have renounce it whatever it may be on condition of be relieve from the evil by which it have be attend of the gross number of immigrant who have reach the province many be already moulder in they grave among the survivor there be widow and orphan and aged and diseased person

will i fear find they way to the western state where land be procurable on more advantageous term than in canada to refer therefore to the 82000 immigrant who have pass into the state through new york and be absorb there without cost to the mother-country and to contrast this circumstance with the heavy expense which have attend the admission of a smaller number into canada be hardly just in the first place of the 82000 who go to new york a much smaller proportion be sickly or destitute and besides by the law of the state ship-owner import immigrant be require to enter into bond which be

presentment of the grand jury of montreal which i have send you officially in which that body advert to the singularly tranquil and contented state of the province -lrb- 8 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : the french question -rrb- with regard to the french he constantly express the conviction that nothing be want to secure the loyalty of the vast majority but a policy of conciliation and confidence in this spirit he urge the importance of remove the restriction on the use of the french language : -- -lrb- sidenote : use of the french language -rrb- i be very anxious to hear that you have take step for the repeal of so much of the act of union as impose restriction on the use of the french language the delay which have take place in give effect to the promise make i think by gladstone on this subject be one of the point of which m papineau be avail himself for purpose of agitation i must moreover confess that i for one be deeply convinced of the impolicy of all such attempt to denationalise the french generally speak they produce the opposite effect from that intended cause the flame of national prejudice and animosity to burn more fiercely but suppose they to be successful what would be the result you may perhaps _ americanize _ but depend upon it by method of this description you will never _ anglicize _ the french inhabitant of the province let they feel on the other hand that they religion they habit they prepossession they prejudice if you will be more consider and respect here than in other portion of this vast continent who will venture to say that the last hand which wave the british flag on american ground may not be that of a french canadian in the same spirit when a association be form for facilitate the acquisition of crown land by french _ habitan _ he put himself at the head of the movement by which mean he be able to thwart the disloyal design of the demagogue who have plan it -lrb- sidenote : french unionisation -rrb- you will perhaps recollect that some week ago i mention that the roman catholic bishop and priest of this diocese have organise a association for colonisation purpose they object be to prevent the sheep of they pasture -lrb- who now strange as it may appear emigrate annually in thousand to the state where they become hewer of wood and drawer of water to the yankee and bad catholic into the bargain -rrb- from quit they fold papineau pounce upon this association as a means of make himself of importance in the eye of he countryman and of gratify he ruling passion by abuse england accordingly at a great meeting convene at montreal be hold forth for three hour to the multitude -lrb- the bishop in the chair -rrb- ascribe this and all other french-canadian ill real or suppose to the selfish policy of great britain and she persevere effort to deprive they of they nationality and every other blessing in process of time after this rather questionable start the association wait on I with a memorial request the co-operation of government m papineau be one of the deputation in deal with they i have two course to choose from i have nothing for it situate as i be but either on the one hand to give the promoter of the scheme a cold shoulder point out its objectionable feature and dwell upon difficulty of execution -- in which case -lrb- use what tact i might -rrb- i should have dismiss the bishop and he friend discontent and give m papineau a opportunity of assert that i have lend a quasi sanction to he calumny or on the other to identify myself with the movement put myself in so far as might be at its head impart to it as salutary a direction as possible and thus wrest from m papineau 's hand a potent instrument of agitation i be tempt i confess to prefer the latter of these course not only by reason of its manifest expediency as bear upon present political contest but also because i sympathise to a considerable extent with the view of the promoter of the movement no one object in my opinion be so important whether you seek to retain canada as a colony or to fit she for independence and make she instinct with national life and vigor as the fill up of she vacant land with a resident agricultural population more especially be it of moment that the inhabitant of french origin should feel that every facility for settle on the land of they father be give they with the cordial assent and concurrence of the british government and its representative and that in the plan of settlement they feeling and habit be consult the sentiment of french canadian nationality which papineau endeavor to pervert to purpose of faction may yet perhaps if properly improve furnish the best remain security against annexation to the state i could not with these view afford to lose the opportunity of promote this object which be present by a spontaneous movement of the people head by the priesthood -- the most powerful influence in lower canada the official correspondence which have pass on this subject i hope to send by the next mail and i need not trouble you with the detail of proceedings on my own part which though small in themselves be not without they effect suffice it to say that papineau have retire to solitude and reflection at he seignory ` la petite nation ' -- and that the pastoral letter of which i enclose a copy have be read _ au prône _ in every roman catholic church in the diocese to those who know what have be the real sentiment of the french population towards england for some year past the tone of this document its undisguised preference for peaceful over quarrelsome course the desire which it manifest to place the representative of british rule forward as the patron of a work dear to french-canadian heart speak volume with the same object of conciliate the french portion of the community he lose no opportunity of manifest the personal interest which he feel in they institution the following letter write in August 1848 to he mother at paris describe a visit to one of these institution the college of st hyacinthe the chief french college of montreal : -- -lrb- sidenote : a french college -rrb- i be present the other day at a examination of the student at one of the roman catholic college of montreal it be altogether under the direction of the priesthood and it be curious to observe the course they steer the young man declaim for some hour on a theme propose by the superior be a contrast between ancient and modern civilisation the greater part of it be a sonorous exposition of ultra-liberal principle ' _ liberté egalité fraternité ' ` vox populi vox dei _ ' a very liberal tribute to the vanity and to the prejudice of the class who might be expect to send they child to the institution or to puff it with a elaborate _ pivot à la lacordaire _ -- that the church have achieve all that have be effect in this genre hitherto _ au reste _ there be the wonderful mechanism which give that church such advantage -- the fourteen professor receive no salary work for they food and that of the homeliest as a consequence a education board and lodging inclusive cost only 15 _ l _ a year the youth subject to a constant discipline under the eye of ecclesiastic day and night i confess when i see both the elasticity and the machinery of this church my wonder be not with lacordaire that it should do so much but that it should not do more -lrb- sidenote : the irish question -rrb- more formidable at all time than any discontent on the part of the quiet and orderly french _ habitan _ be the chronic disaffection of the restless roving irish and especially when connect with a threaten invasion of american ` sympathiser ' when such threat come to nothing it be generally difficult to say whether they be all mere vapouring or whether they might have lead to serious result if not promptly meet but at one time at least there appear to have be solid ground for apprehend that real mischief be intend on the 18th July 1848 lord elgin write : -- -lrb- sidenote : irish republican -rrb- at the moment when the last mail be start a placard call a irish repeal or rather republican meeting be place in my hand i

withdraw he permission state that he have not be before apprise of the precise nature of the assembly after receive this check the leader of the movement fix on a open space near the center of the town for they gathering it take place last night and prove a complete failure not a single individual of importance among the irish repeal party be present some hundred of person attend but be speedily disperse by a timely thunder shower o'connor be violent enough but i have not yet ascertain that he say anything which would form good material for a indictment i be of opinion however that proceedings of this description on the part of a citizen of another country be not to be tolerate and although there be a indisposition in certain quarter to drive thing to a extremity i think i shall succeed in have he arrest unless he take himself off speedily -lrb- sidenote : the british question -rrb- but the french question and the irish question be simple and unimportant as compare with those which be raise by the state of feeling recently create in a large and influential portion of the british population partly by political event partly by commercial cause -lrb- sidenote : the family

be fill with wrath at see rebel -- for as such they consider the french leader -- now take into the confidence of the governor as minister of the crown at the same time many of the individual who compose that party be smart under a sense of injury and injustice inflict upon they by the home government and by that party in the home government by whose policy they own ascendency in the colony have as they consider be undermine nor be it possible to deny that there be some ground for they complaint by the canada corn act of 1843 not only the wheat of canada but also its flour which might be make from american wheat have be admit into england at a nominal duty the premium thus offer for the grind of american wheat for the british market cause a great amount of capital to be invest in mill and other appliance of the flour trade ` but almost before these arrangement be fully complete and the newly build mill fairly at work the -lrb- free-trade -rrb- act of 1846 sweep away the advantage confer upon canada in respect to the corn-trade with this country and thus bring upon the province a frightful amount of loss to individual and a great derangement of the colonial finances ' -lrb- 10 -rrb- lord elgin feel deeply for the sufferer and often press they case on the attention of the secretary of state -lrb- sidenote : discontent due to imperial legislation -rrb- i do not think that you be blind to the hardship which canada be now endure but i must own i doubt much whether you fully appreciate they magnitude or be aware of how directly they be chargeable on imperial legislation stanley 's bill of 1843 attract all the produce of the west to the st lawrence and fix all the disposable capital of the province in grind mill warehouse and forwarding establishment peel 's bill of 1846 drive the whole of the produce down the new york channel of communication destroy the revenue which canada expect to derive from canal due and ruin at once mill-owners forwarder and merchant the consequence be that private property be unsaleable in canada and not a shilling can be raise on the credit of the province we be actually reduce to the disagreeable necessity of pay all public officer from the governor-general downward in debenture which be not exchangeable at par what make it more serious be that all the prosperity of which canada be thus rob be transplant to the other side of the line as if to make canadian feel more bitterly how much kinder england be to the child who desert she than to those who remain faithful for i care not whether you be a protectionist or a free-trader it be the inconsistency of imperial legislation and not the adoption of one policy rather than another which be the bane of the colony i believe that the conviction that they would be better off if they be ` annex ' be almost universal among the commercial class at present and the peaceful condition of the province under all the circumstance of the time be i must confess often a matter of great astonishment to myself -lrb- sidenote : how to be remedy -rrb- he sympathy however with the suffering cause by the introduction of free-trade be not accompany by any wish to return to a protective policy on the contrary he feel that the remedy be to be seek in a further development of the free-trade principle in the repeal of the navigation law which cramp the commerce canada by restrict it to british vessel and in a reciprocal reduction of the duty which hamper she trade with the united state in this sense he write to lord gray : -- i be glad to see you bold measure on the navigation law you have no other course now open to you if you intend to keep you colony you can not halt between two opinion : free-trade in all thing or general protection there be something captivating in the project of form all the part of this vast british empire into one huge _ zollverein _ with free interchange of commodity and uniform duty against the world without though perhaps without some federal legislation it might have be impossible to carry it out undoubtedly under such a system the component part of the empire would have be unite by bond which can not be supply under that on which we be now enter though it may be fairly urge on the other side that the variety of conflict interest which would under this arrangement have be bring into presence would have lead to collision which we may now hope to escape but as it be the die be cast as regard these colony you must allow they to turn to the best possible account they contiguity to the state that they may not have cause for dissatisfaction when they contrast they own condition with that of they neighbor another subject on which i be very solicitous be the free admission of canadian product into the state at present the canadian farmer get less for he wheat than he neighbor over the line this be a unfortunate state of thing i have a long conversation with mr baldwin about it lately and he strongly support the proposition which i venture to submit for you consideration about a year ago viz that a special treaty should be enter into with the state give they the navigation of the st lawrence jointly with ourselves on condition that they admit canadian produce duty free a arrangement of this description affect internal water only might i apprehend be make -lrb- as in the case of columbium in the oregon treaty -rrb- independently of the adjustment of question touch the navigation law generally i confess that i dread the effect of the continuance of the present state of thing on the loyalty of we farmer surely the admission of the american into the st lawrence would be a great boon to they and we ought to exact a _ quid pro quo _ he be sanguine enough to hope that these measure so simple and so obviously desirable might be bring into operation at once but they be not carry until many year later one of they as we shall see only by aid of he own personal exertion and he disappointment on this score deepen the anxiety with which he look round upon the difficulty of he position already describe on August 16 he write : -- the news from ireland -- the determination of government not to proceed with the measure respect the navigation law -- doubt as to whether the american congress will pass the reciprocity of trade bill -- menace of sympathiser in the state -- all combine at present to render we position one of considerable anxiety firstly we have the irish repeal body i need not describe they you may look at home they be here just what they be in ireland secondly we have the french population they attitude as regard england and america be that of a armed neutrality they do not exactly like the american but they be the _ conquer oppressed subject _ of england to be sure they govern themselves pay no tax and some other trifle of this description nevertheless they be the victim of british _ égoisme _ be not the union of the province carry without they consent and with a view of subject they to the british papineau they press and other authority be constantly din this into they ear so no wonder they believe it again we mercantile and commercial class be thoroughly disgust and lukewarm in they allegiance you know enough of colony to appreciate the tendency which they always exhibit to charge they misfortune upon the mother-country no matter from what source they flow and indeed it be easy to show that as matter now stand the faithful subject of she majesty in canada be place on a worse footing as regard trade with the mother-country than the rebel ` over the ` line ' the same man who when you canvass he at a english borough election say ` why sir i vote red all my life and i never get anything by it : this time i intend to vote blue ' -- address you in canada with ' i have be all along one of the steadiest supporter of the british government but really if claim such as mine be not more think of i shall begin to consider whether other institution be not preferable to ours ' what to do under these circumstance of anxiety and discouragement be the question as to any aggression from without i shall throw the responsibility of repel they upon she majesty 's troops in the first instance and i shall be disappointed indeed if the military here do not give a very good account of all american and irish marauder with respect to internal commotion i should like to devolve the duty of quell they as much as possible upon the citizen i very much doubt whether any class of they however great they indifference or disloyalty fancy the taste of celtic pike or the rule of irish mob law happily the danger which there seem so much reason to apprehend be dispel by the policy at once firm and conciliatory of the governor : mainly as he himself be never weary of assert owe to the healthy and loyal feeling engender in the province by he frank adoption and consistent maintenance of lord durham 's principle of responsible government it be one of the occasion not unfrequent in lord elgin 's life that recall the word in which lord melbourne pronounce the crowning eulogy of another celebrated diplomatist : -- ` my lord you can never fully appreciate the merit of that great man you can appreciate the great act which he publicly perform but you can not appreciate for you can not know the great mischief which he unostentatiously prevent ' -lrb- sidenote : navigation law -rrb- in the course of the discussion on the repeal of the navigation law to which reference be make in the foregoing letter a incident occur which attract some attention at the time and which as it could not be explain then ought perhaps to be notice in this place lord george bentinck who lead the opposition to the measure see reason to think that in the publish despatch from canada on the subject a letter have be suppress which would have furnish argument against the government and under this impression he move in the house of common for ` copy of the omit correspondence ' the motion be negative without a division on lord john russell 's point out that it involve a imputation on the governor 's good faith but the premier himself be probably not aware at the time how completely the mover be at fault as be show in the follow letter from lord elgin to mr c bruce who be a member of parliament and a strong protectionist have a double interest in the matter : -- you ask I about this mare 's nest of bentinck the fact be these : the montreal board of trade draw up a memorial for the house of common _ against the navigation law _ contain _ inter alium _ a very distinct threat of separation in the event of they _ non-repeal _ my secretary -lrb- not my private secretary mark but my responsible government secretary -rrb- send _ I a draft _ of a letter to the board contain very loyal and proper sentiment on this head i approve of the letter and send a copy of it home with the memorial _ instead of a report by myself _ partly because it save I trouble and partly because i be glad to show how perfectly my liberal government have express themselves on the point two or three week later the board of trade not like mr sullivan to have the last word write a answer simply justify what they have already state in they memorial which have already go with my comment upon it to be lay before the house of common to send such a letter home in a separate despatch would have seem to I worse than absurd because it would really have be give to this unseemly menace a degree of importance which it do not deserve if i _ have _ send it i must have accompany it with a statement to the effect that my sentiment on the point communicate in my former letter remain unchanged so the matter would have rest pretty much where it do before bentinck seem to suppose that in keep back a letter which state that canada would separate if the navigation law be not repeal i intend by some very ingenious dodge to hasten they repeal -lrb- 11 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : speech on education -rrb- at the beginning of the winter season of 1848-9 lord elgin be present as patron at a meeting of the montreal mercantile library association to open the winter 's course of lecture it be a association mainly found by lead merchant ` with a view of afford to the junior member of the mercantile body opportunity of self-improvement and inducement sufficiently powerful to enable they to resist those temptation to idleness and dissipation which unhappily abound in all large community ' he take the opportunity of deliver he view on the subject of education in a speech part of which may still be read with interest after all that have be speak and write on this fertile topic it have at least the merit of be eminently characteristic of the speaker whose whole life be a illustration in the eye of those who know he best of the truth which he seek to inculcate on the young merchant of montreal -lrb- 12 -rrb- after remark that it be vain for he to attempt in a cursory address to fan the fervor of he hearer ' zeal or throw light on subject which they be in the habit of hear so effectively treat indeed -lrb- he continue -rrb- i should almost be tempt to affirm that in a age when education be so generally diffuse -- when the art of printing have bring the source of information so near to the lip of all who thirst for understanding -- when so many of the secret of nature have be reveal -- when the impalpable and all-pervading electricity and the infinite elasticity of steam have be make subservient to purpose of human utility -- the advantage of knowledge in a utilitarian point of view the utter hopelessness of a successful attempt on the part either of individual or class to maintain they position in society if they neglect the means of self-improvement be truth too obvious to call for elucidation i must say that it seem to I that there be less risk therefore of we decline to avail ourselves of we opportunity than there be of we misusing or abuse they that there be less likelihood of we refuse to grasp the treasure spread out before we than of we lay upon they rash and irreverent hand and neglect to cultivate those habit of patient investigation humility and moral self-control without which we have no sufficient security that even the possession of knowledge itself will be a blessing to we i be much strike by a passage i meet with the other day in read the life of one of the greatest man of he age and country -- watt -- which seem to I to illustrate very forcibly the nature of the danger to which i be now refer as well as its remedy it be state in the passage to which i allude that watt take great delight in reading over the specification of invention for which patent rights be obtain he observe that of those invention a large proportion turn out to be entirely worthless and a source of ruin and disappointment to they author and it be further state that he discover that among these abortive invention many be but the embodiment of idea which have suggest themselves to he own mind -- which probably when they first present themselves he have welcome as great discovery likely to contribute to he own fame and to the advantage of mankind but which after have subject they to that rigid and unsparing criticism which he feel it he bounden duty to apply to the offspring of he own brain he have find to be worthless and reject now unquestionably the powerful intellect of watt go for much in this matter : unquestionably he keen and practice glance enable he to detect flaw and error in many case where a eye equally honest but less acute would have fail to discover they but can we doubt that a moral element be largely involve in the composition of that quality of mind which enable watt to shun the sunken rock on which so many around he be make shipwreck -- that it be he unselfish devotion to truth he humility and the practice of self-control which enable he to rebuke the suggestion of vanity and self-interest and with the sternness of a impartial judge to condemn to silence and oblivion even the offspring of he own mind for which he doubtless feel a parent 's fondness when it fall short of that standard of perfection which he have rear from this incident in the life of that great man we may draw i think a most useful lesson which we may apply with good effect to field of inquiry far transcend those to which the anecdote have immediate reference take for instance the wide region occupy with moral and political or as they be style social question : observe the wretched half - truth the perilous fallacy which quack greedy of applause or gain and speculate on the credulity of mankind more especially in time of perturbation or distress have the audacity to palm upon the world as sublime discovery calculate to increase in some vast and untold amount the sum of human happiness and mark the misery and desolation which follow when the hope excite by these pretender be dispel it be often say in apology for such person that they be after all sincere that they be deceive rather than deceiver that they do not ask other to adopt opinion which they have not heartily accept themselves but apply to this reasoning the principle that i have be endeavor to illustrate from the life of watt and we shall find i think that the excuse be in most case but a sorry one if indeed it be any excuse at all god have plant within the mind of man the light of reason and of conscience and without it he have place those of revelation and experience and if man wilfully extinguish those light in order that under cover of the darkness which he have himself make he may install in the sanctuary of he understanding and heart where the image of truth alone should dwell a vain idol a creature of he own fond imagining it will i fear but little avail he more especially in that day when the secret of all heart shall be reveal if he shall plead in extenuation of he guilt that he do not invite other to worship the idol until he have fall prostrate himself before it these gentleman be truth which i think it will be well for we to lay to heart i address myself more particularly to you who be enter upon the useful and honorable career of the british merchant for you be now stand on the lower step of a ladder which when it be mount with diligence and circumspection lead always to respectability not unfrequently to high honor and distinction bear in mind then that the quality which ought chiefly to distinguish those who aspire to exercise a control and direct influence in any department of human action from those who have only a subordinate part to play be the knowledge of principle and general law a few example will make the truth of this proposition apparent to you take for instance the case of the builder the mason and carpenter must know how to hew the stone and square the timber and follow out faithfully the work plan place in they hand but the architect must know much more than this he must be acquaint with the principle of proportion and form he must know the law which regulate the distribution of heat light and air in order that he may give to each part of a complicated structure its due share of these advantage and combine the multifarious detail into a consistent whole take again the case of the seaman it be enough for the steersman that he watch certain symptom in the sky and on the wave that he note the shift of the wind and compass and attend to certain precise rule which have be give he for he guidance but the master of the ship if he be fit for he situation -- and i be sorry to say that many undertake the duty of that responsible office who be not fit for it -- must be thoroughly acquaint not only with the map of the earth and heaven but he must know also all that science have reveal of some of the most subtle of the operation of nature he must understand as far as man can yet discover they what be the law which regulate the movement of the current the direction of the tempest and the meanderings of the magnetic fluid or to take a case with which you be more familiar -- that of the merchant the merchant 's clerk must understand book-keeping and double-entry and know how to arrange every item of the account under its proper head and how to balance the whole correctly but the head of the establishment must be acquaint in addition to this with the law which regulate the exchange with the principle that affect the production and distribution of national wealth and therefore with those social and political cause which be ever and anon at work to disturb calculation which would have be accurate enough for quiet time but which be insufficient for other i think therefore that i have establish the truth of the proposition that man who aspire to exercise a directing and control influence in any pursuit or business should be distinguish by a knowledge of principle and general law but it be in the acquisition of this knowledge and more especially in its application to the occurrence of daily life that the chief necessity arise for the exercise of those high moral quality with the importance of

inevitable by certain proceedings adopt by they ' in lord metcalfe 's time as the justification of the measure be thus rest on its previous history a brief retrospect be necessary before proceed with the account of transaction which form a epoch in the history of the colony as well as in the life of the governor -lrb- sidenote : history of the measure -rrb- within a very short time after the close of the rebellion of 1837 and 1838 the attention of both section of the colony be direct to compensate those who have suffer by it first come the case of the primary sufferer if so they may be call that be the loyalist whose property have be destroy by rebel measure be at once take to indemnify all such person -- in upper canada by a act pass in the last session of its separate parliament in lower canada by a ordinance of the ` special council ' under which it be at that time administer but it be feel that this be not enough that where property have be wantonly and unnecessarily destroy even though it be by person act in support of authority some compensation ought to be give and the upper canada act above mention be amend next year in the first session of the unite parliament so as to extend to all loss occasion by violence on the part of person act or assume to act on she majesty 's behalf nothing be do at this time about lower canada but it be obviously inevitable that the treatment apply to the one province should be extend to the other accordingly in 1845 during lord metcalfe 's government and under a conservative administration a address be adopt unanimously by the assembly pray he excellency to cause proper measure to be take ` in order to insure to the inhabitant of that portion of the province formerly lower canada indemnity for just loss by they sustain during the rebellion of 1837 and 1838 ' in pursuance of this address a commission be appoint to inquire into the claim of person whose property have be destroy in the rebellion the commissioner receive instruction to distinguish the case of those person who have join aid or abet in the say rebellion from the case of those who have not on inquire how they be to distinguish they be officially answer that in make out the classification ` it be not he excellency 's intention that they should be guide by any other description of evidence than that furnish by the sentence of the court of law ' it be also intimate to they that they be only intend to form a ` general estimate ' of the rebellion loss ` the particulars of which must form the subject of more minute inquiry hereafter under legislative authority ' in obedience to these instruction the commissioner make they investigation and report that they have recognize as worthy of further inquiry claim represent a sum total of 241965_l _ 10_s _ 5_d _ but they add a expression of opinion that the loss suffer would be find on closer examination not to exceed the value of 100000_l _ this report be render in April 1846 but though lord metcalfe 's ministry which have issue the commission avowedly as preliminary to a subsequent and more minute inquiry remain in office for nearly two year longer they take no step towards carry out they declare intention so the matter stand in march 1848 when as have be already state a new administration be form consist mainly of person whose political sympathy be with lower canada it be natural that they should take up the work leave half do by they predecessor and early in 1849 they introduce a bill which be destine to become notorious under the name of the ` rebellion loss bill ' the preamble of it declare that in order to redeem the pledge already give to party in lower canada it be necessary and just that the particulars of such loss as be not yet satisfied should form the subject of more minute inquiry under legislative authority and that the same so far only as they might have arise from the ` total or partial unjust or wanton destruction ' of property should be pay and satisfy a proviso be add that no person who have be convict or plead guilty of treason during the rebellion should be entitle to any indemnity for loss sustain in connection with it the bill itself authorise the appointment of commissioner for the purpose of the act and the appropriation of 90000_l _ to the payment of claim that might arise under it follow in this respect the opinion express by lord metcalfe 's preliminary commission of enquiry -lrb- sidenote : excitement respect it -rrb- such be the measure -- so clearly inevitable in its direction so modest in its proportion -- which fall on a inflamed state of the public mind in canada and misunderstand in england be the occasion of riot and nearly of rebellion in the province and expose the governor-general who sanction it to severe censure on the part of many whose opinion he most value at home he own feeling on its introduction he opinion of its merit and he reason for the course which he pursue in deal with it can not be better state than in he own word write to lord gray on march 1 he say : -- a good deal of excitement and bad feeling have be stir in the province by the introduction of a measure by the ministry for the payment of certain rebellion loss in lower canada i trust that it will soon subside and that no enduring mischief will ensue from it but the opposition leader have take advantage of the circumstance to work upon the feeling of old loyalist as oppose to rebel of british as oppose to french and of upper canadian as oppose to lower and thus to provoke from various part of the province the expression of not very temperate or measure discontent i be occasionally rate in not very courteous language and peremptorily require to dissolve the parliament which be elect only one year ago under the auspices of this same clamorous opposition who be then in power the measure itself be not indeed altogether free from objection and i very much regret that a addition should be make to we debt for such a object at this time nevertheless i must say i do not see how my present government could have take any other course in this matter than that which they have follow they predecessor have already go more than half-way in the same direction though they have stop short and now tell we that they never intend to go farther if the ministry have fail to complete the work of alleged justice to lower canada which have be commence by the former administration m papineau would most assuredly have avail himself of the plea to undermine they influence in this section of the province the debate in parliament on this question have be acrimonious and lengthy but m lafontaine 's resolution be finally pass by a majority of fifty to twenty-two dissension of this class place in strong relief the passion and tendency which render the endurance of the political system which we have establish here and of the connection with the mother-country uncertain and precarious they elicit a manifestation of antipathy between race and of jealousy between the recently unite province which be much to be regret this measure of indemnity to lower canada be however the last of the kind and if it be once settle satisfactorily a formidable stumblingblock will have be remove from my path a fortnight later he add : -- the tory party be do what they can by menace intimidation and appeal to passion to drive I to a _ coup d'état _ and yet the very measure which be at this moment the occasion of so loud a outcry be nothing more than a strict logical follow out of they own act it be difficult to conceive what the address on the subject of rebellion loss in lower canada unanimously vote by the house of assembly while lord metcalfe be governor and mr draper minister and the proceedings of the administration upon that address could have be mean to lead to if not to such a measure as the present government have introduce i enclose a letter which have be publish in the newspaper by a m masson one of the bermuda exile -lrb- 1 -rrb- who be appoint to a office by the late government this person will be exclude from compensation by the bill of the present government and he positively assert that lord metcalfe and some of he minister assure he that he would be include by they i certainly regret that this agitation should have be stir and that any portion of the fund of the province should be divert now from much more useful purpose to make good loss sustain by individual in the rebellion but i have no doubt whatsoever that a great deal of property be wantonly and cruelly destroy at that time in lower canada nor do i think that this government after what they predecessor have do and with papineau in the rear could have help take up this question neither do i think that they measure would have be less objectionable but very much the reverse if after the lapse of eleven year and the proclamation of a general amnesty it have be so frame as to attach the stigma of rebellion to other than those regularly convict before the court any kind of extra-judicial inquisition conduct at this time of day by commissioner appoint by the government with the view of ascertain what part this or that claimant for indemnity may have take in 1837 and 1838 would have be attend by consequence much to be regret and have open the door to a infinite amount of job false swearing and detraction -lrb- sidenote : petition against it -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : neutrality of the governor -rrb- petition against the measure be get up by the tory in all part of the province but these instead of be send to the assembly or to the legislative council or to the home government be almost all address to lord elgin personally obviously with the design of produce a collision between he and he parliament they generally pray either that parliament might be dissolve or that the bill if it pass might be reserve for the royal sanction all such address and the remonstrance bring to he by deputation of malcontent he receive with civility promise to bestow on they he best consideration but studiously avoid the expression of any opinion on the point in controversy by thus maintain a strictly constitutional position he foiled that section of the agitator who calculate on he be frightened or make angry while he leave a door open for any who might have candor enough to admit that after all he be only carry out fairly the principle of responsible government in pursuance of this policy he put off to the latest moment any decision as to the course which he should take with respect to the bill when it come up to he for he sanction as regard a dissolution indeed he feel from the beginning that it would be sheer folly attend by no small risk be he to have recourse to this ultima ratio merely because a parliament elect a year before under the auspices of the party now in opposition have pass by a majority of nearly two to one a measure introduce by the present government in pursuance of the act of a former one if i have dissolve parliament i might have produce a rebellion but most assuredly i should not have procure a change of ministry the leader of the party know that as well as i do and be it possible to play trick in such grave concern it would have be easy to throw they into utter confusion by merely call upon they to form a government they be aware however that i could not for the sake of discomfit they hazard so desperate a policy : so they have play out they game of faction and violence without fear of consequence the other course urge upon he by the opposition namely that of reserve the bill for the consideration of the home government may appear to have be open to no such objection and to have be in fact the wisest course which he could pursue in circumstance of so much delicacy and this seem to have be the opinion of many in england who be dispose to approve of he general policy but it may be doubt whether they have weigh all the consideration which present themselves to the mind of the governor on the spot and which he state to lord gray as follow : -- there be objection too to reserve the bill which i think i shall consider insurmountable whatever obloquy i may for the time entail on myself by decline to lend myself even to this extent to the plan of those who wish to bring about a change of administration in the first place the bill for the relief of a corresponding class of person in upper canada which be couch in term very nearly similar be not reserve and it be difficult to discover a sufficient reason in so far as the representative of the crown be concern for deal with the one measure differently from the other and in the second place by reserve the bill i should only throw upon she majesty 's government or -lrb- as it would appear to the popular eye here -rrb- on she majesty herself a responsibility which rest and ought i think to rest on my own shoulder if i pass the bill whatever mischief ensue may probably be repair if the worst come to the worst by the sacrifice of I whereas if the case be refer to england it be not impossible that she majesty may only have before she the alternative of provoke a rebellion in lower canada by refuse she assent to a measure chiefly affect the interest of the _ habitan _ and thus throw the whole population into papineau 's hand or of wound the susceptibility of some of the best subject she have in the province for among the objector to this bill be undoubtedly to be find not a few who belong to this class man who be work upon by other more selfish and design to whom the principle of constitutional government be unfathomable mystery and who still regard the representative of royalty and in a more remote sense the crown and government of england if not as the object of a very romantic loyalty -lrb- for that i fear be fast wane -rrb- at least as the butt of a most intense and unrelenting : indignation if political affair be not administer in entire accordance with they sense of what be right in solve these knotty problem and choose he course of action the necessity of the situation require that he should be guide by he own unaided judgment and act entirely on he own responsibility for although throughout all he difficulty in the midst of the reproach with which he be assail both in the colony and in england he have the great satisfaction of know that he conduct be entirely approve by lord gray to whom he open all he mind in private letter the official communication which pass between they be necessarily very reserve the follow extract illustrate well this peculiarity in the position of a british colonial governor who have two popular assembly and two public press to consider : -- perhaps you may have be annoy by my not write officially to you ere this so as to give you communication to send to parliament all that i can say on that point be that i have get through this disagreeable affair as well as i have do only by maintain my constitutional position listen civilly to all representation address to I against the measure and adhering to a strict reserve as to the course which i might deem it proper eventually to pursue by follow this course i have avoid any act or expression which might have add fuel to the flame and although i have be plentifully abused because it have be the policy of the opposition to drag I into the strife no one can say that i have say or do anything to justify the abuse and the natural effect of such patient endurance be now begin to show itself in the moderate tone of the organ of the opposition press you will perceive however that i could not possibly have maintain this position here if despatch from I indicate the ministerial policy have be submit to the house of common they would have find they way out here at once every statement and opinion would have form the subject of discussion and i should have find myself in the midst of the _ mêlée _ a partisan to counteract the violent and reckless effort of the opposition lord elgin trust partly to the obvious reasonableness of the proposal under discussion but more to the growth of a patriotic spirit which should lead the minority to prefer the rule of a majority within the province to the coercion of a power from without something also he hope from the effect of the many excellent measure bring in about the same time by he new ministry ` the first really efficient and working government that canada have have since the union ' nor be these hope altogether disappointed write on April 12 he observe that a marked change have take place within the last few week in the tone both of the press -lrb- 2 -rrb- and of the leader of the party some of whom have give he to understand through different channel that they regret thing have go so far ` but ' he add ` whether the gale from england will stir the tempest again or not remain to be see ' -lrb- sidenote : opinion in england -rrb- and in effect the next post from england come laden with speech and newspaper article denounce in no measure term the ` suicidal folly of rewarding rebel for rebellion ' a london journal of influence speaking of the british population as affect by the measure in question say : -- ` they be tolerably able to take care of themselves and we very much misconstrue the tone adopt by the english press and the english public in the province if they do not find some means of resist the heavy blow and great discouragement which be aim at they ' such passage be read with avidity in the colony and construe to mean that sympathy would be extend from influential quarter at home to those who seek to annul the obnoxious decision of the local legislature whatever might be the means to which they resort for the attainment of that end it may be doubt however whether any extraneous disturbance of this kind have much to do with the volcanic outburst of local passion which ensue and which be now to be related -lrb- sidenote : the bill be pass -rrb- the bill be pass in the assembly by forty-seven vote to eighteen on analyze the vote it be find that out of thirty-one member from upper canada who vote on the occasion seventeen support and fourteen oppose it and that of ten member for lower canada of british descent six support and four oppose it these fact -lrb- write lord elgin -rrb- seem altogether irreconcilable with the allegation that the question be one on which the two race be array against each other throughout the province generally i consider therefore that by reserve the bill i should only cast on she majesty and she majesty 's adviser a responsibility which ought in the first instance at least to rest on my own shoulder and that i should awaken in the mind of the people at large even of those who be indifferent or hostile to the bill doubt as to the sincerity with which it be intend that constitutional government should be carry on in canada doubt which it be my firm conviction if they be to obtain generally would be fatal to the connection -lrb- sidenote : and receive the royal assent -rrb- accordingly when on April 25 1849 circumstance make it necessary for he to proceed to parliament in order to give the royal assent to a custom bill which have that day pass the legislative council he consider that as this necessity have arise it would not be expedient to keep the public mind in suspense by omit to dispose at the same time of the other act which still await he decision among which be the ` act to provide for the indemnification of party in lower canada whose property be destroy during the rebellion in 1837 and 1838 ' what follow be thus describe in a official despatch write within a few day after the event : -- -lrb- sidenote : riot -rrb- when i leave the house of parliament i be receive with mingled cheer and hooting by a crowd by no means numerous which surround the entrance to the build a small knot of individual consist it have since be ascertain of person of a respectable class in society pelt the carriage with missile which they must have bring with they for the purpose within a hour after this occurrence a notice of which i enclose a copy issue from one of the newspaper office call a meeting in the open air at the meeting inflammatory speech be make on a sudden whether under the effect of momentary excitement or in pursuance of a plan arrange beforehand the mob proceed to the house of parliament where the member be still sit and break the window set fire to the building and burn it to the ground by this wanton act public property of considerable value include two excellent library have be utterly destroy have achieve they object the crowd disperse apparently satisfy with what they have do the member be permit to retire unmolested and no resistance be offer to the military who appear on the ground after a brief interval to restore order and aid in extinguish the flame during the two follow day a good deal of excitement prevail in the street and some further act of incendiarism be perpetrate since then the military force have be increase and the leader of the disaffected party have show a disposition to restrain they follower and to direct they energy towards the more constitutional object of petition the queen for my recall and the disallowance of the obnoxious bill the proceedings of the house of assembly will also tend to awe the turbulent i trust therefore that the peace of the city will not be again disturb the ministry be blame for not have make adequate provision against these disaster that they by no means expect that the hostility to the rebellion loss bill would have display itself in the outrage which have be perpetrate during the last few day be certain -lrb- 3 -rrb- perhaps sufficient attention be not pay by they to the menace of the opposition press it must be admit however that they position be one of considerable difficulty the civil force of montreal -- a city contain about 50000 inhabitant of different race with secret society and other agency of mischief in constant activity -- consist of two policeman under the authority of the government and seventy appoint by the corporation to oppose therefore effectual resistance to any considerable mob recourse must be have in all case either to the military or to a force of civilian enrol for the occasion grave objection however present themselves in the present instance to the adoption of either of these course until the disposition to tumult on the part of the populace unhappily manifest itself in overt act more especially be it of importance to avoid any measure which might have have a tendency to produce a collision between party on a question on which they feeling be so strongly excite the result of the course pursue be that there have be no bloodshed and except in the case of some of the minister themselves no destruction of private property the passion however which appear to have calm down burst out with fresh fury the very day on which these sentence be pen the house of assembly have vote by a majority of thirty-six to sixteen a address to the governor-general expressive of abhorrence at the outrage which have take place of loyalty to the queen and approval of he just and impartial administration of the government with he late as well as with he present

imply the adoption of the system -lrb- which although it have a good deal to recommend it be certainly open to great objection -rrb- of alternate parliament but this be not the only difficulty the french member of the administration be willing to go to toronto for four year at the close of the present parliament but they give many reason which appear to have in a great measure satisfy they upper canada colleague for insist on quebec as the first point to be make now i have great objection to go to quebec at present i fear it would be consider both here and in england as a admission that the government be under french - canadian influence and that it can not maintain itself in upper canada i therefore conclude in favor of a few day more be give in order to see whether or not the movement now in progress in montreal may be so direct as to render it possible to retain the seat of government there this hope be disappointed and he be oblige to admit the necessity of removal on September 3 he write again : -- we have have since i last write a week of unusual tranquillity but i regret to say that i discover as yet nothing to warrant the belief that the seat of government can properly remain at montreal the existence of a perfect understanding between the more outrageous and the more respectable fraction of the tory party in the town be render even more manifest by the readiness with which the former through they organ have yield to the latter when they preach moderation in good earnest additional proof be thus furnish of the extent to which the blame of the disgraceful transaction of the past four month fall on all all attempt and several have be make to induce the conservative to unite in a address invite I to return to the town have fail which be the more significant because it be well know that the removal of the seat of government be under consideration and that i have deprecate the abandonment of montreal the existence of a party animated by such sentiment powerful in number and organization and in the station of some who more or less openly join it -- own a qualify allegiance to the constitution of the province -- profess to regard the parliament and the government as nuisance to be tolerate within certain limit only -- raise itself whenever the fancy seize it or the crisis in its judgment demand it into a ' _ imperium in imperio _ ' -- render it i fear extremely doubtful whether the function of legislation or of government can be carry on to advantage in this city ` show vigor and put it down ' say some you _ may _ and _ must _ put down those who resist the law when overt act be commit but the party be unfortunately a national as well as a political one after each defeat it resume its attitude of defiance and whenever it come into collision with the authority there be the risk of a frightful race feud be provoke all these danger be vastly increase by montreal 's be the seat of government there be other argument also of no little force he be assure that some member have declare that nothing would induce they to come again to montreal and he himself feel that it must do great mischief to the member from other part of the province to pass some month of each year in that ` hot-bed of prejudice and disaffection ' moreover so long as montreal retain the prestige of be the metropolis it be impossible to prevent its press from enjoy a factitious importance not only within the province but also in england and in the state where it would be look upon as the exponent of the sentiment of the community at large ultimately on November 18 lord elgin report to the home government that after full and anxious deliberation he have resolve on the advice of he council to act on the recommendation of the assembly that the legislature should sit alternately at toronto and quebec and with that view to summon the provincial parliament for the next session at toronto this step ` decide upon in this deliberate and unimpassioned manner ' give a useful lesson which be not lose either upon montreal or the rest of the province nor be this its only good effect ` the arrangement ' write lord gray in 1852 ` by which the seat of government and the sitting of the legislature be fix alternately at toronto and quebec have contribute not a little towards remove the feeling of alienation from each other of the inhabitant of french and of british descent the french canadian have thus be bring into closer communication than formerly with the inhabitant of the western division of the province and a increase of

he popularity detraction probably repeat in all sincerity by many who be honestly incapable of understand he real motive for forbearance and as the member of this party though they have lose they monopoly of political power still remain the dominant class in society the disparage tone which they set be take up not only in the colony itself but also by traveller who visit it and by they carry back to infect opinion in england the result be that person at home who have the highest appreciation of lord elgin 's capacity as a statesman sincerely believe he to be deficient in nerve and vigor and as the misapprehension be one which he could not have correct even if he have be aware how widely it be spread it continue to exist in many quarter until dispel by the singular energy and boldness amounting almost to rashness which he display in china -lrb- sidenote : forbearance of lord elgin -rrb- the more we remember the vehemence with which these injurious report be circulate the more remarkable appear the resolution not to yield to the provocation they involve and the determination to accept the whole responsibility of the situation at whatever personal cost the follow letter be

1849 may close the personal record of this troubled year -lrb- sidenote : its motive -rrb- i do not at all wonder that you should be dispose to question the wisdom of my course in respect to montreal i think it be the best i could have take under the circumstance but i do not presume to say that it may not be criticise -- justly criticise my choice be not between a clearly right and a clearly wrong course : how easy be it to deal with such case and how rare be they in life but between several difficulty i think i choose the least i think too that i be begin to reap the reward of my policy i do not believe that such enthusiasm be ever manifest towards anyone in my situation in canada as have be exhibit during my recent tour but more than this i do not believe that the function of the governor-general under constitutional government as the moderator between party the representative of interest which be common to all the inhabitant of the country as distinct from those which divide they into party be ever so fully and so frankly recognize now i do not believe that i could have achieve this if i have have blood upon my hand i might have be quite as popular perhaps more so for there be many especially in lower canada who would gladly have see the severity of the law practice upon those from whom they believe that they have often suffer much unjustly but my business be to humanize -- not to harden at that task i must labor through obloquy and misrepresentation if need be at the same time i admit that i must not for the miserable purpose of self-glorification but with a view to the maintenance and establishment of my moral influence recover the prestige of personal courage of which some here seek to deprive I before i have travel unattended through the town and village of upper canada and meet ` the bhoy ' as they be call in all of they on they own ground i think i shall have effect this object in so far as the province be concern to right myself in england will be more difficult but doubtless if i live the opportunity of so do even there will sooner or later present itself hitherto any impertinence which have reach I from the other side have be anonymous \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- sidenote : afterthought -rrb- i believe that the sentiment express in the newspaper extract of which you acknowledge the receipt in you last with respect to the merit of the policy of forbearance adopt by I at the great crisis be begin to obtain very generally among the few who trace result to they cause but none can know what that crisis be and what that decision cost at the time i take it i stand literally _ alone _ i alienate from I the adherent of the government who feel or imagine -lrb- have be generally in time past on the anti-government side -rrb- that if the table have be turn -- if _ they _ and not _ they adversary _ have be resist the law of the land and threaten the life of the queen 's representative -- a very different course of repressive policy would have be adopt at the same time i gain nothing on the other side who only advance in audacity and add the charge of personal cowardice to they other outrage at home too i forfeit much moral support for although the government sustain I with that honorable confidence which entitle a government to be well serve they be puzzle the logic of the case be against I lord gray and lord j russell both feel that either i be right or i be wrong if the latter i ought to be recall if the former i ought to make the law respect and lastly i lose any chance of moral support from the opinion of we neighbor in the state for like all primitive constitutionalist the idea of government they hold in that quarter be very simple i have be tell by american ` we think you be quite right but we could not understand why you do not _ shoot they down _ ' i do not as you may suppose often speak of these matter but the subject be allude to the other day by a person -lrb- now out of politics but who know what be go on at the time one of we ablest man -rrb- and he say to I ` yes i see it all now you be right -- a thousand time right -- though i think otherwise then i own that i would have reduce montreal to ash before i would have endure half what you do and ' he add ' i should have be justified too ' ` yes ' i answer ` you would have be justified because you course would have be perfectly defensible but it would not have be the _ best course _ mine be a _ better one _ ' and shall i tell you what be the deep conviction on my mind which apart from the reluctance which i naturally feel to shed blood -lrb- particularly in a cause in which many who oppose the government be actuate by motive which though much alloy with baser metal have claim on my sympathy -rrb- confirm I in that course i perceive that the mind of the british population of the province in upper canada especially be at that time the prey of oppose impulse on the one hand as a question of blood and sensibility they be incline to go with the anti-french party of lower canada on the other as a question of constitutional principle they feel that i be right and that i deserve support depend upon it if we have look to bayonet instead of to reason for a triumph the _ sensibility _ of the great body of which i speak would soon have carry the day against they _ judgment _ and what be the result 700000 french reconcile to england -- not because they be get _ rebel money _ -- i believe indeed that no _ rebel _ will get a farthing but because they believe that the british governor be just ` yes ' but you may say ` this be purchase by the alienation of the british ' far from it i take the whole blame upon myself and i will venture to affirm that the canadian british never be so loyal as they be at this hour and what be more remarkable still and more directly traceable to this policy of forbearance never since canada exist have party-spirit be more moderate and the british and french race on better term than they be now and this in spite of the withdrawal of protection and of the proposal to throw on the colony many charge which the imperial government have hitherto bear pardon I for

they affect the person of the governor but it may be truly say that this be the aspect of they that give he least concern he feel indeed deeply the indignity offer to the crown of england through its representative but there be some satisfaction in the reflection that by take on himself the whole responsibility of sanction the obnoxious bill he have draw down upon he own head the chief violence of a storm which might otherwise have explode in a manner very dangerous to the empire ' i think i might say ' he write ` with less poetry but with more truth what lamartine say when they accuse he of coquet with the _ rouge _ under the provisional government : _ ouus j' be conspiré j' be conspiré comme le paratonnerre conspire avec le nuage pour désarmer la foudre _ ' but the thunder-cloud be not entirely disarm and it burst in a direction which popular passion in canada have always be too apt to take threat of throw off england and join the american state as far back as march 14 1849 we find lord elgin draw lord gray 's attention to this subject there have be -lrb- he write -rrb- a vast deal of talk about ` annexation ' as be unfortunately always the case here when there be anything to agitate the public mind if half the talk on this subject be sincere i should consider a attempt to keep up the connection with great britain as utopian in the extreme for no matter what the subject of complaint or what the party complain whether it be allege that the french be oppress the british or the british the french -- that upper canada debt press on lower canada or lower canada claim on upper whether merchant be bankrupt stock depreciate road bad or season unfavourable annexation be invoke as the remedy for all ill imaginary or real a great deal of this talk be however bravado and a great deal the mere product of thoughtlessness undoubtedly it be in some quarter the utterance of very sincere conviction and if england will not make the sacrifice which be absolutely necessary to put the colonist here in as good a position commercially as the citizen of the state -- in order to which _ free navigation and reciprocal trade with the state be indispensable _ -- if not only the organ of the league but those of the government and of the peel party be always write as if it be a admit fact that colony and more especially canada be a burden to be endure only because they can not be get rid of the end may be nearer at hand than we wot of in these sentence we have the germ of view and feeling which time only make clearer and stronger -- indignation at that tendency so common in all minority to look abroad for aid against the power of the majority faith in the idea of colonial government if base on principle of justice and freedom and as regard the particular case of canada the conviction that nothing be want to secure she loyalty but a removal of the commercial restriction which place she at a disadvantage in compete with she neighbor of the union to understand the scope of he policy during the next few year it will be necessary to dwell at some length on each of these point but for the present we must return to the circumstance which give occasion to the letter which we have quote -lrb- sidenote : manifesto -rrb- while ready as that letter show to make every allowance for the utterance of thoughtless folly or of well-founded discontent on the part of the people lord elgin feel the necessity of check at once such demonstration on the part of pay servant of the crown accordingly when a elaborate manifesto appear in favor of ` annexation ' bear the signature of several person -- magistrate queen 's counsel militia officer and other -- hold commission at the pleasure of the crown he cause a circular to be address to all such person with the view of ascertain whether they name have be attach with they own consent some of these letter be answer in the negative some in the affirmative and other by deny the right of the government to put the question and decline to reply to it lord elgin resolve with the advice of he executive council to remove from such office as be hold during the pleasure of the crown the gentleman who admit the genuineness of they signature and those who refuse to disavow they -lrb- sidenote : remedial measure -rrb- ` in this course say lord gray -lrb- 1 -rrb- ` we think it right to support he and a despatch be address to he signify the queen 's approval of he have dismiss from she service those who have sign the address and she majesty 's command to resist to the utmost any attempt that might be make to bring about a separation of canada from the british dominion ' but the necessity for such act of severity only increase lord elgin 's desire to remove every reasonable ground of complaint and discontent to shut out as he say the advocate of annexation from every plea which could grace or dignify rebellion he feel indeed a assure confidence that by carry out fearlessly the principle of self-government he have ` cast a acorn into time ' which could not fail to bring forth the fruit of political contentment but in the meantime for the immediate security of the connection between the colony and the mother-country he think as we have already see that two measure be indispensable viz the removal of the exist restriction on navigation and the establishment of reciprocal free trade with the united state judge after the event we may perhaps be incline to think that the importance which he attach to the latter of these measure be exaggerated especially as the annexation movement have die away and content commercial as well as political have return to the province long before it be carry but we can not form a correct view of he policy without give some prominence to a subject which occupy for many year so large a share of he thought and of he energy write to lord gray on November 8 1849 he say : -- -lrb- sidenote : ` reciprocity ' -rrb- the fact be that although both the state and canada export to the same neutral market price on the canada side of the line be lower than on the american by the amount of the duty which the american levy so long as this state of thing continue there will be discontent in this country deep grow discontent you will not i trust accuse I of have deceive you on this point i have always say that i be prepare to assume the responsibility of keep canada quiet with a much smaller garrison than we have now and without any tax on the british consumer in the shape of protection to canadian product if you put we trade on as good a footing as that of we american neighbor but if thing remain on they present footing in this respect there be nothing before we but violent agitation end in convulsion or annexation it be better that i should worry you with my importunity than that i should be chargeable with have neglect to give you due warning you have a great opportunity before you -- obtain reciprocity for we and i venture to predict that you will be able shortly to point to this hitherto turbulent colony with satisfaction in illustration of the tendency of self-government and freedom of trade to beget contentment and material progress canada will remain attach to england though tie to she neither by the golden link of protection nor by the mesh of old-fashioned colonial office jobbing and chicane but if you allow the american to withhold the boon which you have the means of extort if you will i much fear that the closing period of the connection between great britain and canada will be mark by incident which will damp the ardor of those who desire to promote human happiness by striking shackle either off commerce or off man even when tender to the premier lord john russell he formal thanks on be raise to the british peerage -- a honor which come at that moment he prize most highly as a proof to the world that the queen 's government approve he policy -- he could not forego the opportunity of insist on a topic which seem to he so momentous it be -lrb- he write -rrb- of such vital importance that you lordship should rightly apprehend the nature of these difficulty and the state of public opinion in canada at this conjuncture that i venture at the hazard of commit a indiscretion to add a single observation on this head let I then assure you lordship and i speak advisedly in offer this assurance that the disaffection now exist in canada whatever be the form with which it may clothe itself be due mainly to commercial cause i do not say that there be no discontent on political grounds powerful individual and even class of man be i be well aware dissatisfied with the conduct of affair but i make bold to affirm that so general be the belief that under the present circumstance of we commercial condition the colonist pay a heavy pecuniary fine for they fidelity to great britain that nothing but the existence to a unwonted degree of political contentment among the mass have prevent the cry for annexation from spread like wildfire through the province this as you lordship will perceive be a new feature in canadian politics the plea of self-interest the most powerful weapon perhaps which the friend of british connection have wield in time past have not only be wrest from my hand but transfer since 1846 to those of the adversary i take the liberty of mention a fact which seem better to illustrate the actual condition of affair in these respects than many argument i have lately spend several week in the district of niagara canadian niagara be separate from the state of new york by a narrow stream span by a bridge which it take a foot passenger about three minute to cross the inhabitant be for the most part ue loyalist -lrb- 2 -rrb- and differ little in habit or mode of thought and expression from they neighbor wheat be they staple product -- the article which they exchange for foreign comfort and luxury now it be the fact that a bushel of wheat grow on the canadian side of the line have fetch this year in the market on a average from 9_d _ to 1_s _ less than the same quantity and quality of the same article grow on the other through they district council a body elect under a system of very extend suffrage these same inhabitant of niagara have protest against the montreal annexation movement they have do so -lrb- and many other district council in upper canada have do the same -rrb- under the impression that it would be base to declare against england at a moment when england have give a signal proof of she determination to concede constitutional government in all its plenitude to canada i be confident however that the large majority of the person who have thus protest firmly believe that they annexation to the united state would add one-fourth to the value of the produce of they farm i need say no more than this to convince you lordship that while this state of thing subsist -lrb- and i much fear that no measure but the establishment of reciprocal trade between canada and the state or the imposition of a duty on the produce of the state when import into england will remove it -rrb- argument will not be want to those who seek to seduce canadian from they allegiance shortly afterwards he write to lord gray : -- it be not for I to dispute the point with free-trader when they allege that all part of the empire be suffer from the effect of free-trade and that canadian must take they chance with other but i must be permit to remark that the canadian case differ from other both as respects the immediate cause of the suffering and still more as respects the means which the sufferer possess of find for themselves a way of escape as to the former point i have only to say that however severe the pressure in other case attendant on the transition from protection to free-trade there be none which present so peculiar a specimen of legislative legerdemain as the canadian where a interest be create in 1843 by a parliament in which the party affect have no voice only to be knock down by the same parliament in 1846 but it be the latter consideration which constitute the specialty of the canadian case what in point of fact _ can _ the other suffer interest of which the _ time _ write do there may be a great deal of grumble and a gradual move towards republicanism or even communism but this be a operose and empirical process the party engage in it be full of misgiving and they rank at every step in advance be thin by desertion not so with the canadian the remedy offer to they such as it be be perfectly definite and intelligible they be invite to form a part of a community which be neither suffer nor free - trading which never make a bargain without get at least twice as much as it give a community the member of which have be within the last few week pour into they multifarious place of worship to thank god that they be exempt from the ill which afflict other man from those more especially which afflict they despise neighbor the inhabitant of north america who have remain faithful to the country which plant they now i believe that if these fact be ignore it be quite impossible to understand rightly the present state of opinion in canada or to determine wisely the course which the british government and parliament ought to pursue it may suit the policy of the english free-trade press to represent the difficulty of canada as the consequence of have a fool for a governor-general but if it be permit I to express a opinion on a matter of so much delicacy i venture to doubt whether it would be safe to act on this hypothesis my conviction on the contrary be that motive of self-interest of a very gross and palpable description be suggest treasonable course to the canadian mind at present and that it be a political sentiment a feeling of gratitude for what have be do and suffer this year in the cause of canadian self-government which be neutralise these suggestion again on December 291849 he write as follow : -- -lrb- sidenote : free navigation -rrb- i believe that the operation of the free navigation system will be what you anticipate to a great extent at least and that it will tend materially to equalise price on the two side of the line at the same time i do think that there be circumstance in this country which falsify in some degree the deduction at which one arrive from reasoning found on the abstract principle of political economy one of these circumstance be the power which the farmer in the western state have no rent to pay have of hold back they grain when price do not suit they you must have observe what hoard they pour forth when they be tempt by the famine price of 1847 and i can not but think that this power of hoard couple with a indifferent harvest must account for the great disparity of price which have obtain during the course of the present year in the new york market for bond grain and grain for the home consumption i fully expect however to see the price of canadian grain bond at new york rise now that it can be export to liverpool in the new york liner which will carry it for ballast nevertheless i think that sir robert peel 's _ dictum _ with respect to the repeal of the corn law on the day on which he retire last from office when he observe that thenceforward even when the poor suffer from the high price of bread they would not ascribe that suffer to the fact of they bread be tax apply with at least equal force to the reciprocity question as affect the canadian farmer for sure be i that so long as there be a duty on they produce when it enter the state and none on the introduction of united state produce into england they will ascribe to this cause alone the difference of price that may occasionally rule to they disadvantage the history of the two measure which lord elgin so ardently desire and which in the foregoing and many similar letter he so urgently press be eminently characteristic of the two legislature through which they have respectively to be carry -lrb- sidenote : repeal of navigation law -rrb- in england the repeal of restrictive navigation law be contend for by thoughtful statesman on grounds of public policy the protective and conservative instinct of the old country fortify by the never-absent spirit of party resist the change when fairly beat by force of argument in the house of common they entrench themselves ha the house of lord and it be only after a hot struggle that the act be pass in June 1849 of which one effect be by lower freight to increase the profit of the canadian trade in wheat and timber and thus to advance in a very important degree the commercial prosperity of the colony -lrb- sidenote : reciprocity treaty -rrb- the delay which retard the settlement of the reciprocity treaty be due to cause of another kind the difficulty be to induce the american congress to pay any attention at all to the subject in the vast multiplicity of matter with which that assembly have to deal it be say that no cause which do not appeal strongly to a national sentiment or at least to some party feeling have a chance of obtain a hearing unless it be take up systematically by ` organizer ' outside the house the reciprocity bill be not a measure about which any national or even party feeling could be arouse it be one which require much study to understand its bearing and which would affect different interest in the country in different way it stand therefore especially in need of the aid of professional organizer a kind of aid of which it be of course impossible that either the british or the canadian government should avail itself session after session the bill be propose scarcely debate and set aside at last in 1854 after the negotiation have drag on wearily for more than six year lord elgin himself be send to washington in the hope -- ' a forlorn hope ' as it seem to those who send he -- of bring the matter to a successful issue it be he first essay in diplomacy but make under circumstance unusually favourable he be personally popular with the american towards whom he have always entertain and show a most friendly feeling they appreciate moreover better perhaps than it be appreciate at home the consummate ability as well as the rare strength of character which he have display in the government of canada and the prestige thus attach to he name join to the influence of he presence and he courtesy and _ bonhomie _ enable he in a few day to smooth all difficulty and change apathy into enthusiasm within a few week from the time of he landing he have agree with mr marcy upon the term of a treaty of reciprocity which soon afterwards receive the sanction of all the government concern the main concession make by the province to the united state in this treaty be -lrb- 1 -rrb- the removal of duty on the introduction for consumption in the province of certain product of the state -lrb- 2 -rrb- the admission of citizen of that country to the enjoyment of the in-shore sea-fishery -lrb- 3 -rrb- the opening-up to they vessel of the st lawrence and canal pertain thereto a good deal of misconception prevail at the time as to the amount of the concession make under the second head the popular impression on this point be that a gigantic monopoly be about to be surrender but this be far from be the case the citizen of the united state have already under the convention of 1818 access to the most important cod-fishery on the british coast the new treaty maintain in favor of british subject the monopoly of the river and freshwater fishery and the concession which it make to the citizen of the united state amount in substance to this that it admit they to a legal participation in the mackerel and herr fishery from illegal encroachment on which it have be find after the experience of many year practically impossible to exclude they -lrb- 3 -rrb- the duration of the treaty be limit to ten year and have not be extend but it be not too much to hope that it have have some effect in engender feeling of friendliness and of community of interest which may long outlast itself -lrb- sidenote : view of government -rrb- it have be already notice that the ` annexation movement ' of 1849 die away without serious consequence and extract which have be give above sufficiently show to what cause lord elgin attribute its extinction the powerful attraction of the great neighbouring republic have be counteract and overcome by the more powerful attraction of self - government at home the centrifugal force be no longer equal to the centripetal to create this state of feeling have be he most cherish desire to feel that he have succeed in create it be throughout much obloquy and misunderstand he greatest support -lrb- sidenote : duty of support authority -rrb- from the earliest period of he entrance into political life he have always have the strongest sense of the duty incumbent on every public man

accustom to look abroad for the source and center of power a beaten minority in the colonial parliament instead of loyally accept its position be never without a hope of wrest the victory from its opponent either by a appeal to opinion in the mother-country always ill-informed and therefore credulous in matter of colonial politics or else by raise a cry of ` separation ' or ` annexation ' the evil effect of this state of thing need hardly be point out on the one hand the constant reference to opinion in england not in the shape of constitutional appeal but by ex-parte statement produce a state of chronic irritation against the mother-country ` there be nothing ' write lord elgin ` which make the colonial statesman so jealous as rescript from the colonial office suggest by the representation of provincial clique or interest who ought as he contend to bow before the authority of government house montreal rather than those of down street ' on the other hand it be not easy to know how to deal with politician who do not profess to own more than a qualify and provisional allegiance to the constitution of the province and the crown of england the one hope in both case be to foster a ` national and manly tone ' of political moral to lead all party alike to look to they own parliament and neither to the london press nor the american hustings for the solution of all problem of provincial government but while thus zealously defend the fortress of british connection commit to he care lord elgin be dismayed to find that its wall be crumble round he undermine by the

the vitality of the monarchical principle as well as in its value he contend that it be a error to suppose that a constitutional monarchy in proportion as it become more liberal tend towards republicanism and further that if such tendency exist it would be retrograde rather than progressive the view of colonial government its object and its difficulty which have be here briefly epitomise

the friend of the connection will be discourage if it be admit that separation _ must _ take place sooner or later the argument in favor of a present move seem to be almost irresistible i be prepare to contend that with responsible government fairly work out with free-trade there be no reason why the colonial relation should not be indefinitely maintain but look at my present difficulty which may be increase beyond calculation if indiscreet expression be make use of during the present crisis the english government think it necessary in order to give moral support to they representative in

there so much violence on the part of the opposition here last summer particularly against the governor-general because it feel itself to be weak in the province and look for success to the effect it could produce in england alone and how be this tendency to bring the imperial and local parliament into antagonism a tendency so dangerous to the permanence of we system to be counteract by one expedient as it appear to I only namely by the governor 's act with some assumption of responsibility so that the shaft of the enemy which be intend for the imperial government may fall on he if a

general principle no doubt can i presume be entertain it be not indeed always easy to apply it in these community where fortune be precarious the social system so much base on equality and public service so generally mix up with party conflict but it should never in my opinion be lose sight of and advantage should be take of all favourable opportunity to act upon it there be two principle which ought i think as a general rule to be attend to in the distribution of imperial honor among colonist firstly they should appear to emanate directly from the crown on the advice if you will of the governor and imperial minister but not on the recommendation of the local executive and secondly they should be confer as much as possible on the eminent person who be no longer actively engage in

-rrb- -lrb- sidenote : colonial existence not provisional -rrb- lord john 's speech on the colony seem to have be eminently successful at home it be calculate too i think to do good in the colony but for one sentence the introduction of which i deeply deplore -- the sting in the tail alas for that sting in the tail i much fear that when the liberal and enlighten sentiment the enunciation of which by one so high in authority be so well calculate to make the colonist sensible of the advantage which they derive from they connection with great britain shall have pass away from they memory there will not be want those who will remind they that on this solemn occasion the prime minister of england amid the plaudit of a full senate declare that he look forward to the day when the tie which he be endeavor to render so easy and mutually advantageous would be sever and wherefore this foreboding or perhaps i ought not to use the term foreboding for really to judge by the comment of the press on this declaration of lord john 's i should be lead to imagine that the prospect of these suck democracy after they have drain they old mother 's life-blood leave she in the lurch and set up as rival just at the time when they increase strength might render they a support instead of a burden be one of the most cheer which have of late present itself to the english imagination but wherefore then this anticipation -- if foreboding be not the correct term because lord john and the people of england persist in assume that the colonial relation be incompatible with maturity and full development and be this really so incontestable a truth that it be a duty not only to hold but to proclaim it consider for a moment what be the effect of proclaim it in we case we have on this continent two great empire in presence or rather i should say two great imperial system in many respects there be much similarity between they in so far as power of self-government be concern it be certain that we colonist in america have no reason to envy the citizen of any state in the union the form differ but it may be show that practically the inhabitant of canada have a greater power in control they own destiny than those of michigan or new york who must tolerate a tariff impose by twenty other state and pay the expense of war undertake for object which they profess to abhor and yet there be a difference between the two case a difference in my humble judgment of sentiment rather than substance which render the one a system of life and strength and the other a system of death and decay no matter how raw and rude a territory may be when it be admit as a state into the union of the united state it be at once by the popular belief invest with all the dignity of manhood and introduce into a system which despite the combativeness of certain ardent spirit from the south every american believe and maintain to be immortal but how do the case stand with we no matter how great the advance of a british colony in wealth and civilisation no matter how absolute the power of self-government concede to it it be still teach to believe that it be in a condition of pupilage from which it must pass before it can attain maturity for one i have never be able to comprehend why elastic as we constitutional system be we should not be able now more especially when we have cease to control the trade of we colony to render the link which bind they to the british crown at least as lasting as those which unite the component part of the union one thing be however indispensable to the success of this or any other system of colonial government you must renounce the habit of tell the colony that the colonial be a provisional existence you must allow they to believe that without sever the bond which unite they to great britain they may attain the degree of perfection and of social and political development to which organise community of free man have a right to aspire since i begin this letter i have i regret to say confirmatory evidence of the justice of the anticipation i have form of the probable effect of lord john 's declaration i enclose extract from two newspaper a annexationist the _ herald _ of montreal and a _ quasus _ annexationist the _ mirror _ of toronto you will note the use they make of it i be more annoyed however i confess by what occur yesterday in council we have to determine whether or not to dismiss from he office a gentleman who be both mpp qc and jp and who have issue a flaming manifesto in favor not of annexation but of a immediate declaration of independence as a step to it i will not say anything of my own opinion on the case but it be generally contend by the member of the board that it would be impossible to maintain that person who have declare they intention to throw off they allegiance to the queen with a view to annexation be unfit to retain office grant during pleasure if person who make a similar declaration with a view to independence be to be differently deal with baldwin have lord john 's speech in he hand he be a man of singularly placid demeanor but he have be seriously ill so possibly he nerve be shake -- at any rate i never see he so much move ` have you read the latter part of lord j russell 's speech ' he say to I i nod assent ` for myself ' he add ` if the anticipation therein express prove to be well found my interest in public affair be go for ever but be it not hard upon we while we be labor through good and evil report to thwart the design of those who would dismember the empire that we adversary should be inform that the difference between they and the prime minister of england be only one of time if the british government have really come to the conclusion that we be a burden to be cast off whenever a favourable opportunity offer surely we ought to be warn ' i reply that while i regret as much as he could do the paragraph to which he refer i think he somewhat mistake its import : that i believe no man living be more oppose to the dismemberment of the empire than lord j russell : that i do not conceive that he have any intention of desert the colony or of invite they to separate from england but that he have in the sentence in question give utterance to a purely speculative and in my judgment most fallacious opinion which be share i fear by very many person both in england and the colony : that i hold it to be a perfectly unsound and most dangerous theory that british colony could not attain maturity without separation and that my interest in labor with they to bring into full play the principle of constitutional government in canada would entirely cease if i could be persuade to adopt it i say all this i must confess however not without misgive for i could not but be sensible that in spite of all my allegation to the contrary my audience be dispose to regard a prediction of this nature proceeding from a prime minister less as a speculative abstraction than as one of that class of prophecy which work they own fulfilment i leave the council chamber dishearten with the feeling that lord j russell 's reference to the manhood of colony be more likely to be follow by practical consequence than lamartine 's famous ' _ quand l'heure aura sonné _ ' invocation to oppressed nationality it be possible indeed that i exaggerate to myself the probable effect of this declaration politician of the baldwin stamp with distinct view and aim who have struggle to obtain a government on british principle desire to preserve it be not i fear very numerous in canada the great mass move on with very indefinite purpose and not much inquire whither they be go of one thing however i be confident there can not be any peace contentment progress or credit in this colony while the idea obtain that the connection with england be a millstone about its neck which should be cast off as soon as it can be conveniently manage what man in he sens would invest he money in the public security of a country where question affect the very foundation on which public credit rest be in perpetual agitation or would settle in it at all if he could find for he foot a more stable resting-place elsewhere i may perhaps be express myself too unreservedly with reference to opinion emanate from a source which i be no less disposed than bind to respect as i have the means however of feel the pulse of the colonist in this most feverish region i consider it to be always my duty to furnish you with as faithful a record as possible of we diagnostic and after all may i not with all submission ask be not the question at issue a most momentous one what be it indeed but this : be the queen of england to be the sovereign of a empire grow expand strengthen itself from age to age striking its root deep into fresh earth and draw new supplies of vitality from virgin soil or be she to be for all essential purpose of might and power monarch of great britain and ireland merely -- she place and that of she line in the world 's history determine by the productiveness of 12000 square mile of a coal formation which be be rapidly exhaust and the duration of the social and political organization over which she preside dependent on the annual expatriation with a view to its eventual alienization of the surplus swarm of she bear subject if lord j russell instead of conclude he excellent speech with a declaration of opinion which as i read it and as i fear other will read it seem to make it a point of honor with the colonist to prepare for separation have contented himself with resume the statement already make in its course with show that neither the government nor parliament could have any object in view in they colonial policy but the good of the colony and the establishment of the relation between they and the mother-country on the basis of mutual affection that as the idea of maintain a colonial empire for the purpose of exercise dominion or dispense patronage have be for some time abandon and that of regard it as a hot-bed for force commerce and manufacture more recently renounce a greater amount of free action and self-government might be concede to british colony without any breach of imperial unity or the violation of any principle of imperial policy than have under any scheme yet devise fall to the lot of the component part of any federal or imperial system if he have leave these great truth to work they effect without hazard a conjecture which will i fear be receive as a suggestion with respect to the course which certain wayward member of the imperial family may be expect to take in a contingency still confessedly remote it would i venture with great deference to submit in so far at least as public feeling in the colony be concern have be safer and better -lrb- sidenote : ` separation ' and ` annexation ' -rrb- you draw i know a distinction between separation with a view to annexation and separation with a view to independence you say the former be a act of treason the latter a natural and legitimate step in progress there be much plausibility doubtless in this position but independently of the fact that no one advocate independence in these colony except as a means to the end annexation be it really tenable if you take you stand on the hypothesis that the colonial existence be one with which the colonist ought to rest satisfied then i think you be entitle to denounce without reserve or measure those who propose for some secondary object to substitute the star and stripe for the union jack but if on the contrary you assume that it be a provisional state which admit of but a stunt and partial growth and out of which all community ought in the course of nature to strive to pass how can you refuse to permit you colony here when they have arrive at the proper stage in they existence to place themselves in a condition which be at once most favourable to they security and to they perfect national development what reason can you assign for the refusal except such as be found on selfishness and be therefore morally worthless if you say that you great lubberly boy be too big for the nursery and that you have no other room for he in you house how can you decline to allow he to lodge with he elder brethren over the way when the attempt to keep up a establishment for himself would seriously embarrass he \* \* \* \* \* _ to the earl gray _ toronto : November 1 1850 sir h bulwer spend four day with we and for many reason i be glad that he have be here he leave we know more of canada than he do when he come i think too that both he and sir e head return to they home re-assure on many point of we internal policy on which they feel doubtful before and much enlighten as to the real position of man and thing in this province -lrb- sidenote : self-government not republican -rrb- with one important truth 1 have labor to impress they and i hope successfully it be this : that the faithful carry out of the principle of constitutional government be a departure from the american model not a approximation to it and therefore a departure from republicanism in its only workable shape of the soundness of this view of we case i entertain no doubt whatever and though i meet with few person to whom it seem to have occur -lrb- for the common belief of superficial observer be that we be republicanise the colony -rrb- i seldom fail in bring it bear to the understanding of any intelligent person with whom i have occasion to discuss it the fact be that the american system be we old colonial system with in certain case the principle of popular election substitute for that of nomination by the crown mr filmore stand to he congress very much in the same relation in which i stand to my assembly in jamaica there be the same absence of effective responsibility in the conduct of legislation the same want of concurrent action between the part of the political machine the whole business of legislation in the american congress as well as in the state legislature be conduct in the manner in which railway business be conduct in the house of common at a time when it be to be fear that notwithstanding the high standard of honor in the british parliament there be a good deal of job for instance we reciprocity measure be press by we at washington last session just as a railway bill in 1845 or 1846 would have be press in parliament there be no government to deal with the interest of the union as a whole and distinct from local and sectional interest have no organ in the representative body it be all a question of canvass this member of congress or the other it be easy to perceive that under such a system job must become not the exception but the rule now i feel very strongly that when a people have be once thoroughly accustom to the working of such a parliamentary system as ours they never will consent to revert to this clumsy irresponsible mechanism whether we shall be able to carry on the war here long enough to allow the practice of constitutional government and the habit of mind which it engender to take root in these province may be doubtful but it may be worth you while to consider whether these view do not throw some light on affair in europe if you part with constitutional monarchy there you may possibly get something much more democratic but you can not i be confident get american republicanism it be the fashion to say ` of course not we can not get they federal system ' but this be not the only reason there be other that lie deeper look at france where they be try to jumble up the two thing a head of the state responsible to the people who elect he and a ministry responsible to the parliament \* \* \* \* \* _ to the duke of newcastle _ march 26 1853 it be argue that by the severance of the connection british statesman would be relieve of a onerous responsibility for colonial act of which they can not otherwise rid themselves be there not however some fallacy in this if by concede absolute independence the british parliament can acquit itself of the obligation to impose its will upon the colonist in the matter for instance of a church establishment can it not attain the same end by declare that as respects such local question the colonist be free to judge for themselves how can it be justifiable to adopt the former of these expedient and sacrilegious to act upon the latter the true policy in my humble judgment be to throw the whole weight of responsibility on those who exercise the real power for after all the sense of responsibility be the best security against the abuse of power and as respects the connection to act and speak on this hypothesis -- that there be nothing in it to check the development of healthy national life in these young community i believe that this policy will be find to be not only the safest but also -lrb- a important consideration in these day -rrb- the most economical \* \* \* \* \* _ to the earl gray _ toronto : December 17 1850 although as you observe it seem to be rather idle in we to correspond on what may be term speculative question when we have so much press business on hand i venture to say a few word in reply to you letter of the 23rd ult firstly because i presume to dissent from some of the opinion which you advance in it and secondly because i have a practical object of no small importance in view in call you attention to the contrast which present themselves in the working of we institution and those of we neighbor in the state my practical object be this : when you concede to the colonist constitutional government in its integrity you be reproach with lead they to republicanism and the american union the same reproach be hurl with anathema against you humble servant lord stanley if i rightly remember in the debate on ryland 's case last year state amid cheer that if you be in the habit of consult the minister of the crown in the colony before you place person on the colonial pension list he have no hesitation in say you have already establish a republic in canada now i believe on the contrary that it may be demonstrate that the concession of constitutional government have a tendency to draw the colonist the other way firstly because it slake that thirst for self-government which seize on all british community when they approach maturity and secondly because it habituate the colonist to the working of a political mechanism which be both intrinsically superior to that of the american and more unlike it than we old colonial system adopt however the view with respect to the superiority of the mechanism of we political system to that of we neighbor which i have venture to urge you proceed to argue that the remedy be in they hand that without abandon they republicanism they and they _ confrères _ in france have nothing to do but to dismiss they president and to substitute we constitution without a king the body without the head for they own to get rid of the inconvenience which they now experience and you quote with approbation as a embodiment of this idea the project submit by m grévy and the red republican to the french constituent assembly -lrb- sidenote : value of the monarchical principle -rrb- now here i confess i can not go along with you and the difference between we be a very material one for if the monarch be not a indispensable element in we constitutional mechanism and if we can secure all the advantage of that mechanism without he i have draw the wrong moral from the fact you say that the system the red republican would have establish in france would have be the nearest possible approach to we own it be possible i think that we may be tend towards the like issue it be possible perhaps probable that as the house of common become more democratic in its composition and consequently more arrogant in its bear it may cast off the shackle which the other power of the state impose on its self-will and even utterly abolish they but i venture to believe that those who last till that day come will find that they be live under a very different constitution from that which we now enjoy that they have traverse the interval which separate a temperate and cautious administration of public affair rest on the balance of power and interest from a reckless and overbearing tyranny base on the caprice and passion of a absolute and irresponsible body you talk somewhat lightly of the check of the crown although you acknowledge its utility but be it indeed so light a matter even as we constitution now work be it a light matter that the crown should have the power of dissolve parliament in other word of depose the tyrant at will be it a light matter that for several month in each year the house of common should be in abeyance during which period the nation look on minister not as slave of parliament but servant of the crown be it a light matter that there should still be such respect for the monarchical principle that the servant of that visible entity clepe the crown be enable to carry on much of the detail of internal and foreign administration without consult parliament and even without its cognisance or do you suppose that the red republican when they advocate the nomination of a ministry of the house of assembly with a revocable _ mandat _ intend to create a frankenstein endowed with power in some case paramount to and in other run parallel with the authority of the omnipotent body to which it owe its existence my own impression be that they mean a set of delegate to be appoint who should exercise certain function of legislative initiation and executive patronage so long as they reflect clearly in the former the passion and in the latter the interest of the majority for the time be and no longer it appear to I i must confess that if you have a republican form of government in a great country with complicated internal and external relation you must either separate the executive and legislative department as in the united state or submit to a tyranny of the majority not the more tolerable because it be capricious and wield by a tyrant with many head of the two evil i prefer the former consider for a moment how much more violent the proceedings of majority in the american legislature would be how much more reckless the appeal to popular passion how much more frequently the permanent interest of the nation and the rights of individual and class would be sacrifice to the object of raise political capital for present use if debate or discussion affect the tenure of office i have no idea that the executive and legislative department of the state can be make to work together with a sufficient degree of harmony to give the maximum of strength and of mutual independence to secure freedom and the rights of minority except under the presidency of monarchy the moral influence of which so long as a nation be monarchical in its sentiment can not of course be measure merely by its recognize power -lrb- sidenote : influence of a governor under responsible government -rrb- those who be most ready to concur in these view of colonial government and to admire the vigor with which they be defend and the consistency with which they be carry out may still be incline to ask whether the maintenance of they do not involve a species of official suicide : whether the theory of the responsibility of provincial minister to the provincial parliament and of the consequent duty of the governor to remain absolutely neutral in the strife of political party have not a necessary tendency to degrade he office into that of a mere _ rous fainéant _ he have in 1849 as sir c adderley express it ` maintain the principle of responsible government at the risk of he life ' be the result of he hard-won victory only to empty himself of all but the mere outward show of power and authority such question he be always ready to meet with a uncompromising negative ' i have try ' he say both system in jamaica there be no responsible government : but i have not half the power i have here with my constitutional and change cabinet ' even on the vice-regal throne of indium he miss at first at least something of the authority and influence which have be he as constitutional governor in canada -lrb- 5 -rrb- he be fully conscious however of the difficult nature of the position and that it be only tenable on condition of be penetrate or _ possess _ as he say with the idea of its tenability in this strain he write to he intimate friend mr cum bruce in September 1852 with reference to a report that he be to be recall by the ministry which have recently come into power as respects the _ matter _ of the report i be dispose to believe that view the question with reference to personal interest exclusively my removal from hence would not be any disadvantage to I but as to my work here -- there be the rub be it to be all undo on this point i must speak frankly i have be possess -lrb- i use the word advisedly for i fear that most person in england still consider it a case of _ possession _ -rrb- with the idea that it be possible to maintain on this soil of north america and in the face of republican america british connection and british institution if you give the latter freely and trustingly faith when it be sincere be always catch and i have impart this faith more or less thoroughly to all canadian statesman with whom i have be in official relationship since 1848 and to all intelligent englishman with whom i have come in contact since 1850 -- as witness lord wharncliffe waldegrave tremenheere & c & c now if the governor cease to possess this faith or to have the faculty of impart it i confess i fear that ere long it will become extinct in other breast likewise i believe that it be equally a error to imagine with one old-fashioned party that you can govern such dependency as this on the antiquated bureaucratic principle by means of rescript from down street in defiance of the popular legislature and on the hypothesis that one local faction monopolise all the loyalty of the colony and to suppose with the radical that all be do when you have simply tell the colonist ` to go to the devil they own way ' i believe on the contrary that there be more room for the exercise of influence on the part of the governor under my system than under any that ever be before devise a influence however wholly moral -- a influence of suasion sympathy and moderation which soften the temper while it elevate the aim of local polity it be true that on certain question of public policy especially with regard to church matter view be propound by my minister which do not exactly square with my pre-conceived opinion and which i acquiesce in so long as they do not contravene the fundamental principle of morality from a conviction that they be in accordance with the general sentiment of the community it be true that i do not seek the commendation bestow on sir f head for bring man into he council from the liberal party and tell they that they should enjoy only a partial confidence thereby allow they to retain they position as tribune of the people in conjunction with the _ prestige _ of adviser of the crown by enable they to shirk responsibility for any act of government which be unpopular it be true that i have always say to my adviser ` while you continue my adviser you shall enjoy nay unreserved confidence and _ en revanche _ you shall be responsible for all act of government ' but it be no less certain that there be not one of they who do not know that no inducement on earth would prevail with I to bring I to acquiesce in any measure which seem to I repugnant to public moral or imperial interest and i must say that far from find in my adviser a desire to entrap I into proceedings of which 1 might disapprove i find a tendency constantly increase to attach the utmost value to my opinion on all question local or general that arise the deep sense which he entertain of the importance of a correct understanding on this point be show by he devote to it the closing word of the last official despatch which he write from quebec on December 18 1854 i readily admit that the maintenance of the position and due influence of the governor be one of the most critical problem that have to be solve in the adaptation of parliamentary government to the colonial system and that it be difficult to over-estimate the importance which attach to its satisfactory solution as the imperial government and parliament gradually withdraw from legislative interference and from the exercise of patronage in colonial affair the office of governor tend to become in the most emphatic sense of the term the link which connect the mother-country and the colony and he influence the means by which harmony of action between the local and imperial authority be to be preserve it be not however in my humble judgment by evince a anxious desire to stretch to the utmost constitutional principle in he favor but on the contrary by the frank acceptance of the condition of the parliamentary system that this influence can be most surely extend and confirm place by he position above the strife of party -- hold office by a tenure less precarious than the minister who surround he -- have no political interest to serve but that of the community whose affair he be appoint to administer -- he opinion can not fail when all cause for suspicion and jealousy be remove to have great weight in the colonial council while he be set at liberty to constitute himself in a especial manner the patron of those larger and higher interest -- such interest for example as those of education and of moral and material progress in all its branch -- which unlike the contest of party unite instead of divide the member of the body politic the mention of such influence as a appreciable force in the administration of public affair may provoke a sneer on the part of person who have no faith in any appeal which be not address to the lowest motive of human conduct but those who have juster view of we common nature and who have see influence that be purely moral wield with judgment will not be dispose to deny to they a high degree of efficacy -lrb- sidenote : defense of the colony -rrb- closely akin to the question of the maintenance of the connection between the colony and great britain especially when view as affect by the commercial and financial condition of the former be the question of throw upon it the expense of defend itself a problem which be then only begin to attract the attention of liberal statesman for though it may be true that the practice of defend the colony with the troops and at the cost of the mother-country be a innovation upon the earlier colonial system introduce at the time of the great war it be not the less certain that to the generation of colonist that have grow up since that time the abandonment of it have all the effect of novelty it be a question on which as affect canada lord elgin be in a peculiar degree ` between two fire ' expose to pressure at once from the government at home and from he own minister and see much to agree with in the view of both -lrb- sidenote : against internal disorder -rrb- in the first place as regard the preservation of order within the province he think it clear that as a general rule the cost of this should fall on the colony itself wherever it enjoy self-government but there be peculiar circumstance in canada which make he hesitate to apply the doctrine unreservedly there owe to the contiguity of the united state the abettor of any mischief in the colony might count on help constantly at hand not indeed from the government of the union which never act disloyally -lrb- 6 -rrb- but from the unruly spirit that be apt to infest the border and it seem to he at least doubtful whether both justice and policy do not require that great britain should afford to the supporter of order some material aid to counterbalance this again the peculiar social and political state of lower canada arise mainly from the condition under which it have pass into the hand of england and from the manner in which england have fulfil those condition create special difficulty as to the maintenance of internal quiet on the one hand england 's respect for treaty obligation have induce she to resist all attempt to break down by fraud or violence those rights and usage of the french population which have tend to keep alive among they feeling of distinctive nationality while on the other hand the effect of the working of the old system of colonial administration have be to confer upon british or american settler a disproportionate share in the government of the province it follow that the french-canadian majority and the anglo - saxon minority be dwelling side by side in that section of the colony without to any sensible extent intermingling and under condition of equilibrium which could never have be establish but for the presence on the same scene of a directing and overrule power in this state of thing while confidently hope that a impartial adherence to the principle of constitutional government would by degree obliterate all national distinction he see reason to fear that the sudden withdrawal of britain 's moderate control whether as the result of separation or of a change of imperial policy would be follow at no distant period by a serious collision between the race -lrb- sidenote : against foreign attack -rrb- similarly as regard defense against foreign attack while agree that a self-governing colony should be self-dependent lord elgin feel that the peculiar position of canada have no foreign attack to apprehend except hi quarrel of england 's make make she case somewhat exceptional and any wholesale withdrawal of british troops he strongly deprecate as likely to imperil she connection with the mother-country if it take place suddenly before the old notion -- the ` axiom affirm again and again by secretary of state and governor that england be bind to pay all expense connect with the defense of the colony ' -- have lose its hold on man 's mind and a feeling of the responsibility attach to self - government have have time to grow up he first letter on the subject be to lord gray write so early as April 261848 : -- the question which you raise in you last letter respect the military defense of canada be a large one and before irrevocable step be take it may be well to look at it on all side the first consideration which offer itself in connection with this subject be this ` why do canada require to be defend and against whom ' a very large number of person in this community believe that there be only one power from which they have anything to dread and that this power would be convert into the fastest friend bone of they bone and flesh of they flesh if the connection with great britain be abandon in this respect the position of canada be peculiar when you say to any other colony ` england decline to be longer at the expense of protect you ' you at once reveal to it the extent of its dependence and the value of imperial support but it be not so here withdraw you protection from canada and she have it in she power to obtain the security against aggression enjoy by michigan or maine : about as good security i must allow as any which be to be obtain at the present time but you may observe in reply to this ` you can not get the security which michigan and maine enjoy for nothing you must purchase it by the surrender of you custom house and public land the proceeds of which will be divert from they present use and apply to other at the discretion of a body in which you will have comparatively little to say ' the argument be a powerful one so long as england consent to bear the cost of the defense of the colony but its force be much lessen when the inhabitant be tell that they must look to they own safety because the mother-country can no longer afford to take care of they on the other hand very weighty reason may be adduce in favor of the policy of require the province to bear some portion at least of the charge of its own protection the adoption of free-trade although its advocate must believe that it tend to make the colony in point of fact less chargeable than heretofore will doubtless render the english people more than ever jealous of expenditure incur on they behalf i be moreover of opinion that the system of relieve the colonist altogether from the duty of self-defence be attend with injurious effect upon themselves it check the growth of national and manly moral man seldom think anything worth preserve for which they be never ask to make a sacrifice my view therefore would be that it be desirable that a movement in the direction which you lave indicate should take place but that it ought to be make with much caution the present be not a favourable moment for experiment british statesman even secretary of state have get into the habit lately of talking of the maintenance of the connection between great britain and canada with so much indifference that a change of system in respect of military defense incautiously carry out might be presume by many to argue on the part of the mother-country a disposition to prepare the way for separation add to this that you effect only a few year ago a union between the upper and lower province by arbitrary means and for object the avowal of which have profoundly irritated the french population that still more recently you have deprive canada of she principal advantage in the british market that france and ireland be in flame and that nearly half of the population of this colony be french nearly half of the remainder irish that canada feel no need of bulwark except against england 's foe be a point on which he constantly insist on one occasion he write : -- only one absurdity can be greater pardon I for say so than the absurdity of suppose that the british parliament will pay # 200000 for canadian fortification it be the absurdity of suppose that canadian will pay it themselves # 200000 for defence and against whom against the american and who be the american you own kindred a flourish swaggering people who be ready to make room for you at they own table to give you a share of all they possess of all they prosperity and to guarantee you in all time to come against the risk of invasion or the need of defence if you will but speak the word -lrb- sidenote : recommend gradual reduction of force -rrb- on the whole he be of opinion that the government should quietly and _ san phrase _ remove they troops altogether from some point reduce they in other and ` aim at the eventual substitution of a major-general 's command for that of a lieutenant-general in canada but that nothing should be do hastily or _ per saltum _ so as to alarm the colonist with the idea that some new and strange principle be go to be apply to they ' you may if you please -lrb- he write -rrb- largely reduce the staff and more moderately the man leave the remainder in the best barracks i think you may do this without in any material degree increase the tendency towards annexation provide always that you make no noise about it but i repeat it you must not unless you wish to drive the colony away from you impose new burden upon the colonist at this time -lrb- 7 -rrb- the course thus sketch out he himself steadily pursue and he last letter on the subject write early in 1853 to the duke of newcastle who have recently become secretary for the colony be occupy in recommend a continuance of the same quietly progressive policy : when i come here we have a commander-in-chief and two major-general we have now only one general on the station and the staff have undergo proportional diminution if further reduction be to be make let they be effect in the same quiet way without parade or the ostentatious adoption of new principle as applicable to the defense of colony which be expose as canada be by reason of they connection with great britain to the hazard of assault from organised power continue then if you will pardon I for so freely tender advice to apply in the administration of we local affair the principle of constitutional government frankly and fairly do not ask england to make unreasonable sacrifice for the colonist but such sacrifice as be reasonable on the hypothesis that the colony be a expose part of the empire induce she if you can to make they generously and without appear to grudge they let it be infer from you language that there be in you opinion nothing in the nature of thing to prevent the tie which connect the mother-country and the colony from be as endure as that which unite the different state of the union and nothing in the nature of we very elastic institution to prevent they from expand so as to permit the free and healthy development of social political and national life in these young community by administer colonial affaire in this spirit you will find i believe even when you least profess to seek it the true secret of the cheap defense of nation if these community be only truly attach to the connection and satisfied of its permanence -lrb- and as respects the latter point opinion here will be much influence by the tone of statesman at home -rrb- element of self-defence not moral element only but

mutual courtesy -- farewell to canada -- at home -lrb- sidenote : the ` clergy reserve ' -rrb- we have have frequent occasion to observe that the guide principle of lord elgin 's policy be to let the colony have its own way in everything which be not contrary either to public morality or to some imperial interest it be in this spirit that he pass the rebellion loss act and in this spirit he watch the contest which rage for many year on the memorable question of the ` clergy reserve ' -lrb- sidenote : history of the question -rrb- by the canada act of 1791 one-seventh of the land then ungrant have be set apart for the support of a ` protestant clergy ' at first these reserve be regard as the exclusive property of the church of england but in 1820 a opinion be obtain from the law officer of the crown in england that the clergy of the church of scotland have a right to a share in they but not dissent minister in 1840 a act be pass in which the claim of other denomination also be distinctly recognize by it the governor be empower to sell the reserve a part of the proceeds be to be apply in payment of the salary of the exist clergy to whom the faith of the crown have be pledge one-half of the remainder be to go to the church of england and scotland in proportion to they respective number and the other half be to be at the disposal of the governor - general for the benefit of the clergy of any protestant denomination willing to receive public aid but the old inveterate jealousy of anglican ascendency aggravate it be say by the political conduct of bishop strachan who have identify he church with the obnoxious rule of the family compact be not content with these concession ally itself with the voluntary spirit catch from the scottish free church movement in 1843 it take the shape of a fanatical opposition to everything in the nature of a public provision for the support of religion and the cry be raise for the ` secularisation of the clergy reserve ' eagerly take up as be natural by the ultra-radical or ` clear-grits ' the cry be echo by a considerable section of the old tory party from motive which it be less easy to analyze and so violent be the feeling that it threaten to sweep away at one stroke all the endowment in question without regard to vested interest and without even wait for the repeal of the imperial act by which these endowment be guarantee more loyal and moderate counsel however prevail owe chiefly to the support which they receive from the roman catholic of lower canada at one time so violently disaffected in 1850 the assembly vote a address to the queen pray that the act refer to might be repeal and that the local legislature might be empower to dispose of the reserved land subject to the condition of secure to the exist holder for they life the stipend to which they be then entitle to this address a favourable answer be return by lord gray who while avow the preference of she majesty 's government for the exist arrangement by which a certain portion of the public land of canada be apply to religious use admit at the same time that the question of maintain it be one so exclusively affect the people of canada that its decision ought not to be withdraw from the provincial legislature a bill for grant to the colony the desire power be intend to be introduce into parliament during the session of 1851 but owe to the pressure of other business it be defer to the next year it be to have be bring forward in a few day when the break-up of lord john russell 's ministry cause it to be again postpone and it be not till may 9 1853 that the long looked-for act receive the queen 's assent no action could be take in the matter by the colonial parliament for that year as its session close on June 14 and when it meet again next year a ministerial crisis follow by a dissolution and a change of minister cause a postponement of all legislation finally on October 17 1854 a bill for the ` secularisation of the clergy reserve ' be introduce into the assembly the more moderate and thoughtful man of every party be say to have be at heart oppose to it but it be impossible for they to stand against the current of popular feel the bill speedily become law the clergy reserve be hand over to the various municipal corporation for secular use and though by this mean ' a noble provision make for the sustentation of religion be fritter away so as to produce but few beneficial result ' -lrb- 1 -rrb- a question which have long be the occasion of much heart-burning be at least settle and settle for ever a slender provision for the future be save out of the wreck by the commutation of the reserved life-interest of incumbent which lay the foundation of a small permanent endowment but with this exception the equality of destitution among all protestant community be complete -lrb- 2 -rrb- the various stage through which this question pass may be trace in the follow letter of which the first be write to lord gray on July 5 1850 : two address to the queen be vote by the assembly a few day ago and bring up by the house to I for transmission the one be a address very loyal in its tone deprecate all revolutionary change -lrb- sidenote : address to the queen -rrb- the other address be not so satisfactory it pray she majesty to obtain the repeal of the imperial act on the clergy reserve pass in 1840 and to hand they over to the canadian parliament to deal with they as it may see fit -- guarantee however the life interest of incumbent the resolution on which this address be found be introduce by a member of the government which have treat the question as a _ open _ one you be sufficiently acquaint with canadian history to be aware of the fact that these unfortunate clergy reserve have be a bone of contention ever since they be set apart i know how very inconvenient it be to repeal the imperial act which be intend to be a final settlement of the question but i must candidly say i very much doubt whether you will be able to preserve the colony if you retain it on the statute book even lafontaine and other who recognize certain vested rights of the protestant church under the constitutional act advocate the repeal of the imperial act of 1840 : partly because lower canada be not consult at all when it be pass and secondly because the distribution make under that act be a unfair one and inconsistent with the view of the upper canadian legislature as express at the time but set aside in deference as it be allege to the remonstrance of the english bishop some among the anglo-saxon liberal and some of the orange tory i suspect share these view a considerable section be for appropriate the proceeds of the reserve at once and apply they to education without any regard to the rights either of individual or of church these person be furious with the supporter of the address for propose to preserve the life interest of incumbent the sentiment of the remainder be pretty accurately convey by the term of the address \* \* \* \* \* _ to the earl gray _ toronto July 19 1850 -lrb- sidenote : reason for agree -rrb- the ` clear grit ' organ which have absorb a large portion of the ` annexationist ' talk very big about what they will do if england step in to preserve the ` clergy reserve ' that party would be only too glad to get up a quarrel with england on such a point it be of course impossible for you to do anything with the imperial act till next session a little delay may perhaps enable we to see we way more clearly with respect to this most perplexing subject lord sydenham 's despatch of January 221840 be a curious and instructive one it accompany the act on the ` clergy reserve ' question which he induce the parliament of upper canada to pass but which be not adopt at home for the house of lord concoct one more favourable to the established church he clearly admit that the act be against the sense of the country and that nothing but he own great personal influence get it through and yet he look upon it as a settlement of the question i confess i see few of the condition of finality in measure which be pass under such circumstance \* \* \* \* \* _ to the earl gray _ toronto march 181851 i be far from think that the ` clergy reserve ' will necessarily be divert from religious purpose if the local parliament have the disposal of they i should feel very confident that this would not be the case be it not that the tone adopt by the church of england here have almost always the effect of drive from she even those who would be most disposed to cooperate with she if she would allow they \* \* \* \* \* _ to the earl gray _ toronto June 141851 on the whole the best chance for the church interest as regard the question in my judgment be that you should carry you empower bill through the imperial parliament this session and that we should get through we session and the general election which be about to follow with as little excitement as possible the province be prosperous and the people contented and at such a time if no disturbing cause arise moderate and reasonable man be likely to be return at the same time the ` clergy reserve ' question be sufficiently before the public to insure we get from the return to parliament a pretty fair indication of what be the real sentiment of the people upon it i need not say that there can be no security for the permanence of any arrangement which be not in tolerable conformity with those sentiment \* \* \* \* \* _ to the earl gray _ July 121851 -lrb- sidenote : movement not prompt by roman catholic -rrb- as to the insinuation that the movement against the endowment of the church of england be prompt by the roman event will give the lie to it ere long the follow fact however seem to be wholly irreconcilable with this hypothesis before the union of the province there be very few if any roman catholic member in the upper canada parliament they be all-powerful in the lower now it be record in history that the upper canadian legislative assembly keep up year after year a series of assault on the ` clergy reserve ' in proof of which read the narrative part of the address to she majesty on the ` clergy reserve ' from the legislative assembly last year and it be equally a fact that the lower canadian legislative assembly never meddle with they except i think once when they be invite to do so by the government some month later in the beginning of 1852 lord john russell 's administration be break up and lord gray handed over the seal of the colonial office to sir john pakington one of the first subject on which the new secretary ask to be furnish with confidential information be as to the state of public feeling in canada upon the question of the future disposal of the ` clergy reserve ' lord elgin reply as follow : -lrb- sidenote : feeling in the province -rrb- you require if i rightly understand you letter that i should state in the first place whether i believe that the sentiment of the community in reference to the subject-matter of this address be faithfully represent in the vote of the assembly i can not answer this question otherwise than affirmatively not that i be by any means dispose to under-rate the importance of the petition which may have be send home by opponent of the measure the clergy of the church of england and of that portion of the presbyterian church which preserve its connection with the established church of scotland be generally unwilling that the question of the reserve should be leave to the decision of the local legislature they be to a considerable extent support by they flock when they approach the throne as petitioner against the prayer of the assembly 's address although it be no doubt a error to suppose that the lay member of these communion be unanimous or all alike zealous in the espousal of these view from this quarter the petition which appear to have reach lord gray and yourself have i apprehend almost exclusively proceed other body even of those which participate in the produce of the reserve as for example the wesleyan and the roman catholic of upper canada have not that i be aware of move in the matter unless it be in a opposite direction -lrb- sidenote : in upper canada -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : in lower canada -rrb- can it then be infer from such indication that public opinion in the province do not support the cause take by the assembly in reference to the ` clergy reserve ' or what be perhaps more to the purpose that a provincial administration form on the principle of desist from all attempt to induce the imperial government to repeal the imperial statute on this subject would be sustained i be unable i confess to bring myself to entertain any such expectation it be my opinion that if the liberal be to rally out of office on the cry that they be assert the right of the provincial government to deal with the question of the ` clergy reserve ' against a government willing at the bidding of the imperial authority to abandon this claim they would triumph in upper canada more decisively than they do at the late general election i need hardly add that if after a resistance follow by such a triumph the imperial government be to give way it would be more than ever difficult to obtain from the victorious party a reasonable consideration for church interest these remark apply to upper canada it be not so easy to foresee what be likely to be the course of event in lower canada the party which look to m papineou as its leader adopt on all point the most ultra-democratic creed it profess no very warm attachment to the endowment of the roman catholic church and be of course not likely to prove itself more tender with respect to property set apart by royal authority for the support of protestantism the french - canadian representative who do not belong to this party be i believe generally disincline to secularisation and would be bring to consent to any such proposition if at all only by the pressure of some suppose political necessity they be however almost without exception commit to the principle that the ` clergy reserve ' ought to be subject to the control of the local legislature while the battle be wage on this ground therefore they will probably continue to side with the upper canada liberal unless the latter contrive to alienate they by some act of extravagance i be aware that there lie beyond the subject of which i have treat larger consideration of public policy affect this question on which i have not venture to touch on the one hand there be person who contend that as the ` clergy reserve ' be set apart by a british sovereign for religious use it be the bounden duty of the imperial authority to maintain at all hazard the disposition thus make of they this view be hardly i think reconcilable with the provision of the statute of 1791 but if it be correct it render all discussion of subordinate topic and point of mere expediency superfluous -lrb- sidenote : in the church -rrb- on the other hand even among the most attach friend of the church some be to be find who doubt whether on the whole the church have gain from the reserve as much as she have lose by they -- whether the ill-will which they have engender and the bar which they have prove to private munificence and voluntary exertion have not more than counter-balanced the benefit which they may have confer and who look to secularisation as the only settlement that will be final and put a end to strife up to this time lord elgin appear to have entertain at least a hope that if the colony be leave to itself it would settle the matter by distribute the reserved fund accord to some equitable proportion among the clergy of all denomination but as time go on this hope become fainter and fainter in he next letter he recount a conversation with a person -lrb- not name -rrb- ` of much intelligence and well acquaint with upper canada ' not a member of the church of england but favourable to the maintenance of a endowment for religious purpose who after remark on the infatuation show by the friend of the church in 1840 express a decide opinion that the vantage ground then so heedlessly sacrifice be lose for ever so far as colonial sentiment be concerned and that ` neither the present nor any future canadian parliament would be induce to enact a law for perpetuate the endowment in any shape ' the increase likelihood however of a result which he regard as in itself undesirable could not abate he desire to see the matter finally settle or shake he conviction that the provincial parliament be the proper power to settle it with he correspondent it be not so nor can it be wonder at that the organ of a tory government should have decline to accede to the prayer of a address which could hardly have any other issue than secularisation but the decision be not destine to be leave in the hand of the tory before the end of 1852 lord derby be replace by lord aberdeen and sir j pakington by lord elgin 's old friend the duke of newcastle who see at once the necessity of concede to the canadian parliament the power of settle the question after its own fashion accordingly on may 21 1853 lord elgin be able to write to he as follow : -lrb- sidenote : empower bill pass -rrb- i be certainly not a little surprised by the success with which you carry the clergy reserve bill through the house of lord i be assure that this result be mainly due to you own personal exertion i be quite confident that both in what you have do and in the way you have do it you have best consult the interest of the province the church and the empire i trust that what have happen will have here the favourable moral effect which you anticipate it can not fail to have this tendency as respects the measure which will be ultimately adopt on this vexed subject i do not yet venture to write with confidence if the representation of the bishop of toronto as to the feeling which exist among the great protestant denomination on the question be correct there could be no doubt whatsoever in regard to the issue for you may depend upon it the roman catholic have no wish to touch the protestant endowment although when they be force into the controversy they will contend that it do not rest on the same basis as they own but i confess that i place no reliance whatsoever on these calculation and representation almost the greatest evil which result from the delegation to the imperial parliament of the duty of legislating on colonial question of this class be the scope which the system afford to exaggeration and mystification party do not meet in fair conflict on they own ground where they can soon gain a knowledge of they relative strength and learn to respect each other accordingly they shroud themselves in mystery and rely for victory on they success in outdo each other in hard swearing many man partly from good nature and partly from political motive will sign a petition spice and pepper to tickle the palate of the house of lord who will not move a yard or sacrifice a shilling on behalf of the object petition for i much fear that it will be find that there be much division of opinion even among member of the laity of the church with respect to the propriety of maintain the ` clergy reserve ' and that even as regard a certain section of the clergy owe to dissatisfaction with the distribution of the fund and with the condition of dependence in which the missionary be keep there be greater lukewarmness on the subject than the fervent representation you have receive would lead you to imagine meanwhile there be a very good feeling in the province -- a great absence of party violence you course have tend to confirm these favourable symptom we must prevent anything be do during this session of the provincial parliament to commit party with respect to the ` clergy reserve ' and as respects the future we must hope for the best -lrb- sidenote : the reserve secularise -rrb- the result have be already state the ` clergy reserve ' be secularise contrary no doubt to the individual wish of lord elgin but the general principle of colonial self-government have signally triumph and its victory more than outweigh to he the loss of any particular cause one other measure remain to be notice on which lord elgin have the satisfaction of induce the home government to yield to the wish of the colony viz the reform of the provincial parliament -lrb- sidenote : reform of the provincial parliament -rrb- by the constitution of 1840 the legislative power be divide between two chamber : a council consist of twenty person who be nominate by the governor and hold they seat for life and a house of assembly whose eighty-four member be elect in equal proportion from the two section of the province as the population of the colony grow -- and between 1840 and 1853 it nearly double itself -- it be natural that the number of legislator should be increase and there be other reason which make a increase desirable -lrb- sidenote : increase of representation -rrb- the legislative assembly -lrb- write lord elgin early in 1853 -rrb- be now engage on a measure introduce by the government for increase the representation of the province i consider the object of the measure a very important one for with so small a body as eighty member when party be nearly balanced individual vote become too precious which lead to mischief i have not experience this evil to any great extent since i have have a liberal administration which have always be strong in the assembly but with my first administration i feel it severely to this change no serious opposition be offer either in the colony or in the imperial parliament and the member of the two house be raise to one hundred and thirty and seventy-two respectively it be otherwise however with the proposal to make the upper house elective a measure certainly alien to english idea but one which lord elgin appear to have think necessary for the healthy working of the constitution under the circumstance then exist in the province as early as march 1850 he write to lord gray : -- -lrb- sidenote : proposal to make the upper house elective -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : reason in favor -rrb- a great deal be say here at present about render we second branch of the legislature elective as the advocate of the plan however comprise two class of person with view not only distinct but contradictory it be difficult to foresee how they be to agree on detail when it assume a practical shape the one class desire to construct a more efficient conservative body than the present council the other seek a instrument to aid they in they scheme of subversion and pillage for my own part i believe that a second legislative body return by the same constituency as the house of assembly under some difference with respect to time and mode of election would be a greater check on ill-considered legislation than the council as it be now constitute baldwin be very unwilling to move in this matter have get what he imagine to be the likest thing to the british constitution he can obtain he be satisfied and averse to further change in this instance i can not but think that he mistake the shadow for the substance i admire however the perseverance with which he proclaim ' _ il faut jeter l'ancre de la constitution _ ' in reply to proposal of organic change though i fully expect that like those who raise this cry in 1791 he will yet if he live find himself and he state-ship flounder among rock and shoal towards which he never expect to steer three year later he hold the same language to the duke of newcastle write on march 26 1853 to inform he that the bill for increase the representation have be carry in the assembly by a large majority he add : -- the lord must be attend to in the next place the position of the second chamber in we body politic be at present wholly unsatisfactory the principle of election must be introduce in order to give to it the influence which it ought to possess and that principle must be so apply as to admit of the working of parliamentary government -lrb- which i for one be certainly not prepare to abandon for the american system -rrb- with two elective chamber i have make some suggestion with this view which i hope to be able to induce the legislature to adopt when we two legislative body shall have be place on this improve foot a greater stability will have be impart to we constitution and a greater strength i believe if england act wisely to the connection -lrb- sidenote : the act pass -rrb- the question do not come before the british parliament till the summer of 1854 after lord elgin 's visit to england during which he have a opportunity of state he view personally to the government at he instance they bring in a bill to enable the colonial legislature to deal with the subject and the measure be carry with few dissentient although vehemently denounce by lord derby in the house of lord the principle of colonial policy which lord durham have express so powerfully in 1888 and on which lord gray and lord elgin have be act so consistently for many year have at last prevail and many of those who most deprecate the propose reform as a downward step towards pure democracy yet acknowledge that as it have be determine upon by the deliberate choice of the colony it ought not to be thwart by the interference of the mother-country -lrb- sidenote : speech of lord derby -rrb- in the course of the speech above refer to lord derby make use of the follow eloquent word : -- i have dream -- perhaps it be only a dream -- that the time would come when exercise a perfect control over they own internal affair parliament abandon its right to interfere in they legislation these great and important colony combine together should form a monarchical government preside over either by a permanent viceroy or as a independent sovereign by one nearly and closely ally to the present royal family of this country i have believe that in such a manner it would be possible to uphold the monarchical principle to establish upon that great continent a monarchy free as that of this country even freer still with regard to the popular influence exercise but yet a monarchy worthy of the name and not a mere empty shadow i can hardly believe that under such a system the friendly connection and close intimacy between the colony and the mother-country would in any way be affect but on the contrary i feel convinced that the change to which i have refer would be productive of nothing for year and year to come but mutual harmony and friendship increase and cement as that friendship would be by mutual appreciation of the great and substantial benefit confer by a free and regulated monarchy but pass this bill and that dream be go for ever nothing like a free and regulated monarchy could exist for a single moment under such a constitution as that which be now propose for canada from the moment that you pass this constitution the progress must be rapidly towards republicanism if anything could be more really republican than this bill the dream have be realize at least in one of its most important feature the gloomy foreboding have hitherto happily prove groundless but the speaker of these word and the author of the measure to which they refer would probably have be alike surprise at the course which event have take respect the particular point then in question for once the stream that set towards democracy have be see to take a backward direction and the constitution of the dominion of canada have return as regard the legislative council to the conservative principle of nomination by the crown \* \* \* \* \* it do not fall within the scope of this memoir to give a account of the numerous administrative measure which make the period of lord elgin 's government so mark a epoch in the history of canadian prosperity it may be well however to notice a few point to which he himself think it worth while to advert in official despatch write towards the close of he sojourn in the country and contain a statistical review of the marvellously rapid progress which the colony have make in all branch of productive industry the first extract bear upon question which have lose none of they interest or importance -- the kindred question of emigration of the demand for labor and of the acquisition and tenure of land -lrb- sidenote : emigration -rrb- the suffering of the irish during that calamitous period -lrb- 1847 -rrb- induce philanthropic person to put forward scheme of systematic colonisation base in some instance on the assumption that it be for the interest of the emigrant that they should be as much as possible concentrated in particular portion of the territory to which they might proceed so as to form community complete in themselves and to remain subject to the influence religious and social under which they have live previously to emigration it be propose if i rightly remember accord to one of those scheme that large number of irish with they priest and home association should be establish by government in some unoccupied part of canada i believe that such scheme however benevolent they design rest on a complete misconception of what be for the interest both of the colony and of the emigrant it be almost invariably find that emigrant who thus isolate themselves whatever they origin or antecedent lag behind they neighbor and i be incline to think that as a general rule in the case of community whose social and political organization be as far advance as that of the north american colony it be for the interest of all party that new comer instead of dwelling apart and bind together by the affinity whether of sect or party which unite they in the country which they have leave should be disperse as widely as possible among the population already establish in that to which they transfer themselves it may not be altogether irrelevant to mention as bear on this subject that the painful circumstance which attend the emigration of 1847 create for a time in this province a certain prejudice against emigration generally the poll tax on emigrant be increase and the opinion widely disseminate that however desirable the introduction of capitalist might be a emigration of person of the poorer class be likely to prove a burden rather than a benefit commercial depression and apprehension as to the probable effect of the free-trade policy of great britain on the prosperity of the colony have a influence in the same direction to counteract these tendency which be calculate as i think to be injurious in the long run both to the mother-country and the province public attention be especially direct in the speech deliver from the throne in 1849 to emigration by way of the st lawrence as a branch of trade which it be most desirable to cultivate -lrb- irrespective altogether of its bearing on the settlement of the country -rrb- in consequence of the great excess of export over import by that route and the consequent enhancement of freight outwards these view obtain very general assent and the measure which have be adopt since that period to render this route attractive to emigrant destine for the west -lrb- the effect of which be begin now to be visible in the yearly increase amount of emigration by way of quebec from the continent of europe -rrb- be calculate not only to promote the trade of the province but also to make settler of a superior class acquaint with its advantage -lrb- 3 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : ottawa valley -rrb- this important region -lrb- the valley of the ottawa -rrb- take the name by which it be designate in popular parlance from the mighty stream which flow through it and which though it be but a tributary of the st lawrence be one of the largest of the river that run uninterruptedly from the source to the discharge within the dominion of the queen it drain a area of about 80000 square mile and receive at various point in its course the water of stream some of which equal in magnitude the chief river of great britain these stream open up to the enterprise of the lumberman the almost inexhaustible pine forest with which this region be clothe and afford the means of transport they produce to market in improve these natural advantage considerable sum be expend by private individual # 50000 currency be vote by parliament last session for the purpose of remove certain obstacle to the navigation of the upper ottawa by the construction of a canal at a point which be now obstruct by rapid -lrb- sidenote : demand for labor -rrb- from the nature of the business the lumber trade fall necessarily in a great measure into the hand of person of capital who employ large body of man at point far remove from market and who be therefore call upon to make considerable advance in provide food and necessaries for they labourer as well as in building slide and otherwise facilitate the passage of timber along the stream and river many thousand of man be employ during the winter in these remote forest prepare the timber which be transport during the summer in raft or if sawn in boat to quebec when destine for england and up the richelieu river when intend for the united state it be a most interesting fact both in a moral and hygienic view that for some year past intoxicate liquor have be rigorously exclude from almost all the chantier as the dwelling of the lumberman in these distant region be style and that notwithstanding the exposure of the man to cold during the winter and wet in the spring the result of the experiment have be entirely satisfactory the bearing of the lumbering business on the settlement of the country be a point well worthy of notice the farmer who undertake to cultivate unreclaimed land in new country generally find that not only do every step of advance which he make in the wilderness by remove he from the centre of trade and civilisation enhance the cost of all he have to purchase but that moreover it diminish the value of what he have to sell it be not so however with the farmer who follow in the wake of the lumberman he find on the contrary in the want of the latter a ready demand for all that he produce at a price not only equal to that procurable in the ordinary mart but increase by the cost of transport from they to the scene of the lumbering operation this circumstance no doubt powerfully contribute to promote the settlement of those district and attract population to section of the country which in the absence of any such inducement would probably remain for long period uninhabited -lrb- 4 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : wild land -rrb- the large amount of wild land hold by individual and corporation render the disposal of the public domain a question of less urgency in this than in some other colony opinion in the province run strongly in favor of facilitate its acquisition in small lot by actual settler and of put all possible obstacle in the way of its fall into the hand of speculator this opinion be found no doubt in part on a jealousy of great landholder but it be mainly i apprehend attributable to a sense of the inconvenience and damage which be experience in young country when considerable tract of land be keep out of the market in the midst of district that be in course of settlement to this feeling much of the hostility to the ` clergy reserve ' be originally due the upset price of government wild land in canada vary from 7_s _ 6_d _ currency to 1_s _ currency a acre accord to quality and by the rule of the crown land department now in force it be concede at these rate except in special case in lot of not more than 200 acre on condition of actual settlement of erect a dwelling-house and clearing one-fourth of the lot before the patent can be obtain the price be payable in some part of the country in ten yearly instalment in other in five with interest in both case from the date of sale i have little faith in the efficacy of such device to compel actual settlement they hinder the free circulation of capital be easily evade and seem to be especially out of place where wild land be subject to taxation for municipal purpose as be the case in upper canada -lrb- 5 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : seigniorial tenure -rrb- a good deal of land in lower canada be hold in seigniory under a species of feudal tenure with respect to the condition of which a controversy have arise which threaten unless some equitable mode of adjust it be speedily devise to be productive of very serious consequence a certain class of jurist contend that by the custom of the country establish before its conquest by great britain the seignior be bind to concede they land in lot of about 100 acre to the first applicant in consideration of the payment of certain due and of a rent which never as they allege exceed one penny a acre and they quote edict of the french monarch to show that the governor and intendant when the seignior be contumacious could seize the land and make the concession in spite of he take the rent for the crown the seignior on the other hand plead the decision of the court since the conquest in vindication of they claim to receive such rent as they can bargain for independently of this controversy the incident of the tenure be in other respects calculate to exercise a unfavourable influence on the progress of the province and its abolition if it could be effect without injustice would no doubt be a highly beneficial measure -lrb- 6 -rrb- still more important and interesting at this time be the follow sketch of the educational system of upper canada the ` common school ' and ` public school library ' which have attract so much the attention of we own educationist nor be it uninstructive to note the contrast between what have be achieve in the colony nearly twenty year ago and the still unsettled condition of similar question in the mother-country : a contrast which may perhaps call to mind the remark of lord elgin already quote as to the rapid growth which ensue when the seed that fall from ancient experience be drop into a virgin soil -lrb- 7 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : education -rrb- in 1847 the normal school which may be consider the foundation of the system be institute and at the close of 1853 the first volume issue from the educational department to the public school library which be its crown and completion the term school library do not imply that the library in question be specially design for the benefit of common school pupil they be in point of fact public library intend for the use of the general population and they be entitle school library because they establishment have be provide for in the school act and they management confide to the school authority -lrb- sidenote : public school library -rrb- public school library then similar to those which be now be introduce into canada have be in operation for several year in some state of the neighbouring union and many of the most valuable feature of the canadian system have be borrow from they in most of the state however which have appropriate fund for library purpose the selection of the book have be leave to the trustee appoint by the different district many of whom be ill-qualified for the task and the consequence have be that the travel pedlar who offer the most showy book at the lowest price have have the principal share in furnish the library in introduce the system into canada precaution have be take which will i trust have the effect of obviate this great evil in the school act of 1850 which first set apart a sum of money for the establishment and support of school library it be declare to be the duty of the chief superintendent of education to apportion the sum grant for this purpose by the legislature under the follow condition : ` that no aid should be give towards the establishment and support of any school library unless a equal amount be contribute or expend from local source for the same ' and the council of instruction be require to examine and at its discretion recommend or disapprove of text book for the use of school or book for school library ` provide that no portion of the legislative school grant shall be apply in aid of any school in which any book be use that have be disapprove of by the council and public notice give of such disapproval ' -lrb- sidenote : common school -rrb- the system of public instruction in upper canada be engraft upon the municipal institution of the province to which a organization very complete in its detail and admirably adapt to develop the resource confirm the credit and promote the moral and social interest of a young country be impart by a act pass in 1849 the law by which the common school be regulate be enact in 1850 and it embrace all the modification and improvement suggest by experience in the provision of the several school act pass subsequently to 1841 when the important principle of grant money to each county on condition that a equal amount be raise within it by local assessment be first introduce into the statute-book -lrb- sidenote : local superintendence -rrb- the development of individual self-reliance and local exertion under the superintendence of a central authority exercise a influence almost exclusively moral be the ruling principle of the system accordingly it rest with the freeholder and householder of each school section to decide whether they will support they school by voluntary subscription by rate bill for each pupil attend the school -lrb- which must not however exceed 1_s _ per month -rrb- or by rate on property the trustee elect by the same freeholder and householder be require to determine the amount to be raise within they respective school section for all school purpose whatsoever to hire teacher from among person hold legal certificate of qualification and to agree with they as to salary on the local superintendent appoint by the county council be devolve the duty of apportion the legislative grant among the school section within the county of inspect the school and report upon they to the chief superintendent the county board of public instruction compose of the local superintendent or superintendent and the trustee of the county grammar school examine candidate for the office of teacher and give certificate of qualification which be valid for the county the chief superintendent give certificate to normal school pupil which be valid for the province while the chief superintendent who hold he appointment from the crown aid in specify case by the council of public instruction have under he especial charge the normal and model school besides exercise a general control over the whole system the question of religious instruction as connect with the common school system present even more than ordinary difficulty in a community where there be so much diversity of opinion on religious subject and where all denomination be in the eye of the law on a footing of entire equality it be lay down as a fundamental principle that as the common school be not board but day school and as the pupil be under the care of they parent or guardian during the Sunday and a considerable portion of each week day it be not intend that the function of the common school teacher should supersede those of the parent and pastor of the child accordingly the law contents itself with provide on this head ` that in any model or common school establish under this act no child shall be require to read or study in or from any religious book or to join in any exercise of devotion or religion which shall be object to by he or she parent or guardian provide always that within this limitation pupil shall be allow to receive such religious instruction as they parent or guardian shall desire accord to the general regulation which shall be provide accord to law ' and it authorise under certain regulation the establishment of a separate school for protestant or roman catholic as the case may be when the teacher of the common school be of the opposite persuasion clergyman recognize by law of whatever denomination be make _ ex officio _ visitor of the school in township city town or village where they reside or have pastoral charge the chief superintendent dr ryerson remark on this head : -lrb- sidenote : the clergy -rrb- ` the clergy of the county have access to each of its school and we know of no instance in which the school have be make the place of religious discord but many instance especially on occasion of quarterly public examination in which the school have witness the assemblage and friendly intercourse of clergy of various religious persuasion and thus become the radiate center of a spirit of christian charity and potent cooperation in the primary work of a people 's civilisation and happiness ' he add with reference to the subject generally ` the more carefully the question of religion in connection with a system of common school be examine the more clearly i think it will appear that it have be leave where it properly belong -- with the local school municipality parent and manager of school the government protect the right of each parent and child but beyond this and beyond the principle and duty of morality common to all class neither compelling nor prohibit recognize the duty of pastor and parent as well as of school trustee and teacher and consider the unite labor of all as constitute the system of education for the youth of the country ' lord elgin himself have always show a profound sense of the importance of thus make religion the groundwork of education speaking on occasion of the opening of a normal school after notice the zealous and wisely - direct exertion which have ` enable upper canada to place itself in the van among the nation in the great and important work of provide a efficient system of general education for the whole community ' he proceed : -- -lrb- sidenote : what be education -rrb- and now let I ask this intelligent audience who have so kindly listen to I up to this moment -- let I ask they to consider in all seriousness and earnestness what that great work really be i do not think that i shall be chargeable with exaggeration when i affirm that it be _ the _ work of we day and generation that it be _ the _ problem in we modern society which be most difficult of solution that it be the ground upon which earnest and zealous man unhappily too often and in too many country meet not to co-operate but to wrangle while the poor and the ignorant multitude around they be starve and perish for lack of knowledge well then how have upper canada address herself to the execution of this great work how have she seek to solve this problem -- to overcome this difficulty sir i understand from you statement -- and i come to the same conclusion from my own investigation and observation -- that it be the principle of we common school educational system that its foundation be lay deep in the firm rock of we common christianity i understand sir that while the vary view and opinion of a mixed religious society be scrupulously respect while every semblance of dictation be carefully avoid it be desire it be earnestly recommend it be confidently expect and hope that every child who attend we common school shall learn there that he be a be who have a interest in eternity as well as in time that he have a father towards whom he stand in a closer and more affect and more endearing relationship than to any earthly father and that father be in heaven that he have a hope far transcend every earthly hope -- a hope full of immortality -- the hope namely that that father 's kingdom may come that he have a duty which like the sun in we celestial system stand in the center of he moral obligation shed upon they a hallow light which they in they turn reflect and absorb -- the duty of strive to prove by he life and conversation the sincerity of he prayer that that father 's will may be do upon earth as it be do in heaven i understand sir that upon the broad and solid platform which be raise upon that good foundation we invite the minister of religion of all denomination -- the _ de facto _ spiritual guide of the people of the country -- to take they stand along with we that so far from hamper or impede they in the exercise of they sacred function we ask and we beg they to take the child -- the lamb of the flock which be commit to they care -- aside and to lead they to those pasture and stream where they will find as they believe the food of life and the water of consolation one more extract must be give from the despatch already quote because it illustrate a feature in he character to which the subsequent course of he life give such marked prominence -- he generous and tender feeling of what be due to subject or inferior race a sad feeling in this case and but faintly support by any hope of be able to do anything for they benefit -lrb- sidenote : aboriginal tribe -rrb- it be painful to turn from review the progress of the european population and they descendant establish in this portion of america to contemplate the condition and prospects of the aboriginal tribe it can not i fear be affirm with truth that the difficult problem of reconcile the interest of a inferior and native race with those of a intrusive and superior one have as yet be satisfactorily solve on this continent in the united state the course of proceed generally follow in this matter have be that of compelling the red man through the influence of persuasion or force to make way for the white by retreat farther and farther into the wilderness a mode of deal with the case which necessarily entail the occasional adoption of harsh measure and which cease to be practicable when civilisation approach the limit of the territory to be occupy in canada the tribe have be permit to dwell among the scene of they early association and tradition on land reserve from the advance tide of white settlement and set apart for they use but this system though more lenient in its operation than the other

they in a condition of perpetual pupillage and the relation subsist between they and the government which treat they partly as independent people and partly as infant under its guardianship involve many anomaly and contradiction unless there be some reasonable ground for the hope that they will be eventually absorb in the general population of the country the canadian system be probably destine in the long run to prove as disastrous to they as that of the united state in 1846 and 1847 the attempt be first make to establish among they industrial board school in part support by contribution from they own fund if school of this description be properly conduct it may i think be expect that among the youth train at they a certain proportion at least will be so far civilised as to be capable of make they way in life without exceptional privilege or restraint it would be i be incline to believe expedient that any indian show this capacity should be permit after sufficient trial to receive from the common property of the tribe of which he be a member -lrb- on the understanding of course that neither he nor he descendant have thenceforward any claim upon it -rrb- a sum equivalent to he

if it be judiciously carry out \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- sidenote : relation with the united state -rrb- no sketch of a governor 's life in canada would be complete which do not contain some account of he relation with the great neighbouring republic we have see that at the beginning of he government lord elgin 's care be increase by threat and more than threat of interference on the part of ` sympathiser ' from some of the american state and that he look upon the likelihood of lawless inroad not to speak of the possibility of lawful war as afford solid reason for england 's maintain a body of troops in the colony but it must not be suppose that he attitude towards the government or people of the state be one of jealousy or hostility the loyal friendliness of the government in repress the intemperate sympathy of certain of its citizen he cordially acknowledge and with the people he do he utmost to encourage the freest and friendliest intercourse social and commercial not only in order that the inhabitant of the two country might provoke one another to increase activity in the good work of civilisation but also that they might know and understand one another and that he might

democratic party and hold some year ago very different view from those which they express on this visit they find here the warmest and most cordial welcome from all she majesty 's representative not excepted but they see i venture to say almost with certainty nothing to lead they to suppose that the canadian desire to change they political condition on the contrary the mention of she majesty 's name evoke on all occasion the most unbounded enthusiasm and there be every appearance of a kindly feel towards the governor general which the american seem not disincline themselves to share ` to

believe we have be steer by its light again as respects ourselves i trust that the effect of this buffalonian visit will be very beneficial i take occasion in my speech in a joking way which provoke nothing but laughter and good humor to hint at some of the unreasonable trait in the conduct of my canadian friend i be sure that the american go home with very correct view as touch we politics and

to be require by the same gracious authority to resign into other and i trust worthier hand the office of governor-general with the heavy burden of responsibility and care which attach to it it be fitting therefore that we should now speak to each other frankly and without reserve let I assure you then that the severance of the formal tie which bind we together will not cause my earnest desire for you welfare and advancement to abate the extinction of a official relationship can not quench the conviction that i have so long cherish and by which i have be support through many trial that a brilliant future be in store for british north america or diminish the interest with which i shall watch every event which tend to the fulfilment of this expectation and again permit I to assure you that when i leave you be it sooner or later i shall carry away no recollection of my sojourn among you except such as be of a please character i shall remember -- and remember with gratitude -- the cordial reception i meet with at montreal when i come a stranger among you bear with I for my sole recommendation the commission of we sovereign i shall remember those early month of my residence here when i learn in this beautiful neighborhood to appreciate the charm of a bright canadian winter day and to take delight in the cheerful music of you sleigh bell i shall remember one glorious afternoon -- a afternoon in April -- when look down from the hill at monkland on my return from transact business in you city i beheld that the vast plain stretch out before I which i have always see clothe in the white garb of winter have assume on a sudden and as if by enchantment the livery of spring while you noble st lawrence burst through he icy fetter have begin to sparkle in the sunshine and to murmur he vernal hymn of thanksgive to the bounteous giver of light and heat i shall remember my visit to you mechanic ' institute and mercantile library association and the kind attention with which the advice which i tender to you young man and citizen be receive by they i shall remember the undaunted courage with which the merchant of this city while suffer under the pressure of a commercial crisis of almost unparalleled severity urge forward that great work which be the first step towards place canada in she proper position in this age of railway progress i shall remember the energy and patriotism which gather together in this city specimen of canadian industry from all part of the province for the world 's fair and which have be the means of render this magnificent conception of the illustrious consort of we beloved queen more serviceable to canada than it have perhaps prove to any other of the countless community which have be represent there and i shall forget -- but no -- what i might have have to forget be forget already and therefore i can not tell you what i shall forget the remain extract be from parting word speak after a ball which he give at quebec on the eve of he final departure in December 1854 -lrb- sidenote : farewell to quebec -rrb- i wish i could address you in such strain as i have sometimes employ on similar occasion strain suit to a festive meeting but i confess i have a weight on my heart and that it be not in I to be merry for the last time i stand before you in the official character which i have bear for nearly eight year for the last time i be surround by a circle of friend with whom i have spend some of the most pleasant day of my life for the last time i welcome you as my guest to this charming residence which i have be in the habit of call my home -lrb- 13 -rrb- i do not i will frankly confess it know what it would cost I to break this habit until the period of my departure approach and i begin to feel that the great interest which have so long engross my attention and thought be pass out of my hand i have a hint of what my feeling really be upon this point -- a pretty broad hint too -- one lovely morning in June last when i return to quebec after my temporary absence in england and land in the cove below spencerwood -lrb- because it be Sunday and i do not want to make a disturbance in the town -rrb- and when with the greeting of the old people in the cove who put they head out of the window as i pass along and cry ` welcome home again ' still ring in my ear i mount the hill and drive through the avenue to the house door i see the drop tree on the lawn with every one of which i be so familiar clothe in the tenderest green of spring and the river beyond calm and transparent as a mirror and the ship fix and motionless as statue on its surface and the whole landscape bath in a flood of that bright canadian sun which so seldom pierce we murky atmosphere on the other side of the atlantic i begin to think that person be to be envy who be not force by the necessity of they position to quit these engrossing interest and lovely scene for the purpose of proceed to distant land but who be able to remain among they until they pass to that quiet corner of the garden of mount hermon which jut into the river and command a view of the city the shipping point levi the island of orlean and the range of lawrentine so that through the dim watch of that tranquil night which precede the dawn of the eternal day the majestic citadel of quebec with its noble train of satellite hill may seem to rest for ever on the sight and the low murmur of the water of st lawrence with the hum of busy life on they surface to fall ceaselessly on the ear i can not bring myself to believe that the future have in store for I any interest which will fill the place of those i be now abandon but although i must henceforward be to you as a stranger although my official connection with you and you interest will have become in a few day matter of history yet i trust that through some one channel or another the tiding of you prosperity and progress may occasionally reach I that i may hear from time to time of the steady growth and development of those principle of liberty and order of manly independence in combination with respect for authority and law of national life in harmony with british connection which it have be my earnest endeavor to the extent of my humble means of influence to implant and to establish i trust too that i shall hear that this house continue to be what i have ever seek to render it a neutral territory on which person of opposite opinion political and religious may meet together in harmony and forget they difference for a season and i have good hope that this will be the case for several reason and among other for one which i can barely allude to for it might be a impertinence in I to dwell upon it but i think that without any breach of delicacy or decorum i may venture to say that many year ago when i be much younger than i be now and when we stand towards each other in a relation somewhat different from that which have recently subsist between we i learn to look up to sir edmund head with respect as a gentleman of the highest character the greatest ability and the most varied accomplishment and attainment -lrb- 14 -rrb- and now lady and gentleman i have only to add the sad word farewell i drink this bumper to the health of you all collectively and individually i trust that i may hope to leave behind I some who will look back with feeling of kindly recollection to the period of we intercourse some with whom i have be on term of immediate official connection whose worth and talent i have have the best means of appreciate and who could bear witness at least if they please to do so to the spirit intention and motive with which i have administer you affair some with whom i have be bind by the tie of personal regard and if reciprocity be essential to enmity then most assuredly i can leave behind I no enemy i be aware that there must be person in so large a society as this who think that they have grievance to complain of that due consideration have not in all case be show to they let they believe I and they ought to believe I for the testimony of a die man be evidence even in a court of justice let they believe I then even i assure they in this the last hour of my agony that no such error of omission or commission have be intentional on my part farewell and god bless you \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- sidenote : at home -rrb- the two year which follow lord elgin 's return from canada be a time of complete rest from official labor for though on the break up of lord aberdeen 's ministry in the spring of 1855 he be offer by lord palmerston the chancellorship of the duchy of lancaster with a seat in the cabinet he decline the offer not on any ground of difference from the new ministry which he intend to support but because have only recently take he seat in the house of lord after a long term of foreign service during which he have necessarily hold aloof from home politics he think it advisable for the present at least to remain independent he find however ample and congenial occupation for he time in the peaceful but industrious discharge of home duty at broomhall still he thought be constantly with the distant province in which he have labor so long whenever he appear in public whether at a dinner give in he honor at dunfermline or on occasion of receive the freedom of the city of glasgow or in deliver a lecture at the annual opening of the edinburgh philosophical institute -- it be with the same desire of turn to account the knowledge gain abroad for the advantage of the colony or of the mother-country or for the mutual benefit of both with the same hope of draw closer the bond of union between they and dispel something of that cloud of ignorance and indifference which have often make the public opinion of great britain a hindrance rather than a support to the best interest of she dependency -lrb- sidenote : in the house of lord -rrb- it be only very rarely that he take any part in the business of legislation and of the two occasion on which he be induce to break silence one be when the interest of canada appear to he to be imperil by the rumor intention of government to send thither large body of troops that have just return from the crimea he think it he duty to protest earnestly against any such proceeding as likely in the first place to complicate the relation of canada with the united state and in the second place to arrest she progress in self-dependence -lrb- sidenote : crimean war -rrb- the other occasion of he speaking be in may 1855 when lord ellenborough have move a address to the crown condemnatory of the manner in which the crimean war have be and be be conduct have be out of england when hostility be begin he have not to consider the question whether it be a glorious or even a necessary war in which we be engage and he one feeling on the subject be that which he have previously express to the citizen of glasgow my opinion -lrb- he then say -rrb- -lrb- on the question of the war -rrb- i can easily state and i have no hesitation in avow it i say that now we be in the war we must fight it out like man i do not say throw away the scabbard in the first place because i dislike all violent metaphor and in the second place because the scabbard be a very useful instrument and the sooner we can use it the better but i do say have draw the sword do not sheathe it until the purpose for which it be draw be accomplish in the same spirit he now defend the ministry against lord ellenborough 's attack not on party grounds which he take pain to repudiate but on what he conceive to be the true patriotic principle -- viz to strengthen at such a time the hand of the exist government unless there be a distinct prospect of replace it by a stronger after mention that he have not long before inform lord palmerston that ` while he be resolve to maintain a independent position in parliament it be nevertheless he desire and intention subject to that qualification and reserve to support the government ' he proceed : i form this resolution not only because i have reason to believe that on question of public policy my sentiment would generally be find to be in accordance with those of the present government nor yet only because i feel i owe to the noble viscount himself and many at least of he colleague a debt of obligation for the generous support they uniformly give I at critical period in the course of my foreign career but also and principally because in the critical position in which this country be place -- at a time when we have only recently present to the astonished eye of europe the discreditable spectacle of a great country leave for week without a government and a popular and estimable monarch leave without councillor during a period of great national anxiety and peril when there be hardly a household in england where the voice of wail be not to be hear or a eye which be not heavy with a tear -- it appear to I i say under such circumstance to be the bounden duty of every patriotic man who have not some very valid and substantial reason to assign for adopt a contrary course to tender a frank and generous support to the government of the queen have come to that determination he have now to ask himself whether circumstance be so altered as to make it he duty to revoke the pledge spontaneously give to this conclusion he could not bring himself it seem to I -lrb- he say -rrb- these resolution divide themselves naturally into two part the first part have reference to what i may call the general policy of the government with respect to the war and that portion of they be conceive in strain of eulogy and commendation -- i may almost say in strain of exultation the resolution speak of firm alliance of brotherhood in arm of a sympathetic and enthusiastic people but not a word of regret for national friendship of old standing break -- desolation carry into thousand of happy home -- europe in arm -- asia agitate and febrile -- america sullenly expectant this exuberance of exultation he say be amply meet by the exuberance of denunciation which characterise the latter part of the address but it be to he mind even less just than the former but even -lrb- he continue -rrb- if i could bring myself to believe which i have fail in do that censure might be pass in the term of these resolution upon she majesty 's present government without injustice i should still be unwilling to concur in they unless i could find some better security than either the resolution themselves afford or as i regret to be oblige to add the antecedent and record sentiment of noble lord opposite afford that by bring about the change of administration which these resolution be intend to promote i should be do a benefit to the public service my lord i can not but think that at a time when it be most important that the government of this country should have weight and influence abroad frequent change of administration be _ primâ facie _ most objectionable i happen to be upon the continent when the last change of government in this country take place and i must say it appear to I that a most painful impression be create in foreign state with respect to the instability of the administrative system of this country by these frequent change of administration i do think indeed that not the least of the many calamity which this war have bring upon we be the fact that it have have a tendency in many quarter to throw discredit on that constitutional system of government of which this country have hitherto be the type and the bright example among the nation after all what be chiefly valuable to nation as well as to individual and the loss of which alone be irreparable be character and it appear to I that view in this light many of the other calamity which we have have to deplore during the course of this war have be already accompany by a very large and ample measure of compensation to take for instance the military department : notwithstanding the complaint we have hear of deficiency in we military organization i believe we can with confidence affirm that the character of the british soldier both for moral quality and for power of physical endurance have be raise by the instrumentality of this war to a elevation which it have never before attain in spite of the somewhat unfavourable tone which i regret to say have be adopt of late by a portion of the press of america i have myself see in influential journal in that country commentary upon the conduct of we soldier at alma at balaklava and at inkerman which no true-hearted englishman could read without emotion : and i have hear a tribute not less generous and not less unqualified bear to the quality of we troops by eminent person belong to that great military nation with which we be now so happily ally to look to another quarter -- to contemplate another class of virtue not less essential than those to which i have refer to the happiness and glory of nation -- i have hear from enthusiastic even bigoted votary of that branch of the christian church which sometimes pride itself as have alone retain in its system room for the exercise of the heroic virtue of christianity -- i say i have frequently hear from they the frank admission that the hospital of scutarus have prove that the fairest and choicest flower of christian charity and devotion may come to perfection even in what they be pleased to call the arid soil of protestantism but my lord can we flatter ourselves with the belief that the character of we statesman of we public man and of we parliamentary institution have rise in a like proportion be it not on the contrary notorious that doubt have be create in quarter where such doubt never exist before as to the practical efficiency of we much-vaunted constitution as to its fitness to carry we unscathed through period of great difficulty and danger i believe my lord that there be one process only but that a sure and certain process by which these doubt may be remove it be only necessary that public man whether connect with the government or with the opposition whether tie in the bond of party or hold independent position in parliament should evince the same indifference to small and personal motive the same generous patriotism the same disinterested devotion to duty which have characterise the service of we soldier in the field and of the woman of england at the sick-bed and my lord i can not help ask in conclusion if -- which god forbid -- it should unhappily be prove that in those whom fortune or birth or royal or popular favor have place in the van these quality be want who shall dare to blame the press and the people of england if they seek for they elsewhere from the tone of this speech it will be see that lord elgin have not at this time join either of the two party in the state he be in truth still feel he way through the maze of home politics to which he have be so long a stranger and from which as he himself somewhat regretfully observe those ancient landmark of party have be remove ` which if not a wholly sufficient guide be yet some sort of direction to wanderer in the political wilderness ' while he be still thus engage event be happen at the other end of the earth which be destine to divert

as the arrow case derive its interest then from the debate to which it give rise and its effect on party at home rather than from any intrinsic value of its own so do it now mainly owe its importance to the accidental circumstance that it be the remote and insignificant cause which lead to a total revolution in the foreign policy of the celestial empire and to the demolition of most of those

2000000_l _ of pocket-money yet i suppose that the fellah owe to they own industry and the incomparable fertility of the country be not badly off as compare with the peasantry elsewhere we pass at one of we stopping-place between cairo and suez part of a turkish regiment on they way to jeddah these man be dress in a somewhat european costume some of they with the queen 's medal on they breast there

face i have see since i have reach this continent they be much more rigorous it appear with the lady in egypt than at constantinople there they wear a veil which be quite transparent and go about shopping : but in egypt they seem to go very little out and they veil completely hide everything but the eye in the palace which i visit near cairo -lrb- and which the pacha offer if we have choose to take it -rrb- i look through some of the grated window allow in the hareem and i suppose that it must require a good deal of practice to see comfortably out of they it appear that the person who ascend to the top of the minaret to call to prayer at the appoint hour be blind man and that the blind be select for this office lest they should be able to look down into the hareem that be certainly

construct that the overflow of the upper one fill the lower and in this way when the fall be considerable a great quantity can be gather they be all fill with rubbish and it be very possible that

general ashburnham the commander of the expeditionary force who have leave bombay a few hour after the startling tiding have be receive through the telegraph lord elgin 's first feeling be that these disturbance in indium furnish a additional reason for settle affair in china with all possible speed so as to be free to succor the indian government it be only when fuller intelligence come from lord canning with urgent entreaty for immediate help that he determine in consultation with general ashburnham who cordially enter into all he view on the subject to sacrifice for the present the chinese expedition in order to pour into calcutta all the troops that have be intend for canton _ galle ceylon -- may 26th _ -- this be a very charming place so green that one almost forget the heat ashburnham be here we go on together to singapore this evening bad news from indium i think that i may find in this news if confirm a justification for press matter with vigor in china and hasten the

enough the mutineer have murder european seize the fort and treasure of delhus and proclaim the son of the great mogul there seem to be no adequate european force at hand to put they down and the

at galle for a few hour in order to await the arrival of the homeward-bound steamer from calcutta and to get further news but on reflection i come to the conclusion that the best course to take be to view this grave intelligence as a inducement to press on to china i write officially to clarendon to say that if this intelligence be confirm it might have a tendency to lower we prestige in the east and to increase the influence of the party oppose to reason in china that this state of affair might make it more than ever necessary that i should endeavor to bring matter in china to a issue at the earliest moment so as to anticipate this mischief and to place the regiment destine for china at the disposal of government for service elsewhere _ may 29th _ -- we be now near the close of we voyage and the serious work be about to begin up to this point i have hear nothing to throw any light upon my prospects it be impossible to read the blue-book without feeling that we have often act towards

bring brooke back they then turn upon he and he have to run for he life the bishop give I a interesting description of he school of chinese boy he say they be much more like english boy than other oriental : that when a new boy come they generally get up a fight and let he earn he place by he prowess but there be no manage they without pretty severe punishment indeed he say that if a boy be in fault the other do not at all like he not be well punish they seem to think that it be a injustice to the rest if this be omit i be about to do with a strange people so much to admire in they and yet with a perversity of disposition which make it absolutely necessary if you be to live with they at all to treat they severely sometimes almost cruelly they have such a overweening esteem for

pekin but on the 14th of July come letter from lord canning write in a strain of deeper anxiety than any that have precede and give no hope that any troops could be spare from indium for many month to come at the same time lord elgin learn that the french on whose co-operation he count could not act until the arrival of the chief of the mission baron gro who be not expect to reach china till the end of September in this state of thing to remain at hong-kong be worse than useless the sight of he inaction and the knowledge of the reason which enforce it could not fail to damage the position of england with the public of china both chinese and foreign he form therefore the sudden resolution to proceed in person to calcutta where he would be within easier reach of telegraphic instruction from england where he would have the advantage of personal communication with lord canning and of learn for himself at what time he might expect to have any troops at he command and where moreover he appearance might have a moral effect in support of the government greater than the amount of any material force at he disposal -lrb- sidenote : sail for calcutta -rrb- _ h m s ` shannon ' -- July 19th

without troops and without competent representative of we ally -lrb- america and france -rrb- to concert with doomed either to _ aborder _ the court of pekin alone without the power of act vigorously if i meet a repulse or to spend three month at hong-kong do nothing and proclaim to the whole world that i be wait for the frenchman ie that england can do nothing without france i consider the great objection which exist to either of these course _ sur ce entrefaite _ come further letter from canning beg for more help from I and show that thing be even worse with he than they be when i first hear from he it occur to I that i might occupy the three month well in run up to calcutta take with I what assistance i can collect for he and obtain thereby a opportunity of confer with he and learn from he what chance i have of get before the winter the troops which i have detach to he support sir m seymor approve the plan warmly it occur to I on Tuesday evening and on Thursday i be under weigh alas _ l'homme propose mai dieu dispose _ the monsoon be against we and as this ship be practically useless as a steamer as she can only carry coal for five day we be beat against the wind and make little progress perhaps my whole plan may fail because i have the misfortune to be in one of hm 's ship instead of in a good merchant steamer which would be go at ten mile a hour in a direct line while we be go at six in a oblique one however we must hope for the best whether we be to have peace or war with china either object will be much more effectually accomplish when the european force be act together than when we be alone the russian meanwhile no doubt hint to the emperor that we be in a bad way in indium the plan then if we can accomplish it be this : to run up as fast as i can to calcutta and to return so as to meet baron gro who be not expect till the middle of September there will just be time to communicate with the court of pekin before winter i have mention the reason for these proceedings derive from my own position but of course i be mainly influence by a consideration for canning in both he letter he have express a desire to see I and i be tell that my appearance

within two mile of a great city doom i fear to destruction from the folly of its own ruler and the vanity and levity of ours we have move a little farther up the river this morning and as we be like st paul drop a anchor from the stern i have have over my head for several hour the incessant dancing about and clanking of a ponderous chain-cable till my brain be nearly all shake out of they place _

-rrb- _ hm ` furious ' canton river -- January 2nd 1858 _ -- the last week have be a very eventful one : not one of unmixed satisfaction to I because of course there be a great deal that be painful about this war but on the whole the result have be successful on Monday last -lrb- the 28th -rrb- i be awaken at 6 be by a cannon-shot which be the commencement of a bombardment of the city which last for 27 hour as the fire of the shipping be either not return at all or return only by a very few shot i confess that this proceeding give I great pain at the time but i find that much less damage have be do to the town than i expect as the fire be confine to certain spot i be on the whole therefore dispose to think that the measure prove to be a good one as the terror which it have excite in the mind of the cantonese be more than in proportion to the injury inflict and therefore it will have the effect i trust of prevent any attempt on they part to dislodge or attack we which would entail very great calamity on themselves at 10 be on Monday the troops land at a point about two mile east of the city and march up with very trifling resistance to lin fort which they take the french enter first to the great disgust of we people next morning at 9 be they advance to the escalade of the city wall and proceed with again very slight opposition to the magazine hill on which they hoist the british and french flag they then take gough fort with little trouble and there they be by 3 pm establish in canton the poor stupid chinese have place some gun in position to resist a attack from the opposite quarter -- the quarter viz from which gough attack the city and some people suppose that if we have advance from that side we should have meet with some resistance my own opinion be that the resistance would have be no great matter in any case although no doubt if we have make the attempt in summer and with sailor only as some propose when i come here in July we should probably have meet with disaster as it be my difficulty have be to enforce the adoption of measure to keep we own people in order and to prevent the wretched cantonese from be plunder and bully this task be the more difficult from the very motley force with which we have to work compose firstly of french and english secondly of sailor to a great extent -- they be very imperfectly manageable on shore all moreover have i fear a very low standard of morality in regard to steal from the chinese there be a word call ` loot ' which give unfortunately a venial character to what would in common english be style robbery add to this that there be no flogging in the french army so that it be impossible to punish man commit this class of offence on the other hand these incomprehensible chinese although they make no defense do not come forward to capitulate and i be in mortal terror lest the french admiral who be in the way of look at these matter in a purely professional light should succeed in induce we chief to engage again in offensive operation which would lead to a unnecessary destruction of life and property i propose to gro that we should land on the first day of the year and march up to magazine hill he consent and the chief agree so we land about 1 pm at a point on the river bank immediately below the south-east angle of the city wall which be now we line of communication between the river and magazine hill as we land all the vessel in the river hoist english and french flag and fire salute we walk up to the hill along the top of the wall which be a good wide road and which be all line with troops and sailor who present arm and cheer as we pass we reach the summit at about three the british quarter which be a sort of temple stand on the highest point the hill fall pretty precipitously from it on all side the view be one of the most extensive i ever see towards the east and north barren hill of considerable height and much of the character of those we see from hong-kong on the west level land cultivate in rice and otherwise towards the south the town lie still as a city of the dead the silence be quite painful especially when we return about nightfall : but it be partly owe to the narrowness of the street which prevent one from see the circulation of population which may be go on within we remain at the top of the hill till about half-past five during which time we blow up the blue jacket fort and gough fort and get back to we ship about 8 pm have spend a very memorable first of January and make a very interesting expedition although i could not help feeling melancholy when i think that we be so ruthlessly destroy the prestige of a place which have be for so many century intact and undefiled by the stranger and exercise we valor against so contemptible a foe _ January 4th _ -- i have not give you as full a description as i ought to have do of the view and ceremony of Friday because i see ` we own correspondent ' there and i think i can

petition to we to protect they against robber native and foreign -lrb- sidenote : capture of yeh -rrb- _ January 6th _ -- yesterday be a great day the chief make a move which be very judicious i think and which answer remarkably well they send body of man at a early hour into the city from different point and succeed in capture yeh the lieutenant-governor of the city and the tartar general & c this be do without a shot be fire and i believe the troops behave very well abstain from _ loot _ & c altogether the thing be a complete success and i give they great credit for it yeh have be carry on board the ` inflexible ' steamer as a prisoner of war he be a enormous man i can hardly speak to he appearance as i only see he for a moment as he pass I in a chair on he way to he vessel morrison who have take a sketch of he speak favourably of he but it be the fashion to abuse even he look the lieutenant-general have be allow to depart but the lieutenant-governor and tartar general be still in custody at head-quarter at my suggestion a proposal be make to the lieutenant-governor to-day to continue to govern the city under we but the stolidity of the chinese be so great that there be no say what he may do we have give he till to-morrow to determine whether he will accept my whole effort have be direct to preserve the cantonese from the evil of a military occupation but they stupid apathetic arrogance make it almost impossible to effect this object yeh 's tone when he be take be to be rather bumptious the admiral ask he about a old man of the name of cooper who be kidnap at first he pretend that he know nothing about he when press he say ` oh he be a prisoner of war i take he when i drive you away from the city last winter i take a great deal of trouble with he and the other european prisoner but i could not keep they alive they all die and if you like i 'll show you where i have they bury ' morrison say that when he see he on board the ` inflexible ' he be very civil and _ piano _ he take it easy eat and drink well & c he say to he captain that if it be not a indiscreet question he would be glad to know whether it be likely that we should kill he the captain have no difficulty in re-assure he on that point _ January 8th _ -- we have rather a important day 's work yesterday the lieutenant-governor show some symptom of a willingness to govern on we condition this give some chance of we get out of the difficulty of we situation you may imagine what it be to undertake to govern some million of people -lrb- the province contain upward of 20000000 -rrb- when we have _ in all _ two or three people who understand the language i never have so difficult a matter to arrange each man have he own way of see thing and the real difficulty of the question be enormous and the mystery of the chinese character almost unfathomable the problem be well nigh insoluble however yesterday we seem to make some progress towards a understanding we walk up to the front along the wall as usual and very hot it be but we return through the town itself with the general and admiral and a large escort i ride on a pony it be a strange and sad sight the wretched-looking single-storied house on either side of the narrow street almost all shut up only a few people make they appearance and these for the most part wan and haggard and here and there place which the fire from we ship have destroy all present a very melancholy spectacle and one could hardly help ask one 's self with some disgust whether it be worth while to make all the row which we have be make for the sake of get into this miserable place however i presume that the better part of the population have either flee or hide themselves i daresay if they have return and the shop have be open the aspect of the town would have be different -lrb- sidenote : establishment of a joint tribunal -rrb- _ January 9th _ -- yesterday i go up again to the front without gro and press matter forward towards a solution the result be that my plan of get the governor of the province to consent to return to he yamun and resume he function a board of we officer support by a large body of troops be appoint to inhabit he yamun with he and to aid he in the maintenance of order prevail to-day we go gro and i in great procession to the governor 's yamun to reinstate he in he office on the above condition we be carry in chair through the town attend by a large escort the city seem fuller of people than on the occasion of my former visit and they look more cheerful _ January 10th _ -- by a ludicrous mistake no order have be give to release the governor and tartar general so that after wait for they for a hour we hear that the sentry would not let they leave the room in which they be confine the consequence be that it be get late and as i wish to get my escort out of the street before it be dark we be oblige to hurry through the ceremony a little we begin with a kind of squabble about seat but after that be over i address the governor in a pretty arrogant tone i do so out of kindness as i now know what fool they be and what calamity they bring upon themselves or rather on the wretched people by they pride and trickery gro follow in a few word endorse what i have say the governor answer very satisfactorily i then rise say that we must depart and that we wish he and the tartar general all sort of felicity they be good-natured - look man the general being of great size they conduct we to the front door where we ought to have find we chair but they have disappear to the infinite wrath of mr parke i say the front door but in fact the house consist of a series of one-storied pavilion place one behind the other and connect by a covered way with trellis-work panel run through a sort of garden we get at last into the chair and hasten off to the city wall which we reach just as it be get dark have thus terminate about the strangest day which have yet occur in chinese history -- the governor of this arrogant city of canton accept office at the hand of two barbarian chief _ Wednesday January 13th _ -- you get the least agreeable picture of the concern in which i be engage because as i write this record from day to day all my anxiety and they cause be narrate on the whole i think the last fortnight have be a very successful one i walk through the city to-day with the admiral and a escort and see evident sign of improvement in the street the people seem to be resume they avocation and the shop to be re-opening my ` tribunal ' be work well in short i hope that the evil incident to the capture of a city and especially of a chinese city have be in this instance very much mitigate the season be very change three night ago the thermometer do not fall below 72 ° and last night it fall to 40 ° there be a cold wind and it be necessary to walk briskly to-day to keep one 's - self warm -lrb- sidenote : exodus -rrb- _ January 16th _ -- though i be able to send off the last despatch with something of a satisfactory report we be by no means i fear yet out of the wood i take a long walk in the city of canton yesterday i visit the west gate where i find a stream of people move outwards and be tell by the officer that this go on from morning to night they say when ask that they be go out of town to celebrate the new year but my belief be that they be fly from we the street be full and the people civil quantity of eat stall but a large proportion of the shop still shut as we get near the wall in we own occupation some people run up to we complain that they have be rob we go into the house and see clearly enough the sign of devastation i have no doubt from the description that the culprit be french sailor if this go on one fortnight after we have capture the town when be it to stop it be very difficult to remedy nothing could i believe be worse than we own sailor but they be now nearly all on board ship and we have the resource of the _ cat _ all this be very sad but i be not yet quite at the end of my tether if thing do not mend within a few day i shall startle my colleague by propose to abandon the town altogether give reason for it which will enable I to state on paper all these point no human power shall induce I to accept the office of oppressor of the feeble -lrb- sidenote : a sober population -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : maintenance of order -rrb- _ January 20th _ -- i hint at my idea as to the evacuation of the city and it have have a excellent effect there be a notable progress towards quiet in the city still i fear the tide of emigration be go on parke be exert himself with considerable effect and he be really very clever there be a great many more shop open in the street yesterday than i have see before what a thing it be to have to deal with a sober population i have wander about the street of canton for some seven or eight day since the capture and i have not see one drunken man in any christian town we should have have number of row by this time arise out of drunkenness however cow the population might have be the tribunal convict a chinaman the other day for sell ` samshoo ' to the soldier i request parke to hand he over to the governor pehkweus for punishment this be do and the arrangement answer admirably the governor be pleased he present himself before the chinese as the executor of we judgment and at the same time we to a certain extent seem to be concede to the chinese the principle of exterritoriality which we assert as against they i have no ` responsible minister ' here though the presence of a colleague and since military operation begin the position of the naval and military commanders-in-chief have require I to act with some caution in order to make the wheel of the machine work smoothly and keep on the rail for this reason it be that i suggest a few day ago the plan of evacuation the maintenance of order in a city under martial law be i feel a affair rather for the commander-in-chief than for I therefore i be in a false position when i meddle with it directly but the question of remain in the city or not be a political one by let it be know that i have there my line of torre vedras upon which i should fall back if necessary i obtain the influence i require for insure as far as possible the adoption of satisfactory arrangement within the city i must add that this evacuation plan be not intend by I to be a mere threat i have it clearly mature in my mind as a thing feasible and which would be under certain circumstance a advisable plan to adopt in take canton we have as i understand it two object in view : the one to prove that we could take it the other to have in we hand something to give up when we come to term with the emperor -- ' a material guarantee ' i believe that the capture of the city follow by the capture of yeh have settle the former point indeed from all that i hear i infer that the capture of yeh have have more effect on the chinese mind than the capture of the city i believe therefore that we might abandon the city without lose much if anything on this head no doubt we should lose on the second head we should not have canton to give up when a treaty be conclude if we have give it up already even then however we might by retain the island of honan the fort & c do a good deal towards provide a substitute so that you see my threat be make _ bonâ fide _ i certainly should have prefer the loss to which i have refer to the continuance of a state of thing in which the ally troops be plunder the inhabitant _ January 24th _ -- baron gro and i be converse together yesterday on affair in this quarter and among other thing he tell I that we be both much reproach for we laxity and that i be more blame on that account than he i say to he : ' i can praise you on many account my dear baron but i can not compliment you on be a greater brute than i be ' whatever be the feeling of the british resident and whatever excuse may be make for it the consistent humanity show both in the take and in the occupation of the city do not fail to strike mr reed the plenipotentiary of the united state who write to lord elgin : ' i can not omit this opportunity of most sincerely congratulating you on the success at canton the great success of a bloodless victory the merit of which i be sure be mainly due to you lordship 's gentle and discreet counsel my countryman will i be sure appreciate it ' ` this ' observe lord elgin from the representative of the united state be gratify both personally and politically

man who be in this condition be in the receptacle for untried prisoner and say he have be there seven year in one of the court which we enter there be a cell close in by a double row of upright post which be the common style of gate at canton and i be attract to it by the groan of its inmate i desire it to be open and such a spectacle as it present the prisoner be cover with sore produce by severe beating one be already dead and the rat -- but i can not go further in description the other could hardly crawl they be so emaciated and my conviction be that they be shut in there to die the prison authority state that they have escape at the time of the bombardment for which they have be punish as we see if the statement be true they must have be systematically starve since they recapture we pretext for visit the prison be to discover whether any european or person who have be in the service of or have have relation with european be confine in they we take out some who profess to belong to the latter class i go a step further by take out a poor boy of fifteen whom we find in chain but so weak that when we take they off he be unable to stand i tell mr parke to take he to pehkwei from I as a sample of the manner in which he prison be manage _ February 2nd _ -- pehkweus be very indignant at we visit to he prison and hint that he would make away with himself in a letter which he write to I on the subject however he be oblige to admit that some of the thing we find be very bad and quite against the chinese law on review the whole i must admit that except in the case of the one cell that i have describe it be rather neglect want of food medical care cleanliness & c than positive cruelty of which one find evidence in the prison \* \* \* \* \* -lrb- sidenote :

the affair as a local disturbance not affect the imperial power to any permanent settlement it be essential that he should be a party the next step therefore be to move northwards to shangha and there open direct negotiation with the court of pekin and for the success of these negotiation it be obviously of great importance that the envoy of england and france should have the co - operation of the representative of russium and the united state _ February 4th _ -- still no letter to-morrow frederick be to go to macao to take to messr reed and putiatine copy of all my diplomatic correspondence

very long to wait perhaps time pass a little more quickly than when one be dawdle and do nothing at hong-kong but still this life be tiresome enough i do not suppose that there ever be a town of the same extent or a population of the same number more utterly uninteresting than the town and population of canton -- low house narrow street temple contain some hideous idol which be not apparently in the least venerate by they own worshipper the only other resource be the curiosity shop and as you know i have not the genius for make collection _ February 9th _ -- thing have take a better turn f by

apply elsewhere to produce the like result with evident satisfaction lord elgin set himself in a official despatch to refute this reasoning after observe that the native show rather a exaggeration than a defect of the desire to live peaceably with foreigner he proceed : -- the state of ningpo in this respect furnish they favorite and perhaps most plausible argument to that class of person who

have apply to they he say that perhaps the word be too strong that he be much attach to the chinese but that certain class at canton be no doubt very hostile to foreigner and that the chastisement they have receive be quite necessary i really believe that what dr b say be pretty nearly the truth of the case and it be satisfactory to I that the fact that i labor to spare the people should be know know not only by those who approve but by those who abhor clemency from the foregoing and similar extract it will be see how much interest he take in the labor of the missionary and at the same

to the native a lesson of vengeance which when once learn may not always be apply with discrimination but if the extension of the privilege of foreigner in china involve consideration of nicety still more delicate be the question which arise when it be propose to confer by treaty on foreign power the right to interfere on behalf of native who embrace they religion it be most right and fitting that chinaman espouse christianity should not be persecute it be most wrong and most prejudicial to the real interest of the faith that they should be tempt to put on a hypocritical profession in order to

we hesitation and delay the poor fellow even stand at they gun and fire away pretty steadily but as they hardly ever hit it be of very little consequence how much they fire as soon as we man land they abandon the fort and run off in all direction we have hardly have any loss i believe but the french who blunder a good deal with they gunboat and then contrived to get blow up by set fire to a powder magazine have suffer pretty severely i fancy that we have get almost all the artillery which the chinese empire possess in this quarter this affair of yesterday in a strategical point of view be a much more creditable affair than the taking of canton we gunboat and man appear to have do well and though they be oppose to poor troops still they be troops and not crowd of woman and child who be

news since i begin this letter except a vague report that the admiral be move up the river slowly meet with no resistance rather a friendly reception from the people i be surprise that we have not yet hear anything from pekin i hope the emperor will not fly to tartary because that would be a new perplexity i be not quite in such bad spirit as last week because at least now there be some chance of we get this miserable war finish and thus of my obtain my liberty again we ought to have a mail from england any day change of government have this inconvenience that of course the new-comer can not possibly take time to read over previous correspondence so that they must be but partially inform on many point but no doubt at this distance it be practically impossible for government to give instruction and all the responsibility must rest on the agent on the spot at this moment when i be move up to pekin i be receive the despatch of the government comment upon the canton proceedings and ask I : what do you intend to do next _ may 27th _ -- i have be pacing the deck look at the dancing wave sparkling under a bright full moon it be the third time i think that i have see it since i have

advance i have also a communication from the chinese plenipotentiary but it be not of much importance i do not think that these poor timorous people have any notion of resist i only trust that they may make up they mind to concede what be requisite at once and enable we all to have do with it _ may 28th _ -- the last news from canton show that the kind of panic which have be in my opinion most

chinese government which have come into we hand these stupid people though they can not resist and hardly even make a serious attempt to do so never yield anything except under the influence of fear and it be necessary therefore to make they feel that one be in earnest and that they have nothing for it but to give way accordingly i get a guard of 150 marine and the band of the ` calcutta ' and set off with all my suite in chair _ tambour battant _ for the place of rendezvous it be about two-and-a-half mile off and the heat of the sun very great the road carry we through several narrow

consent to have this interview in order that we might compare we power and see whether we could treat together i tell they that i have bring mine and i at once exhibit they give they a translation of the document they say they have not power of the same kind but a decree of the emperor appoint they and they bring out a letter which be wrap up in a sheet of yellow paper the chief plenipotentiary rise and raise the paper reverentially over he head before unfold it i think the term of this document rather ambiguous besides which i be desirous to produce a certain effect so when it have be translate to I i say that i be not sufficiently satisfy with it to be able to say on the spot whether i could treat with they or not that i would if they please take a copy of it and consider the matter but that i would not enter upon business with they at present so say i rise move to the front of the stage and order the escort to move and the chair to be bring this put the poor people into a

day on Friday afternoon however baron gro come to I with a message from the russian and american minister to induce I to recede from two of my demand -- 1 a resident minister at pekin and 2 permission to we people to trade in the interior of china because as they say the chinese plenipotentiary have tell they that they have receive a decree from the emperor state that they should infallibly lose they head if they give way on these point the resident minister at pekin i consider far the most important matter gain by the treaty the power to trade in the interior hardly less so i have at stake not only these important point in my treaty for which i have fight so hard but i know not what behind for the chinese be such fool that it be impossible to tell if we give way on one point whether they would not raise difficulty on every other i send for the admiral give he a hint that there be a great opportunity for england that all the power be desert I on a point which they have _ all _ in they original application to pekin demand and which they all intend to claim if i get it that therefore we have it in we power to claim we place of priority in the east by obtain this when other would not insist on it would he back I this be the forenoon of Saturday 26th the treaty be to be sign in the evening i may mention as a proof of the state of people 's mind that admiral seymor tell I that the french admiral have urge he to dine with he assure he that no treaty would be sign that day well i send frederick to the imperial commissioner to tell they that i be indignant beyond all expression at they have attempt to communicate with I through third party that i be ready to sign at once the treaty as it stand but that if they delay or retract i should consider negotiation at a end go to pekin and demand a great deal more & c frederick execute this most difficult task admirably and at 6 pm i sign the treaty of tientsin i be now anxiously wait some communication from pekin

be briefly sum up as follow : -- the queen of great britain to be at liberty if she see fit to appoint a ambassador who may reside permanently at pekin or may visit it occasionally at the option of the british government protestant and roman catholic to be alike entitle to the protection of the chinese authority british subject to be at liberty to travel to all part of the interior under

the expense of the war -lrb- sidenote : reason for moderation -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : right of send a ambassador -rrb- in bring this treaty to a conclusion lord elgin might have say of himself as truly as of the brother who have so ably help he in arrange its term that he ` feel very sensibly the painfulness of the position of a negotiator who have to treat with person who yield nothing to reason and everything to fear and who be at the same time profoundly ignorant both of the subject under discussion and of they own real interest ' moreover he have constantly to recollect that under the ` most favored nation ' clause every concession make to british subject would be claim by the subject or person call themselves the subject of other power by whom they be only too likely to be employ for the promotion of rebellion and disorder within the empire or for the establishment of privileged smuggling and piracy along its coast and up its river in all these circumstance he see grounds for exercise forbearance and moderation and he forbearance and moderation be reward by the readiness with which the emperor sanction the treaty and the amicable manner in which its detail be subsequently settle one exception there be to this moderation on he part and to this readiness on theirs viz he insist against the earnest remonstrance of the imperial commissioner back by the intercession of the russian and american envoy on the right of send a ambassador to pekin but it be a exception of that kind which be say to prove the rule for the stipulation be one which could not lead to abuse and which would be conducive as he believe in the highest decree to the true interest of both the contracting party he be convince that so long as the system of entrust the conduct of foreign affair to a provincial government endure there could be no security for the maintenance of pacific relation on the one hand the provincial governor be entirely without any sentiment of nationality caring for nothing but the interest of they own province : nor be they in a position to exercise any independence of judgment they life and fortune be absolutely at the disposal of a jealous government so that it be generally they most prudent course to allow any abuse to pass unnoticed rather than risk they head by report unwelcome truth on the other land the central government in which alone a national feeling and a independent judgment be to be look for be profoundly ignorant on all question of foreign policy and must continue to be so as long as the department for foreign affair be establish in the province for these reason he regard the principle that a british minister might henceforth reside at pekin and hold direct intercourse with imperial minister at the capital as be of all the concession in the treaty the one pregnant with the most important consequence -lrb- 2 -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : to be keep in reserve -rrb- but the right once secure he be very desirous that it should be exercise with all possible consideration for the long-cherished prejudice of the chinese on the subject who look forward with the utmost horror to the invasion of they capital by foreign minister with they wife and establishment these latter be as it appear in they eye more formidable than the minister themselves accordingly when the imperial commissioner address to he a very temperate and respectful communication urge that the exercise of the treaty-right in question would be of serious prejudice to china mainly because in the present crisis of she domestic trouble it would tend to cause a loss of respect for they government in the mind of she subject he gladly forward they memorial to the government in england support it with the strong expression of he own opinion that ` if she majesty 's ambassador should be properly receive at pekin when the ratification be exchange next year it would be expedient that she majesty 's representative in china should be instruct to choose a place of residence elsewhere than at pekin and to make he visit either periodical or only as frequent as the exigency of the public service might require ' with much shrewdness he point out that the actual presence of a minister hi a place so uncongenial especially during the winter month when the thermometer fall to 40 ° below zero might possibly be to the mandarin mind less awe-inspiring than the knowledge of the fact that he have the power to take up he abode there whenever the conduct of the chinese government give occasion and that thus the policy which he recommend would ` leave in the hand of she majesty 's government to be wield at its will a moral lever of the most powerful description to secure the faithful observance of the treaty in all time to come ' -lrb- sidenote : return

duty he proceed : -- this subject present considerable difficulty as duty of octrous be levy universally in china on native as well as foreign product and as canal and road be keep up at the expense of the government it seem to be unreasonable to require that article whether of foreign or native production by the simple process of pass into the hand of foreigner should become entitle to the use of road and canal toll-free and should moreover be relieved altogether from charge to which they would be liable if the property of native on the other hand experience have teach we the inconvenience

party i have invite the imperial commissioner to dine with I and request that they would send a juggler to perform before dinner they try to fight shy after have accept i suppose because they consider it _ infra dig _ to attend at the performance of the juggler but they come at last and enjoy the dinner part of the affair thoroughly the juggler be good but one particular feat be beyond praise he twist a bit of paper into the shape of a butterfly and keep it hover and flutter lighting here or there on a fan which he hold in he other hand on a bunch of flower & c -- all by the action on the air produce by a fan which he hold in the right hand at one time he start two butterfly and keep they both on the wing it be the most graceful trick i ever see and entirely a affair of skill not trick the juggler be succeed by the dinner which i wind up by give sundry toast with all the honor to the great amusement of my commissioner Thursday morning be occupy in pay bill which be a most difficult matter as the government will not allow the people to take money in the shop and the complication of account be very great the accuracy of the japanese in these matter be however very great -lrb-

yeddo be not in some important particulars so considerable as those which have be make by china in the treaty of tientsin it be however a material advance on all previous treaty with japan and it open the door to the gradual establishment of relation of commerce and amity between the people of the west and that of japan which might become as lord elgin hope and believe of the most cordial and

call in question some of the privilege concede under the treaty and that they might find on the still unsettled state of affair in the south a hope of succeed in this attempt he think it better to dispel all such illusion at once by take a high and peremptory tone upon the latter subject accordingly when he formal complaint against hwang the governor-general of the two kiang for keep up hostility in spite of the treaty be meet by a promise to stop this for the future by proclamation he refuse to accept this promise and demand the removal of hwang and the suppression of a committee which have be form for the enrolment of volunteer intimate at the same time through a private channel that unless he obtain full satisfaction on the canton question it be by no means improbable that he might return to tientsin and from that point or at pekin itself require the emperor to keep he engagement this have the desire effect the commissioner at once undertake not only to issue a pacific proclamation couch in become term but also to memorialise the emperor for the recall of the governor - general and the withdrawal of all power from the committee of brave it may be add that the

usual during the last few day i have reason to suspect that the commissioner come here with some hope that they might make difficulty about ` some of the concession obtain in the treaty with a kind of notion perhaps that they might continue to bully we at canton if i have depart i think it probable enough that everything would have be throw into confusion and the grand result of prove that my treaty be waste paper might have be attain i have think it necessary to take step to stop this sort of thing at once so i have send some very peremptory letter to the commissioner about canton refuse to have anything to say to they till i be satisfy on this point & c i have also through a secret channel have the hint convey to they that if they do not give I full satisfaction at once i be capable of go off to tientsin again -- a move which would no doubt cost they head to both kweiliang and hwashana i have already extort from they a proclamation announce the treaty and i have now demand that they shall remove the governor-general of the canton province from office and suppress the war committee of the gentry _ October 16th _ -- yes the report of the conclusion of a treaty which be convey so rapidly overland to st petersburg be true and yet i be not on my way home do not think that i be indifferent to this delay it be however for the moment inevitable everything would have be lose if i have leave china the violence and ill-will which exist in hong-kong be something ludicrous as it be matter be go on very fairly with the imperial commissioner and i expect a official visit from they this day at noon the english mail arrive yesterday the visit of the commissioner go off very well i think that they have accept the situation and intend to make the best of it _ October 19th _ --

disagreeable encounter at tientsin they seem disposed to be conversable and friendly the governor-general of this province who be one of they be consider a very clever man and he appear to have rather a notion of take a go-ahead policy with foreigner -lrb- sidenote : the tariff -rrb- the chief matter that remain to be arrange be the settlement of certain trade-regulation supplemental to the treaty involve a complete revision of the tariff -lrb- sidenote : the opium trade -rrb- a tariff be not usually a matter of general interest but this tariff be of more than mere commercial importance as have for the first time regulate and therefore legalise the trade in opium -lrb- 1 -rrb- hitherto this article have be mention in no treaty but have be leave to the operation of the chinese municipal law which prohibit it altogether but the chinese would have it there be no lack of foreign trader chiefly british and american ready to run the risk of smuggling it for the sake of the large profit to be make upon it and the custom-house official both native and foreign inspector hardly even keep up the farce of pretend to ignore the fact at one port indeed the authority exact from the opium trader a sort of hush-money equivalent to a tax about 6 per cent _ ad valorem _ it might well be say that ` the evil of this illegal connive at and corrupt traffic could hardly be overstate that it be degrade alike to the producer the importer the official whether foreign or chinese and the purchaser ' to remedy these evil two course be open one be effective prohibition with the assistance of the foreign power but this the chinese commissioner admit be practically hopeless mainly owe to the inveterate appetite of they people for the drug the other remain : regulation and restriction by the imposition of as high a duty as could be maintain without give a stimulus to smuggling it be not without much consideration that lord elgin adopt the latter alternative and it be a great satisfaction to he that he view on this subject be ultimately share by mr reed the envoy of the united state who have come to the country with the intention of support the opposite opinion in the course of the conference on these point which be carry on in the most friendly spirit lord elgin induce the commissioner to make a separate agreement that he should be permit irrespectively of the condition impose by the treaty to make a expedition up the great river yangtze kiang a permission of which he gladly avail himself not only for the sake of explore a new and most interesting country but even more with the view of mark how entirely and cordially he treaty be accept _ shanghae -- November 2nd _ -- you will i be sure see how necessary it have be for I to protract my stay to this time the systematic endeavor to make it appear that my work be a failure could be counteract only by my own presence the papers & c from england be complimentary enough about the treaty but some of the account which have go home be somewhat exaggerated and perhaps there will be a reaction more particularly i find a hope express that we have plunder the wretched chinese to a greater extent than be the case meanwhile i have achieve one object which will be i think the crowning act of my mission i have arrange with the imperial commissioner that i be to proceed up the river yangtze the treaty only provide that it shall be open when the rebel have leave it i daresay this will give rise to comment if so i shall have anticipate they by go up the river myself i shall take with I my own squadron -lrb- what i have in japan -rrb- the weather be beautiful quite cool enough for comfort we shall visit a region which have never be see except by a stray missionary i shall lose by this move some three week but i do not think they will be really lose because it will give so very complete a demonstration of the acceptance of the treaty by the chinese authority that even hong-kong will be silence _ November 6th _ -- i hope to have start to-day but be oblige to put off till Monday as the tariff be not yet ready for signature i grieve over every day lose which protract we separation i see that in the very flattering article of the _ time _ of September 7th which you quote it be imply that when i sign the treaty i have do my work and that the responsibility of see that it be carry out rest with other if this be true -- and you will no doubt think so -- i might have return at once at least after japan but be it true could i in fairness to my country or in what i trust you believe come second in the rank of motive with I to my own reputation leave the work which i have undertake unfinished besides i own that i have a conscientious feeling on the subject i be sure that in we relation with these chinese we have act scandalously and i would not have be a party to the measure of violence which have take place if i have not believe that i could work out of they some good for they could i leave this the really noblest part of my task to be work out by other anyone could have obtain the treaty of tientsin what be really meritorious be that it should have be obtain at so small a cost of human suffering but this be also what discredit it in the eye of _ many _ of _ almost all _ here if we have carry on war for some year if we have carry misery and desolation all over the empire it would have be think quite natural that the emperor should have be reduce to accept the term impose upon he at tientsin but to do all this by means of a demonstration at tientsin the announcement be receive with a yell of derision by connoisseur and baffle speculator in tea and indeed there be some ground for scepticism it would have be very easy to manage matter here so as to bring into question all the privilege which we have acquire by that treaty even then we should have gain a great deal by it because when we come to assert those rights by force we should have have a good instead of a bad _ casus bellus _

near its mouth on the han-yang side and walk to that town which be a foo or prefectoral city and wall it contain the remains of some building of pretension triumphal arch & c which imply that it must have be a place of some distinction but it have be sadly maltreat by the rebel _ December 9th -- four pm _ -- the day be rainy and the purser complain of difficulty in make he purchase yesterday and

have bully we that we have bully they of late year that it be much better that henceforward we should settle matter reasonably that he be desirous to show I every attention in he power that when the port should be open he would do all he could to promote commerce and good understanding in short he speak very sensibly it be exceedingly probable that if he have not get a little check he might have keep we at as great a distance as possible but be that as it may it be just another proof of how easy it be to manage the chinese by a little tact and firmness we be now load coal flour & c as fast as we can take it on board -lrb- sidenote : visit to governor-general -rrb- _ December 10th -- six pm _ -- this day break fine and clear so i send off to the governor-general to tell he that if he would

for the free passage of vessel communicate with the ` furious ' they describe they ride through nankin as if it have be one through a great park -- tree and the street wider than usual in china but no

as the tide rise -lrb- about midnight -rrb- it lift we off we shoal we have to go cautiously sometimes to-day but we have close this eventful expedition successfully the general result and chief incident of the interesting expedition thus happily complete be report to the government in england in a despatch date January 5th 1859 from which be take the following extract : -- -lrb- sidenote : difficulty of get at fact -rrb- the knowledge of the chinese language possess by messr wade and lay enable I to enter without difficulty into communication with the inhabitant of the town and rural district which we visit at various point in we progress we wander unarmed and unattended in party of three or four to a distance of several mile from the bank of the river and we never experience at the hand of the native anything but courtesy mingle with a certain amount of not very obtrusive curiosity notwithstanding however these favourable opportunity the budget of statistical fact which i be able to collect be hardly as considerable as i could have desire chinaman of the humbler class be not much addict to reflection and when subject to cross-examination by person greedy of information they be apt to consider the proceed a strange one and to suspect that it must be prompt by some exceedingly bad motive moreover have be civilised for many generation they carry politeness so far that in answer a question it be always they chief endeavor to say what they suppose they questioner will be best please to hear if therefore the knowledge of a fact be to be arrive at it be above all thing necessary that the inquiry bear a tint so neutral that the person to whom it be address shall find it impossible to reflect its color in he reply he will then sometimes in he confusion blunder into a truthful answer but he do so generally with a bashful air indicative of the painful consciousness that he have be reluctantly violate the rule of good breed a search after accurate statistics under such condition be not unattended with difficulty -lrb- sidenote : exaggerated report of population -rrb- i be confirm by what i have witness on this expedition in the doubt which i have long entertain as to the accuracy of the popular estimate of the amount of the town population of china the city which i have visit be no doubt suffering at present from the effect of the rebellion but i can not bring myself to believe that at the best of time they can have contain the number of inhabitant usually imputed to they m hue put the population of the three city of woo-chang-foo han-yang-foo and hankow at 8000000 i doubt much whether it now amount in the aggregate to 1000000 and even when they be flourish i can not conceive where 3000000 of human being could have be stow away in they -lrb- sidenote : rural population -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : town population -rrb- what 1 have see lead I to think that the rural population of china be generally speak well-doing and contented i work very hard though with only indifferent success to obtain from they accurate information respect the extent of they holding the nature of they tenure the taxation which they have to pay and other kindred matter i arrive at the conclusion that for the most part they hold they land which be of very limited extent in full property from the crown subject to certain annual charge of no very exorbitant amount and that these advantage improve by assiduous industry supply abundantly they simple want whether in respect of food or clothing in the street of city in china some deplorable object be to be meet with as must always be the case where mendicity be a legalised institution but i be incline to think that the rigor with which the duty of relationship be enforce operate as a powerful check on pauperism a few day ago a lady here inform I that she nurse have buy a little girl from a mother who have a surplus of this description of commodity on hand i ask why she have do so and be tell that the little girl 's husband when she marry would be bind to support the adopt mother by the judicious investment of a dollar in this timely purchase the worthy woman thus secure for herself a provision for old age and a security which she probably appreciate yet more highly for decent burial when she die -lrb- sidenote : manufacture -rrb- my general impression be that british manufacturer will have to exert themselves to the utmost if they intend to supplant to any considerable extent in the native market the fabric produce in they leisure hour and at interval of rest from agricultural labor by this industrious frugal and sober population it be a pleasing but pernicious fallacy to imagine that the influence of a intriguing mandarin be to be presume whenever a buyer show a preference for native over foreign calico in return to shaughae lord elgin have hope to find the object of he mission so far secure that there would be nothing to prevent he sailing for england at once : but nearly two more month elapse before he be able to turn he back on the celestial empire _ shangha -- January 17th _ -- the ` furious ' and ` cruiser ' arrive here safely on the 10th i have just accomplish the herculean task of look over a two-month ' supply of newspaper and this occupation interlard with a certain number of letter and visit to and from the imperial commissioner and to-day a address from the british community of shangha have pretty fully occupy my time -lrb- 3 -rrb- the home mail be due to-day and 1 be anxiously wait to learn from it what the government intend to do about relieve I i trust that you many disappointment as to my return may have be somewhat relieve by the conviction that i be follow the right course this open up of the east be not a light matter the comet be most magnificent here do i ever mention it in my letter during the whole period of its visit in this quarter it have night after night a clear blue cloudless sky spangle with star innumerable to disport itself in canton be come round to tranquillity as fast as we ever have any right to expect but the absurd thing be that these funny people at hong-kong be begin to praise I -lrb- sidenote : trouble at canton -rrb- _ January 20th _ -- i have hardly write the word ` canton be come round to tranquillity ' when i hear that there have be fight there again it be a good thing in my opinion as it will enable we to demonstrate we superiority to the brave if the general and admiral improve the opportunity properly not by a great deal of slaughter that be quite unnecessary but by promptitude and strike a blow at the right moment the chinese do not care much about be kill but they hate be frighten and the knowledge of this idiosyncrasy of theirs be the key of the position i have just write a letter to my friend the imperial commissioner here which will i think shake they nerve considerably and bring they to a manageable frame of mind in fact when he find that governor-general hwang have not be recall nor the committee of gentry suppress and that the canton brave be still make war upon we troops he feel that the chinese be try to evade the performance of they promise and that there be nothing for it but to ` appeal again to ` that ignoble passion of fear which be unhappily the one _ primum mobile _ of human action in china ' -lrb- 4 -rrb- accordingly he write to the imperial commissioner that as the emperor do not carry out what they undertake he would have nothing more to say to they on the subject that the english soldier and sailor would take the brave into they own hand and that he or he successor would in a month or two have a opportunity of ascertain at pekin itself whether or not the emperor be abet the person who be create disturbance in the south the

comfortable quite as good as the accommodation provide for commercial traveller at a english inn a good many book seem to form part of the luggage of the occupant of each room that we enter it be curious that i should have be engage in so many enterprise of rather a out-of-the-way character since i have be out here i confess that in my own opinion the voyage up the yangtze be not the least important one _ January 22nd _ -- mail arrive frederick 's appointment -lrb- 5 -rrb- be very satisfactory and i be sure it be the best the government could have make for the public interest it be a great comfort to I to know that he will wind up what i can not finish -lrb- sidenote : return to hong-kong -rrb- _ shangha -- January 25th _ -- after full consideration i have resolve to go at once to hong-kong and take the canton difficulty in hand a variety of circumstance lead I to the conclusion that the court of pekin be about to play we false ho the governor-general of the two kiang the tautaus of this port and the treasurer of the district all well-disposed to foreigner have be gradually remove from the council of the commissioner some papers which we have seize also indicate that the emperor be by no means reconcile to some of the most important concession obtain in the treaty this row at canton be therefore very opportune i have take a high tone inform the commissioner that i be off to the south to punish disturber of the peace there and that when i have teach they to respect treaty i -lrb- or my successor -rrb- will return to settle matter still pend here pacifically or otherwise as the emperor may prefer it be to be hope that this language will bring they to they sens or rather bring the court to its sens for i do not suppose that the commissioner be so much to

police over even english vessel which carry coolie to foreign port : -- ` men-of-war have order to seize vessel break the law but as they be not prize and the captain if he seize they wrongfully be

happen if i have give way to those who wish I to carry fire and sword through all the country village or if i have go home and leave the winding-up of these affair in the hand of other i say all this because i be anxious that you should appreciate the motive which have make I prolong my stay in this quarter on the 15th he start intend to join general straubenzee in a expedition up the west river

propensity than by exact the greatest possible amount of ` backshish ' from traveller who visit the pyramid we push on over the heap of sand and _ débris _ or probably covered-up tomb which surround the base of the pyramid when we suddenly come in face of the most remarkable object on which my eye ever light somehow or other i have not think of the sphinx till i see she before I there she be in all she impose magnitude crouch on the margin of the desert look over the fertile valley of the nile and she gaze fix on the east as if in earnest expectation of the sun-rising and such a gaze the mystical light and deep shadow cast by the moon give to it a intensity which i can not attempt to describe to I it seem a look earnest search but unsatisfied for a long time i remain transfixed endeavor to read the meaning convey by this wonderful eye but i be strike after a while by what seem a contradiction in the expression of the eye and of the mouth there be a singular gentleness and hopefulness in the line of the mouth which appear to be in contrast with the anxious eye mr bowlby who be a very _ sympathique _ inquirer into the significancy of this wonderful monument agree with I in think that the upper part of the face speak of the intellect strive and strive vainly to solve the mystery -- -lrb- what mystery the mystery shall we say of god 's universe or of man 's destiny -rrb- -- while the lower indicate a moral conviction that all must be well and that this truth would in good time be make manifest we could hardly tear ourselves away from this fascinating spectacle to draw nearer to the great pyramid which stand beside we its outline sharply trace in the clear atmosphere we walk round and round it think of the strange man whose ambition to secure immortality for themselves have express itself in this giant creation the enormous block of granite bring from one know not where build up one know not how the form select solely for the purpose of defy the assault of time the contrast between the conception embody in these construction and the talk of the frivolous race by whom we be surround and who seem capable of no thought beyond a desire for daily ` backshish ' -- all this see and feel under the influence of the dim moonlight be very striking and impressive we spend some time in move from place to place along the shadow cast by the pyramid upon the sand and observe the effect produce by bring the moon sometimes to its apex and sometimes to other point on its outline i feel no disposition to exchange for sleep the state of dreamy half - consciousness in which i be wander about but at length i lay down on the shingly sand with a block of granite for a pillow and pass a hour or two sometimes doze sometimes wakeful till one of we attendant inform I that the sun would shortly rise and that it be time to commence to ascend the pyramid if we intend to witness from its summit he first appearance we have intend to spend the night in the tomb but it be so hot that we be only too glad to select the spot in which we could get the greatest amount of air a very soft and gentle breeze waft across the desert from a unknown distance fan I as i sleep the ascent be i confess a much more formidable undertaking than i have anticipate and we french friend give in after attempt a few step the last word which have pass between he and I before we retire to rest be interchange as we be stand in front of the sphinx and be characteristic : _ ah que c'est drôle _ be the reassuring exclamation which fall from he lip while we be there transfix and awestruck as far as the ascent of the pyramid be concerned i be not sure but that i be sometimes tempt to follow he example when i find how great be the effort require to mount up in the hot air the huge block of granite and the unpleasantness of feeling every now and then with what facility one might topple downward this sensation be most disagreeably feel when as generally happen at any very critical place my arab friend who be help I up begin to talk of ` backshish ' and to insinuate that a small amount give at once and before the ascent be complete would be particularly acceptable however after a while the summit be reach i be not sure that it repay the trouble at any rate i do not think i should ever wish to make the ascent again we have a horizon all around tinted very much like turner 's early picture and become brighter and more variegate as the dawn advance until it melt into day behind and on two side of we be the barren and treeless desert stretch out as far as the eye could reach before we the fertile valley of the nile the river meander through it and in the distance cairo with its mosque and minaret the highest the citadel mosque stand out boldly upon the horizon it be a fine view and have a character of its own but still it be not in kind very different from other view which i have see from elevated point in a flat country it do not stand forth among my recollection as a spectacle unique and never to be forget as that of the night before do very soon after the sun rise the heat become painful on we elevated seat and we hasten to descend-an operation somewhat difficult but not so serious as the ascent have be we mount we donkey and after pay a farewell visit to the sphinx we return to cairo as we have come all agree that we expedition be one of the most agreeable and interesting we have ever make i confess that it be with something of fear and tremble that i return to the sphinx that morning i fear that the impression

leak be however too much for he and he have nothing for it but to run over to the opposite side of the anchorage where there be a sandy bay and there to beach he ship we perform this operation successfully though at time it seem probable that the water would gain upon we so quickly as to stop the working of the engine before we reach we destination if this have happen we should have drift

that i estimate correctly they power of resistance that we have spend in we armament against they three time as much as be necessary and that if we have difficulty to encounter they be likely to be

it be a much more fertile district than this beautifully cultivate and the house better than i have see anywhere else in china the people seem very comfortable and they relation with the french be

: -- _ August 2nd _ -- there have be a few day ' interval since i write and i now date from pey-tang and from the general 's ship the ` granada ' a peninsular and oriental steamer for i owe it to he that i be here i need hardly tell you the event that have occur -- public event i mean -- since the 28th as they will all be record by ` we own ' we move on the 29th to a different anchorage some five mile nearer pey-tang all the evidence be to the effect that the pey-tang fort be undefended at least that there be no barricade in the river and therefore that the best way of take they would be to pass they in the gunboat as we do the peiho fort in 1858 and as we also pass nankin that year but it be resolve that we should land a quantity of man in the mud about a mile and a half below they this be to have take place on the 30th and those of my gentleman who intend to leave I as better fun be to be find elsewhere keep up a tremendous bustle and noise from about 4 be however at about 6 they be inform that the order for landing be countermand on the plea that there be too much sea to admit of the horse be transfer from the vessel to the gunboat next day the 31st it be rain and the sea seem rougher in the morning however at about 9 the gunboat begin to move the general have agree that i should have he ship and that i should move either over the bar or as near to it as i could manage i anchor the ` granada ' outside the bar and as i do not choose to lose the sight of the landing i get into my row-boat go at last on board the ` coromandel ' the admiral 's ship the landing go on merrily enough it be a lovely rather calm evening we be within a long-range shot of the fort and if shoot or shell have drop among the boat and man who be huddle up on the edge of the mud-bank it would have be inconvenient we enemy however have no notion of do anything so ungenerous so the landing go on uninterruptedly the french carry almost all they want on they back we man employ coolie & c for that purpose we see nothing of the enemy except the movement of a few tartar horseman out of and into the town gallop along the narrow causeway on which we troops be to march at midnight eight gunboat -- six english and two french -- steamed past the fort it be a moment of some excitement because we do not know whether or not they would be fire at however nothing of the kind take place and about a hour after they have start three rocket that soar and burst over the village intimate that they have reach the place appoint to they have witness this part of the proceedings i lay down on the

he have meet a party of french soldier who be oblige some chinese to carry a wooden gun which they have capture in the fort declare that they have enter it find it desert and possess of no defence but two wooden gun it turn out that they have not enter first but that a english party head by mr parke have precede they this rather promise to diminish the interest of the attack on the fort which have be fix for half-past four in the morning but there be another fort on the opposite side of the river perhaps there might be some resistance there alas vain hope three shot be fire at it from the gunboat which have pass through during the night and some twenty labourer walk out of it to seek a more secure field for they industry in some neighbouring village afterwards we troops go in and find it empty as the other so end the capture of pey-tang we come over the bar in the evening and i go to see hope grant at the capture fort where he have fix he abode while there we discover a strongish body of tartar cavalry at a distance of about four mile along the causeway which lead from this to tientsin and taku i urge the general to send out a party to see what these gentry be do lest they should be break up the causeway or do any other mischief and i hear from he this morning that he have arrange with general montauban to do so and that a party of 2000 man start on that errand early the tartar seem to be in greater force than be suppose the officer in command -lrb- rightly or wrongly i know not which -rrb- resolve to consider the expedition merely a reconnaissance and to retire after stay on the ground a short time of course the tartar will consider this a victory and will he elate by it but perhaps this be a good thing as it may induce they to face we on the open the ground on which they be find be firm and fit for cavalry and be about four mile from the peiho fort this be a very nasty place the country around be all under water and it be impossible to get through it

diplomacy even the bare announcement of he arrival lord elgin fear they might interpret as a invitation to treat and use as a excuse for dilatory and evasive negotiation the justice of this view be prove by what take place on the 5th of August have occasion to station one of he ship near the shore for the purpose of get water the admiral send a flag of truce to warn some tartar troops post near the spot that ` he ship have not go there with the view of make a attack but that it would fire on the tartar if they approach too near it ' the governor - general at once take advantage of the opening this give he affect to believe that the flag of truce come from lord elgin he address to he a despatch full of profession of amity and say that he ` have receive instruction to discuss and dispose of all question with the british minister ' but contain no mention of the _ ultimatum _ to this and numerous similar missive which come for a time in rapid succession lord elgin have but one reply -- that he could discuss nothing until the demand already make have be satisfied _ August 9th _ -- my diplomacy begin yesterday for i receive in the morning a communication from the governor-general of the province not frankly concede we demand but make tolerably plausible proposal for the sake of occasion delay i have refuse to stay the march of the military on such overture but the great slowness of we operation be likely to lead I into diplomatic difficulty the chinese authority if they become frightened be clever enough to advance proposition which it may be impossible to accede to without compromise the main object of this costly expedition and by refuse which i shall nevertheless expose myself to great animadversion there be a reconnaissance again this morning and i hope from the report of crealock -lrb- who accompany it and who be do very well -rrb- that the enemy will prove quite as little formidable as i have always expect the serious advance be positively to have take place to-morrow but i almost fear there will be another delay i be anxious to conclude peace as soon as possible after the capture of the peiho fort because from what i have see of the conduct of the french here i be sure that they will commit all manner of atrocity and make foreigner detest in every town and village they enter of course they presence make it very difficult to maintain discipline among we own people -lrb- sidenote : take of the fort -rrb- the ` serious advance ' take place on the 12th and be completely successful on that day the ally take possession of the little town of sinho : two day later they occupy tangkow the fort however which guard the entrance of the peiho -- the taku fort from which the british force have be so disastrously repulse the year before -- remain untaken opinion be divide as to the plan of operation the french be for attack first the great fortification on the right or southern bank of the river but sir robert napier urge that the real key to the enemy 's position be the most northerly of the fort on the left or northern bank happily he counsel prevail on the 21st this fort be take by assault with but little loss of life and the soundness of the judgment which select the point of attack be prove by the immediate surrender of all the remain defensible position on both side of the river during the greater part of this time lord elgin be on board the ` granada ' moor off pey-tang suffer all the anxiety of a active spirit condemn to inactivity in the midst of action : responsible generally for the fate of the expedition yet without power to control any detail of its operation fret especially at the delay which be perhaps necessarily incident to a divide and subdivide command write after the surrender of the taku fort he say : -- i have tear up the earlier part of this letter because it be needless to place on record the anxiety i feel at that time to revert to the portion of my history which be include in the part of my letter that i have destroy i must tell you that it be on the 12th that the troops first move out of pey-tang i see they defile past and in the afternoon ride out to the camp but be turn back by a large body of tartar cavalry who menace my flank and as some of my people have just discover in the apartment of the tartar general at sinho a letter state that they be determine to capture the ` big barbarian himself ' this time i think it better to retrace my step the second action take place on the 14th and on the 15th i ride out to see the general and have a conference with he on the 17th i go to the gulf to see gro i have have dozen of letter from the chinese authority and i have answer some of they not in a way to give they much pleasure all these detail be give at full length in my annihilated letter but already they seem out of date _ tangkow -- August 23rd _ -- grant have be marvellously favor by the weather for the rain which arrest all movement here stop the day before he move out of pey-tang and begin again about a hour after he have take the taku fort which lead to the surrender of the whole i must also say that the result entirely justify the selection which he make of he point of attack and as this be against the write opinion of the french general it be a feather in grant 's cap the chinese be just the same as they be when i know they formerly they fire the cannon with quite as little accuracy but there be one point of difference in they proceedings on previous occasion we have always find they fort open on one side so that when they be turn the troops leave they and escape in this instance they be enclose with ditch palisade stake & c so that the poor fellow have nothing for it but to remain in they till they be push out by bayonet almost all we casualty occur during the escalade i go through the hospital yesterday and find very few who have be strike by round shoot a very small portion of the force be engage so that my opinion of its unnecessary magnitude be not shake i need not describe the action for you as you will no doubt see elsewhere a detailed account of it my own personal history will not be indifferent to you i leave the ` granada ' at about 530 pm on the 20th -lrb- Monday -rrb- find some dinner and a tent at the camp at sinho start next morning at about 530 be ride into tangkow where i now be and mount to the top of the head-quarter ' house whence i have a very good view of the operation i be dislodge after a while because a battery open fire at about fifteen hundred yard from we and some of the ball fall so near that we begin to think they be perhaps firing at I on be dislodge from my belvidere i take some breakfast to console myself and soon after see the british flag on the fort which we have be attack i ride over to it we meet a good many of we own wounded and all round the fort be number of the poor chinaman stake and massacre in all sort of way i find the two general there and soon after the admiral come up from he ship under a flag of truce two letter come to I from the chinese but true to my policy of let the fight man have all the prestige of take the fort i would not have anything to say to they the messenger be tell that they must give up the fort to the commanders-in-chief before i would listen to they and that in the meantime the army would proceed with its operation they move on accordingly and i return to my post of observation at tangkow i have hardly reach it when the rain begin and in about a hour the road have become absolutely impassable for artillery and nearly so for everything else the troops meet with no resistance at the second fort and the indefatigable parke have go over to the unfortunate governor-general extort from he a surrender of the whole which he bring to the commanders-in-chief on the morning of the 22nd have i believe dictate its term of course grant 's triumph be complete and deservedly so the system of we army involve such a enormous transportation of provision & c that we make however but slow progress i have therefore urge the admiral who have get through the barrier at the mouth of the peiho -lrb- and who be not unwilling to go ahead -rrb- to proceed up the river with he gunboat : if he meet with any obstruction which be serious he can stop he progress and await the arrival of troops if he meet none he will soon reach tientsin _ August 24th _ -- this morning at about four grant awake I with a letter from the admiral say that he have experience in go up the river exactly what we do in 1858 -- the poor people come down in crowd to offer submission and provision and no opposition of any kind he write from ten mile below tientsin which place he be go to occupy with he small gunboat force the general have agree to despatch a body of infantry in gunboat and to make he cavalry march by land and i be only await the return of the admiral to move on so all be go on well grant have also agree to send a regiment to shanghae in case there should be trouble there it really look now as if my absence would not be protracted much beyond the time we use to speak of before i start at the same time i do not like to be too confident -lrb- sidenote : the peiho -rrb- _ August 25th -- noon _ -- high and dry at about fifteen mile below tientsin this must remind you of some of my letter from the yangtze two year ago we start this morning at 630 in the ` granada : ' the general and i with both we staff we have go on famously to this point scrape through the mud occasionally with success in round a corner however at which a french gunboat have already stick before we we have run upon a bank it be very strange to I to be go up the peiho river again the fertility of the plain through which it run strike I more than it do formerly the harvest be at hand and the crop clothe it luxuriantly the poor people in the village do not appear to fear we much we treat they well before and they expect similar treatment again the admiral do he work of occupy tientsin well he have great quality -lrb- sidenote : tientsin -rrb- _ tientsin -- Sunday August 26th _ -- we reach this place about midnight it be about the most nervous operation at which i ever assist go round the sharp turn with this long ship by moonlight i have a moment of painful _ saisissement _ when i feel almost certain that we should run into my dear colleague gro who have ground in a little gunboat at one of the worst bend of the river we only save he by drop a anchor from the stern and go backwards full speed the yangtze be bad enough but we never use to go on at night and there be no danger of collision this ship look also as if she would go head over heel much more easily than the ` furious ' i be wait for parke and the general before i decide as to landing & c be it not strange to be here immediately ahead of we be the yamun where gro and i spend the eventful week in 1858 which precede the signature of the treaty of tientsin _ two pm _ -- we be to have the yamun in which reed and putiatine be lodge in 1858 a much better quarter than we old one and the general gro and i be all to lodge in it together -lrb- sidenote : chinese yamun -rrb- _ tientsin -- August 27th _ -- i have a very bad headache after i have send off the mail yesterday we ship have moreover get aground and be lie over so much on one side that it seem possible that she might topple over altogether under these circumstance and have the prospect of a very noisy night on board i determine to land and sleep in my yamun the portion of it dedicate to I consist of a regular chinese garden with rockwork and bridge and pond full of lotus leave and flowerpot of all dimension with shrub and flower in they surround on two side by wooden building contain room with carve woodwork and other chinese neatness it be the only house of a chinese gentleman i have ever inhabit for when i be here before i dwelt in a temple the mosquito be a little troublesome at first but i get my net up and sleep tolerably better than i should have do here for the iron ship get so heat by the sun during the day that they be never cool however fresh the night air may be -lrb- sidenote : negotiation -rrb- _ August 29th _ -- i intend to have tell you that i be send a stiff letter to my old friend kweiliang but in fact it have take some time and consultation with gro to settle its term and it be only now be translate yesterday afternoon the long-expected mail arrive shall i really eat my christmas dinner with you really many thing be more improbable than that i hope at one time that this letter might be despatch from pekin but as we have to meet commissioner here and to make a kind of supplementary treaty before proceed thither it be doubtful whether we shall accomplish this i be not sure that i like my present domicile as well as i do my domicile here in 1858 because although it be a great deal more _ orné _ it be proportionably hotter be surround by wall which we can not see over it be a great place with a infinite number of court and room of all size i should think several family must live in it unless the establishment of a chinese gentleman be very large indeed if kweiliang and co come into we term my present intention be to send at once to frederick officially and request he to come on to pekin he have be have some very troublesome work at shangha with the rebel indeed there be at present work enough for both of we in china _ September 1st _ -- kweiliang arrive last night and send I a hint that he intend to call on I to-day i send one in return to say that i would not see he until he have answer my letter i fear a little more bully will be necessary before we bring this stupid government up to the mark both yesterday and to-day i take a ride in the morning with grant i ride a horse of he a very nice one the sun become powerful very early but it be a charming climate now the abundance of all thing wonderful : beef and mutton at about threepence a pound peach grape and all sort of vegetable in plenty ice in profusion i daresay however that in six week ' time it may be very cold at one moment on the 2nd of September it really seem as if the object of the mission be achieve for the imperial commissioner -- one of whom be the same kweiliang who have conduct the negotiation in 1858 -- in a formal despatch give a positive assurance that the treaty of tientsin should be faithfully observe and that all the demand hitherto make should be concede in full a draft of convention be accordingly prepare on this basis but when it come to the point kweiliang and he colleague declare that they have no authority to sign it without refer to pekin and it become obvious that he either do not possess or do not at that moment wish it to be suppose that he possess power equal to those which he hold in 1858 although he previous language have be calculate to convey the opposite impression -lrb- sidenote : break off -rrb- here be clearly a deliberate design to create delay with the view of drag on negotiation into the winter it be indispensable lord elgin think to check this policy by a act of vigor and accordingly with the concurrence of baron gro he intimate to the imperial commissioner that in consequence of the want of good faith exhibit by they in assume the title of plenipotentiary when they could not exercise the authority which it imply and of the delay which the allege necessity of constant reference to pekin would occasion he have determine to proceed at once to tung-chow in the immediate neighborhood of the capital and to enter into no further negotiation with they until he should have reach that place _ September 8th _ -- i be at war again my idiotical chinaman have take to play trick which give I a excellent excuse for carry the army on to pekin it would be a long affair to tell you all the in and out but i be sure from what have come to pass during the last few day that we must get nearer pekin before the government there come to its sens the blockhead have go on negotiate with I just long enough to enable grant to bring all he army up to this point here we be then with we base establish in the heart of the country in a capital climate with abundance around we we army in excellent health and these stupid people give I a snub which oblige I to break with they no one know whether we progress be to be a fight or a ovation for in this country nothing can be foresee i think it better that the olive-branch should advance with the sword i be afraid that this change in the program -- a hostile instead of a peaceful march on pekin -- will keep I longer here because i can not send for frederick till peace be make and i can not i suppose leave pekin till he arrive there _ Sunday September 9th _ -- kweiliang and co want very much to call on I yesterday but i would not receive they the junior commissioner who be at canton with parke and know he well tell he that in fact the people here have be urge they to make a effort to prevent war say : ` if we be sure that the foreigner would have the best of it we should not care but if they be worst they will fall back on we and wreak they vengeance upon we ' this do not seem a very formidable state of mind as far as we be concern we have behave well to the people except at peytang and sinho and the consequence be that we can move through the country with comparative ease if the people try to cut off we baggage and refuse we supply we should find it very difficult to get on _ noon _ -- i have just return from a service on board the ` granada ' where the clergyman administer the sacrament to a small congregation at four we march to the war but as i go to bear the olive it be not so bad a Sunday 's work you may very likely hear through siberium of the result of we march before you receive this letter announce that it be to take place i shall not therefore speculate upon it _ yang-tsun about twenty mile above tientsin -- September 10th -- two pm _ -- this morning we start at about five and reach this encampment soon after seven a very nice ride cool and through a succession of crop of millet a stiff reedy stem some twelve or fourteen foot high with a tuft on the top be the physiognomy of the millet stalk it would puzzle the tartar cavalry to charge we through this crop as it be we have see no enemy and mr parke have induce the inhabitant to sell we a good many sheep and oxen we tent be not pitch till near noon so i sit during most of the forenoon under the shade of a hedge there have be thunder since and a considerable fall of rain i hope it will not make the road impassable but if it fill the river a little it will do we good for we may then use it for the transport of we supplies and it be now too low we do not know much what be ahead of we but we hear of tartar troops farther on and at tung-chow it be say that a large army be collect under sang-ko-lin-sin himself -lrb- they great general -rrb- i be now enjoy the life of a camp write to you seat on my portmanteau with my desk on my only chair it be perhaps better than my hothouse at tientsin -lrb- sidenote :

that they be under order to come to tientsin to settle everything and deprecate a forward movement -lrb- 2 -rrb- i shall of course stick by my program and decline to have anything to say to they till i reach tung-chow of course this proceeding on they part augur well for peace it pour all last evening and the general determine not to march this morning but as it be fine now i think we may start at noon and make out we allotted march it be cooler this morning and i think it not improbable that the thunder of yesterday may close the hot season however the sun be come out in he strength so one can not say what the day may bring forth _ ten _ be -- all we cart-driver with they animal disappear during last night leave the cart behind they probably they get a hint from the chinese authority i be sorry for it for if we begin to resort to measure of violence to supply ourselves we may entirely alter the footing on which we have hitherto stand with the people we be put all we surplus goods into junk in order to reduce we baggage -lrb- sidenote : chinese gentleman-farmer -rrb- _ nan-tsai-tsun -- September 12th _ -- where will this letter be send from it be begin at a small town on the close of we march of to-day which ought to have be we march of yesterday it be a very mild one -- about eight mile -- through a nice country more wooded than former march and with bright sunshine and a fresh almost frosty air the sunshine we have not at first for we start before the sun have appear on the horizon instead of trust to we tent we have this day take up we abode in the house of a chinese gentleman - farmer the owner of about 1000 acre it be nearly as large as the house i occupy at tientsin at least it have nearly as many court the gentleman have a good library in which i have establish myself and he seem poor man very anxious to accommodate we though he appearance be not that of a man entirely at he ease as i be start this morning i get a second letter from the new plenipotentiary rather more defiant in its tone and say that there be troops at we next station with whom we shall come into collision if we advance with a army parke be go on with a escort and we shall soon know from he what the state of the case really be -lrb- sidenote : ho-see-woo -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : monastery -rrb- _ ho-see-woo -- September 14th _ -- we have a charming march to this

a monastery with very nice apartment and quantity of stable grain agricultural implement & c all indicative of a very prosperous community i have see no _ bonzerie _ on anything like so comfortable a scale i have a second letter from my commissioner in the evening of the last day on which i write a page of this journal more humble in its tone then the precede one and as my general be get uneasy about he supplies & c i think it necessary to make a kind of proposition for a arrangement we soldier do so little for themselves and they necessity be so great that we move but slowly we present party consist of about 1500 fight man but we count about 4000 mouth and all must have abundantly of the best the french -lrb- i admit that they take more out of the country and sometimes perhaps by rougher method -rrb- carry on they back several day ' provision they work in all sort of way for the army the contrast be i must say very striking i therefore think it better to send wade and parke to the new imperial commissioner to see whether they intend to resist or not and to make a proposal to test this they set out last night and i have just hear from they that as they do not find the commissioner at the place they expect -lrb- matow -rrb- they be go on to tung-chow the place where i intend to sign the convention parke be one of the most remarkable man i ever meet for energy

of the blood imperial and in they repeat assurance that ` what they sign be as though the emperor sign it ' and that ` no comparison could be draw between the authority vest in they and that hold ' by previous commissioner there appear to be everything necessary to justify the belief that they word might be trust unhappily the confidence which the ally be thus lead to repose in they be destine to be deceive not however so far as appear owe to bad faith on they part but owe to the fact that they pacific influence at court be overborne on this occasion by that of the war party head by the commander-in-chief sang-ko-lin-sin -lrb- 3 -rrb- on the return of the two secretary from the conference lord elgin at once acquaint baron gro and sir hope grant with its result and it be agree that

they story be mix up with public event -lrb- sidenote : cause of the change -rrb- as to the origin and cause of the renewal of hostility it be impossible to speak with certainty nor be it probable that we shall ever arrive at a better opinion on the subject than that which be form by lord elgin on the spot in he report to the government he write : -- to hazard conjecture as to the motive by which chinese functionary be actuate be not a very safe undertaking and it be very possible that further information may modify the view which i now entertain on this point i be however dispose at present to doubt there have be a deliberate intention of treachery on the part of prince tsaus and he colleague but i apprehend that the general-in-chief sang-ko - lin-sin think that they have compromise he military position by allow we army to establish itself so near he line at chang-kium - wan he seek to counteract the evil effect of this by make a great swagger of parade and preparation to resist when the ally army approach the camping-ground allot to they several of we people colonel walker with he escort my private secretary mr loch baron gro ' secretary of embassy comte de bastard and other pass through the tartar army during the course of the morning on they way from tung-chow without encounter any rudeness or ill-treatment whatsoever at about a quarter to ten however a french commissariat officer be assault by some tartar soldier under circumstance which be not very clearly ascertain and this incident give rise to a engagement which soon become general on the whole i come to the conclusion that in the proceedings of the chinese plenipotentiary and commander-in-chief in this instance there be that mixture of stupidity want of straightforwardness suspicion and bluster which characterise so generally the conduct of affair in this country but i can not believe that after the experience which sang-ko-lin-sin have already have of we superiority in the field either he or he civil colleague could have intend to bring on a conflict in which as the event have prove he be so sure to be worst -lrb- sidenote : firm measure -rrb- late on the night of the 18th lord elgin

return the city of pekin would forthwith be attack and take ' even when offer come that they should be restore on condition of he withdraw he troops he refuse to listen to such term convince that any

since i last write in this journal i have moreover be separate from it and from all my effect on the 21st we have another battle with the tartar i accompany the army and see it all consider that the tartar be so wretchedly armed and lead they do pretty well we be now about six mile from pekin but i believe the general will not move for a week we learn that parke and he companion viz loch de norman bowlby captain brabazon lieutenant anderson nineteen sikh and one of the dragoon guard be in pekin but we have have no communication with they yet -lrb- sidenote : pali-chiao -rrb- _ pali-chiao -- September 27th _ -- i close my last letter somewhat in haste for i have be separate for three day from it and my desk and when we meet again i be busy with my despatch & c the arrest of parke and the other be a very disagreeable incident and we do not yet know what it may lead to i send word yesterday to the emperor 's brother who be now name to treat with I that unless they be return to the camp within three day ' time and a pledge be give that the convention i draw up at tientsin be sign pekin will be assault we be anxious until we receive a answer to this _ ultimatum _ it be a reply to a letter from the prince to I in which he coolly state that the prisoner should be return when we army and fleet have retire from the country meantime we have a army in excellent health abundantly supply and which in five action with the enemy have lose some twenty kill i think i tell you at the close of my last letter that at midnight on the 18th i receive a note in pencil from the general tell I what have lead to the conflict of that day at 330 be i send a answer by crealock and at five set off with a escort of thirty irregular to ride about twenty mile to the general 's camp we then agree that the commanders-in-chief should send a notification to the chief mandarin of tung-chow to the effect that unless we countryman be forthwith restore pekin would be assault no notice be take of this so on the 21st we advance and attack a large body of tartar encamp between tung-chow and pekin i accompany the infantry and artillery during the day 's proceedings we encamp after the battle where we now be among some tree we sleep in tent but we have a house where we mess i be live with the general as my establishment have not yet be bring up from ho - see-woo i ride over yesterday to see the russian minister who with he sixteen cossack be occupy the village or rather town of chin-kia-wan which be take after the affair of the 18th it be a sad scene of desolation general ignatieff be very obliging and friendly as i have indeed find he to be throughout he and i entirely agree as to how the chinese should be fight i may be very near the close of this china business or i may be at the commencement of a new series of difficulty all be very uncertain at present the climate be pleasant here be it not for the quantity of dust which be overwhelming we have abundance of grape and some other good fruit _ September 29th _ -- at midnight of the 27th i be rouse by wade who bring I a letter from prince kung -lrb- the emperor 's brother -rrb- a good deal milder than the last but still imply that parke & c be not to be return until the treaty & c be sign the comparative mildness of the tone of this communication be clearly attributable to the firmness of my last letter and i therefore induce those with whom i act to agree to nay adhering to it in my reply i accordingly write to say that the army would advance unless the prisoner should return in the course of to-day but that i do not intend to add to the convention which i have already furnish to the chinese plenipotentiary and that i will sign that at once and close the war if they choose i hardly expect to see we friend to-day the general will not advance to-morrow but they say they will on Monday meanwhile it be rain a sort of english rain not tropical and if we have not too much of it it will do good _ October 1st _ -- yesterday morning come another letter propose that the army should retire to chin-kia-wan and that then the treaty should be sign and the prisoner restore this be clearly inadmissible as the chinese would infer from it that whenever they have a difficulty with we they have only to kidnap some of we people to bring we to term so we have again hand the matter over to the general from whose hand indeed it would not now have be take if they have not urge I to make this last overture to prince kung i do not know when they will advance _ October 3rd _ -- we have move about two mile

duty to turn a deaf ear to every overture for they restoration which have involve the slightest retrograde movement of we army or the abandonment of any demand previously prefer by I against the chinese government i have feel that any such concession on my part would have establish a most fatal precedent because it would have lead the chinese to suppose that by kidnapping englishman they might effect object which they be unable to achieve by fair fighting or diplomacy i confess that i have be moreover throughout of opinion that in adopt this uncompromising tone and boldly set the national above the personal interest i be in point of fact best consult the welfare of we friend who be in durance but it be not to be expect that all person would view in the same light a question of policy so obscure and apart from the warm personal interest which i feel in they safety you lordship can well understand that it relieve I from a great load of anxiety to learn from the result that

from the conscientious and liberal spirit in which he address himself to the investigation of the singularly complicated problem present by the moral social political and commercial condition of china

should leave pekin untouched -lrb- for he have engage not to harm the city -rrb- and should fall specially on the emperor who be personally responsible for the crime that have be commit he go on to discuss the different course that be open to he he might inflict a fine but it could not be exact except by appropriate a further portion of the chinese revenue already seriously trench upon by we previous demand or he might require the surrender of the individual guilty of violate the flag of truce : but if he name no one some miserable subordinate would be give up if he specify the real culprit sang-ko-lin-sin the demand would infallibly be refuse and could not be enforce dismiss these alternative he proceed : -- have to the best of my judgment examine the question in all its bearing i come to the conclusion that the destruction of yuen-ming - yuen be the least objectionable of the several course open to I unless i could have reconcile it to my sense of duty to suffer the crime which have be commit to pass practically unavenged i have reason moreover to believe that it be a act which be calculate to produce a greater effect in china and on the emperor than person who look on from a distance may suppose it be the emperor 's favorite residence and its destruction could not fail to be a blow to he pride as well as to he feeling to this place he bring we hapless countryman in order that they might undergo they severest torture within its precinct here have be find the horse and accoutrements of the trooper seize the decoration tear from the breast of a gallant french officer and other effect belong to the prisoner as almost all the valuable have already be take from the palace the army would go there not to pillage but to mark by a solemn act of retribution the horror and indignation with which we be inspire by the perpetration of a great crime the punishment be one which would fall not on the people who may be comparatively innocent but exclusively on the emperor whose direct personal responsibility for the crime commit be establish not only by the treatment of the prisoner at yuen - ming-yuen but also by the edict in which he offer a pecuniary reward for the head of the foreigner add that he be ready to expend all he treasure in these wages of assassination on Thursday the 18th of October the extensive building of the palace be give to the flame

which you have receive from I since we part and yet perhaps it will not be the one which you will welcome the least because it will convey to you the news that i have sign my treaty and that the

about it it rain yesterday and the day before and i have considerable difficulty in reading in my bed as my paper window which keep out the cold pretty well keep out also a good deal of light they be not transparent so the view through they be not lively to-day there be a beautiful sunshine and i have be walk about a little in the court before my room door the present arrangement be that we remain here till the 8th i have some difficulty in obtain this but it be of great importance that before the army go i should get a decree from the emperor sanction the publication of the treaty all over the empire the french general will not however consent to remain -lrb- sidenote : funeral of the murder captive -rrb- _ October 31st _ -- another fine day but i have not leave the house partly from consideration for the remains of my cold and partly because i have have letter to finish i have have visit from both my colleague gro and ignatieff the latter and i be always very good friend perhaps he take advantage of my simplicity but at any rate we always seem to agree remarkably he be wide awake to the jesuit intrigue here by the way i should mention that the french have a wonderful funeral on Sunday in honor of the murder captive i could not attend be in bed at the time several speech in bad taste be deliver and a remarkable series of performance take place among other thing each

a escort and parke and crealock proceed to the imperial city within which be the imperial palace we obtain access to two enclosure form part of the imperial palace appendage : both elevated place the one ascend by a pathway in regular chinese rockwork on a large scale and really striking in its way and the other be a well-wooded park-like eminence crown by temple with image of buddha the view from both be magnificent pekin be so full of tree and the house be so low that it hardly have the effect of look down on a great city here and there temple or high gateway rise above the tree but the general impression be rather that of a rich plain densely people in the distance the view be bound by a lofty chain of mountain snow-capped from the park-like eminence we look down upon the imperial palace -- a large enclosure crowd with yellow-roofed building generally low and a few tree dot among they it be difficult to imagine how the unfortunate shut up there can ever have any exercise i do not wonder that the emperor prefer yuen-ming-yuen the yellow roof intersperse here and there with very deep blue one have however a very brilliant effect in the sunshine after enjoy these view i go to the russian minister 's and find he install in a house get up _ à l'européenne _ and look very comfortable with he national stove he show I he chapel also this morning i get a letter from gro tell I that in opposition to my advice he have be to see prince kung i tell he he ought to let the prince come to he first but the jesuit think that they can curry favor with the chinese by make he _ condescend _ they be quite wrong as i be sure the result will prove the prince come to see I to-day before return gro ' visit which go for something in this land of ceremony i receive the prince with all honor and have a good deal of talk with he through the interpreter in a style which remind I of the dialogue at the commencement of ` eothen ' i have i believe secure the edict for which we have

have start at 1 be on the 6th from tientsin to ride to pekin and have be oblige by fatigue to rest at ho-see - woo we be to have leave pekin on the 8th so i be oblige to send to beg one day 's respite from the general it be impossible to make frederick start back to tientsin on the very day follow he arrival at about noon he reach pekin it be a great relief to I because i have be choose a house for he and there be other matter concern which it be most important that he should be consult i find he very well disposed to stay on at pekin but on find that both gro and ignatieff be oppose to leave they legation there for the moment we both agree that it would be better to act as they have resolve to do i therefore write to prince kung acknowledge the good faith which he have show about the emperor 's edict and the publication of the treaty -lrb- both of which thing have be do in the most complete manner -rrb- and add that the english army would in accordance with the term of the convention retire at once from pekin i go on to inform he that i propose to call on he to take leave and at the same time to introduce to he mr bruce who have just arrive at pekin we proceed accordingly to he palace at 4 pm on the 8th with a impose military escort after we have converse some time together i tell parke to explain to the prince that in england the individual who represent the sovereign whatever he personal rank always take precedence of all other that as my task in china be complete mr bruce would henceforward occupy that position and that therefore with the prince 's permission i would give up to he the seat of honor on which i be place and take he seat instead i then rise and change seat with frederick this little bit of act answer very well it put frederick into direct relation with the prince and do away with the impression -lrb- if it exist -rrb- of my have superior rank to he the prince be civil and say rather neatly that he hope they would conduct business satisfactorily not only because he be british minister but brother to lord elgin with whom he have have such pleasant relation on the follow day -lrb- the 9th -rrb- before we start he come to we abode to return we visit i make frederick receive he tell the interpreter to say that i have no business to speak of but that i should come into the room before he leave the house to take leave of he the consequence be that frederick have a long and to all appearance satisfactory conversation with he -lrb- sidenote : leave pekin -rrb- after this we set out for tung-chow we have to wait there

read write & c -rrb- on a lovely autumn day low temperature and bright sunshine i think that this wind-up at pekin be very promising it be probable that there may be some reaction when the emperor and the bad adviser whom he have about he return and even ignatieff do not choose to remain at pekin during that moment of reaction at the same time it be evident that kung who be he brother have commit himself to the peace policy and that he intercourse with we have be much more satisfactory to he than he at one time expect it be probable that the emperor will for once hear something of the truth kung will claim credit for have induce we to remove from pekin to tientsin while the fact that we be still as near as tientsin will be a _ in terrorem _ argument in support of he policy of conciliation if kung weather the difficult moment which he will have to traverse when the emperor return i have hope that all the benefit which i have expect to derive from we minister 's residence at pekin will be achieve we _ sinologue _ be fine fellow it be refresh to see they spirit and pluck wade parke and morrison all put they service at we disposal and offer to remain alone at pekin my choice however fall on a younger man of whom i have a very good opinion and who have be with I as assistant-interpreter -lrb- 12 -rrb- i think it better for many reason to leave a person who have smaller pretension than any of those i have name the gossip be that the emperor be occupy he time at jehol by marry a fourth wife -lrb- a rather expensive proceeding -rrb- and get tipsy i be afraid he be not much worth although if the papers in the vermilion pencil which we find in the summer palace be he write he be not such a fool as people suppose frederick bring with he you letter to September 10th i pray that you may now be rejoice in the belief that bruce be get on well and happily at school -lrb- sidenote : tientsin -rrb- -lrb- sidenote : its climate -rrb- _ tientsin -- November 14th _

a much drier climate than that of shanghae we have have about seven day of rain in all since i leave shangha in July frederick have nineteen day consecutively just before he leave shanghae he be not

promote by the open up of china i must say in reply that i do not think that in matter of art we have much to learn from that country but i be not quite prepared to admit that even in this department we can gain nothing from they the distinguish characteristic of the chinese mind be this -- that at all point of the circle describe by man 's intelligence it seem occasionally to have catch glimpse of a heaven far beyond the range of its ordinary ken and vision it catch a glimpse of the path which lead to military supremacy when it invent gunpowder some century before the discovery be make by any other nation it catch a glimpse of the path which lead to maritime supremacy when it make at a period equally remote the discovery of the mariner 's compass it catch a glimpse of the path which lead to literary supremacy when in the tenth century it invent the printing press and as my illustrious friend on my right -lrb- sir e landseer -rrb- have remind I it have catch from time to time glimpse of the beautiful in color and design but in the hand of the chinese themselves the invention of gunpowder have explode in cracker and harmless firework the mariner 's compass have produce nothing better than the coast junk the art of printing have stagnate in stereotyped edition of _ confucius _ and the most cynical representation of the grotesque have be the principal product of

year ago at the time when i announce to they that it be my intention to seek a treaty in pekin itself if i could not get it before i arrive there i make this observation -- that when force and

in favor of the maintenance of a large army native and european there be a good deal that be circular and puzzling to a beginner when i ask why so considerable a native army be require i be tell that the native must bear a certain proportion to the european force that european can not undertake cantonment duty or speak generally any of the duty which the military may from time to time be call to render in support of the civil power during peace that in war again they be admirable on the battle-field but that they can not turn they victory to account by follow up a discomfited foe unless they have the aid of native troops nor perform many other service which be not less indispensable than great battle to success against a enemy who know the ground and be inure to the climate this line of argument very naturally raise the question wherefore then be the maintenance of so large a european army necessary rebellion have be crush and european troops be not suit for the repression of such local disturbance as occasionally occur there be little present prospect of war from without though persium be move towards herat and apparently prepare for dost mohammed 's death the answer which i

' if you draw from all this the inference that what you really dread be you native army you get into the vicious circle again do not suppose that i be tempt by these logical paradox to run to hasty conclusion i be aware that for many reason we must now entertain and probably shall long find it necessary to entertain a large army native and european in indium practically what we have to do be to endeavor by a judicious system of recruit organization and distribution to render we army as serviceable and as little a source of peril as may be but i do think that they go far to prove that notwithstanding we vast physical superiority to anything which can be bring against we we should find it a difficult task to maintain we authority in indium by the sword alone and that they justify a very jealous scrutiny of all scheme of expenditure for military object which render necessary the imposition or maintenance of tax which occasion general discontent or deprive the government of the

improvement to a greater degree even than those of great britain for no doubt if the quality of the indian product be so far raise as to admit of its compete on term approach to equality with that of america it would obtain a permanent footing in the great market to which it have access now only at moment of extraordinary dearth moreover i do not scruple to confess to you that i be not so bigoted in my adhesion to the dogma of political economy as to be unwilling at a season of crisis like the present to entertain proposal for accelerate this result merely because they contravene the principle of that science on the contrary i receive thankfully suggestion for accomplish a object which i have so much at heart more especially when they emanate from person deeply interested and thoroughly conversant with the subject like yourself -- even when they fall within the category of what you style ` extraordinary measure ' but you will surely allow that the _ onus probandus _ lie very heavily on a government which adopt measure of this class and that if by abnormal interference it check the natural and healthy operation of the law of demand on capitalist and cultivator it incur a weighty responsibility even as regard the specific recommendation which you have make and which have much to justify it in my eye -- because i would go great length in the direction of aid the ryot to improve they staple if i could see my way to effect this object without do more harm than good -- i must observe that there be question which have to be very gravely and carefully examine before it can be act upon in the first place it be right that i should tell you that the opinion which obtain here respect the result of recent operation in dharwar in so far as the case furnish a precedent for the interference of government officer in such matter differ widely from that entertain by you but set this point aside and assume for the sake of argument that the interposition at dharwar be attend by unmixed benefit to all concerned do it follow that corresponding success would accompany the mission of fifty military officer to the cotton district of indium for the purpose of induce the ryot to substitute exotic for native cotton in they cultivation in order to do this exotic cotton justice it must be treat with some care especially at the time of its introduction into district where it have be previously unknown condition of climate as well as of soil must be take into consideration in determine the time and method of cultivation the climate of dharwar where the monsoon meet differ widely from that of many part of indium where the season be divide between a deluge of rain and a period of bake heat be i likely to find fifty young military officer who would be competent to advise the ryot on point of so much delicacy and if the ryot follow they counsel be disappoint in the expectation which they have be lead to form what would be the effect on the prospects of cotton cultivation in indium i do not say all this in condemnation of you scheme but in order to point out to you how much have to be think of before it can be act upon meanwhile there be measure for promote the interest of cotton cultivation in indium which the government can adopt without abandon its proper sphere of action not only without danger but with a high probability perhaps i might say a

momentous question we must in the first place be careful lest we suffer ourselves to draw erroneous conclusion from the warm expression of gratitude and affection lavish upon canning by the native generally if i be to venture to compare great thing with small i should say that they feeling towards he be due to cause somewhat similar to those which earn for I the good will and confidence of the french canadian in canada both he and i adopt on some important point view more favourable to the subject race than those which have be entertain by we respective predecessor so far we establish legitimate and substantial claim on they regard but it be not so much the intrinsic merit of those view still less be it the extent to which we act upon they which win for we the favor of those race we owe that mainly to the uncompromising hostility the bitter denunciation and the unmeasured violence which the promulgation of those view provoke from those who be regard by they as they oppressor i use often to say to my scotch friend in lower canada when they be heap every indignity upon I and even resort to open violence -lrb- for there they do not hold they hand off -rrb- ` you be play my game i want to win the confidence of the french canadian but i know the nature of that people : they be touchy and suspicious as race who feel that they be inferior and believe that they be oppressed invariably be by measure of simple justice towards they -lrb- and beyond that line i do not intend to proceed a inch -rrb- i despair of be able to effect my object but if you continue for a year to act as you be now act denounce I as you enemy and they friend and prove the sincerity of you belief by outrage and violence you will end by convince they that i be to be trust and i shall win the day ' -- the result prove the accuracy of this prediction the feeling of the native of indium towards canning be in some measure due to a similar cause the clamor for blood and indiscriminate vengeance which rage around he and the abuse pour upon he because he would not listen to it impart in they eye to act which carry justice to the verge of severity the grace of clemency -lrb- sidenote : -lrb- 2

be much too small to be a source of anxiety and unless they take the initiative it be my opinion that there can be no important rise the mussulman of delhus be a contemptible race fanatic be very rare on this side of the sutlej the terror of that period when every man who have two enemy be sure to swing be not forget the people declare that the work of nadir shah be as nothing to it he execution be

man who alone have the will and power to put a arrest on this course of proceeding and to prevent its extension all over the land no doubt as i have say canning earn a substantial claim to the gratitude of the native chief by adopt a more liberal and considerate policy towards they than that pursue by he predecessor it be perhaps not surprising that he should have do so situate as we be in this country -- a small minority rule a vast population that differ from we in blood civilisation color and religion monopolise in we own territory all position of high dignity and emolument and exercise even over state ostensibly independent a paramount authority -- it be manifest that the question of how we ought to treat that class of native who consider that they have a natural right to be leader of man and to occupy the first place in indium must always be one of special difficulty if you attempt to crush all superiority you unite the native population in a homogeneous mass against you if you foster pride of rank and position you encourage pretension which you can not gratify partly because you dare not abdicate you own function as a paramount power and partly because you can not control the arrogance of you subject of the dominant race scindiah and holkar be faithful to we just in proportion as they be weak and conscious that they require we aid to support they against they own subject or neighbor : and among the bitterest of we foe during the mutiny be native who have be court in england canning see the evil which the crush policy of he predecessor be entail and he reverse it it be a happily time change of policy the rebellion break out while it be yet recent and no doubt the hope and gratification inspire by it have they effect in induce a certain number of chief to pause and to require more conclusive proof that the british raj be to kick the beam before they cast they weight into the opposite scale of the balance after the rebellion be suppress the inducement to persevere in this line of policy be still more stringent to grant to native potentate who be tremble in they shoe and ready to receive the boon on any term which you might prescribe the reversion of state which have become vacant because you have of you own authority and mere motion hang they chief and declare they to be escheat be a wise a graceful and under the circumstance a perfectly safe policy the same may be say of the measure take to put the talookdar of oude on they leg and which be precede by the confiscation of all they property i believe that this policy like the policy of clemency be sound and right in principle but in form a just estimate of its success and of its applicability to all season and emergency it be necessary to take into account the speciality of the time to which i have refer -lrb- sidenote : -lrb- 3 -rrb- assertion of british sovereignty -rrb- what then be the scope and extent of application which canning in action be prepare to give to this policy here be the important question and it be not altogether a easy one to answer for like most wise administrator can deal with the concrete rather than the abstract and it would not be difficult to cull from he decision sentiment and sentence which seem to clash when you meet with a individual ruling which appear not to tally with what you have assume to be he general principle you say it be ` unnatural ' this be one way out of the difficulty but be it the right way my own opinion be that canning never intend to let the chief get the bit into they mouth or to lose he hold over they it be true that he ride they with a loose rein but the pace be so kill during the whole of he time that it take the kick out of they and a light hand and silken thread be all that be require he policy of deference to the authority of native chief be a means to a end the end be the establishment of the british raj in indium and when the means and the end come into conflict or seem likely to do so the former go to the wall even in the case of the chieftainship of amjherra he look as the yankee say ` ugly ' when scindiah have get what he want show a disposition to withhold the grant to loyal individual which he have volunteer to make from the revenue of the chieftainship it be true that the ostensible ground of canning 's dissatisfaction be the violation of a promise but what title have he to claim this promise or to exact its fulfilment if the escheat belong as of right to scindiah again when i come to this country i find that he be walk pretty smartly into a parcel of people in central indium who be get up a little rebellion on they own account a tempest in a teapot not against we but against they own native ruler in this instance he interfere no doubt as head policeman and conservator of the peace of all indium but observe if we lay down the rule that we will scrupulously respect the right of the chief to do wrong and resolutely suppress all attempt of they subject to redress they wrong by violence which in the absence of help from we be the only redress open to they we may find perhaps that it may carry we somewhat far -- possibly to annexation -- the very bugbear from which we be seek to escape holkar for instance unless common fame traduce he have rather a itch for what mr laing call ` hard rupee ' he subject and dependent have decide and not altogether unintelligible objection to certain method which he adopt for indulge this propensity when they -- those of they more especially who have treaty claim to we protection come to we to complain and to ask we help -- be we to say to they : -- ` we have too much respect for holkar 's independence to interfere bight or wrong you have better book up for we be bind to keep the peace and we shall certainly be down upon you if you kick up a row ' in the anomalous position which we occupy in indium it be surely necessary to propound with caution doctrine which logically apply land we in such dilemma -lrb- sidenote : problem for a time of peace -rrb- at a future time if i live and remain here it be possible that i may take the liberty of submit to you some view of my own on these question it may perhaps turn out that a time of peace be better fit than one of revolution for the discovery of the true theory accord to which we relation with native state ought to be conduct or it may be for the discovery that no theory can be frame sufficiently elastic to fit all those relation and the complication which arise out of they and that after all we must in a great measure rely on the rule of common sense and of the thumb when the circumstance of the time be such that it be deem right and proper to abrogate all law and to establish over the land a reign of terror and of the sword -- to pour out in deference to the paramount claim of the safety of the state public money whether obtain from present taxation or the mortgage of posterity with profusion absolutely uncontrolled -- to decree confiscation on a scale of unprecedented magnitude it be obvious that a reputation for clemency economy and respect for the native rights of property be obtainable under condition that be not strictly normal if you want to ascertain whether you system will stand in all weather you must test it when the rule of law and order have replace that of arbitrary will -- when man present themselves not as the scared recipient of bounty but as the assertor of admit rights we shall see how far in such piping time it may be possible for the governor-general to enforce on the british local authority the claim of public economy without resort to any interference which can be suppose to militate against the hypothesis that the say authority understand a great deal better than he do what they want be and how they ought to be supply or to maintain the peace of indium without question the indefeasible title of the native chief to do what they like with they own meanwhile

possess by seem to be unwilling to listen to any statement of grievance which they may desire to make or to suspect they motive when they suggest remedy it be quite possible that such view as you instance may prevail to a considerable extent with we agitating people but it be equally certain that many who join they would indignantly repudiate the imputation of be actuate by any motive of the

profess and when they propose objectionable remedy argue against they on they own premise some of course would rather abandon they sound premise than they illogical conclusion when they be drive in this way to the wall but a large number come over to the right side when they find that the consideration of they allege grievance be approach without any prepossession against they of course this be

character on some of the most eventful page of the history of indium and both be remove at a time when expectation as to the service which they might still render to indium be at its height i shall not now dwell on the great national loss which we have all sustain in this dispensation but perhaps i may be permit to say that to I the loss be not only a public one but a private and personal calamity likewise both of these distinguish man be my contemporary both i believe i may without presumption say my intimate friend it be a singular coincidence that three successive governors-general of indium should have stand towards each other in this relationship of age and intimacy one consequence be that the burden of govern indium have devolve upon we respectively at different period of we life lord dalhousie when name to the government of indium be i believe the youngest man who have ever be appoint to a situation of such high responsibility and trust lord canning be in the prime of life and i if i be not already on the decline be at least nearer to the verge of it than either of my contemporary who have precede I indeed when i be leave england for indium lord ellenborough who be now alas the only survive ex-governor-general of indium say to I ` you be not a very old man but depend upon it you will find yourself by far the oldest man in indium ' pass from these personal topic after notice the good fortune which have place the formation of the railway system of indium in the hand of a man who have in a special manner make that subject he own he proceed to speak of the future of indian railway insist especially on a point about which he feel very strongly the necessity of they cease to depend on a government guarantee and add some practical hint for they development and extension : -lrb- sidenote : future of indian railway -rrb- but gentleman however interesting it may be to refer to the past and to dwell upon the present the most important question which we have to answer relate to the future and the most important of all in my opinion be this -- to what agency be we henceforward to look if we would desire to extend as widely as possible to all part of indium the benefit of this potent instrument of modern civilisation i have no hesitation in affirm at once in answer to this question that we must not look to a indefinite extension of a system of government guarantee for the accomplishment of this object in the first place it would be wholly unjustifiable for any one object however important to place such a strain upon we finances as this policy would involve in the second place however justifiable and necessary a system of government guarantee may be in certain circumstance it be essentially a expensive one because by secure to shareholder a minimum rate of interest on they capital it weaken in they the motive to economy and because by divide the responsibility for expenditure between government and railway official it diminish in the latter the sense of responsibility moreover the indefinite extension of a system of government guarantee be wholly incompatible with the endeavor to bring private enterprise largely into play for the execution of these work while there be a unlimited call for capital for work enjoy the protection of a government guarantee it be not to be expect that capital will be forthcoming to any extent for similar work which have not that protection for the accomplishment therefore of the great object to which i be refer we must henceforward i apprehend look to private enterprise not perhaps to private enterprise wholly unaided by the state but at any rate to private enterprise not protect by government guarantee but if so what be the condition which will entitle railway enterprise of this class to the countenance and encouragement of the government i lay it down as a fundamental principle that we ought to look to the eventual establishment of one uniform railway gauge for the whole of indium the experience of england be conclusive as to the inconvenience of a double or conflicting railway gauge after the expenditure of a untold amount of money in parliamentary conflict the broad gauge of england have be compel to take the narrow gauge on its back and the whole capital expend upon the former may be say to have be throw away but what do this resolution in favor of a uniform gauge imply it will i think be admit that the main object of a uniform railway gauge be to enable the several railway line to exchange they plant in order to avoid transhipment of freight but if the plant of the subsidiary line be to be transport along the main line it must be sufficiently well finish to be fit to travel in safety at high speed and if the plant of the main line be to travel along the subsidiary line the latter must have rail sufficiently heavy and work of construction sufficiently substantial to support it moreover where stream or river be encounter they must be bridge in short the subsidiary line must be build in a manner which would make they nearly as expensive as the main line in other word railway must not be introduce into any part of indium where we can not afford to spend from 13000_l _ to 15000_l _ a mile upon they i be not prepare to accept this conclusion i have be a good deal in america and i know that we practical cousin there do not refuse to avail themselves of advantage within they reach by grasp at those which be beyond it in 1854 i travel by railway from new york to washington we have several ferry to cross on the way but we find that the railway with the ferry be much better than no railway at all in short in america where they can not get a _ pucka _ railway they take a _ kutcha _ one instead this i think be what we must do in indium there be many district where railway cost 3000_l _ or 4000_l _ a mile might be introduce with advantage although they would not justify a expenditure of from 10000_l _ to 15000_l _ a mile we have only to be careful that _ kutcha _ line be not mistake for _ pucka _ one -- that they be not allow to set up a rival system as against the main line or to occupy ground which should be appropriate by the latter -lrb- sidenote : carriage dâk to allahabad -rrb- as the railway from benare to allahabad be not yet complete lord elgin and he suite perform this part of the journey by carriage dâk they travel

crop here and there the wide-spreading dusty plain give but faint indication of the fertility which cultivation and irrigation can no doubt evolve from they even when the mountain be approach and the ascent commence the same character of barrenness attach to the scene for they side be almost bare of tree and there be little to relieve they except the patch of vegetation which lie snugly in the valley or creep in terrace up the slope no doubt the greater luxuriance in foliage and vegetation which adorn simlum be in some measure due to the presence of the european visitor who prevent the tree from be cut and protect in other way the amenity of the place but the climate and soil have also it may be presume a good deal to do with it for the tree at simlum be not only more abundant but also different from those which be meet with on the mountain nearer to the plain this probably account for what otherwise seem strange -- namely that european wish to escape from the heat of the lowland should have fix on a spot among the hill so distant from the plain it be not as inaccessible now as it be in former day because a road have be make which be practicable for cart but by this road the distance from the foot of the hill to simlum be fifty-six mile and the journey for most people occupy three or four day whereas we ascend from the foot of the hill to kussowlie which be at a elevation nearly as great as that of simlum in a little more than two hour it use to be suppose that mountain overhang the lowland be less healthy than those farther remove from they but whether this be the case or not may be doubtful however whatever may have be the reason for the original selection of simlum it certainly have now greater attraction as a residence than any spot lie between it and the

and physical obstacle which put difficulty in the way of the transfer of labor from place where it be redundant to those where it be want but to affirm generally of a country where labour-saving machine be in consequence of the cheapness of labor as little use as in indium that there be a ` want of labor ' seem to I to be a paradox i will give a example : -- if in america the climate make it necessary that every private white soldier should have a punkah pull over he day and night do you think that no agency but that of the human hand in its rudest and most direct application would be employ in this task and why be it otherwise in indium because labor be so cheap that necessity the mother of invention do not stimulate the ingenuity of man here as it do there far from deprecate the introduction of capital i should be delighted to hear that the amount to be spend in indium this year be to be three time what it promise to be i do not say to be spend by government for to this there be objection altogether irrespective of the question of the amount of labor available the first effect of this enlarged expenditure would no doubt be to raise the wages of labor this would be in itself a blessing for which i should thank god but its second and more permanent effect would be to increase the number of the class of skilled labourer which the patient sober and ingenious population of indium be fit to supply in so great abundance if due encouragement be give and further to drive capitalist to the substitution of machinery for brute human labor to a greater extent than be the practice now the ultimate result would therefore be to render the exist stock of labor doubly productive the fruit of this increase productiveness be divide in proportion more or less equitable between the labourer and capitalist i believe that the railway expenditure be already exercise a sensible influence of this salutary character body of navvy be become attach to the company who follow they from place to place and render they comparatively independent of the local supply of labor and above all by call forth native talent in the form of skilled labor they be impart that kind of education which will i believe do more for the elevation of the mass than any other which we can provide in indium \* \* \* \* \* _ to h s maine esq _ camp hodul : February 25 1863 -lrb- sidenote :

race than where they be homogeneous he cite strangely enough ireland where these moral influence which be of themselves generally sufficient in england and scotland be supplement by wholesale eviction on one side and murder on the other but the law of landlord and tenant be i believe the same in ireland as in england and it be quite possible that a little _ particular _ legislation which would have

missionary gathering at lahore i speak to sir r m -- on the subject when i meet he at delhus he seem to think that it have do more harm than good to the missionary cause as the presence of high official be sure to raise suspicion in the mind of the native i tell he that as regard the act of official in such matter my opinion be this : -- if a official say to I ' i think that i may with

to indium than we know what to do with i could not help give a few day ago a hint concern my canadian experience on this point when i be appoint to canada the first canadian official to whom i be

draw up a elaborate address recommend annexation to the united state allege as one of they principal reason that so long as they remain colonist they could obtain no credit in england for public

address we have 2000 mile of railway in canada in course of construction and we government debenture -lrb- 6 per cent -rrb- be sell in london at 119 higher than those of the united state government in fact we have more credit than we could always employ properly now how be this change effect simply by show a good balance-sheet a improve country and a contented people and leave capitalist to draw they own inference from these phenomenon i do not despair of see a similar state of thing in indium and it be with the view of give a impulse in this direction that i state publicly at benare the other day that we must look for the further development of we railway system to _ bonâ fide _ private enterprise aid perhaps where circumstance require it by government but not to the extension of government guarantee unguaranteed company can not get money while guarantee company be compete with they as borrower therefore if we intend to encourage the former we must let capitalist know that a limit will be put on the operation of the latter -lrb- sidenote : seat of government -rrb- as to the seat of government question i be strongly of opinion that the proper thing to do at present be to give practical effect to the provision in the indian council act which authorise the governor - general to call he council together in other part of indium besides calcutta this would give to the supreme government a more catholic character than it now possess and perhaps in some degree diminish the jealousy of calcutta influence which obtain so extensively i do not see my way towards recommend the entire abandonment of calcutta it be a important place and have certain traditional claim which it be not quite easy to set aside moreover although the calcutta community may have its fault and wayward tendency it be a influential element in we body corporate and politic and a government which know its duty may effect a great deal of good and derive no little benefit by come into contact with it for the present therefore i think that calcutta should continue to be the headquarters of government but that we should meet from time to time at other place for legislative purpose so as to qualify calcutta local association with other local association this plan will be attend of course with some trouble and expense i intend to make some inquiry to ascertain what the latter be likely to be i do not see why we should not legislate in camp if there be difficulty in provide house accommodation i should like if possible to hit upon a plan which would give we a sufficient range in choose and vary we place of meet more on all this hereafter \* \* \* \* \* _ to sir charle wood _ roorkee : march 19 1863 -lrb- sidenote : value of training at headquarters -rrb- i confess i think it very important that the head of the local government should have have some training at headquarters it be much easier for a intelligent officer who have be so train to supply a lack of local knowledge than for one who have be constantly employ in a particular province to grasp in a sufficiently comprehensive spirit the general interest of the empire and duly to appreciate the relative claim of its component part already among the high officer in the province there be a considerable disinclination to face the climate and labor of calcutta situation in the province where the work be lighter where the summer can be spend on the hill and where the holder be in a much greater degree monarch of all they survey be naturally prefer to the sweltering metropolis this preference would be strengthen if it be suppose that this provincial career be the road to the lieutenant-governorship moreover it be to be remember that the patronage exercise by these lieutenant-governor be very great indeed it be important that it should not fall too absolutely into the hand of the same local clique so much on the abstract question of general _ versus _ local experience \* \* \* \* \* _ to sir

that the work be lighter and that reputation be more easily win in the service of the minor than in that of the supreme government moreover i think it desirable that the best man should be attract to the latter service and i observe a grow disinclination to abandon good opportunity under local government for those which the supreme government have to offer a local government with plenty of hill station & c have many attraction for person who can contrive to be on good term with the lieutenant-governor i think that something be due to those who face the climate and the competition of calcutta not to mention the fact that they have opportunity of become conversant with the general business of the country beyond those which be enjoy by person whose service have be confine to any one locality

consider what oriental society be when i reflect on the frightful corruption both of mind and body to which the inheritor of wealth and station be expose -- the general absence of motive to call forth good instinct or of restraint to keep bad in check -- i own that i do not feel quite sure that even if we could sweep away all rights of sub-proprietor or tenant and substitute for the complication

opinion can be more fatal to we prestige and legitimate influence my modest ambition for england be that she should in this eastern world establish the reputation of be all-just and all-powerful but to achieve this object we must cease to attempt to play a great part in small intrigue or to dictate in case where we have not positive interest which we can avow or conviction sufficiently distinct

we ought to select some considerable town -- the capital of a province or local government if possible what we wish to do be to give effect to the scheme embody in the ninth clause of the council act and we should do so in such a manner as to carry public opinion with we if the plan answer we may exercise a greater liberty of choice on future occasion i adhere to the opinion which i first express that on the whole lahore be the place which unite the greatest number of advantage it be the capital of a province which be loyal which be under the government of indium and which moreover have a good many special characteristic of its own with which it may be well that the supreme legislature should acquaint themselves on the spot against these recommendation be to be set the greater distance from calcutta which do not affect communication by telegraph and for more bulky communication as compare with delhus be only a question of a few hour i have no wish to legislate at a purely military

inhabit it the state of affair in afghanistan and on we frontier would render a demonstration which would at once afford evidence of we military strength and gratify the pride and self-importance of

disturbance which have assume more serious proportion but it be notice here chiefly as illustrate the view which lord elgin take of the policy and duty of the british government in such case it be not without the greatest reluctance that he be induce to take up the quarrel at all : for he have the strongest aversion for warlike operation in the exist state of indium and particularly on the frontier of afghanistan and he have no small distrust of those military tendency and that thirst for opportunity of distinction which be apt to characterise the ablest governor of frontier province but he have prevent a sitana expedition in the previous year he be assure that the recent inroad of the fanatic be the direct consequence of he last year 's supineness and he be tell that if he again hold back the disturbance would be renew another year with usury moreover he be assure that the project expedition would secure the peace of the frontier for a long period and that the operation would be little more than a military promenade and would be over before he camp reach peshawur it be scarcely possible for a civil governor to resist such a pressure of professional opinion and he consent to take measure of repression write to sir charle wood on the subject he say : -- the overt act charge consist in the return of the fanatic to sitana whence they be drive out by we some year ago and the frontier tribe in question be hold to be guilty because they have allow they to return to this place although bind by treaty with we to refuse to admit they on a review of all the circumstance and look to the well-known character and design of the sitana fanatic i come to the conclusion that the interest both of prudence and humanity would be best consult by level a speedy and decisive blow at this embryo conspiracy accordingly it be arrange that the punjâb government should at once take the necessary measure for expel the fanatic from judoon where they have congregate and then if circumstance permit proceed to destroy they place of refuge at mulka but it be well know that in indium to use lord elgin 's own expression ` rise official be instinctively in favor of a good row ' some of those around he be urgent that the expedition should be defer until the spring and should then be organise on a larger scale and with more comprehensive object lord elgin set he face decidedly against this i wish -lrb- he write -rrb- by a sudden and vigorous blow to check this trouble on we frontier while it be in a nascent condition the other plan would give it several month to fester and to extend itself and if there be among the mohammedan population in these region the disposition to combine against we which be allege and which be indeed the justification of the measure propose how far might not the root of the conspiracy stretch themselves in that time the afghan in they distract state might furnish sympathiser we should be invite to interfere in they internal affair in order to oppose those among they who be abet we mohammedan adversary in short there be no end to the complication in which this postponement of active operation might involve we everything be more or less uncertain in such affair but in the absence of any very palpable blunder what we actually propose to do would appear to be a pretty safe proceed the main purpose be to expel the fanatic from judoon and it be hardly possible that we should fail in this as they be within easy reach of we there the further object -- of punish other tribe and destroy the refuge of the fanatic at mulka -- may be abandon if it be deem advisable without any loss of prestige though of course with some abatement of the completeness of the movement i therefore think it necessary to adhere to my original resolution

labourer to come to he plantation for a few day at a time chiefly for the purpose of earn money enough to pay the government assessment of they land but he opinion be that if there be no assessment no labor would be procurable we have not yet come across much tea the plantation we have see be on a very small scale and in a nascent condition but they be promising there seem no reason to doubt that the climate and a certain portion at least of the soil in this district be suit to the growth of tea the climate too do very well for the european constitution though it be hardly as healthy as i expect to find it both native and european be subject to fever at certain season especially in the valley but i have no doubt that the latter may do well as employer of labor this place -lrb- sultanpore -rrb- be only about 4000 foot above the level of the sea and i have little doubt that be the state of cultivation and trade to justify the outlay a cart road might be make to it without

engage my attention it be sad to see how they have be neglect and how much waste of valuable timber have ensue the native have a practice of girdle fine tree at a few foot from the root in order to strip off as much of the bark as they can conveniently reach it be rather a difficult practice to check but if we can manage to draw a line between the wood in which the villager have rights and the
