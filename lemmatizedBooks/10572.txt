find a bottle o ' whisky as the skipper ` ad say i sit down on the locker and ` ad a glass and then i sit worrying and wonder wot be to be the end of it all the whisky warm I up a bit and i ` ad just take up the bottle to ` elp myself agin when i ` eard a faint sort o ' sound in the skipper 's state-room i put the bottle down and listen but everything seem deathly still i take it up agin and ` ad just pour out a drop o ' whisky when i distinctly ` eard a hissing noise and then a little moan for a moment i sit turn to stone then i put the bottle down quiet and ` ad just get up to go when the door of the state-room open and i see the drownded gal with ` er little face and hair all wet and drip standing before I ted sawyer ` as be tell everybody that i come up the companion-way like a

once wot be the matter when i get my breath back a bit and tell 'em they laugh all except the cook and ' e say it be only wot i might expect then like a man in a dream i see the gal come out of the companion and walk slowly to the side ` look ' i ses ` look there she be ' ` you be dream ' se the skipper ` there be nothing there ' they all say the same even when the gal step on to the side and climb on to the wharf she come along towards I with ` er arm hold close to ` er side and make the most ` orrible face at I and it take five of 'em all they time to ` old I the wharf and everything seem to I to spin round and round then she come straight up to I and pat I on the cheek ` pore old gentleman ' she se ` wot a shame it be ted it be too bad ' they let go o ' I then and stamp up and down the jetty laugh fit to kill themselves if they ` ad only known wot a exhibition they be make of themselves and ` ow i pity they they would not ha ' do it and by and by ted wipe he eye and put he arm round the gal 's waist and se -- ` this be my intended miss florrie price ' he se ` be not she a little wonder wot d'ye think of ` er ' ` i 'll keep my own opinion ' i ses ' i be not get nothing to say against gal but if i only lay my hand on that young brother of ` ers ' they go off agin then worse than ever and at last the cook come and put ` be skinny arm round my neck and start splutter in my ear i shove ` im off hard because i see it all then and i should ha ' see it afore only i do not ` ave time to think i do not bear no malice and all i can say be that i do not wish ` er any
