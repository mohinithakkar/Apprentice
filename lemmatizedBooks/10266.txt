personality x the type of personality xi some historic personage xii application and possibility xiii the effect upon human evolution the gland regulate personality introduction attitude toward human nature the case against human nature man know thyself say the old greek philosopher man perforce have take that advice to heart he life-long interest be he own species in the cradle he begin to collect observation on the nature of the queer being about he as he grow the research continue amplify broaden wisdom he measure by the devastating accuracy of the datum he accumulate when he declare he know human nature consciously cynical maturity speak doctor of human nature -- every man feel himself entitle to that degree from the university of disillusioning experience in defense of he claim only the limitation of he articulate faculty will curb the vehemence of he indictment of he fellow for all history provide the material literature the critique biology the inexorable logic of the case against human nature the historical record be a spectacle of man destroy man a collection of chapter on man 's increase cruelty to man limitation of time and space have be shorten and eliminate tool of production have be multiply and complicate the source of energy and power have be systematically attack and trap but the nature of man have remain so unchanged that clap trap about progress be easy target for the barrage of every cheap pamphleteer the naturalist probe into code of conduct system of morality structure of society variation in the scale of value that individual race and nation have subject themselves to as custom law and religion again and again the portrait be present of man prey upon man of cunning a parasite upon stupidity and of predatory strength enslave the weakling intellect until finally be evoke reaction and consequence that overtake in catastrophe and cataclysm preyer and prey upon alike human nature be but part of the magnificent tree of beast nature man be link by every tie of blood and bone and cell memory with he brethren of the sea the jungle the forest and the field the beast be a seeker of freedom but a seeker for he own ego alone and the satisfaction of he own instinct only thus he struggle to a sort of freedom which make he the ishmael of the universe everyone 's hand against he as he own hand be against everyone the human animal have achieve no advance beyond the necessity of he ancestor nor free himself from he bondage to they instinct and automatic reflex and so the sociologist the analyst of human association turn out to be simply the historian and accountant of slavery yet the history of mankind be too a long research into the nature of the machinery of freedom all record history indeed be but the documentation of that research view thus custom law institution science art code of morality and honor system of life become invention come upon try out standardized establish until scrap in everlasting search for more and more perfect means of free body and soul from they congenital thralldom to a host of innumerable master indeed the history of all life vegetable and animal of bacillus elephant orchid gorilla as well as of man be the history of a search for freedom freedom what to a living creature be freedom how completely have it dominate the life history of every creature that ever crawl upon the earth trace we cellular pedigree descend we family tree to its rootlet we amebic ancestor and the craving for more freedom be manifest in the soul of even the lowest bury in darkness and slime when the first clever bit of colloidal ooze protoplasm as the ameba protrude a bit of itself as a pseudopod it achieve a new freedom for accidentally or deliberately it create for itself a new power -- the ability to go directly for food in its environment instead of wait patiently passively as the plant do for food to just happen along therewith develop in place of the previous quietist pacifist quaker attitude toward its surroundings a new religion a new tone : aggressive predatory careerist that adventure be a great step forward for the ameba -- a miracle that free it forever from the danger of death by starvation but latent in that move be all the terrible possibility of the tiger the alligator the wolf and all the variety of predaceous beast and plant parasitism and slavery the device that enable the ameba to change its position in space of its own will and so increase its freedom immeasureably mean the generation of infinite evil pain suffering and degradation for billion in the womb of time the breeding of inferiority human history be a continuation of vertebrate history be full of similar instance the invention of the stock company for example furnish a certain relative freedom to hundred a certain amount of leisure to think and play and independence to travel and record and immunity from a daily routine and drudgery in turn it bear fruit in misery and horror multiply for million like those of the child lacemaker of mid-victorian england who be drag from they bed at two or three o'clock in the morning to work until ten or eleven at night in the service of a stock company a corporation be say to have no soul the struggle for freedom of every living thing have no conscience throughout the living world from ameba to man parasitism and slavery together with they by-product physical and spiritual degeneracy appear as the after effect of the more vital individual 's effort to remain alive and free the origin of slavery may be see in the parasitism of the infectious disease which kill man the change from parasitism to slavery be a inevitable step of creative intelligence in the transition evolution make one of those break which it indulge in periodically as its mode of progress the natural effect of slavery have be a selection of two sort of individual along the line of the survival of the adapt it have tend to perpetuate in the breed the quality of the strong which would make they stronger and certain quality in the weak which would increase they weakness for parasitism and likewise slavery infallibly entail the degradation of certain structure and a overgrowth of other by the law of use and disuse the type of organ which would function normally be not its possessor parasitic in that function invariably degenerate or disappear parasitic insect lose they wing a entire anatomical system may even be lose so the tapeworm which feed upon the digest food present in the intestine of its host have no alimentary canal of its own because it need none on the other hand the organ of attack and combat grow by a constant use into the most remarkable of efficient weapon in human society the process continue out of the tapeworm nature the tiger nature the wolf nature the simian nature human nature evolve repeat episode of subjugation and suppression mixed with countless incident of predaceous cupidity and rapacity have make man what he be today indeed by a sort of instinct society have construct its institution upon empirical observation and assumption agree with this principle the deduction concern human nature and human trait that a interplanetary visitor would draw from a study of we common law would be at least slightly humiliating to we incorrigible pride law court code of civil contract and criminal procedure the system of subordination in army and navy caste and class man and woman employer and employee teacher and pupil parent and child be base upon the fundamental the conservative axiom that man especially the common plain man -lrb- lincoln 's phrase -rrb- be a be incurably lazy stupid dishonest muddle cowardly greedy restless obsess with a low cunning and a selfish callousness and insensibility to the suffering of he fellow creature animal and human why be it that man the noblest creature of creation make in the image of god capable of the flight of attainment that distinguish a christ a caesar a plato a shakespeare a shelley a newton be so describe not alone by hopeless pessimist like koheleth swift and mark twain but by the common law the common opinion the common assumption of mankind because the development of slavery and parasitism in human society the subjection of the weak to the strong the dull and base to the clever and headstrong set up a vicious cycle : the liberation of more energy for the making of more and more slave and the propagation of slave and slave quality in a geometrically increase proportion this might be call the _ malthusian law of slavery _ for the quality that i have name as man 's own characterization of himself be the quality of the slave and the slave-soul nietzche take great pain to repeat ad nauseam that these quality be the quality of the slave but by burden himself with the hypothesis evolve from he inner consciousness that the slave impose from below a morality of weakness upon they master he miss the really obvious process by which slave beget more slave slavery beget more slavery and the slave-soul become universal that process be the simple action of physical and spiritual reproduction of the slave the subnormal beget the subnormal the inferior beget the inferior slavery appear as a invention of the would-be-free it be a brilliant flash of genius of a seeker after freedom however it become a boomerang by multiplication and hereditary transmission the inferiority and the number of the slave create a new overwhelming problem for the superior few the upper crust of the free at last the problem grow into the problem of problem the problem of government that threaten all freedom as a epidemic disease threaten even the most healthy government at first organize for conquest and subjugation have to change its character until it become more and more to consist of experiment in a new social machinery that would free somebody of the incubus so through the century one technique of liberty after another be test in the laboratory of experience but always the attempt be so muddle because the problem be not grasp muddledom be the essence of the slave-soul and the essence infiltrate and poison the whole atmosphere in which the would-be-free think and act king ' head be chop off a whole class be guillotine reform movement come and go the master fight every inch of they retreat and pile stratagem upon stratagem device upon device to retain they spoil the democratic formulum of freedom for all come to the fore so at last universal suffrage be introduce as the panacea freedom seem within grasp now it look as if a method and a objective have be hit upon that will lead both the free and the enslave out of they mutual bondage and release the handcuffs which have bind they together all the trial and error test to which history have subject institution appear to culminate in the formulum that would automatically yield liberty the french want a little more and add equality and fraternity the american put it quite definitely as the formulum that would assist the pursuit of life liberty and happiness that formulum be : the _ democracy of the normal _ to be sure a civilization might be organize for the breeding and the glorification of the supernormal such a civilization may yet have to be try but as the supernormal as we know they today be merely biologic sport in a sense simple accident no one can tell whether they will turn out true shot or just flash in the pan so it look the better course to stick to the plan of nature which seem to be the raising of the level of the normal and the gradual increase of they faculty and power what the statesman be up against under the term of the democratic formulum the problem of the statesman seem to become enormously simplify that be if one assume that he have work out a perfectly clear idea of what a democracy mean and what the normal means assume these unassumable he problem simplify into the definite object of produce and develop the greatest possible number of normal -- or if you will the greatest happiness of the greatest number of normal life furthermore you then begin to have the entirely novel possibility in the world : some sort of collective effort for a collective purpose beyond the personal greed and fear faction and hatred so the state instead of fulfil its old function of serve as the tool of certain powerful individual latterly know as the big man might be transform into a instrument toward freedom with the ideal of a democracy of the normal ever before he the statesman could go on to construct and modify he social machinery that would entail the satisfaction not alone of the animal need but also the highest aspiration and therefore the provision of the finest condition of life for the normal : those most favorable stimulative and assistant to creative activity for what else be the content of the idea of freedom without commit the intellectual sin which william jame name vicious abstractionism the goal of the clearest progressive and liberal thought and force of the twentieth century might be sum up as this freedom in a democracy of normal a good formulum which coincide with the technique of nature in the evolution of species a fair fight a free-for-all who be unhandicapped be the motto of natural selection where civilization shake hand with natural instinct what but the happiest of result can be expect unfortunately the formulum in human society possess a achille ' heel again it be slavery where slavery have become breed into the bone the standard of the normal become reduce so tremendously that the average of normal the majority be hopelessly inferior in effect they be really subnormal so the ideal of we ideal statesman be bind to be defeat because of the inadequacy of he material no matter how interested in he main business : the promotion of freedom for creative activity in a democracy of the normal he be bind to be beat by the majority consist of subnormal there be nothing leave for he but to cater to the minority of careerist the one-eighth of the electorate represent superior intelligence the intelligence test employ in the war show that and also that forty-five per cent of the examine or about one half the total population have a mental capacity or natural ability that would never develop beyond the stage normal to a twelve-year-old child they be doom to remain forever subnormal the careerist as the abnormal the careerist be those who practice the careerist religion the careerist religion be the religion par excellence of modernity someone once say with the perfect candor of the north american that america be the land of opportunity he mean that america be the land of the careerist or as it have also be put it be the land of the man on the make the careerist or the man on the make be of a thousand genus and species variety and subvariety with transition link between one find he at every level of society except a negligible minority the feminine career of today -lrb- as of the last ten thousand year of the race 's history -rrb- consist in the acquisition of a husband after that she be so identify with he that she own life as something distinct individual and unique become blur and then completely erase the feminine careerist the careeristina if you will be a definite type consider the unimportance of a collective purpose to the woman whose career be the mate and then the mate 's career all the kink and twist of the feminine mind result from the necessity of that fundamental primary problem would form a multitudinous and interesting list the most successful careeristina be the absolutely unconscious one because they be not passively besiege nor actively bombard by any doubt as to what they want they play they game exceedingly well as do not the quasi-rebel and faint-hearted revoltee that form no small percentage of the newest woman for a number of woman the feminist movement have be a attempt to break away from the tradition of the wife-careerist and to strike a line of auto-careerism can the careeristina instinct the fruit of the practice of so many generation be uproot by the good intention of a mere statesman but the masculine careerist be a marvelous creature he be a biologic sport a abnormal variation new york be the place to watch and study he in he thousand and ten of thousand you can observe he climb climb climb precisely as a ant climb a tree nothing can really discourage or sway he from he choose path if he be not get on financially he be get on socially or he be use the one method of advance to help he with the other how the line of least resistance and greatest advantage be determine for and take by he be a fascinating process the careerist instinct the inherit flair for a career must not be confound with the instinct of self-preservation self-expansion or self-expression because they be utterly different indeed the careerist instinct be often they direct antagonist clash with and dominate they the making of the career involve the distortion the mutilation degradation degeneration or even the complete suppression of the true personality but it be all instinctive to consider the life of the careerist as a expression of instinct will explain too the success of so many who have no inner awareness of what they want these go straight for the career look neither to the right nor to the leave without doubt or hesitation just as they go for the respiration business as soon as they be bear then there be the super-careerist ordinarily the careerist be rather obvious easily recognizable with diaphanous motive and conduct but there be another and rarer bird the careerist of talent even the careerist of genius whom it be not so easy to see through clever and brainy he may be a good all around trifler or he specific gift for some line of achievement may make he more effective there be nothing he may not call himself : conservative liberal progressive or radical often he be a agnostic about social and political affair and problem which pass for the indecision of the open mind and be quite handy to render he all thing to all man but perpetually the underlie careerist instinct drive he to use all man and woman all idea and movement and force he come in contact with for he own personal advancement just as the slave make instinct guide the red ant in all its activity to procure its captive idea do not make a hero out of he but he make hero of idea because they serve he in he ascent because he be the most subtle the most complex and the most deceptive type of careerist he be the most dangerous to the adventure and speculation in intellect which mankind be to say that he be a wolf in sheepskin be to be unjust to he since he be most successful when he be most unaware of he own charlatanry he be most sincere when he be most insincere and most truthful when he lie best a little self-consciousness of hypocrisy be a corrupting thing much of it completely incompatible with the most successful careerism tartuffe be always applaud by the world when he play hamlet if he really believe in himself as hamlet and as all he have to do if he be at all talented be to look into he glass and see himself in the part he carry it off very well why the statesman fail slave and careerist subnormal and abnormal be the important element of the constituency of every modern statesman the financial and social careerist as business man professional artist publicist president of country politician philosopher dominate he outlook he plan he horizon the slave the inferior the subnormal exist merely to be exploit by they no one question the cause of the multiplicity of they no one ask why there be so many little life for a fundamentally mind statesman the control of the production of the careerist why he be produce and how he may be prevent become the primary problem of he art well you say what be you go to do about it that be human nature the evil of human nature there be the perpetual answer to be repeat by we clever editor unto eternity you can not get away from human nature it be human nature to be a careerist it be human nature to put the immediate triumph of the self and its pleasure above the more indirect the more remote and distant benefit of a great wonderful free community we be all careerist in so far as democracy have succeed as a form it have persist because there be in it for the common man the promise of he get more out of life that way than any other way for himself and the devil take the other the myopia of such crude selfishness continue to determine he politics to this very day and so he proceed to vote for favor bestow and patronage past or potential that be when he do not throw he ballot away altogether into the fire of family habit sectional inertia or race prejudice again you say that be human nature it be human nature for we to be narrow to be confine within the circle of personal thought and desire without imagination for the beyond so the calf be limit in its wanderings to the radius of the rope by which it be tethered the servile soul will always be submissive and docile greedy and stupid what else could you expect from the descendant of the solitary beast who once live for thousand of year in cave without servility of the soul without chain for the spirit of the wild animal against the world man could never have be drive to live together for twenty-four hour in community the conception of human quality out of which all social machinery have be devise and build be a conception of slave quality and careerist quality as we be all catch in the net as the unconscious memory of we slave and careerist ancestor flow in we blood and echo in we cell all we can do be accept it and work with it human nature be a incurable disease like jehovah 's definition of himself it be it have be and ever will be everywhere the same always the same forever the same there be no way out poor human nature all of these stricture upon poor human nature be exceedingly delightful to we careerist every unpleasant social fact every outrage to we best instinct every exhibition of incapacity incompetency inefficiency indifference every example of super-criminal negligence be pardon as a effect of that universal sin human nature take the case of the statesman and the diplomat who fail to prevent the great war though they see it come for year and who should therefore all entente as well as german american as well as japanese be indict for they criminal negligence precisely as a physician would be for failure to report and stop the spread of a epidemic disease all these crime of omission and commission be excuse on the plea that it be all due to human nature and that what can be blame on human nature in general can be blame on no one in particular poor human nature flagellate on every hand what be we to do with it why be the careerist so numerous and ubiquitous why do the slave-soul infiltrate like a cancer the soul of society with its black fluid be freedom the divine idea nothing but the toy of a orator to the majority a distant star in the night to a helpless minority yet the instinct to freedom the appetite for freedom flicker through the century as a fitful flame though snuff out by every gust of class passion every wind of mob resentment and every storm of national jealousy though the inferior subnormal multiply into great sheep majority and the careerist like napoleon morbid variant involve million in they disease the idea of freedom persist obstinately have we any reason for regard it as other than a illusion if freedom be a illusion we must admit the doom of democracy and no wagnerian crash of orchestration mitigate the tragedy of the scene as we eye be open to the twilight of we new god for what other social method be there leave to we in the struggle against nature 's barrier upon human aspiration for perfect satisfaction it look as though every other method have fail we in the past refined aristocracy and benevolent despotism have fail as miserably as we democracy be now fail and as we be sure crude anarchism and communism would they inferiority have throw they on the scrap heap as for we present way of government as a permanent method the storage of power in the hand of the clever few war burn in the lesson of how little the careerist regard either the subnormal or supernormal he condemn they all sooner or later to wholesale slavery and carnage be man then never to be the architect of he own destiny be we to surrender we faith in the future of we kind to the spectacle of a miserable species sentence by its own nature to self-destruction we think to rise upon the wing of knowledge and beauty lure by the mystery of color and the magic of design and the might of the intellect and its word that have transfigure life into the greatest adventure ever attempt in time and space but we find ourselves merely another experiment intricate and rather long draw out to be sure with marvelous pyrotechnics magnificent effect here and there but bind to eliminate itself in the end to make stuff for the museum of the real conqueror of the star yet to come we be condemn to be class with the dodo and the mammoth by the come discoverer of a escape from the slave and careerist and so let we resign ourselves to fate let we eat of the humble bread of the stoic 's consolation in the face of the mock laughter of the god let we admit that mind in man have unconsciously but irretrievably will its own self-annihilation what remain for we except to beat we breast and proclaim : so be it o lord so be it man as a transient yet true as it be that the human animal have achieve no advance beyond the necessity of he ancestor nor free himself from he bondage to they instinct and automatic reflex be there no way out anywhere be there perhaps some ground for hope and consolation in the thought that we of the twentieth century no longer see ourselves man as something final and fixed darwin change fate from a static sphinx into a chameleon flux just as certainly as man have arise from something whose bone alone remain as reminder of he existence we be persuade man himself be to be the ancestor of another creature differ as much from he as he from the chimpanzus and who if he will not supplant and wipe he out will probably segregate he and allow he to play out he existence in cage city the vision of this after-man or from-man be really about as helpful to we as the water of the oasis mirage be to the lose die of thirst in the desert the outcry of the wretched and miserable the gray-and-dreary live din a unmanageable tinnitus in we ear like god it may be but a large vague idea toward which we grope to snuggle up against it seem implicit in the doctrine of evolution but how do we know that in man the spiral of life have not reach its apex and that now even now the vortex of its descent be not begin how do we know that the from-man be to be a superman and not a subman how can we dare to hope that the slave-beast-brute be to give birth to a heir fine and free and superior we do not know and we have every indication and induction for the most oppositely contrary conclusion life have blunder supremely in while make brain its darling forget or helplessly surrender to the egoism of alimentation so it have spawn a conflict between its organ and a consequent impasse in which the lower centre drive the higher pitilessly into devise means and instrument for the suicide of the whole as war show plainly to the most stupidly gross imagination the germ of we own self-destruction as a species saturate we blood the probability loom with almost the certainty of a syllogistic deduction that such will be the outcome to we hundred of thousand of year of pain upon earth in the face of that speculation upon a comet or gaseous emanation hit the planet or the sun grow cold become babyish fancy how clearly the possibility be point in the discussion about the use in the next war of bacterial bomb contain the bacillus of cholera plague dysentery and many other what influenza do in destroy million they can repeat a thousand time and ten thousand time what else the laboratory will bring forth of which no man dream in the way of destructive agent act at long distance upon huge mass and over any extent of territory be presage in that single example but besides thus willing by a inner necessity its own annihilation life in the very structure and machinery of its be seem catch into the entanglement of a inescapable net a eternity-long bondage it can never rip to flee and remake itself into the immortal image that be its god and so there go by the board the last alleviation of those unbeatable optimist who would soothe they ache soul with at least the drop of comfort : that if man be a mortal species with not the slightest prospect of a continue immortality not to mention a glorious future and destiny there be other man after all may be simply a bad habit life will succeed in shake off no philosophy or religion can afford to be anthropocentric merely it must include all life and all live thing to which we be blood-related there be other species or latent species to take up the torch that burn poor homo sapiens and ascend the height the ant and bee may yet mutate along certain line that would make they the master of the universe but no matter what species or variety get the upper hand in the struggle for survival and power the implication of the quality necessary to victory in conflict of individual separate piece of protoplasm will be there besides life be always beget of life that be why synthetic protoplasm be nothing but a phrase it be impossible to conceive of something alive possess of the property of remember that be not possess of a store of past experience you can no more think of get rid of these unconscious memory of protoplasm than you can think of get rid of the wetness of water they be imbed in the most intimate chemistry of the primeval ameba as well as in we most complex tissue the memory of the cold lone fish and the hot predatory carnivor who be we begetter may haunt we to the end of time the bee and the ant too have weave inextricably into the woof of they cell the instinct that sooner or later would send they brain ganglion even when evolve to the pitch of perfection to elaborate the self-and-species murder invention and discovery that be apparently destine to slay we the power of unconscious memory and unlearnable technique of reaction to experience once groove thus prove the great gift and the eternal curse of protoplasm make it possible for it to be and become what it be and have they have also make it forever impossible for it to be or become its own contradiction add to this unsloughable remembrance of the past for better for worse the secretive consciousness of its present need every living thing as against every other live thing be obsess with as a peregrinate finite spatially limit be it be separate from all other live being by inorganic dead mass and yet drive to contact with they by a fundamental impulse to assimilate they into itself and make they part of itself that assimilatory urge be present in every activity from coarse ingestion as food to the moral metabolism of the hermit-saint who would influence other to do as he fate and anti-fate in effect the history of life resemble the life history of the smallest thing we know of the electron and the largest the great sun and star of space the electron begin perhaps as a swirl in the primeval ether join other electron form colony city empire element of a increase complexity through stage of a relative stability like lead or gold until it reach the stage of integration which will its own disintegration that we have be teach to look upon with proper awe and reverence as radium and we be tell that nebula wander until they collide and give birth to star star wander and collide and give birth to nebulae life begin as a quiver colloid go on painfully to build a brain which automatically refine itself to the point of discover and use the most efficient method of destroy other and by a boomerang effect itself fate the conception of fate be a greek idea the classic formulum for tragedy the struggle of man with the sequence of cause and effect within he and without that be so utterly beyond he grasp and ken or power to modify originate with they but they must also be give the credit for have conceive a idea and start a process which at first slowly and gropingly now slip and fall tear and bleeding among the thorn of the dark forest of human motive presently go on with a firmer more practice more confident step to emerge into the light as the deliberate conqueror of fate that idea-process this anti-fate be science science begin with the adventure of free-thinking speculator who revolt against religious cosmogony and superstition sceptic concern the knowledge that be the accept monopoly of the priesthood must have exist in the oldest civilization we know anything of more than twenty-five thousand year ago the aurignacian but it be to the greek that we owe that amalgamation of curiosity deliver of fear that merger of systematic research and critical think untrammelled by social inhibition which be the essence of modern science out of they have come the great tree of knowledge of we time which be too the only ygdrasil of life undying because it live upon successive generation of human brain cell science as the pursuit of the real begin with very small thing by man with very small intention inventory collection of isolate datum something permanent for the mind out of the flux of transient sensation little track and foot path in the jungle of phenomenon be they goal with no sense of themselves as the mightiest of master-builder cultivate humility toward they material at any rate the little man plough they little field strike the oil of a great generalization or classification or explanation with no fanfare of trumpet first as freak and crank then as scholar and pedant then protect and perhaps stimulate under the competitive royal patronage as society and academy they prepare for the harvest compare they to pioneer farmer sowing a undeveloped territory be really totally inadequate and inaccurate for the most part they be like coral maker laboriously construct with no vision certainly no sustained vision of the whole to the practical man of affair the shopkeeper and trader the land-owner and ship-owner the soldier and sailor the statesman and politician the people who specialize in maneuver human being and material they be for this futile devotion to abstract knowledge marked ridiculous and absurd weakling mollycoddle baby not to be trust with the demand and danger of public life but it so happen remarkably late in history that with the discovery of the possibility of coal there be a great boom in the demand for industrial machinery at the same time there be throw up the most marvelous advance in physics and chemistry recur war become not the clash of mercenary army but the catapulting of whole nation at each other new destructive device out of the laboratory be raise into the commandant of the course of history then science acquire prestige science as king science as power loom as the great new figure the overshadow novel factor in practical statesmanship unlike the factor x in the traditional equation it be the known factor par excellence the factor by which the value of all the other factor of human life will be ascertain and solve as knowledge of the condition determine all life it stand as the courageous david of the race against the goliath territory of the uncontrollable and the inevitable even the unknowable human history resolve itself into the drama : science contra fate quite a change from the vaudeville show of the restless personal ambition of vindictive fool and greedy scoundrel the mischief and adventure of half-witted genius and licensed rogue that have be figure of the prologue the future of science have become the future of the race so much of a inkling of the truth be begin to be appreciate that be ordinarily take to mean that the process by which the wessex man become the new york and london man the accumulation of accidental discovery and inspire invention of scatter individual will go on provide a succession of marvel and miracle for the careerist and he retinue not only be he to be entertain and serve by they but any commercial value will also be exploit by he the natural wonder of the laboratory have take the place of the supernatural absurdity of the medieval mind as a fillip for the imagination of the man in the street even spiritualism ape the technique of the physicist the credulity of reporter alone concern development in surgery for example be incredible there be enough rot publish daily for a brief to be make out against the idolatry of science the religion of science science also as a religion as a faith to bind man together as a substitute for the moribund old mythology and theology which keep they sundered be commence to be talk of in a more serious tone the wonder-maker may have force upon he may welcome the honor of the priest though he pose as the humble slave of nature and she secret presently the foundation and institute which coexist with the cathedral and church just as once the new christian chapel and congregation stand side by side with pagan temple and heathen shrine may oust they rival and assume the monopoly of ritual should its spirit remain fine and clear should it maintain the glorious promise of its dawn should its high priest realize the perpetually widen intimation of its universal triumph and escape the ossification that have overtake all young and hopeful thing and institution the real foundation for a future of the species would be lay and so its ultimate suicide prevent the time have go by however for any complacent assurance that the redemption of mankind be to be attain by a new religion of word there be no doubt that the damnation or salvation of a individual have often be determine by a religious crisis in which the magic of word have work they witchery there be plenty of evidence that a psychic conversion will effect a actual revolution in the whole way of living of the victim or patient as you like it william jame in he variety of religious experience establish that pretty definitely when it come to group race nation the outlook be wholly different there be a conflict of so many and diverse habit and interest belief and prejudice that hope for some common merely intellectual solvent for all of they be rather forlorn if at all the resolution of the conflict will come by a pool of actual power and interest in which the religion of science will play the great part of the liberator of mankind from the whole system of torment that have make the way of all flesh a path of rock along which a manacled prisoner crawl to he doom science and human nature science have a future the religion of science have a future can science assure we that human nature in spite of its beast-brute-slave origin hold the possibility of a genuine transformation of its texture can fate 's stranglehold upon we be break there will be certainly a tremendous a overwhelming increase in the general stock of information we call physics and chemistry and biology a abundance of new comfort novel sensation fresh experience and breath-bereaving device that will thrill or heal will follow of course in they wake the religion of science will infiltrate and penetrate and permeate by its capillary action the barbaric superstition the ridiculous rite the unsanitary insanity of we social system but what about the poor human soul itself with its inherent vice and virtue its fear and indulgence audacity and nobility jealousy shame blunder incurable likes craving and disease can science change the texture of the slave and careerist if they represent the subnormal and the abnormal what about the becky sharp the mark tapley and tom pinch not to speak of the nicholas nickleby and the hamlet the micawber and the falstaff what future have they as they recur in the generation indeed do not the very fact of they recurrence of they and of the hundred of other type and temperament point implacably to the conclusion to which the historian the philosopher and the biologist have drive we : that in the grip of a endless chain of past the human soul have no future that may appear a irrelevant a immaterial and a incompetent question to we man of business and affair human nature as fall angel or ape parvenu have always look upon itself as fix for eternity human nature never change and be everywhere and always will be the same as a man be build breed in the bone these be the axiom of we social and economic euclid indeed man assume that he nature be as uncontrollable as the course of the star have limit he research into the substance of freedom to a grope for a understanding of the adequate external condition of liberty thus he set himself another of the insoluble problem he seem to delight in by neglect the most important factor in the equation yet the invisible soul of man ignore as a variable vary quantity have upset all society and constitution and all scheme of bondage as well as of freedom for freedom it become obvious as soon as it be clearly state be sheer impossibility until the internal condition of he nature be ascertain and the way pave for they control a simple illustration of the working of this principle be supply by we democracy grossly pretender how can a democracy be possible without a knowledge of the control of the individually and socially subnormal who since they offer themselves to exploitation by the careerist prove themselves the weak link in the chain of co-operation with a equal opportunity for all that be the democratic ideal in what do the equality or inequality of man consist just what be the quality necessary for successful competition or if you will co-live of man with he fellow-men and how and why do they operate no freedom independent of the servile repetition of history and heredity be conceivable until these inquiry have be elaborately carry out toward a certain work finality the promise of eugenics there be to be sure the claim and assertion and negative achievement of the youngest of the science eugenics they be invincible optimist the eugenist : it be perhaps a case of a virtue bear of necessity thus franci galton in the preface to the bible of eugenics he essay on hereditary genius declare : there be nothing either in the history of domestic animal or in that of evolution to make we doubt that a race of sane man may be form who shall be as much superior mentally and morally to the modern european as the modern european be to the lowest of the negro race high hope beat in this declaration but galton could not have foresee that the signing of a scrap of paper by one of the modern european would let loose all the other modern european in a pandemonium of horror the lowest of the negro race could not but envy as a masterpiece of its kind it seem to be suspiciously easy for he to accept a excuse to slide down the dizzy height he have climb from the african level the eugenist would put they trust in the encouraged breeding of the best and the compulsory sterility of the rest but what be the best and who be the best and where will you find they when they be not inextricably emulsify with the worst it be a long long way to the day of a segregate out and in of mendelian unit-character besides this be a strange world of choice nobody be to be consider worthy of parenthood until he have fall in love properly nobody who would permit a outsider 's decision as to when he be properly in love would be worth thirty cent as a parent there be the ultimate dilemma of the eugenist -- the dilemma which destroy forever the dream of a control of parenthood from the point of view of merely psychic value new psychology there be the claim and outcry and promise of the psychologist -- the specialist in the probe of the human soul and human nature in we time the demand for a dynamic psychology of process and become psychology with a energy in it have split they into two school -- the emphasizer of instinct and the subconscious the mcdougallian and the pleader for sex and the unconscious the freudian a synthesis between these two group be latent since they difference be those of horizon merely for the mcdougallian look upon the world with two eye and see it whole and broad -- the freudian see through they telescope a circular field and exclaim that they behold the universe it be true that they own a telescope but what have either to offer we quest for light on the future of the species nothing very much thus to turn to the disciple of mcdougall in a recent volume entitle human nature and its remake professor william ernest hocking of harvard contend that man all axiom about he nature to the contrary be but a creature of habit and so the most plastic of live thing since habit be self-controlled and self-determined by the self-determination of the habit of the race will the new freedom be reborn it sound old very old and pathetic because it recognize original and permanent ingredient of we composition in the word pugnacity greed sex fear as element to be accept in any system of the principle of civilization it be the bubble of education all over again what in we cell be pugnacity what in we bone be greed what in we blood be sex what in we nerve be fear until these inquiry be respect conscious character building or even stock breeding must remain the laugh stock of the smoking room and the regimental barracks come the freudian to they we owe the aeroplane to a new universe they have open up for we the geology of the soul layer upon layer cross-section upon cross-section have be pile before we and what a melodramatic cinema of thrill and shiver villain and hero heroine and adventuress have they not unfold each motive as the stiff psychologist of the nineteenth century with he plaster-of-paris category and pigeon hole and classification label the teem creature of the mind become anon a strutting actor upon a multitudinous stage and a audience in a crowded playhouse scene be enact the febrile fancy of a poe or a de maupassant never could have conjure the complex the neurosis the compulsion the obsession the slip of speech the trick of manner the devotion of a life-time the culture of a nation all furnish bit for the freudian mosaic attraction and inhibition repulsion and suppression be hold up as the ultimate pull and push force of human nature but be the problem solve be not human nature primarily animal nature and do we so thoroughly understand this animal nature do not all this material of freudianism consist of variation upon social burden impose on the original human nature to be sure at every moment of life choice have to be make and choice involve the clashing of instinct and motive with victory for one or some and defeat for the other but the freudian material per se -- the sex material -- be it not merely the by-product of a certain state of society a sane society would eliminate nearly all of freudian disease but still have original human nature upon its hand why be it that of two individual expose to the same situation one will develop a complex the other will remain immune the only soil we know of the real foundation stone of we be and live be the cell we be make of tell I the cellular basis of a complex and i will grant that you have arrive at some real knowledge way for the physiologist there have grow up contemporaneously with the teaching of freud a body of discovery and knowledge in physiology concern these factor which be like a long sword of light illuminate a pitch-black spot in the night the dark place in human nature seem to have become the sole monopoly of the freudian and they psychology but only seemingly for all this time the physiologist have be work begin with a candle and now hold in he hand the most powerful arc-light he have explore two region the sympathetic nervous system and the gland of internal secretion and have come upon datum which in due course will render a good many of the freudian dictum obsolete not that the freudian fundamental will be scrap completely but they will have to fit into the great synthesis which must form the basis of any control of the future of human nature that future belong to the physiologist already he achievement provide the foundation i propose in the follow chapter to sketch the history and outline the element of this new knowledge and then to glimpse some of the larger human reaction to it a good deal of this new knowledge be not altogether new a number of the isolate fact have be know and talk about for more than two generation but the newer addition and the light they have throw upon old problem present the opportunity for a synthesis which must sooner or later be make the chemistry of the soul besides it be time that the secret of the laboratory step out into the market place unashamed imaginative man have play for age immemorial with wondrous fairy tale and fancy of what he would achieve the science of physics and chemistry have make everyday commonplace reality out of he radiant dream one need not repeat the clichs of we editor but the analogy be there nevertheless no control over heat and light and electricity today we slave be possible until physics and chemistry take they in hand no control of the human soul be possible until it too will be take in hand by they we may now look forward to a real future for mankind because we have before we the beginning of a chemistry of human nature the internal secretion with they influence upon brain and nervous system as well as every other part of the body corporation as essentially blood-circulating chemical substance have be discover the real governor and arbiter of instinct and disposition emotion and reaction character and temperament good and bad a huge complex of evidence as various complicated and obscure as human nature itself support that fundamental law the chemistry of the soul magnificent phrase it be a long long way to that goal the exact formulum be as yet far beyond we reach but we have start upon the long journey and we shall get there then will man truly become the experimental animal of the future experiment not only with the external condition of he life but with the constituent of he very nature and soul the chemical condition of he be include the internal secretion be the step of the ladder by which he will climb to those dizzy height where he will stretch out he hand and find himself a god modern knowledge of these chemical substance circulate in the blood and affect every cell of the body date back scarce half a century but already the path blaze by the pioneer have lead to the exploration of great country the thyroid gland the pituitary gland the adrenal gland the thymus the pineal the sex gland have yield secret and certain great postulate have be establish the life of every individual normal or abnormal he physical appearance and he psychic trait be dominate largely by he internal secretion all normal as well as abnormal individual be classifiable accord to the internal secretion which rule in they make-up individual family nation and race show definite internal secretion trait which stamp they with the quality of difference the internal secretion formulum of a individual may in the future constitute he measurement which will place he accurately in the social system more and more we be force to realize that the general form and external appearance of the human body depend to a large extent upon the function during the early developmental period of the endocrine gland we stature the kind of face we have the length of we arm and leg the shape of the pelvis the color and consistency of the integument the quantity and regional location of we subcutaneous fat the amount and distribution of hair on we body the tonicity of we muscle the sound of the voice and the size of the larynx the emotion to which we exterior give expression all be to a certain extent condition by the productivity of we gland of internal secretion -lrb- llewelly f barker john hopkin university 1st president of association for study of internal secretion -rrb- the implication for the statesman the educator the vocational expert the student of the neurotic and of genius of delinquent deficient and criminal the explorer of the exceptional and the commonplace the understanding of the poetic and kinetic base and dull type as well as of those two master interest of mankind sex and war be manifest the mystery of the individual in all he distinct uniqueness begin to be penetrate and so every phase of social life in which the individual be at bottom the final determinant must be review in the light of the new knowledge history may be examine from a entirely new angle the biography of we hero of the past in the carlylean sense will bear reinspection even utopia will have to be revise the internal secretion constitute and determine much of the inherit power of the individual and they development they control physical and mental growth and all the metabolic process of fundamental importance they dominate all the vital function during the three cycle of life they co-operate in a intimate relationship which may be compare to a interlock directorate a derangement of they function cause a insufficiency of they a excess or a abnormality upset the entire equilibrium of the body with transforming effect upon the mind and the organ in short they control human nature and whoever control they control human nature the control of the gland of internal secretion wait upon we knowledge of they the nature and precise composition of the substance manufacture by they and just what they do to the cell envisage the future that knowledge today be meager look back fifty year it become a amazing achievement and revelation it be worth we while to survey the accomplished and to trace its general human significance for a certain tangible degree of knowledge and control have be attain and should be part of the average citizen 's equipment in deal with the everyday problem of he life the attitude of the laboratory a certain number of so-called experimental physiologist that be the physiologist of the animal laboratory who will have nothing but syllogistic deduction and quantitative determination base upon animal experiment as the datum of they science will be apt to look askance upon the precede paragraph and those which will follow to they any man who relate the internal secretion to anything outside of the routineer 's path put he reputation at stake if he have any reputation at all to start in with they would have we deliver a scotch verdict upon all the question which arise as soon as one attempt to take in the more general significance of the gland of internal secretion this even though the more general implication concern the effect of they product the relation of they to growth and development nutrition and energy environmental reaction and resistance to disease as well as the grand complex of intelligence be admittedly well ascertain in some direction the method of absolute measurement in science have yield miracle for some thousand of year a isolate individual here and there or a isolate institution have devote themselves to the task struggle not only with they own weakness but with religious and political dogma which spoil and vitiate even the beginning of they effort when in the seventeenth century man associate themselves in research for free communication and discussion of they finding a great invention come alive close on its heel be bear the exact experimental method amazing triumph be bear of that marriage which sweep away before it ignorance and superstition and prejudice its child and grandchild have flourish and grow strong and mighty they have transmute the material condition of life certainly all the laurel belong to the method of absolute measure observation yet all this time the old method of inductive observation have not go dead most magnificent triumph of nineteenth century science the evolution theory of charle darwin remain the most conspicuous instance of clarification of think in human history that work be the outcome of a attempt to relate and interpret a collection of observation on species and they variation that have long lain to hand a mixture without a solvent darwin see certain generalization as solvent and behold a clear solution out of the mud but it be by pile evidence upon evidence co-ordinate isolate fact not directly associate that the towering structure be erect there be no prettier sample extant of the power of the inductive method not that there be no triumph of the quantitative method in store for the biologist already the material of the mendelian have become basic part of he structure and today in pursuit of the solution of hundred of the problem of live matter chemist and physiologist be employ the most precise standard unit and measure of the physical science blood chemistry of we time be a marvel undreamed of a generation ago also these achievement be a perfect example of the accomplished fact contradict a priori prediction and criticism for it be one of the accept dogma of the nineteenth century that the phenomenon of the living could never be subject to accurate quantitative analysis however desirable the purely quantitative experimental method may be they naturally need always to be precede by the qualitative study of direct observation inevitably there will be numberless error apparent and real inconsistency and contradiction and idea that will have to be discard just the same there be no other method of progress every bit of evidence point towards the internal secretion as the holder of the secret of we inmost be they be the well spring of life the dynamo of the organism in trail they scent we appear to be upon the track not only of the chemistry of we body but of the chemistry of we very soul a increase host of factor and study marshal themselves solidly for that declaration endeavor to conceive the consequence and possibility for the future a synthesis of the know in the field provide even now a means of understanding and control of the perplexity of human nature and life that be like a vista see from a mountain top after the lifting of a fog the most precious bit of knowledge we possess today about man be that he be the creature of he gland of internal secretion that be man as a distinctive organism be the product the by-product of a number of cell factory which control the part of he make-up much as the different division of a automobile concern produce the different part of a car these chemical factory consist of cell manufacture special substance which act upon the other cell of the body and so start and determine the countless process we call life life body and soul emerge from the activity of the magic ooze of they silent chemistry precisely as a tree of tin crystal arise from the chemical reaction start in a solution of tin salt by a electric current man be regulate by he gland of internal secretion at the beginning of the third decade of the twentieth century after he have struggle for we know at least fifty thousand year to define and know himself that summary may be accept as the truth about himself it be a far-reaching induction but a valid induction support by a multitude of detailed fact amazingly enough the incontestable evidence that first pointed to and then prove up to the hilt this answer to the question : what be man have be gather in less than the last fifty year darwin and huxley and spencer who first open man 's eye to they origin be ignorant of the very existence of some of they and have not the faintest notion or suspicion of the real importance or function of any of they the prejudice of philosopher now there be certain prejudice and problem which appear to be rudely brush away by the dogmatic arrogance of the principle state what you say be man but a affair of he peculiar gland chemistry but what of mind soul consciousness still another of these pathetically one-sided and superficial theory of man as a machine pure and simple which would make he the most complicated of mechanism a marvel of intricate part but would deprive he of he essence as self-conscious unique in the universe man think man at any rate dread to lose the cherish impregnable conviction that he be something apart inherently and therefore infinitely different from every other phenomenon in the range of he cosmos a thorough dissection of the relation and attitude toward psychic material of the consistent physiologist who refuse to deal in contradictory term would lead we a little too far so would the reconciliation between the claim of mind and the concept of the organism as a system of chemical reaction the most fundamental aspect of that herculean task warn by the sign no trespassing we shall leave to the metaphysician the influence of the gland of internal secretion upon the mind we must consider but at present postpone yet the hot-headed contender on both side may be remind of certain fact we live in the most iconoclastic of age there be sane people alive today go quietly about they business who deny the very existence of consciousness these heretic of course pooh-pooh absolutely the lion of metaphysics on the other hand it may be point out to we mechanist who believe in mechanism to the bitter end that even if man can be describe entirely as a mere transformer of energy there be no reason why he can not also be describe as a transformer of energy plus someone who make use of the transformer and of the energy transform the stone wall before the honest mechanist be the abolition of purpose and design a old insoluble problem upon he premise preach until you be blue in the face behaviorist tropism in which man be push and pull about in he environment as be iron filings in a magnetic field think up objective physiology in which you life and mine become a series of concatenate influence and compound reflex play with word like the concentration reflex when you mean idea and the symbolic reflex when you mean language but you most rigid nomenclature will never abolish the mystic personal purpose in the equation no matter how low the step in the animal series to which you descend the declaration that a man be dominate by certain gland within he body should not be take to give aid and comfort to those who would banish mind from the universe chapter i how the gland of internal secretion be discover just what be the gland of internal secretion and how have we become possess of whatever information about they we have a brief review of how the idea of a gland of internal secretion come into the human mind and of the contribution that have converge into a single body of knowledge be worth while a gland be a collection of cell -lrb- those viscous globule which be the unit of all tissue and organ -rrb- it manufacture substance intend for a particular effect upon the body economy the effect may be either local or upon the body as a whole originally a gland mean something in the body which be see to make something else generally a juice or a liquid mixture of some sort a classical example be the salivary gland elaborate saliva the microscope have show we that every gland be a chemical factory in which the cell be the worker the product of the gland work be its secretion thus the sweat gland of the skin secrete the perspiration as they secretion the lachrymal gland of the eye the tear as theirs the collectivism of management and control be the only essential difference between they and the modern soap factory or tnt plant man as a carnivor and as a consequent anatomist have be acquaint with these more superficially place gland for some thousand of year during all this time and during the epoch of the achievement of gross anatomy it be believe that the secretion of all gland be pour out upon some surface of the body either a exterior surface like the skin or some interior surface the various mucous membrane this be support by the discovery of canal-like passage way lead from the gland to the particular surface where its secretion be to act these corridor the secretory or excretory duct be present for example in the liver conduct the bile to the small intestine device of transportation fit happily into a comparison of a gland to a chemical factory corresponding thus closely to the tramway and railroad of we industrial center little more than a hundred year ago it be observe that certain organ like the thyroid body in the neck and the adrenal capsule in the abdomen hitherto neglect because they function be hopelessly obscure have a glandular structure as in so much scientific advance the discovery or improvement of a new instrument or method a fresh tool of research be responsible the perfection of the microscope be the reason this time if one wish to trace the idea of internal secretion by cell to a individual it be convenient if not pedantic to give the credit to theophile de bordeu a famous physician of pari in the eighteenth century bordeu come to pari as a brilliant provincial in he early twenty and by the charm of he manner and daring therapy fight he way to the most exclusive aristocratic practice of the court naturally a courtier take to the intrigue of the royal court like a duck to water make enemy on every hand as well as friend and with a fastidious and impatient clientele he yet find time to dabble in the wonder of the newly perfect microscope and to speculate upon the meaning of the novelty reveal by it in the tissue _ he coin the thought of a gland secretion into the blood _ it be in the year 1749 that he come to pari from the pyrenee a young medical graduate destine to become the most fashionable practitioner of he time at the age of twenty-three he be hold the professorship of anatomy at he alma mater montpelier where he father be a successful physician at twenty-five he be elect correspond member of the royal academy of science a handsome presence and a tartarin de tarascon disposition assure he success from the start the medical world be then compose of the emulsion of charlatanry and science molire ridicule success stimulate envy and jealousy one of the richest of the older medical man set himself the job of procure he scalp on a trumped-up charge of steal jewel from a dead patient -- a favorite accusation against the doctor of the eighteenth century -- he have bordeu 's license take away from he the good grace of certain woman to whom bordeu have always appeal and who indeed supply the fund to get he start in paris ram through two act of parliament to reinstate he nothing daunt he return to he quest for a court clientele and be reward finally by have the moribund loui xv as a patient this be the man with whom the modern history of the internal secretion begin not content with adventure among the courtier and desperado of the most corrupt court in the most corrupt city of the world he go in for research the high power microscope that come into vogue when he be study reveal vague wonder which he describe in a monograph research into the mucous tissue or cellular organ but what make he interesting be a slender volume on the medical analysis of the blood publish in the year of the american declaration of independence the sexual side of man and woman arouse bordeu 's most ardent enthusiasm start with observation on the character of eunuch and capon as well as spayed female animal he formulate a conception of sexual secretion absorb into the blood settle the male or female tint of the organism and set the seal upon the destiny of the individual thus he must be donate the credit of anticipate the most modern doctrine on the subject the generation after he witness the triumph of the cell as the recognize unit of structure of the tissue the brick of the organ it be soon find that the cell of the more familiar gland like the sweat or tear gland resemble the cell of the more mysterious structure name the thyroid in the neck or adrenal in the abdomen of which the function be unknown what have hitherto prevent classification of the latter as gland be the fact that they possess no visible pathway for the removal of they secretion so now they be set apart as the _ ductless _ gland the gland without duct as contrast with the gland normally equip with duct since too they be observe to have a exceedingly rich supply of blood the blood present itself as the only conceivable mode of egress for the secretion pack within the cell so they be also call the blood or vascular gland the name which become most popular be those which represent a contrast of the gland with the duct convey they secretion to the exterior as the gland of external secretion and the gland without the duct the secretion of which be keep within the body absorb by the blood and lymph to be use by the other cell as the gland of internal secretion how different these two class of gland be may be realize by imagine the existence of great factory manufacture food product which would diffuse through they wall into the atmosphere to be absorb by we body there be certain term for the gland of internal secretion which be use interchangeably they be speak of often as the _ endocrine _ gland and as the _ hormone _ produce gland endocrine be most convenient for it stand for both the gland and its secretion hormone be employ a good deal in the literature of the subject but it apply specifically to the internal secretion and not to the gland the experimental pioneer all this clarification of the concept of the gland of internal secretion occur in the first quarter of the nineteenth century however no inkling of they real importance to the body of which quantitatively they form so insignificant a part be apparently reveal to anyone not even the most daring speculation or brilliant guess work in physiology engage they as material thus henle the great anatomist calmly affirm that these gland have no influence on animal life : they may be extirpate or they degenerate without sensation or motion suffering in the least johann mller the most celebrated physiologist of he day and contemporary of henle write in 1844 and coolly state the ductless gland be alike in one particular -- they either produce a different change in the blood which circulate through they or the lymph which they elaborate play a special rle in the formation of blood or of chyle in other word they be dismiss as curious nonentity of no real significance to the running of the body laennec the french founder of the art of diagnosis in medicine once say that nothing about a science be more interesting than the progress of that science itself he might have add that nothing either be more interesting than the contradiction in that progress for while these grand mogul of they science be enunciate they dogma pioneer here and there be already set the mine that be to explode they the experimental method to the value of which biologist be just begin to awaken be destine to be the vehicle of time 's revenge a application of it to the mystery of sex be the immediate occasion sex and sex difference have always more or less obsess the imagination of mankind the volume of theory about they would constitute a respectable museum certain gross fact however be know the effect of loss of the sex gland upon the configuration of the body and the predominate constitution in animal and eunuch have always attract attention the proverb and story of all nation be full of reference to they but up to the nineteenth century no controlled experimental work be ever carry out regard they it be in 1849 that aa berthold of gttingen a quiet sedate lecturer carry out the pioneer experiment of remove the testis of four rooster and transplant they under the skin it be berthold 's idea to test whether a gland with a definite external secretion and a duct through which that secretion be expel but which yet have power over the body as a whole that be to be attribute only to a internal secretion could not be show by a clean-cut experiment to possess such a internal secretion he succeed perfectly for he find that though in thus separate the gland from its duct and so cut off its external secretion the action of the cell manufacture that secretion be destroy the general effect upon the body be not those of castration the animal retain they male characteristic as regard voice reproductive instinct fight spirit and growth of comb and wattle whereas if the gland be entirely remove these male trait peculiar to the rooster be completely lose the inference be the existence of a internal secretion to berthold belong the honor of be the first experimental demonstrator who prove the reality of a gland with a true internal secretion and the power it exercise through the blood upon the entire organism besides he show that a typical gland of external secretion could also have a internal secretion a possibility never before consider that two kind of cell could live within the same gland : one set usually recognize as produce the external secretion the other evolve the internal secretion be a astounding original conception enter claude bernard science be suppose to be immune to the personal prejudice and emotional habit of the vulgar it be the tradition that a new contribution to knowledge emerge from no matter how obscure the source should be hail as a gift from the god but the sad truth of the matter be that a new finding in science require as much backing as a new project in high finance or social climb berthold like mendel the founder of genetics be a great pioneer but there be no personage no person of consequence with no patronage by anyone of consequence no wife or kin to push he and no audience to stimulate he he poor four little page of a report publish ten year before darwin 's origin of species attract not the slightest notice bury in the print of a journal with a subscription list of possibly two or three hundred of whom perhaps two dozen may have be interested enough to read it but without any recorded reaction on the part of any of they it be a flash in the pan though it be good original conclusive stuff it be cut dead absolutely by the scientific world as a result forty year elapse before the implication of he study be rediscover by the columbus of the modern approach to the internal secretion the american frenchman brown-squard it take a first class man of genius in he field in pari with a respected position in the whirl of its medical planetary system and a university appointment to boom and advertise the doctrine of the internal secretion so that people begin to sit up and listen and take side -- on the wrong grounds this frenchman be claude bernard at a series of lecture on experimental physiology deliver at the college of france in 1855 he coin the term internal secretion and external secretion and emphasize the opposition between they on the basis of a incorrect example the function of the liver in the supply of sugar to the blood just as columbus reach america carry on a series of logical syllogism build upon unreal picture of a straight path to the east claude bernard open up the continent of the internal secretion to the experimental enthusiast of he time by a discovery which today be not group among the phenomenon of internal secretion at all in attempt to throw light upon the disease diabetes in which there be a loss of the normal ability of the cell to burn up sugar he examine the sugar content of the blood in different region of the body he find that the blood of the vein in general contain less sugar than the blood of the artery which mean that sugar be take from the blood in pass through the tissue but the venous blood of the right side of the heart contain as much sugar as the arterial blood evidently somewhere sugar be add to the blood in the vein before it get to the heart the blood of the vein which go from the liver to the right side of the heart be then find to contain a higher percentage of sugar than be present in the artery the vein which transmit the blood from the intestine to the liver have the usual lower percentage of sugar correspond to the analysis establish for the other vein the liver therefore must add sugar to the blood on its way to the heart extraction of the liver then reveal the presence in it of a form of starch a animal starch which bernard call glycogen the sugar-maker the origin of the sugar add to the blood on its way from the liver to the heart be thus settle bernard go on to hail glycogen and the sugar derivable as the internal secretion of the liver and to erect and then drive home a theory of internal secretion and they importance in the body economy the case he have hit upon be exquisitely fortunate as the liver have hitherto be regard purely a gland of external secretion the bile nowadays glycogen and the blood sugar be not consider internal secretion because they be classify as elementary reserve food while the concept of the internal secretion have become narrow down to substance act as starter or inhibitor of different process moreover the process of liberation of sugar from glycogen itself in the liver upon demand be today set down to the action of a internal secretion adrenalin claude bernard 's conception like a novelist 's character have turn upon its creator take on a life of its own and evolve into something he never intend he look upon a internal secretion as simply maintain the normal composition of the blood which bath alike and treat alike the democracy of cell today the blood be believe merely the transport medium for the internal secretion destine for a particular group of cell addison 's as the first english contribution the year 1855-56 be red-letter year in the history of the gland of internal secretion they witness not only the publication of claude bernard 's lecture on experimental physiology but also the appearance of a monograph by thoma addison a english physician entitle on the constitutional and local effect of disease of the suprarenal body in this he describe a fatal disease during which the individual affected become languid and weak and develop a dingy or smoky discoloration of the whole surface of the body a browning or bronzing of the skin cause generally by destructive tuberculous disease of the suprarenal or adrenal body addison promptly put down these constitutional effect of loss of the adrenal body to loss of something produce by they of constitutional importance he be particularly strike by the change in the pigmentation of the skin so much so that he own designation for the affection be bronze skin since then however the condition have be universally style addison 's disease there be something spectacularly mysterious and picturesque about most of the malign insidious effect of the disease which appeal at once to a number of investigator the most adventurous the most daring the most imbue with enthusiasm for the experimental method be the american frenchman brown-squard who be acknowledge the father of modern knowledge of the gland of internal secretion though to claude bernard belong the honor of the grandfather brown-squard the great brown-squard as the outstanding figure in the history of the gland of internal secretion deserve some notice as a personality in the word of the note-maker for novel and play he be a card he be bear in 1817 at port-loui on the island of mauritius off africa then french property he father be a mr brown a american sea captain he mother a mme squard a frenchwoman early in childhood the father sail away on one of he voyage and never come back the mother thereafter support herself and she son sew embroidery at fifteen brown-squard with the physical appearance of a indian creole be clerk in a colonial store by day and compose poetry romance and play by night the call of pari be in he blood which be indeed a supersaturated solution of wanderlust soon he be land there to make he fortune in literature only too speedily to be disillusioned exhibition of manuscript to a lead literary light merely evoke curt advice to learn a trade or go into business he would have none of either and study medicine instead earn he way by teaching as he learn in the laboratory he make the acquaintance of people who more than once be to be he salvation in the up and downs of he career in 1848 he be one of the secretary of the society of biology newly found by claude bernard some trouble perhaps some effect upon he health of cholera which then sweep pari cause he to return to he native mauritius to encounter a epidemic of cholera there he slave manfully for which a gold medal be afterward strike for he that over with he embark in 1852 for new york without a word of american learning english on board this be the first of a series of voyage as he often boast he cross the ocean sixty time not a bad record for the day when the _ mauretanium _ be still in the womb of time he make a hopeless failure out of practice in new york become so poor as to practice obstetrics at five dollar a case and marry a niece of daniel webster then he go back to pari back to america next as professor of physiology at the university of richmond virginium a job occupy for a few month only because of he opinion on slavery ostensibly anyhow to pari then the roll stone meander again so that soon after he be offer and accept the charge of a great newly open hospital for epileptic in london that prove merely a interlude and in 1863 we find he back in he fatherland -lrb- if we may hold france he motherland -rrb- as professor of neuropathology at harvard in new york fame precede he now with a thousand trumpet so that on the day of he arrival he be keep busy see patient until night when he have to desist because of exhaustion but still he do not prosper a unfortunate second marriage almost break he heart and a attempt to find in new york a new medical periodical the _ archive of scientific and practical medicine and surgery _ get he into hot water not until the death of claude bernard in 1878 leave vacant the chair of physiology in the college of france do he find peace and rest he hasten to paris be appoint and live in spite of the most erratic of existence to the ripe old age of 78 work up to the last minute addison 's monograph stimulate brown-squard in the year after its printing to reproduce the fatal disease experimentally by excise the suprarenal capsule in animal addison be very modest in he monograph he state that the first case of the malady have be report by he great predecessor at guy 's hospital london richard bright the describer of bright 's disease then he talk about the curious fact he have stumble upon and refer to a ill-defined impression that these suprarenal body in common with the spleen and other organ in some way or other minister to the elaboration of the blood in the preface to he work he have speak more confidently of the fact that nature as a experimenter and a vivisector can beat the physiologist to a frazzle indeed he begin like this : if pathology be to disease what physiology be to health it appear reasonable to conclude that in any give structure or organ the law of the former will be as fix and significant as those of the latter : and that the peculiar character of any structure or organ may be as certainly recognize in the phenomenon of disease as in the phenomenon of health although pathology therefore as a branch of medical science be necessarily found on physiology question may nevertheless arise regard the true character of a structure or organ to which occasionally the pathologist may be able to return a more satisfactory and decisive reply than the physiologist -- these two branch of medical knowledge be thus find mutually to advance and illustrate each other indeed as regard the function of individual organ the mutual aid of these two branch of knowledge be probably much more nearly balanced than many may be dispose to admit : for in estimate they we be very apt to forget how large a amount of we present physiological knowledge respect the function of these organ have be the immediate result of casual observation make on the effect of disease william jame express the same think some decade later when he emphasize that the abnormal be but the normal exaggerated and magnify play upon by the limelight and therefore the best teacher and indicator of the exact definition and limitation of the normal addison speaking before the south london medical society in 1849 declare that in all of three afflict individual there be find a diseased condition of the suprarenal capsule and that in spite of the consciousness of the bias and prejudice inseparable from the hope or vanity of a original discovery he could not help entertain a very strong impression that these hitherto mysterious organ -- the suprarenal capsule -- may be either directly or indirectly concerned in sanguification -lrb- the making of the blood -rrb- : and that a diseased condition of they functional or structural may interfere with the proper elaboration of the body generally or of the red particle more especially a modern acquaint with after development would say that addison be very hot upon the trail indeed but withal though he must have be well aware of john hunter 's advice to jenner on vaccination do not think make some observation he training in the indirect reasoning and deduction of the clinician prevent he from go right on to a direct experimental test of he theory this brown-squard proceed to do remove the adrenal gland in several species of animal he find mean a terrible weakness in twenty-four to forty-eight hour and death shortly after if only one be remove there be no change apparent in the normal animal but death occur rapidly upon removal of the other even after a long interval furthermore transfusion of blood from a normal into one deprive of its suprarenal prevent death for a long time indicate that the suprarenal normally secrete something into the blood necessary to life the year 1855-1856 behold two other important gland of internal secretion the thyroid the gland in the neck astride the windpipe and the thymus in the chest above the heart make they debut the thymus be introduce by the great classic monograph of friedleben on the physiology of the thymus in which he mention the usual forget pioneer : felix plater a swiss physician who in 1614 have find a enlarged thymus in a infant die suddenly and restelli a italian who interested himself in the effect of removal of the thymus more than ten year before friedleben believe that in the young without a thymus there occur a softening of the bone and general physical and mental deterioration he start the ball roll for a number of research moritz schiff of frankfort-on-the-main show that excision of the thyroid gland in dog be invariably fatal a number of physician in the first half of the century have report certain remarkable symptom associate with enlargement of the thyroid gland as goitre in 1825 the collect posthumous writings of caleb perry a eminent physician of bath england record eight case in which together with enlargement of the gland there develop enlargement and palpitation of the heart a distinct protrusion of the eye from they socket and a appearance of agitation and distress schiff 's paper be the first to throw any light on the subject but for some reason probably the same as in berthold 's forlorn experiment with the sex gland the work of a person of no importance be ignore or perhaps the more charitable view be that it be forget yet the tide of observation keep sweeping in relevant datum in 1850 curl a english pathologist study the cretinous idiot of salzburg write about century before by paracelsus discover that with they defective brain and mentality there be associate a absence of the thyroid body and accompany symmetrical swelling of fat tissue at the side of the neck then sir william gull in 1873 paint the singular detail of a cretinous condition develop in adult woman a condition to which another englishman william ord of london five year later donate the title of myxedema because of a characteristic thickening and infiltration of the skin that be one of its feature surgery then enter upon the scene the great swiss surgeon theodore kocher perform the first excision of the thyroid gland in human being for goitre in the same year in 1882 jl reverdin another surgeon of geneva notice that in man complete removal of the thyroid be follow by symptom identical with those collect under the name of myxedema and use the phrase operative myxedema to emphasize he conviction of the connection between they then schiff in 1884 neglect twenty-five year come back with a array of demonstration prove that the various symptom tremor spasm and convulsion follow removal of the thyroid could be prevent by a previous graft of a piece of the gland under the skin or by the injection of thyroid juice into a vein or under the skin or by the ingestion of thyroid juice or the raw thyroid by mouth a crystallization of idea about the true function of the thyroid be now inevitable in 1884 sir victor horsley produce a experimental myxedema by removal of the thyroid in monkey resemble closely in its symptom-picture the disease as it occur in human being mbius a german neurologist come out boldly for the conception that a number of ailment could be due to qualitative and quantitative change in the secretion of the thyroid and that just as myxedema and cretinism be due to a insufficiency of the secretion parry 's disease be to be ascribe to a excessive outpouring of it the next step be easy in 1888 sir felix semon as a outcome of a collective investigation establish for all time that cretinism myxedema and post-operative myxedema be one and the same it be bind to occur to someone that if human myxedema and animal experimental myxedema be one and the same schiff 's procedure of prevention and cure by feed thyroid gland by mouth in the latter could be apply to the former the idea occur to two man murray and howitz in 1891 murray 's patient a mr h be show before the northcumberland and durham medical society a english country medical organization in February 1891 she be forty-two year old and have bear nine child the illness attack she have begin insidiously with a gradual enlargement and thicken of she face and hand she have become very slow in speech and gait sensitive to cold and languid and depressed in spirit to the point of inability to go about alone murray employ the glycerin extract of the thyroid gland of a freshly kill sheep inject twenty-four drop hypodermically twice a week there be a immediate and marvelous improvement which continue steadily murray finding that it could be maintain by feed the gland by mouth the feature and skin return to the normal speech quicken and she become able to walk about and live she life without hesitation or assistance she live to the age of seventy-four die in 1919 in the twenty-eight year during which it be always necessary to administer the thyroid she consume over nine pint of thyroid comprise the gland of 870 sheep giant and dwarf and fat people have always interested people as freak departure from the usual and the normal and have form the stock of popular museum circus and country fair every mythology have concern itself with they the titan among the greek og gog and magog among the hebrew be example of the fascination of the superlarge john hunter the founder of experimental surgery spend a fortune in chase after the skeleton of a famous irish giant in 1783 dwarf have also fascinate -- witness the short-limbed satyr of the greek and the dwarf god -lrb- ptah and be -rrb- of egypt as well as the vogue of the court dwarf-buffoon of whom velasquez have leave we some portrait fat people obesity as a manifestation of personality have arouse wonder and amusement the world over the fat boy have always furnish good sport to the sam weller all these character tall or short fat or lean be related to the activity of a gland of internal secretion in the head the pituitary which become a center of interest in the late eighty because of its situation the opinion of the ancient be that it be the source of the mucus of the nose a opinion reinforce by the greatest anatomist of the dark age galen and hold up to the seventeenth century in other word it be consider simply a gland of external secretion experimental removal of the pituitary be essay by horsley in 1886 the same man who two year before have reproduce myxedema successfully in monkey other succeed he attempt but the conclusion draw be uncertain or contradictory result from the difficulty of the operative technique of get at a gland place at the base of the brain not until 1908 be the problem solve by paulesco of bucharest who devise a way of reach it by trepan the skull he be thus able to prove beyond a doubt that the pituitary gland be essential to life and that without it no animal could continue to live for any length of time soon after harvey gushing and he associate at john hopkin hospital discover that removal of part of the gland be follow by a pronounced obesity and sluggishness a basis for the understanding of obesity and growth be then establish in the eighty there come to the clinic of pierre marie in paris a pupil of the great charcot various woman complain of headache they also tell he about a enlargement of they hand and foot and a alarming change in the bone of the face he differentiate the affection from its imitator and create its present designation of acromegaly -lrb- enlargement of the extremity -rrb- also he correlate they relationship to the giant who have be mention acromegalic have be also liken to the neanderthal man who have probably as the gorilla may have a excess of the pituitary in they system for four year he study the morbid phenomenon in the tissue of these sufferer at last consign to they end first one and then another and then a third and a fourth exhibit a striking hypertrophy of the pituitary body and a consequent widening of the portion of the base of the skull which cradle the gland he proceed to say so in the graduate thesis of he pupil souza leite the inference be inevitable that the entire process be to be put down to a overactivity of the pituitary ever since too the growth of the skeleton have be accept as control by that gland about this time another set of old observation come to life again related to those of docent berthold on the auto-grafting of the testis of a cock with complete retention of its sexual character which he say must be due to the productive action of the testis ie to its effect upon the blood and thence to the corresponding effect of such blood upon the entire organism of course stock raiser and poultry fancier have note the interesting outcome of castration for about as long as they profession have exist and for age the diminution of sexual activity as a predecessor to the decadence of senility have be harp upon rejuvenation especially in connection with sexual activity as well as with tissue and spiritual elasticity have be one of the haunting phantom of the imagination for as long as we have record of articulate humanity together with el dorado the elixir of youth have share the honor with the philosopher 's stone the idea of employ the chemical material of the sex gland the testis or the ovary to bring back youth to restore juvenility have not as far as we know occur to anyone who at any rate put himself on record by word or deed until 1889 the hero of the new departure be the hero of so many daring adventure among speculative experiment brown-squard at this time the wanderer be a aged sage seventy-two year old fit as custom go only for retirement and resignation to the fate of all flesh the old passion of experiment upon himself as well as upon the guinea-pig dog cat and monkey by which he be always surround be as alive and kick as ever i suppose he have be think for year concern some method for the resumption of youth for we find he exclaim when the opportunity loom of a great laboratory on agassiz island long island on one of he recurrent flight to new york : would that i be thirty and other passage in he personal communication refer again and again to he consciousness of grow old the miracle that be be perform by inject thyroid and feed thyroid in animal probably act as the spark to a inflammable mass of idea long smoulder in the subcellar of he mind the effect be report to the society of biology in paris one memorable evening June 1 1889 in two note on the result of the hypodermic injection in man of the testis juice of monkey and dog and certain generalization deduce therefrom such juice he state have a definite energy-mobilizing or as he put it dynamogenic action upon the subject himself stimulate amazingly he general health muscular power and mental activity these experiment they nature the manner in which they be conduct the character and age of the experimenter and the result claim be exquisitely good stuff for ridicule cartoonist and reporter leap upon the theme with the avidity of the true-blue interviewer pari where to be ridicule be to be kill in public with the most ignominious of death react as only the french temperament can react the wit of the salon crackle the bourgeoisie chortle the proletariat roar the elixir of life have be discover and it be excellent sport but brown-squard remain unshaken he have all the rous of pari run to he and consequent charge of quackery and charlatanism how much of these unsavory epithet really apply to he will not be determine until we have a better acquaintance with he more intimate life a biography and collection of he letter be need but it be certain that the general principle he arrive at aid as much by the wing of intuition as by the clue of incomplete and incompletely controlled experiment survive as the foundation of whatever we know about the internal secretion and all we present viewpoint he sum these up in 1891 as follow : all the tissue in we view be modifier of the blood by means of a internal secretion take from they by the venous blood from this we be force to the conclusion that if subcutaneous injection of the liquid draw from these part be ineffectual then we should inject some of the venous blood supply these part we admit that each tissue and more generally each cell of the organism secrete on its own account certain product or special ferment which through this medium -lrb- the blood -rrb- influence all other cell of the body a definite solidarity be thus establish among all the cell through a mechanism other than the nervous system all the tissue -lrb- gland and other organ -rrb- have thus a special internal secretion and so give to the blood something more than the waste product of metabolism the internal secretion whether by direct favorable influence or whether through the obstacle they oppose to deleterious process seem to be of great utility in maintain the organism in its normal state the only part of this statement not concede today be that relate to the formation of internal secretion by tissue other than those of which the cell be definitely glandular that be secretory : as can be determine under the microscope brown-squard add to the concept of internal secretion father by claude bernard the idea of a correlation a mutual influence of they and of the different organ of the body through they the nervous system have hitherto be regard as the sole means of communication between cell by its telegraphic arrangement of nerve filament reach out everywhere interweave with each other and the cell the brown-squard conception infer the existence of a postal system between cell the blood supply the highway for travel and transmission of the post the post consist of the chemical substance secrete by the gland to be sure the doctrine be only a inference though well-founded of which the direct experimental proof be not to be obtain until the research of bayliss and starling yet to brown-squard belong the immortal credit if not of the originator at any rate of the resurrector of the idea of use gland extract to influence the body the unwarranted hope arouse by he enthusiastic report of rejuvenate miracle have long since be dissipate moreover they smear the whole subject with a disrepute which cling to certain narrow and unreasonable mind to this day but as every physiologist since have acknowledge he be and remain the great path-breaker in the conquest of the internal secretion the hormone the problem of the internal secretion be now attack from another angle a great russian physiologist pawlow call attention to the fact that the introduction of a dilute mineral acid such as the hydrochloric acid normally a constituent of the stomach digestive fluid into the upper part of the intestine provoke a secretion of the pancreas which be so important for intestinal digestion he explain the phenomenon as a reflex a matter of the nerve go from the intestine to the pancreas he pupil popielskus throw doubt upon so easy a explanation by prove that the same reaction could be elicit even after all the nerve connection between the gut and the spinal cord be sever if the relation be a reflex it would have to be class now as one of those local nerve circuit which be pretty common among the viscera a local call and reply as it be without mediation of the great long distance trunk line in the spinal cord and the medullum oblonga the work of bayliss and starl two english physiologist be commence then to test the hypothesis they soon find that the experiment could be so devise as to exclude any influence whatever on the part of the nervous tissue and yet result positively thus if a loop of intestine be so prepared as to be attach to the rest of the body only by means of its blood vessel all the nerve be cut put some acid into it be still follow by a flow of pancreatic juice no less marked than when none of the part about the piece of gut have be disturb it be evident that the stimulus to the pancreas be carry by way of the blood stream that the stimulate substance be not the acid itself be show by the failure of the reaction to occur when the acid be inject directly into the blood stream since there be this difference in the effect between acid in the intestine and acid in the blood it be manifest that the active substance must be some material elaborate in the intestinal mucous membrane under the influence of the acid so they scrape some of the lining of the bowel rub it up with acid and inject the filter mixture into the blood they be reward by a flow of pancreatic juice greater in amount than any obtain in they other experiment from the filter mixture they isolate in a impure form a solid substance which when introduce into the circulation have a similar action to this of which the exact chemical make-up be as yet a unknown they give the name secretin secretin and its property they use to generalize as a perfectly direct and amply demonstrable example of a internal secretion metaphor be no less valuable in physiology than in poetry they declare that the internal secretion appear to they to be chemical messenger telegraph boy send from one organ to another through the public highway the blood -lrb- really more like a move platform -rrb- so they christen they all hormone derive the word from the greek verb mean to rouse or set in motion as a science be a well-made language a new word be a event it sum up detail economize brain-work and so be cherish by the intellect the study of the internal secretion have advance by leap and bound since it become convenient to speak of they as hormone withal the brilliant work of bayliss and starling stand as the third great foundation stone the first claude bernard 's and the second brown-squard 's in the architecture of the modern concept of the internal secretion chapter ii the gland : thyroid and pituitary the gland of internal secretion the history of which as tool of thought i review in the previous chapter have each a interesting evolutionary story without some acquaintance with that story the rough outline of they physical architecture and the particular work they be call upon to perform in the body no adequate understanding of they influence upon type of human nature and personality be possible the thyroid gland this gland consist of two maroon color mass astride the neck above the windpipe close to the larynx these be bridge by a narrow isthmus of the same tissue they remind one of the flap of a purse open up the gland have always attract much attention because its enlargement constitute the prominent deformity know as goitre to begin with the thyroid be once a sex gland pure and simple in the lowest vertebrate and in the homologous tissue of the higher invertebrate the fraction of the thyroid be intimately connect with the duct of the sexual organ they be indeed accessory sexual organ uterine gland satellite of the sex process from petromyzon upward that relationship be lose the thyroid migrate more and more to the head region to become the great link between sex and brain how alive that function still be be grossly show by the swell of the gland with sexual excitement menstruation and pregnancy relative to the body weight it be largest in the mammalium and smallest in the fish it therefore grow larger as the vertebrate ascend in the scale it have in fact develop in direct proportion to and side by side with the fundamental differentiate vertebrate characteristic of these the possession of a dry hairy skin instead of a moist or mucus bearing chitinous skin the ownership of a internal bony skeleton and a large skull and a complicated development of brain be the diagnostic sign thyroid internal secretion have a very definite control relation to all of they : to skin its hairiness moisture and amount of mucus to the growth and size of the bone especially the bone of the extremity and the skull and to intelligence and the complexity of the convolution of the brain injury to the thyroid especially in grow animal be follow by profound retrogression or arrest of development in skin skeleton and brain in the fish and the cyclostome the thyroid be represent only by some small scrubby patch little larger than the head of pin scatter along the aorta the great blood vessel from the heart and out a little way along each gill it become larger and more compact among the amphibian and reptile but still remain quite small large and prominent among the bird and mammalia it be largest and most prominent among the primate and man it be hence permissible to think of the thyroid as a dictator of evolution to crown it as the vertebrate gland par excellence and to call the typical vertebrate brand mark secondary _ thyroid _ characteristic in precisely the sense of darwin class the horn of cattle as secondary _ sexual _ characteristic in such enthusiasm for the thyroid as a determinant of evolution its pillar of cloud by day and column of fire by night one should not forget the other gland of internal secretion in they all we may suppose life tired of invent merely prehensile destructive and reproductive organ hit upon the happy thought of contrivance which be in essence chemical factory to speed up the rate of variation and so of a higher evolution creator of the land animal accord to this conception the thyroid play a fundamental part in the change of sea creature into land animal experimentally thyroid have be use to transform one into the other thus the occasional change of a mexican axolotl a purely aquatic newt breathing through gill into the amblystoma a terrestrial salamander with spotted skin breathing by means of lung have long be know feed the axolotl on thyroid gland produce the metamorphosis very quickly even if the axolotl be keep in water in the reptile house at the london zoological garden full-grown example of the common black axolotl and the pretty white variety be exhibit some be nearly three inch long alongside be show several example of the amblystoma stage produce in one of the laboratory of oxford university and at the garden by thyroid feeding a variation of the thyroid in the direction of increase secretion be probably responsible for the first land animal thyroxin secretion of the thyroid under the microscope as in the test tube the thyroid show remarkable and unique feature close spherule line by a single layer of cell enclose a gelatinous material know as colloid which stain deeply with acid dye comprise the unit of its architecture essentially it may be picture as a series of jelly bubble secrete by outlying cell a relatively high percentage of iodine be the unique distinctive fact in its chemistry discover by baumann in 1895 the presence of the element have focus the intelligence of chemist upon the gland with the consequent demonstration of arsenic also in it it be soon manifest that the secretion of the gland be dependent upon the iodine content for its activity active extract of the thyroid like thyreoglobulin and iodothyrin be prove to contain iodine and to become inactive when the iodine be remove effort to isolate the iodine contain active principle in pure form be fruitless until the work of kendall at the mayo foundation he obtain it as a white finely crystalline odorless and tasteless substance heat stable and analyzable the free form separate as a sheaf of fine needle kendall at first call it the a-iodine compound then name it thyroxin there be other internal secretion of the thyroid with a function of they own that have no iodine but they be secondary and obscure thyroxin be accept today as the purify internal secretion of the thyroid because all the effect of the whole gland may be elicit with it thyroxin produce result with dose amazingly minute compare with the quantity of whole gland necessary moreover a dose of thyroxin appear to last a organism in need of it over a period of time the other have to be administer continuously study with thyroxin carry on in recent year have round out the whole concept of the business of the thyroid in the body economy one may sum it up by say that the thyroid secretion be the _ great controller of the speed of live _ the more thyroid one have the faster one live the less one have the more slowly one live that be not to imply any direct proportion between the amount of thyroid secretion in a individual and the length of life to which he be destine the speed of living in the chemical sense -lrb- which be the fundamental sense -rrb- and the rate at which the chemical reaction go on that constitute the process of life be dependent upon the thyroid when the reaction go faster more oxygen and food material be burn up or oxidize more energy be liberate the metabolic wheel rotate more quickly the individual sens feel think and act more quickly liken one energy machine to another the thyroid may be compare to the accelerator of a automobile that be a rough and superficial comparison because a accelerator let in more of the fuel to be burn up while the thyroid make the fuel more combustible it thus resemble more the primer for a rich mixture of gasoline and air burn at a greater velocity than a poor one but the action of thyroid could really be simulated only by some substance that could be introduce into the best possible of gasoline mixture to increase its combustibility by a hundred per cent or more for that be what thyroid will do to we food nor have it only this destructive or combustion side withal there be at the same time a constructive action for the process free energy to be use for heat motion or other need the thyroid therefore in addition to its rle as a accelerator act too as the efficient lubricator for energy transformation so we see it as accelerator lubricator and transformer of we energy the gland of energy production the isolation of thyroxin have make possible the determination of the influence of the thyroid hormone upon the evolution of energy in any higher animal organism there be for every individual a constant know as the metabolic rate or the combustion rate a reading of the rate at which he cell be consume material for heat the metabolic rate be thus a gauge of the energy pressure within the organism it may be calculate by measure the amount of carbon dioxide gas exhale during a unit of time and the number of calorie of heat radiate by the skin simultaneously a simplify device have lately render it practicable to make actual determination by a few five-minute reading of the rate of oxygen absorption by the lung plummer also connect with the mayo foundation have show that what would amount to less than a grain of the thyroxin would more than double the amount of energy produce in a unit of time to be exact one milligram of thyroxin increase the metabolic rate two per cent that illustrate some of the power of the internal secretion of the thyroid and its importance to normal life the mobilization of energy but not only be the height of pressure of energy in the cell control by the thyroid the mobility of that energy be also control without it rapid and large fluctuation of energy output and elasticity and flexibility of energy mobilization for any sudden mental or muscular act let alone a emergency become impossible a woman suffer with myxedema the condition describe by the english physician gull as a cretinoid state supervening in the adult life of woman have a insufficient amount of thyroxin in she blood and tissue she be clumsy and awkward and will stumble when endeavor to walk upstairs any effort be almost paralyzed because the range of fluctuation of energy the ability to mobilize energy in turn dependent upon a ability to increase the metabolic rate be limit in slang phrase she can not step on it she existence be set to go at a rate in the neighborhood of forty per cent below the normal by the administration of thyroxin she metabolic rate can be raise to any desire figure the spark can be adjust so to speak to any point we like and it can be so maintain for year in the normal animal to be sure the internal secretion of the thyroid be not absolutely essential to life so it contrast with the hormone of the minute parathyroid place so closely to it a minimum dose of which be absolutely a prerequisite for continued life the fundamental chemical reaction within the cell occur in the complete absense of thyroxin but they go on in a relatively fix rigid and unvarying way confine within the narrow limit of a constant figure under such condition the level of energy production be bind to be low and to remain low and the modus of its mobilization slow and unwieldy with thyroid be introduce the trick of _ catalysis _ or the speed up of the vital chemical reaction through the agency of a _ intermediate _ which accelerate the process it be par excellence the great catalyst of energy in the body -lrb- a catalyst be a intermediary like the trace of water which will bring about a explosion between dry oxygen and hydrogen that without it have stay inert with the strongest current of electricity -rrb- thus it supply a mechanism not only for quantity output of that subtle reality we label energy but also a apparatus for vary the available amount of it and for permit the maximum range in ease and rapidity of its utilization the thyroid be still another device of life for procure more and more variation and differentiation its goal as far as we can peer through the opalescent screen upon which its manifestation quiver from another point of view the thyroid may be look upon as the organ evolve for maintain the same amount of iodine in the blood as there be in sea water sea water be we original habitat since like venus we have all come up out of the sea the more intimate study of the composition of the blood have reveal the most astonishing parallelism between it and the compound of sea water the blood be sea water to which have be add hemoglobin as a pigment for carry oxygen to the cell not in direct contact with the atmosphere nutrient to take the place of the prey we marine ancestor gobble up frankly and directly and white cell to act as the first line of defense to keep the concentration of iodine in the blood a constant the thyroid evolve since there be no iodine in most food and very little in those which do contain it that a minimum amount of iodine in the food be necessary to health be show by the existence of goitre region around some of the great lake in the united state for instance the water do not contain enough iodine as a result numerous case of goitre occur iodine in the form of sodium iodide in small dose will act as a prophylactic the amount of iodine in the blood be about one or two part to ten million and that of the liver be about three or four part to ten million since the liver be the most complex and active chemical factory in the body its appropriation of a greater amount of iodine for itself be understandable when thyroxin be administer in a single dose there be a distinct lag in the absorption of it by the tissue a single dose do not generate its maximum effect until the tenth day this effect continue for about ten day then there be a gradual decrease in the intensity of reaction for another ten day so that the length of time a single administration of thyroxin function within the body be about three week again we have occasion to notice a protective device of the cell since the presence of thyroxin in the tissue determine the rate at which they burn themselves up it be obvious that if there be no mechanism for retard its action and at need vary it they really would set fire to themselves that be to say if the tissue hold a maximum of the thyroid internal secretion and have to take up more and more as it be feed out to they by the thyroid through the blood the pressure of energy production would attain the state of a boiler without a safety valve even if self-destruction be avoid by the ingestion of the largest quantity of energy-bearing food rest for the cell would be difficult if not impossible the thyroxin in the tissue diminish after a period of great exertion the thyroxin probably be carry back to the thyroid gland and keep there as reserve until further demand so it have be discover that during the winter month the thyroid gland of beef sheep and hog all contain much less iodine than during the summer month during the winter month manifestly more energy be require to maintain body temperature hence the gland surrender more of its secretion to the tissue and so keep less of it itself there must be too a certain wear out of the potency of the iodine with time even dead inorganic catalyst make of simple element wear out after have be use time and time again though the thyroid be the supreme energizer life be incompatible with a certain excess of it death can be produce by successive daily injection of its internal secretion but it have besides the energize effect certain formative and nervous influence equally marvelous as illustration there be the case of thyroid deprivation in human being cretinism and myxedema as well as those in which it be believe there occur a excess of the thyroid secretion in the blood and tissue the condition of _ hyper_thyroidism cretinism as thyroid deficiency not that there be any arrest contrast of startling difference between the phenomenon present by different species the younger the animal the grosser the morbid symptom witness the animal fail to grow the bone and cartilage except of the skull fail to develop the abdomen project and become large and flabby the sex organ atrophy there be sterility pregnant rabbit abort hen produce very small egg or none at all these be the result of remove the thyroid in animal apathetic indifferent dirty awkward apparently idiotic describe the human cretin they skin be rough and coarse peeling in sheet in some it be considerably knarl and crease as in the aged and in other swollen hard and resistant the hair become shaggy and rough lose all luster and tend to grow irregularly and fall out the temperature become subnormal and a anemia supervene there be a distinct reduction in the resistance to infection and intoxication cretinism in the human be a condition in which the burning taper we call life flicker and smoulder and smoke thirty year ago it be a example of the most hopeless idiocy whole population be afflict with it but neither man of science nor bigot-fanatic assure by the divine confidence of its meaning as a visitation believe it could be modify a iota today that inept word cure may be apply to we power of attack upon it provide it be permit to attack early enough modification in the direction of the most surprising betterment be the miracle that have be work the history of a cretin run somewhat as follow : a baby be bear which in all appearance seem normal perhaps the nose be a trifle squatter than even the average new-born 's flat nose there may also be abnormal sleepiness greater even than that of the normal baby in the first month or two in that there be no spontaneous awakening from the coma for food but in most case this be put down to normal variability or maybe to that limbo of all a baby 's trouble : weakness after some month it be notice that the infant be fail to grow at the normal rate either physically or mentally examination at this time reveal a curious thicken of the dental ridge then the tongue take the center of the scene by become unusually thick and prominent to the point of project beyond the mouth at all time and interfere with breathing when the infant be in a recumbent position more and more of the characteristic of the affection turn up the queer repulsive pitiful face of the cretin which make they all seem brother or twin shape itself a yellowish white or waxy pallor rough dry scaly bloated skin swollen often wrinkled brow watery eye often almost conceal by the thickened eyelid the depressed pug nose with its wide thick nostril large erect ear the wobbly drool tongue stick out at one yet not in derision the hair thin and like tow in texture rather than human eyebrow and eyelash be scant and often absent the nail short thin and brittle the tooth very late in come may be represent by a few sharp point irregular decay quickly sometimes not succeed at all by those of the second dentition whatever growth occur be irregular and disproportionate the trunk though small compare with the head appear massive against the background of the diminutive extremity the back be somewhat humped arch at the waist-line while the abdomen protrude like a balloon with a hernia often at the navel the extremity be short bow cold and livid cover with roll of the infiltrate skin roll which can not be smooth out hand and foot be broad pudgy and floppy the finger stiff square and spade-like the toe spread apart like a duck 's by the solid skin above the collar bone there be frequently great pad of fat which sometimes encircle the narrow bull neck the mental state vary with the degree of deprivation of the internal secretion of the thyroid in the worst case it be repulsively vegetable even the intelligence common to the higher animal be want the cretin of the human plant kind as they have be nickname will not recognize mother or father or any person about they or even a person from a object and manifest no interest in anything or anybody not even toy hunger and thirst they manifest by grunt and inarticulate sound or by scream they neither smile cough nor laugh but sit like sphinx breathe but not react there be of course all grade and variety there be those who recognize parent and familiar face and exhibit some evidence of affection for they acquire a limited vocabulary and then cease no progress possible even with the alphabet they attain the size and age of two or three year and there stop altogether as if a permanent brake be apply to the wheel of they growth some higher type may even come to speak connected sentence and exhibit a certain mild spontaneity though stupid and slow and abnormally deliberate resemble the acquire form of thyroid deprivation or insufficiency for which ord invent the name myxedema i have fill in with some detail this thumbnail sketch of thyroid deprivation as it occur in infancy to illustrate how wide a sweep the gland 's lariat embrace skin hair bone muscle and fat brain and intelligence growth and development be modify precisely as the size and shape of certain crystal be modify by the presence or absence of ingredient in a apparently homogeneous solution a fertilize ovum in which the predecessor of the thyroid gland be present that be to say in which there be the seed and soil for its sprout look the same as one without that formative material yet when the time come for the internal secretion of the thyroid to put in its oar in the metabolic game its presence or absence make all the difference in the world to the individual in the middle of the nineteenth century when the concentration of phosphorus in the brain be establish as significant the cry for the emphasis of that fact be -- without phosphorus no thought be possible we can much more relevantly declare that without thyroid no thought no growth no distinctive humanity or even animality be possible for the epigram about phosphorus be bombast since it can be declaim with equal truth that without oxygen without carbon without nitrogen without any of the food element that go to make up the chemical composition of brain matter no thought be possible indeed if one be set upon the indictment of a single chemical element as the begetter of consciousness the prisoner at the bar would have to be copper there be more copper in the brain by a considerable degree than in any other organ of the body which perhaps will be exceedingly regret by the patron of the aristocracy of the soul who would have it as a emanation of a deposit in the brain of silver at least if not gold they be like the old lady who would never permit herself to be cure of she ailment except by gold plate pill copper however be not necessary to intelligence without thyroid there can be no complexity of think no learning no education no habit-formation no responsive energy for situation as well as no physical unfold of faculty and function and no reproduction of kind with no sign of adolescence at the expect age and no exhibition of sex tendency thereafter effect of feed thyroid how subtly the internal secretion affect every phase and aspect of child as well as adult by do something to the speed of activity in they cell be tell straightway by the effect of it when eat or introduce into the skin or blood of various people a cretin idiotic dwarfish deform hopeless a incessantly prod burden of sorrow to the mother who look upon the masterpiece she have labor to bring forth and behold a terrible gargoyle become transform when feed thyroid in a few day the cretin will get warmer and require much less wrap and bed-clothe with the improvement in circulation the color become better and the extremity lose they coldness in a week or so irritability and resentment at disturbance appear he will begin to recognize and know he parent smile and play there be a gradual return to the normal of the facial appearance and a resumption of growth all kind of marvelous growth effect occur twenty tooth may be cut in six month coarse rough dry shaggy hair become fine silken long and curly the skin become soft moist and roseate inch in height may be add every month bright active even talkative be the descriptive term a observer would apply after a few month a complete remaking of body and soul be apparently affect yet should the administration of the thyroid cease a almost immediate reversion to the original vegetative condition be inevitable after a few day reactiveness slow down the child will speak only when speak to will sit quietly in a chair all day and act semi-anesthetized gradually hair and skin return to the previous cold-blooded animal state and the whole picture of the cretin be in full bloom supply the internal secretion of the gland promptly repeat the transformation one wonder what be to be the ultimate fate of these reform cretin since the tale of the opening of life to they once consider hopeless idiot be scarce a generation old we have no datum as yet as to the character of they child or grandchild they adventure and vicissitude in short they life history those of whom we have any record be normal and healthy school child or worker alive to the interest of childhood or they occupation and social circle no one outside they family know that they be cretin and the most acute observer would be hard put to it to suspect what a theme for the reflection upon appearance the eminent victorian love there be possibility the imagination may envisage one may suppose such a cretin with all he other ductless gland intact grow successfully to manhood under careful medical guidance no one but himself be aware of he affliction outside of he medical adviser luck aid he to rise in the world or perhaps he have be bear with a spoon of the precious metal in he mouth adolescence love and marriage dance they sequence we hero of course keep he dread secret to himself whether such a omission of confidence would entitle he wife to a divorce be something court will be call upon to decide sooner or later but without anticipate the honeymoon involve a trip to the south sea a storm and a wreck throw they alone on a island tropical easy to live on and rescue in the course of a few month certain the man to he horror discover that he have save of he medicament only a pill box contain half a dozen of thyroid tablet he requirement be one a day he see they go day by day finally they be all go he feel he faculty slip hour by hour shall he tell she indecision grip he and he delay until the day when he consciousness sink to the point where he mind no longer grasp he problem the wife must endure the spectacle of the enchantment of she husband and he change from gallant lover to dull animal ogre a new version of beauty and the beast cretinism as one manifestation of a soul without thyroid or without enough thyroid be not all the first great success with thyroid be achieve in adult particularly adult woman exhibit a peculiar obesity coldness loss of hair and tooth and a remarkable lassitude and torpor that might be sum up as a chronic drowsiness like a saturation of the blood with some narcotic drug or there may be a melancholia or a lack of ability to seize the finer point of a mental process or a argument treat in the abstract child be say to be lazy slow or dull they experience a irritating difficulty in understand question and express they want and desire and so be declare to be vicious or stupid all these be grade of the degeneration which ord the englishman name myxedema at its worst it be a sort of bloat and dry of the body and the mind then there be infantilism which be help by the give of thyroid extract it differ from the ordinary cretinism in that while one be remind of the latter by the physical stunting and the other stigma there be a certain amount of intelligence which enable the individual to hold he own while he be a child he become a grown-up baby : at twenty prefer the company of child of ten and pass under the evil influence of design so-called normal person so dominate he will lie steal start fire commit almost any crime with no inherent flair for criminality but because of a lack of independent judgment and inability to resist suggestion and a desire to please friend he be simply a overgrown child who still love to play with toy laugh and cry become angry or afraid unreasonably and ridiculously and yell for mamma when thwart or scare so much for what happen when there be not sufficient of the thyroid secretion in the blood and tissue now to consider the effect of a excess of it the condition call hyperthyroidism as the insufficiency of it be label subthyroidism too much thyroxin can be introduce into the system of a normal individual or even a cretin by the simple administration of too large dose or over too long a time also a train of symptom similar to those evoke by a oversecretion of the thyroid may be mobilize by the taking of too much iodine great sorrow great joy a sudden severe jolt to the nervous equilibrium sexual excitement a overwhelming anger or grief may leave in they wake a permanent hyperthyroidism the symptom be the reverse of cretinism and myxedema there be a over-excitability of the nerve in place of sluggishness and a over-reactivity of the whole organism to its environment the heart 's action be too fast and under the slightest stimulus get faster to the point of obtrude itself into the conscious mind as a palpitation instead of the lowered temperature and coldness of the cretin there be a heighten temperature one or two degree above the normal and a feeling of heat the individual have a high warm color do not sleep well become or remain thin no matter how much he or she eat be abnormally susceptible sexually may suffer from a definite insomnia be emotional and perspire freely alert neurotic or high-strung magnetic and imaginative be some of the descriptive adjective applicable the eye be bright and prominent large and beautiful when they have not reach the stage entitle pop-eyed or they may even become so protuberant and bulge as to develop the expression of one stare aghast at some ineffable horror the latter be the feature of only the severest type when there be a associated goitre the combination designate as exopthalmic goitre there be too individual in whom hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism be mixed or rather alternate at one time they present the phenomenon of the one at another of the other they be the people who complain of the cyclic quality of they mood and purpose they mood will be a heaven of exaltation and exhilaration and then descend into a slough of despond from which they feel themselves inextricable they be always talk about the up and downs of they mental state headache and languor and fatigability dry skin and lack of appetite for food or exertion on one day or for one week give way on the next day or for the next week to a energetic gayety and sweaty flush skin a prominent appetite for food and every sort of activity drive to be forever on the go for one period in the next they feel like lie down most of the day with no inclination for any life whatever the stage of depression may go as far as a melancholia the stage of stimulation as far as mania they may simulate manic-depressive or cyclic insanity something restrain they and hold they bind as in a vise in the one cycle and then they be drive on beyond themselves by some invisible whip in the next thyroid as differentiator besides the action of the thyroid as energizer lubricator and growth catalyzer it have a remarkable power as a differentiator of tissue it determine the embryonic etching of the different organ which in they totality comprise the unique individual every multicellular animal must first have exist as a single cell the impregnate ovum with the body and personality of the ovum the creature be one and continuous literally something the single cell have make of itself by sub-dividing and differentiate in the process the cell mass often go through stage which stand out as individuality in themselves that appear on the surface absolutely unrelated so the caterpillar and the butterfly to the nave child seem as far apart as worm and bird in the case of the frog the tadpole as a first sketch seem completely a impossible and wild absurdity yet we know that there be a orderly progression of event a propagation of cell a forward go arrangement of chemical reaction that result in expansion and intricate complication of the organism just what the force at work in this most mysterious of all natural process be have be a intellectual mystery that the best mind of the race have attempt to get rid of with word like pangenesis -lrb- darwin -rrb- word of black -lrb- mediterranean or greek and latin -rrb- origin as allen upward have name they always cover a multitude of ignorance the gland of internal secretion here as in so many other dark place provide the open sesame to certain long close door of biology they offer themselves to we as the first definitely tangible agent which be know to keep the process of growth go and undoubtedly initiate the marvelous unfold of tissue and function organ and faculty sum up as development or differentiation thus by the direct feeding of thyroid at particular point in the differentiate history most curious effect have be elicit if the gland be make part of the nutriment the bathing environment of the tadpole a hastening of its metamorphosis be attain the tadpole life not out its day as a tadpole but precociously turn into a frog but such a frog it be a miniature frog a dwarf frog a frog see by look through the wrong end of the telescope a frog not magnify but micrify frog have be so create the size of fly there have occur a splitting of the two reaction which ordinarily go hand in hand : the reaction of growth which be just brute increase of total mass or weight and volume and the reaction of differentiation which be the finer process the picture be a frog but a frog the size of a tadpole a frog which have miss its childhood adolescence and youth skip over these transition stage into the adult age as a pigmy it be all as if a baby be suddenly to grow a beard and moustache evolve and shed tooth and acquire the manner of a earnest citizen and yet retain the height and weight of a baby that the spectacle of such a superbaby be not quite the most fantastic of all improbability be show by the condition of progerium first record by the briton hasting guilford a queer spectacle in which a child incontinently grow old without have live -- in the course of a few week or month you look upon he and see senility on a small scale but with all its peculiarity : wrinkled skin apathy gray hair and all the rest of it all we can say about it be that it be probably due to a paralysis of all the gland of internal secretion a removal of they influence upon the cell contrariwise to the feeding of thyroid removal of the thyroid of tadpole will prevent they development into frog if iodine be then feed to they say mixed with flour normal metamorphosis will occur if body be the tool chest which we carry about with we as samuel butler say then to the thyroid belong the name of tool-maker another function of thyroid that must be take into consideration be what have be speak of as its antitoxic function -- in plainer english its power to prevent poisoning or to increase resistance against poison include the bacterium and other live agent which cause the infectious disease each molecule of food ingest for assimilation into we substance accumulate a history of wanderings and pilgrimage attachment and transformation beside which the gross tramping of a marco polo become the rambling step of a seven-league boot giant in the course of its peregrination it become a potential poison potential because it be never allow to grow in concentration to the danger point the thyroid play its rle of protector like all the internal secretory machine in a animal deprive of a thyroid the feeding of meat shorten life -- a single sample of how it work to guard against intoxication from within the feeding of thyroid will also raise the ability of the cell to stand poison introduce from without -- intoxication of all sort alcohol and morphine will affect in much smaller dose the subthyroid person than the normal or the hyperthyroid as regard the infection which directly or indirectly kill most of we the injection of thyroid will increase the content in the blood of the protective antibody which preserve we temporarily at any rate against malignant invader the opsonin for example those substance which butter the bacterium so that the appetite of the white cell for they be properly rouse be mobilize by thyroid feeding or injection other substance in the blood which destroy and dissolve bacterium be also increase the thyroid probably perform these function by send its secretion to the cell directly responsible for the immunity reaction and stimulate they to activity a sketch of the thyroid like the foregoing show it as the wondrous controller of vitality and growth and indefatigable protector against intoxicant and injury when it be sufficiently active life be worth while when it be defective life be a difficult threatening blackness that would make it out as the gland of gland it be tremendously important without a doubt in normal everyday life but no more so than the other member of the cast the position of star it may claim but in vain the other gland of internal secretion to be sketch will each when the marvel of its business in the cell-corporation be consider present itself as candidate for the honor of the president justice should give fair credit to all the organ which fabricate the reagent of individuality and the regulator of personality the pituitary in the human skull the pituitary be a lump of tissue about the size of a pea lie at the base of the brain a short distance behind the root of the nose it be of a grayish-yellow color unpretentious and insignificant enough in appearance and so long neglect by the scientist who boast they immunity to the glamor of the spectacular guess at its nature date back to aristotle like most of its colleague among the gland of internal secretion it be really two gland in one two gland with but a single name at least it consist of two different part distinct in they origin history function and secretion but juxtapose and fuse into what be apparently a homogeneous entity they be conveniently speak of as the anterior gland and the posterior gland in the embryo the anterior gland be derive by a proliferation of cell from the mouth area the posterior gland represent a outgrowth of the oldest part of the nervous system when it be trace back along the tree of the vertebrate species it be find to be present in all of they a ancient invention its precursor have be identify in worm and mollusc and even among the starfish the pituitary be practically the same from myxine to man a trust veteran therefore among the internal secretory organ its importance can be surmise to understand the story of the pituitary variously acquire bit of information concern it have be assemble and fit together like the fragment of a picture puzzle as cushing have so well put it here and there piece stick out obviously out of place the relation of some of they to one another or to the whole design be not at all clear part appear to have be irrevocably lose or not yet to have turn up chance bystander will select odd figure and articulate they into a new harmony yet out of the jumble of fragment a fairly respectable insight have be gain in less than a half century the pituitary be cradle in a niche at the base of the skull which because of its form be know as the sellum turcica or turkish saddle so situate a operative approach to it be overwhelmingly difficult on the other hand x-ray study be favor nature 's darling treasure it might be call since there have be provide a skull within the skull to shelter it under the most highly magnifying lens of the microscope three kind of cell have be distinguish the anterior gland be a collection of solid column of cell surround by blood space into which they secretion be undoubtedly directly pour a gelatinous material presume to be the internal secretion of the gland have in fact be observe emerge from the cell into the blood space the posterior lobe or gland consist of secrete cell produce a glassy substance which find its way into the spinal fluid that bathe the nervous system the spinal fluid itself be a secretion of another gland at the base of the brain the choroid nerve and internal secretion be associate here with a closeness symbolic of they general relation from each portion of the gland -lrb- to stick to the accept nomenclature of speaking of the two gland as one -rrb- a active substance have be isolate robertson a american chemist separate from the anterior lobe a substance soluble in the fat solvent like ether and gasoline which he christen tethelin but pe smith have show that the active material be soluble neither in boiling water nor in boiling alcohol the typical fat solvent a number of fact favor the idea of the anterior lobe cell as stimulant of growth of bone and connect and support tissue generally from the posterior lobe pituitrin believe its internal secretion have be obtain in solution pituitrin be a substance of many marvelous function in general it control the _ tone _ of the tissue of involuntary or smooth muscle fiber of the blood vessel and the contractile organ of the body like the intestine the bladder and uterus when inject it will slowly raise the blood pressure and keep it raise for some time and will increase the flow of urine from the kidney and of milk from the breast it will also cause a intense continued contraction of the bladder and the uterus it be also say to control the salt content of the blood upon which its electrical conductivity and other property depend normally there be a certain fixed ratio of the salt in the blood which keep they like the ratio in sea-water again we have a example of the curious atavism of the internal secretion the thyroid remember keep the iodine concentration of the blood like that of the ocean we original habitat pituitrin likewise do its part to maintain we internal environment as near as possible to what be once the surrounding medium a substance somewhat similar have be find in the skin gland of toad the extraordinarily well protected position of the pituitary its persistence throughout life and its abundant blood supply emphasize its vital importance no other gland of internal secretion can adequately substitute for it complete expiration mean death in two or three day with a peculiar lethargy unsteadiness of gait and loss of appetite emaciation and a fall of temperature so that the animal become cold-blooded its temperature the same as that of the atmosphere it occupy if only part of the anterior lobe be take away there occur a remarkable degeneration of the individual the degeneration be not a mucinous infiltration of the skin and the internal organ which occur with thyroid deprivation but a fatty degeneration with a tendency to inversion of sex a singular somnolence a dry skin loss of hair a dull mentality sometimes epilepsy and a noticeable craving for and tolerance of sweet appear these be but a few of the observation obtain in experimental sub-pituitarism that be underaction or insufficient secretion of the pituitary produce by remove part of the anterior gland if such a experimental sub-pituitarism be start in infancy for instance in puppy there be a cessation or marked hinder and slow of growth that be dwarf be artificially create apropo pathologist have show that in several true human dwarf the gland be rudimentary or inadequate all of which go hand in hand with the evidence that the skeleton stand directly under the domination of the pituitary regulator of organic rhythm there be certain other singular by-effect of the gland in its relation to the periodic phenomenon of the organism like hibernation sleep and the critical sex epoch of both sex in hibernation or winter sleep the animal in cold weather pass into a cataleptic state in which it continue to breathe more deeply but more slowly than when awake but show no other sign of consciousness or life a lower blood pressure and a marked insensitivity to painful and emotional stimulus go with it there be a preliminary storage of starch in the liver and of fat throughout the fat depot of the body these be so like what happen after part of the pituitary be remove that a comparison of the two become inevitable common to both condition be a drop in the rate of tissue combustion or metabolism which can be relieve by injection of a extract of the pituitary a rise of temperature occur simultaneously moreover examination of the gland of internal secretion of hibernate species like the woodchuck during the period of hibernation show change in all of they but most marked in the pituitary the shrunken cell stain as if they too be asleep or in a rest stage the characteristic alive quality of these cell return without relation to food or climate when the animal come to in the spring at the vernal equinox hibernation may perhaps be put down to a seasonal wave of inactivity of the pituitary gland now winter sleep may be look upon as a exaggeration of ordinary night sleep the latter differ from the former only in its brevity in the natural sleep of non-hibernating species there occur too a fall in temperature moreover they all even man have a certain capacity for winter sleep as the experience of traveller and explorer in the arctic region indicate in certain part of russium where there be a scarcity of food during the winter month the peasant pass week at a time in a somnolent state arouse once a day for a scant meal just as the sex gland influence the body and mind profoundly with a certain cyclic periodicity of activity and inactivity -lrb- rut heat menstrual period and so on -rrb- which have be demonstrate to have a very close functional relationship with the pituitary so sleep and hibernation will bear interpretation as product of a temporary dormancy of the same gland we have then to set up in the place of morpheus and apollo the new god of the internal secretion of a chemical-making bit of the brain as a explanation of the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness there be individual who go about outside of hospital wall quasi-normally who be semi-hibernator or partial hibernator and who be really in a state of subpituitarism they be people who may have something wrong or inferior with they pituitary but not to the extent of interference with they daily life they go about with they type stamp upon they for the see eye the classical type be obese with fat distribute everywhere but more so in the lower abdomen and the lower extremity they be slow and dull and sexually inactive often impotent they be sometimes tall but most often dwarfish and may be subject to epileptic seizure they recall the picture of what happen to young dog partially deprive of the pituitary dickens deliver a perfect likeness of a extreme degree of the condition in the fat boy of the pickwick papers whose employment with mr wardle consist in alternate sleeping and eating when the pituitary overact all grade of overaction of the pituitary exist then its peculiar power to act as a stimulant to the growth of bone and the soft supporting and connect tissue like tendon and ligament come into play if the overaction or excess of secretion begin in childhood or adolescence that be before puberty there result a great elongation of the bone so that a giant be the consequence now giant have always appeal to the imagination of the little man and have have all kind of wonderful ability ascribe to they by he the giant and ogre of folk-lore and fairy tale be favor with the most extraordinary mental advantage direct and analytic acquaintance with the giant of we own day as well as a probe of they conduct in the past have show that normal giant -- person of exceptional size free from physical or mental deformity -- be rare there be people with _ hyper _ - pituitarism who exhibit the highest mental power in they be a increase activity of the posterior lobe in association with enlargement and hyperfunction of the anterior overgrowth be not so marked and the individual be lean and mentally acute but the ordinary giant be one in whom there be degeneration of the pituitary after too much action of the anterior and too little of the posterior gland a tumor or disease process in the gland be most often responsible if the overaction of the anterior happen after puberty when the long bone have set and can not grow longer a peculiar diffuse enlargement of the individual occur especially of he hand and foot and head the nose ear lip and eye get larger and coarser as these people be rather big and tall to begin with the effect produce be that of a heavy-jawed burly bulk person with bushy overhang eyebrow and a aggressive manner for there be too something distinctive about they mentality which have be as often portray as those of the pathologic giant rabelai ' most famous character gargantua belong to the group we recruit more drum-majors than prime minister from among these people they often suffer much from torture boring headache and a consequent despondency and feeling of hopelessness which color gray the entire spiritual spectrum up to a certain point these sufferer have a remarkable alertness and capacity when conscious of the malady they often meet it with a doggedly courageous optimism which be another characteristic although woman occasionally commit suicide in both the semi-hibernator who remind one of cattle and in the giant or acromegalic type who remind one of the anthropoid ape there develop a distinct diminution of sexual life a abnormal process in the anterior gland whether of oversecretion or of undersecretion may interfere with the proper functioning of the posterior gland the secretion of which be tonic not only to the brain cell but also to the sex cell thus young animal deprive of the pituitary will not if male grow spermatozoon nor ripe ovum in the female moreover the feeding of pituitary increase sexual activity in the case of hen this have be demonstrate to be about thirty per cent by a pretty experiment at a time of the year when egg diminish six hundred and fifty-five hen lay two hundred and seventy-three egg upon a ordinary diet when pituitary be add to they food for four day the number of egg rise to three hundred and fifty-two a increase of seventy-nine in addition the fertility of the chick bear of these egg be augmented especially if both parent have be feed on pituitary there be other aspect of the relation of the pituitary to sex which will be treat in another chapter the bony cradle of the pituitary always in attempt to understand the pituitary it be necessary to remember that it be tightly pack in the bony cradle the turkish saddle or sellum turcica should some stimulus local or in the blood arouse the gland to growth a good deal will depend upon whether it have room to grow in or it will make room by erode the bone with space for the formation of a large anterior and posterior pituitary gland there will be create the long lean individual with a tendency to high blood pressure and sexual trend great mental activity initiative irritability and endurance a outstanding trait of these favorite of fortune be that they remain thin no matter how much food they consume and they have the best of appetite they often be subject to severe headache because of intermittent swell of the gland against the bone of its container if the bony container be or become too small for its contents it be interesting that along with the other sign of pituitary insufficiency such as undersize obesity and asymmetry there develope conspicuous moral and intellectual inferiority the unfortunate suffer from compulsion and obsession and lack inhibition they be the pathological liar with little or no initiative or conscience -- amoral not merely theoretically but instinctively and unconsciously with all the certitude and perfection of the unconscious accomplishment thyroid and pituitary the thyroid and the pituitary have often be compare the anterior gland and the thyroid arise from almost the same spot in the embryonic oesophagus the thyroid be a outgrowth in front the anterior pituitary a outgrowth behind of the same soil they both control growth marvelously also the differentiation the mass and intricacy of the tissue but they differ in the site of they control the thyroid bear more directly upon the inner and outer covering of the body the skin the skin gland and the hair the mucous membrane and the irritability and the preparedness for response of the nerve the pituitary act more upon the framework of the body the skeleton and the mechanical support and mover bone and ligament muscle and tendon seem to be within its immediate sway the secretion or secretion of the pituitary diffuse directly into the fluid bathing the nervous system supply beneficent stimulant and aid in the abstraction of harmful waste so while the thyroid raise the energy level of the brain and the whole nervous system as a byproduct of its general awakening effect upon all the cell of the body the pituitary probably stimulate the brain cell more directly perhaps in the manner of caffeine or cocaine the difference between the thyroid and the pituitary might be put this way : that while the thyroid increase energy evolution and so make available a greater supply of crude energy by speed up cellular process the pituitary assist in energy transformation in energy expenditure and conversion especially of the brain and of the sexual system in short the thyroid facilitate energy production the pituitary its consumption the pituitary appear therefore as the gland of continued effort hence fatigability a inability to maintain effort be one of the prominent complaint when there be destruction or a insufficiency of it for one reason or another as such it contrast with the gland of emergency effort know as the adrenal chapter iii the adrenal gland the gonad and thymus like the pituitary each adrenal gland be a double gland that be consist of two distinct portion unite together one might say by the accident of birth it would be confusing however to speak of each as two gland because there be as a matter of fact two separate adrenal gland one in the right side of the abdomen and the other in the left each gland be composite or duplex how the two part come to be unite be a long story interesting but too long to be recount here in fish they be apart and independent each adrenal be a cocked hat shape affair astride the kidney easily recognize because of its yellowish fatty color indeed for century the gland be not give a separate status as organ but be pass up as part of the fat ensheathe the kidney in childhood and youth in common with the other gland they be relatively larger and more prominent than in the adult also at every age the amount of blood pass through they be very large compare to they size they tremendous importance in the body economy account for they be so favor the two part of which each gland be compose be know as the cortex or outer portion -lrb- literally the bark -rrb- and the medullum or inner portion -lrb- literally the core -rrb- no clean-cut boundary sharply delimit the two as strand and peninsula of tissue of one portion penetrate the other in the history of they development in the species and the individual and in they chemistry and function a sharp difference contrast they in the embryo the cortex be derive from the same patch that give rise to the sex organ the ovary in the female and the testis in the male describe as the germinal epithelium how intimately the two set of gland be connect be neatly point by this fact of a common ancestor all vertebrate possess adrenal gland in the lowest of the vertebrate petromyzon the two part be distinct the cell of the cortex-to-be be situate in the wall of the kidney blood vessel project as peninsula in the blood stream the blood sweeping over and past they the medulla-to-be consist of cell accompany the vegetative nerve among reptile the two become adjacent for the first time and among bird one part occupy the mesh of the other the size of the cortex vary directly with the sexuality and the pugnacity of the animal the charge buffalo for example own a strikingly wide adrenal cortex the flee rabbit on the other hand be conspicuous for a narrow strip of cortex in its adrenal human being possess a cortex larger than that of any other animal no definite chemical substance have as yet be isolate from the cortex that remain a problem for the investigator of the future but certain observation especially concern the relation between the development and behavior of the so-called secondary sex characteristic those quality of skin hair and fat distribution physical configuration and mental attitude which distinguish the sex and the condition of the gland indicate clearly that a internal secretion will be isolate and that it will in its activity furnish certain predictable feature three different layer of cell arrange in string that interpenetrate to form a network directly bath by blood that break in upon they from _ open _ blood vessel compose the cortex most remarkable be this method of blood supply for it be exceedingly common among the invertebrate and rare among the vertebrate in certain disturbance of these gland especially when there be tumor which supply a massive dose of the secretion to the blood presumably peculiar sex phenomenon and general developmental anomaly and irregularity be produce if the disease be present in the fetus take hold before birth and so bring into the world with the child there evolve the condition of pseudo-hermaphroditism the individual if a female present to a greater or less extent the external habit and character of the other sex so that she be actually take for a man although the primary sex organ be ovary often not discover to be such except when examine after a operation or death how closely such a occurrence touch upon the problem of sex inversion and perversion come at once to mind if the process involve the adrenal cortex attack it after birth the symmetrical correspondence and harmony of the primary sex organ and the secondary sex character be not affect but there follow a curious hastening of the ripening of body and mind sum up in the word puberty a precocious puberty with the most startling effect a little girl of 2 3 or 4 year of age perhaps will come to exhibit the growth and appearance of a girl of 14 she begin to menstruate she breast swell she shoot up in height and weight sprout the hair distribution of the adult and the mentality of the adolescent restless acquire doubt emerge a tot bewitch into puberty a boy of six or seven may suddenly in the course of a few week or month become a little man robust rather short and stocky but moustach with the muscular strength and sexual power of a man and thinking as a man it be all as if into some fermentable medium or solution a little yeast be drop that change the quiet calm of its surface into a bubble effervesce revolution it suggest at once that maturation the transformation of the child into the man or woman must be due to the pour into the blood and the body fluid of some substance which act like the yeast in the fermentable solution the adrenal cortex be one source of the maturity-producing internal secretion if trouble in the adrenal cortex start after puberty phenomenon of the same type but of a different order exhibit themselves a woman say in the thirty become thus afflict slowly or quickly she body will be cover by a abundant growth of hair more or less of a beard and moustache appear upon the face she voice will become deep and penetrate she muscle will harden and she will show a capacity for hard physical labor sexually she appear to be make over masculinity now predominate in she make-up virilism be the name by which the french in particular have popularize the knowledge of the condition virilist have to shave or be shave regularly and be not bother in the least by the care responsibility jealousy and anxiety of personal beauty for the change in they spirituality make they immune to the preoccupation of the feminine the cause of such a transformation in a previously entirely normal woman have be find to be a tumor of the adrenal cortex but not only be sexuality and the conduct of the secondary sex character connect with the adventure of the adrenal cortex the development of the master tissue of the body the brain the pride and darling of evolution be in some subtle way correlate with it the adrenal cortex contain more of the phosphorus-containing substance of the general nature of those find in the central nervous system than any other gland or non-nervous tissue in the body during human intrauterine life the adrenal gland be large and conspicuous in the first half of the second month be twice as large as the kidney most of this relatively huge size which happen in the human alone and not in other animal be due to enlargement of the cortex should this preponderance of the cortex over the medullary portion not occur in the human that be if the proportion remain like those of other animal the brain fail to develop properly or a entirely brainless monster be generate the human brain therefore probably owe its superiority over the animal brain to the adrenal cortex in development anyhow the growth of the brain cell they number and complexity be thus control by the adrenal cortex besides its action upon the sex cell and the brain cell the internal secretion of the adrenal cortex act upon the pigment cell of the skin blunt they sensitiveness to light in degeneration of the interior of the gland which destroy the medullum but not the cortex the color of the skin be leave unmodified if however the cortex be invade as happen most often in the classical tuberculosis of the adrenal which draw the attention of the englishman addison to they then a darken of the skin which may go on to a negroid bronzing follow that mean a increase sensitiveness of the pigment cell of the skin to light skin color control may therefore be look upon as a adrenal cortex function so much be know about the adrenal cortex upon the medullum the interior gland of the gland there have be lavish a amount of attention beside which the cortex be to be class as a neglect wall-flower nearly everything that possibly could be determine about a internal secretion have in its case be settle or plausibly guess at the cell manufacture the secretion its exact chemistry and function its action upon the blood the liver and spleen the heart and lung the brain and nervous system have be minutely investigate study and chart its source in the food its fate in the body its place in the history of the individual and the species its importance as a weapon in the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest have be make the subject of a astonishing number of research consider the short period of scarce three decade that intensive science have center its barrage upon it in the first place the medullum contain numerous nerve cell belong to the vegetative also call the sympathetic nervous system but these nerve cell be merely minor note of the symphony the motif be settle by a majority of large granular cell which stain a distinctive yellowish-brown when the gland be fix in a solution of bichromate of potash all chromium salt in fact stain the therefore label chromaffin cell the characteristic staining power appear to be dependent upon or correlate with the presence of the internal secretion of the medullum of the adrenal adrenalin for the content of adrenalin as calculate chemically and the depth of stain as see under the microscope rise and fall together chromaffin reaction and adrenalin content go together the poisonous skin gland of the toad have be find to give a marked chromaffin reaction and to contain a large amount of adrenalin other mass of cell in the human body especially along the course of the sympathetic nervous system have be show to give the reaction and to contain adrenalin the erratic brown-squard pound and hammer away for more than thirty year on the importance to life of the adrenal gland since death occur so quickly after they removal but it be not until schaefer the scotch physiologist -lrb- who have do more than any other live man to stimulate study of the internal secretion -rrb- find that a extract of they when inject into a vein produce a remarkable though temporary rise of the blood pressure that a real enthusiasm for its investigation be generate as the upshot a number of other significant property besides the first of blood-pressure raise have be put down to its credit chemical test demonstrate that it originate in the medullum the exact amount of it present in the medullum in the blood issue from the adrenal and in the circulation in general have be determine the concentration in the blood be about one part in twenty million while there be about a hundred thousand time as much store in the gland as reserve in infection and intoxication after muscular exertion and with profound emotion there be a decrease of it in the gland and a increase in the blood pain and excitement especially fear and rage will bring about its discharge from the gland with its entry into the blood there be a tremendous heightening of the tone a _ tense _ of the nervous system the nerve cell become more sensitive to stimulus more sugar be pour into the blood from the liver more red blood corpuscle be squeeze into the circulation from the blood lake of the liver and spleen there be a redistribution of the whole blood mass a good deal of it be withdraw from the internal viscera and hurry to the skeleton muscle and the brain the heart beat more strongly the eye see more clearly the ear hear more distinctly and the breathing be more rapid the temperature rise the hair of the head and the body become erect the skin get moist and greasy it will help a fatigued muscle to regain its normal tone in short it have a reinforce action upon the nutritive property of the blood the tone of the muscle and the activity of the brain and the vegetative nerve chemist set themselves the task of discover just what be the substance possess of such extraordinary and hitherto unimagined property the pure adrenalin be isolate capable of evoke all the reaction of the impure adrenal extract mixture the final triumph be the preparation of it artificially in the laboratory its synthesis when a substance can be synthesize in the chemist 's laboratory it mean that its composition have become thoroughly understand here at last be a example of those mysterious internal secretion the existence of which have indeed be postulate and prove but which have never actually be inspect by the eye of mortal man to have it in a test-tube indeed to possess it in large quantity in bottle to be able to manipulate and examine it without fear of the co-action of admixed impurity to see it with the eye and to taste it with the tongue be truly a marvel the miracle arouse at once score of research the gland of combat and fight consider its effect one be remind at once of the similarity to the expression of a primitive emotion like anger or fear so by turn a relation upside down it be argue that if artificial adrenalin could produce all these effect of a emotion like fear the emotion itself should produce a increase of the natural adrenalin in the blood this be find to be the case cannon of harvard have build up a entire theory of the adrenal as the gland of emergency upon the basis of these effect in the face of crisis the adrenal function as the gland of combat and indeed as i have mention the more combative and pugnacious a animal the more adrenal it have while the timid and meek and weak have less the gland of combat the gland of emergency energy the gland of preparedness -- such be the adrenal gland when view from the adrenalin standpoint a picture of its activity in the evolutionary scheme of struggle and survival be something like the following : meet a enemy the animal be put in danger it must fight or flee for its life in either case certain condition must be fulfil if the body of the animal endanger be to be save to prevent injury to itself and to do as much injury as possible to the foe -- that become its immediate urge and necessity of the two animal if in one the heart should begin to beat more strongly the blood pressure to rise the blood to flow more rapidly through the attack instrument the muscle the tooth and claw the brain and its eye while the other animal experience none of these the former will be the victor in fight or flight adrenalin may be look upon as the invention for the mobilization at a moment 's notice or as we say after generation of use by instinct of all these visceral and blood advantage in the struggle of combat or flight the nature of instinct in its relation to the gland of internal secretion be a problem for another chapter but we may note that the james-lange theory of a emotion regard it as a consciousness of the very change in the organism adrenalin cause since adrenalin be the starter of the whole process and since mcdougal have define emotion as the feeling aspect of a instinct just as a instinct may be define as the motor aspect of a emotion the adrenal as emotion-genetic and instinct-genetic play a part in the most profound process of the subconscious and unconscious the mechanism of fear we may therefore visualize a mechanism of fear a instant excess of adrenalin occur in the blood of say a cat when it be alarm by the sight of a dog in that cat at the image of its hereditary enemy certain brain cell vibrate a nerve tract in use as the line for that particular message in a hundred thousand generation of cat whirr its yell to the medullum of the adrenal gland through the tiny solitary vein of the gland a infinitesimal quantity of the reserve adrenalin respond and with what a effect the blood that primary medium of life the precious fluid that be everything must all or nearly all be send to the firing line the battle trench the brain and muscle now or never so the blood be draft from the non-essential industry -- from the skin where it serve normally to regulate the heat of the body -- from the digestive organ the stomach and intestine which must forsooth stop now since if the organism will die they last effort of digestion have be do -- from the liver and spleen great chemical factory in normal time but now of no moment besides should they be wound it be better they should be bloodless and so run the least chance of bleed to death or get infected for the more tissue there be around the greater the danger of infection so like the skin the liver which usually hold in its great lake and vessel about a quarter of all the blood in the body be almost drain and blanch at the same time its great storehouse of sugar open they sluice and pour into the blood increase its sugar content by about a third because the combustion of sugar be the easiest way of get energy free in the cell sugar be the most quickly burn up of all the food and so the great food of the muscle and the heart the poison of fatigue acid product of the contraction of muscle be antagonize and neutralize by substance form in the course of the oxidation of the sugar adrenalin too be directly fatigue antagonist it cause the blood to clot faster than under ordinary circumstance it erect the hair of the animal and dilate the pupil of the eye there be a increase of the apparent size all of which be to intimidate the enemy like a indian 's painting of he face blue and green it also -- but what else do it not do the story of adrenalin would have delight the heart of samuel butler he note book opulent as they be would have be the richer in page and page with he comment on it contend as he do with the pompous dogmatic mechanism worship of the new scientific clique of he time on the one hand and the superstition of the old theological caste on the other he have to fight the hardest kind of guerrilla warfare in defense of the purpose of life adrenalin that weapon of a gland trace its ancestry back to the begetter of the brain itself for brain and adrenal gland both have evolve from the small nerve ganglion of the invertebrate would have back up to the hilt he argument which he have to elaborate on the indirect grounds of analogy and induction essential for defense and for protection -- a organ in which everything necessary for the stratagem of retreat or the offensive of attack be supply ad libitum while everything non-essential or detrimental to the matter of the moment be inhibit arrest and suppress -- no more perfect sample of the design with which life be drench could be imagine by the most closeted of passionate idealist failure of the adrenal as the gland of acute stress and strain the adrenal in modern life be call upon to function more heavily and frequently than in the past as a matter of fact the life of the beast of jungle and field as well as of savage and barbarian be just as full of emergency and shock as that of the average city man or woman in the case of the latter however inhibition education and the condition of modern living improper food sedentary indoor confinement and universal rack and noise have undoubtedly make greater and greater demand upon the adrenal gland chemical quantitative study have show that by repeated stimulation the adrenal gland may be exhaust of they reserve supply of secretion which return only insufficiently if not enough time be give for recuperation there result a condition of temporary or chronic adrenal insufficiency supposedly a insufficient functioning of the gland as a whole in person so afflict there appear a fatigability a sensitiveness to cold cold hand and foot which be sometimes mottle bluish-red a loss of appetite and zest in life and a mental instability characterize by a indecision and a tendency to worry a weepishness upon the slightest provocation a certain number of the temporary breakdown or nervous prostration which seem to be grow more common or fashionable may be sometimes trace to such a deficiency of normal response to the need of everyday conflict by the adrenal gland in some mental and physical elasticity be totally lose and even the slightest exertion in either field often cause so much weariness and exhaustion as to be prohibit depression and even melancholia be associate with the fear of not be able to accomplish good work hitherto easy and enjoy sometimes they be obsess with the thought that they have lose they nerve completely and so dread to commit themselves in even the most trivial of situation the vacillate frame of mind be so distressing at time as to arouse thought of suicide when these symptom concur in the type of personality whom i shall describe as the unstable adrenal-centered individual there be evidence for explain the process as the effect of a insufficiency of secretion by the adrenal gland shock collapse heart failure and sudden death follow abnormal emotion like a attack of rage or the terror of a railroad accident or bad news or excessive exertion like run a long race or climb a high mountain when in poor general health as the phrase go or in the terminal stage of infection like epidemic influenza or asiatic cholera have be put down to a acute insufficiency of the adrenal gland a lowered temperature blood pressure and blood vessel tone exhibit in test of the response of the skin to stroke be present in all of these and point the same moral in the second half of the 19th century a american physician beard describe neurasthenia a general disturbance of the body and mind not properly classifiable as a disease but serious enough to incapacitate or at least greatly limit the sufferer the neurasthenic be to be recognize by the fact that the most painstaking objective examination of he organ reveal nothing the matter with they yet accord to he complaint everything be the matter with he he can not sleep when he lie down he can not keep awake when he stand up he can not concentrate but still he be pitifully worry about he life the slightest irritant cause he to go off the handle as he work himself up into he hysterical state as a reaction to a disagreeable person or problem irregular blotch may appear on he face and neck generally he hand and foot be clammy and perspire he face be abnormally flush or pallid the eye be worried or starey unwonted wander sensation involve now this area of the body or now that obsess he as the blood pressure be too low for the age the circulation be nearly always inadequate and palpitation of the heart be a frequent complaint so frequent that attention be often center upon the heart a diagnosis of heart disease be make and the unfortunate be doom for life -- to brood over horrible possibility the brooding over themselves and they trouble be one of the distinctive feature of the whole complex neurasthenia may masquerade as any organic disease a individual with a soil for a neurasthenic reaction to life will become neurasthenic when confront by any stone wall include a serious ailment within himself beard 's neurasthenia leap at once into the limelight it be seize upon and applaud in europe as a good new name for a old condition observe particularly in american abroad to rest from the fatigue of the get-rich-quick game of industrial speculator in fact the name of the american disease be give to it various theory about the effect of climate sunlight per square inch and unit of time oxygen content of the air and so on be offer up upon the altar of scientific explanation sir arbuthnot lane famous protagonist of lane 's intestinal kink say that all american be neurasthenic neurasthenia become one of the most popular of diagnosis and remain so today neurasthenia regard as a reaction of people to the stress and strain of life have without a doubt increase the most casual of observer will tell you that the generation of the great war be a neurasthenic generation it take its pleasure too intensely its pain too seriously its trouble too flippantly but what be neurasthenia beard himself regard it as a chronic fatigue and loss of tone of the nervous system a literal interpretation of he term that the conception as far as it go be valid be prove by the fact that it be the neurasthenic who furnish the majority of the clientele of the cult the christian scientist the osteopath and the chiropractor and who be the subject of the faith and miracle cure like those of lourde that be because they particular disease or what appear to they to be they very own disease -- and they certainly cherish they ailment -- be but a expression of a compensation for indeed a consolation for the underlie feeling of insufficiency or inferiority be there no moral code be there no social system nor the consequent inculcate conscience to be responsible to there would be no such disguise symptom as the disease which preoccupy the consciousness the feeling of insufficiency would be there and would be recognize as in itself the disease to the physiologist and the psychologist the feeling of insufficiency be the disease no matter how spectacular the overlay phenomenon -- a cripple on crutch or a man blind and speechless shell shock be now acknowledge to belong to this group now one of the outstanding effect of disease of the adrenal gland be the feeling of muscular and mental inefficiency and as a matter of fact a good number of observation conspire for the idea that a certain number of neurasthenic be suffer from insufficiency of the adrenal gland the chronic state of the acute phenomenon know as the nervous breakdown really represent in they a breakdown of the reserve of the adrenal and a elimination of they factor of safety in the light of that conception the great american disease -- dementia americana -- be see to be adrenal disease -- and the american life to be the adrenal life often make too great demand upon that life and so break down with it adrenal excess the converse of adrenal insufficiency that of adrenal excess also exist in certain type of the middle-aged a high blood pressure accompany by a great capacity for work have be show to be associate with hypertrophy of the cortex in woman there be a degree of masculinity as the adrenal in woman make for masculinity neutralise more or less the specifically feminine influence of the internal secretion of the ovary such woman possess a vigor and energy above the normal and command responsible position in society not only among they own sex but also among man they be the one who in the present overturn of the traditional sex relationship will become the professional politician banker captain of industry and director of affair in general the gonad -lrb- _ sexual puberty or interstitial gland _ -rrb- the gonad be the name apply to the generative or reproductive gland consider collectively in the male they be the testis in the female the ovary they be therefore sometimes call the sexual gland as they possess definite canal for the removal of they gross secretion the specific reproductive cell ovum or spermatozoon to a surface of the body they be first of all gland of external secretion but they have be also find to hold secretory cell not concern with the making of the reproductive corpuscle but as all the evidence indicate with the manufacture of a internal secretion these interstitial cell form the interstitial gland a classic example of a gland of internal secretion lodge in the interstice of a gland of external secretion be thus furnish by the gonad origin of sex trait the history of sex go back far in the scheme of life the immortality of the ameba be at one time one of the indisputable of biology then some observation be make which throw doubt upon a long accept fact now declare a dogma lately opinion have veer back to immortality but in the case of a close relative of the ameba the one-celled animal know as the paramecium union with another paramecium true conjugation have be prove necessary to prevent death sooner or later sex here appear in its most primitive form on the basis of exchange of necessary material between individual to prevent death they own have be so to speak wear out in the course of metabolism specifically different sex come later when mortality be a universal fate as a means of rebirth and escape from death then the sex develop they latest function most prominent among the younger vertebrate of act as nature 's most potent method of variation and differentiation in the pursuit of the different nature have exalt sex and the intensity of the sex life as far as the preservation of a species be concerned and the reproduction of the individual the asexual method bud for example would have do well enough but when it come to enact a different individual apart from the effect of environment sex stand out as the favored method of life the development of the sex and the sexual life bring a new element of conflict into the living world before the advent of the sex the conflict be essentially for the means of existence food alone but with the sexual life come a conflict for sex pleasure a competition among member of the same species for the same individual as they sex partner the result be the introduction of a factor in evolution which darwin examine so closely in the descent of man the sex conflict have be the cause for the origin and the survival of certain physical and mental trait helpful in sex attraction sex combat the growth of the embryo and the nutrition and safety of the young of a species -- in short the whole process of sexual selection the proportion of the skeleton the distribution of hair and fat the construction of organ of attack and defense the color of the skin the cyclic process of preparation for impregnation the oestrus or heat period in animal the menstrual period in the human be the psychic reaction to danger and combat have all be thus determine that man be beard while woman be not -- that woman have potentially functional breast while man have not -- the aggressive pugnacity of man contrast with the more passive timidity of woman have all be evolve in the sex struggle survive because most effective in that struggle these so-called secondary sexual characteristic be a expression of the influence of the internal secretion of the gonad or the interstitial gland some call they puberty gland because they ripening initiate puberty we know that these interstitial gland to stick to that name -lrb- rather than to the name of the puberty gland since they serve not only to induce puberty but to maintain maturity -rrb- be the actual primary dictator of the process by which male and female be distinguish if not create castration be probably the first surgical operation carry out for experimental purpose suggest no doubt by a curiosity concern its effect trepanning of the skull the geologic record indicate be do even by the cave man but as a experimental operation castration seem to hold the primary position in the annals of surgery its effect note the satisfaction of one of the lower human instinct jealousy popularize it from the day of semiramis eunuch have be commonplace figure of the east they function definite : to guard the harem of the powerful the age of abdul hamid witness no diminution of the barbaric torture by which child be prepare for the profession it be to the credit of england that in its dominion in the orient the practice have be abolish but it go on even today accord to the best authority four out of five of these victim at the auto-da-fe of a vicious human instinct die immediately or soon after from exhaustion due to pain and infection not all of the ancient nation countenance the brutal horror the hebrew placard castration a unpardonable sin make it a sin to castrate even animal nor be any man so mutilate permit to worship in the house of the lord -lrb- deuteronomy xxiii 11 -rrb- yet we have evidence that the latter jewish king employ foreign eunuch in they harem who often hold the most important position as minister of the court besides the eunuch another group of people have present material for the study of the interstitial gland these be the skoptzus of russium and the lipowaner of roumanium among they castration be a religious ritual mankind have always be most brutal to itself in the name of the ideal these sect be found because in the eighteenth century a antipode of joseph smith and brigham young discover this passage in matthew xix 12 for there be some eunuch which be so bear from they mother 's womb and there be some eunuch which be make eunuch of man : and there be eunuch _ which have make themselves eunuch for the kingdom of heaven 's sake _ he that be able to receive it let he receive it he decide that he be inspire to spread the gospel of castration a sect be found who think that surgery be the easiest way to enter the gate of paradise and they multiply and fructify the sect exist today and some of the most interesting study of the internal secretion of the interstitial gland have be make among they related to acquire eunuchism be the condition of eunuchoidism the eunuch which be so bear from they mother 's womb baron larey the great surgeon of napoleon 's army be they first painter he be the only altruist bonaparte say he have ever meet in he life he portray a group of soldier with peculiarly high-pitched voice smooth and hairless skin and atrophy generative organ a somewhat similar picture be evolve in certain type of insufficiency of the pituitary gland feature of the picture be exhibit with disturbance of the other internal secretory gland also like the thymus but a host of experiment and datum prove the interstitial gland to be the direct controller of elementary sexuality and the specific sex trait of male and female beginning with berthold back in the first half of the nineteenth century who study the fowl a number of observation have be make on the effect of excision translocation and transplantation of these gland the result of the experiment and observation can be sum up as follow : if the male individual be castrate before puberty that be before the advent of the sexual life secondary sex quality do not develop in male the generative organ do not grow hair on the face do not appear hair elsewhere on the body remain generally scanty the voice continue as high-pitched as the child 's there be more or less muscle weakness obesity and mental sluggishness in other word we have a effeminate man technically a eunuch in the castrated female the pelvis do not grow to the normal feminine size the breast do not swell as they should more or less hair come out on the face the voice be low-pitched and tend to be rather husky the leg be longer and again the mentality be dull that be a masculine sort of woman be produce in short the castrate male take on a feminine type and the castrated female a male type in either case there be also a infantilism a retention of the infantile mental trait a lack of development of the adult mental attitude and reaction now if in the castrate male be transplant a ovary the positive characteristic of the female be evoke such as enlarged mammary gland and a tendency to secretion of milk experiment have also be report in which a uterus be also place in such a animal with a means of entry and pregnancy follow if in the castrated female a testicle be plant the masculine trait become much more marked and striking a direct exchange of the male and female rles can thus be achieve castration after puberty can not modify profoundly structure like the skeleton which be already complete yet it may unquestionably bring about definite retrogressive change in the secondary sex character : reduction or loss of virility diminution of facial and body hair and a general presenility or hastening of senility how remarkably these interstitial cell influence the entire structure and vitality of the organism be indicate by these fact how much they have to do with sexual impulse sexual excitement and sexual desire what the freudian have popularize as the libido and how subtly they act upon the come and duration of adolescence and maturity as well as sexual precocity and peversion we shall consider in a later chapter but it be enough now to remember that these interstitial gland be the primary dictator of the genital sense and flair of the individual in any attempt at measurement of man and woman the quality and quantity of the internal secretion of the interstitial cell must be respect as a fundamental consideration the womanly woman and the manly man those ideal of the victorian which crumble before the attack of the ibsenite strindbergian and shavian in the ninety but which must be recognize as quite valid biologically be the masterpiece of these interstitial cell when in they perfection they be such solely because of the right concentration in the blood of the substance manufacture not only by these cell but by all the gland of internal secretion for it can not be repeat and emphasize too often that the interstitial cell of the sex gland be most sensitive to all kind of other influence and in particular the other internal secretory organ they may indeed be watch as a index scale or barometer of the general tone of the whole internal secretion system sex variation offer a variety of clue to variation disturbance predominance and abnormality in all the component of the ductless gland association to take a single instance the development of the long bone be dependent upon the handling of food lime by the body eunuch and eunuchoid that be individual with insufficient internal secretion of the interstitial cell have longer bone and more fragile bone than the normal vice versa those with a excess of the secretion have shorter and thicker bone the earlier the onset of menstruation which mean puberty the shorter the extremity as the action of the internal secretion of the ovary close the story of the growth of the long bone the ovary be a most important factor in the regulation of the power of the organism to keep lime in the bone if they over-secrete in a excess which can not be take care of by the other gland of internal secretion the body lose lime a softening and curving of the bone occur and the most horrible deformity and torture for the sufferer take out the ovary have cure some of the afflict administration of the antagonize gland extract have help other a italian bossus in 1907 use adrenal gland curatively more recently a british student of the subject blair bell be give the direction of the treatment at long range of a number of case in indium the land of chronic pregnancy with insufficient food and consequent oversecretion of the ovary with the typical softening of the bone at he suggestion pituitary be use successfully some of the gland of internal secretion act as accelerator to the sex gland other act as retard antagonist among the most important of the latter be the thymus the thymus be the gland which dominate childhood it appear to do so by inhibit the activity of the testis or ovary castration cause a persistent growth and retard atrophy of the thymus removal of the thymus hasten the development of the gonad situate in the chest astride the windpipe it descend and cover over the upper portion of the heart overlap the great vessel at the base of the heart it be a brownish red mass which when cut present the spongy effect of a sweetbread the more intimate view of detail reveal by the higher power of the microscope show conglomeration of the white cell of the blood know as lymphocyte but scatter through the substance of the gland between these lymphocyte like the interstitial cell of the sex gland place between the sex cell be peculiarly stain cell in whorl of which there be many more in the thymus of embryonic and early postnatal life know after they discoverer as hassal 's corpuscle they be believe by some to elaborate the specific internal secretion of the thymus present in all vertebrate there seem to be more of it in the carnivora than in the herbivora like the thyroid concern the exact function of the thymus we be a good deal at sea the latest opinion about the result of extirpation even in young and grow animal be that they be nil yet there be a certain justification for proclaim the thymus the gland of childhood the gland which keep child childish and sometimes make child out of grown-up there be a quantity of datum for that proposition in the first place the curve of rise of growth of the gland seem to coincide with the period of childhood the curve of its decline with the period of adolescence and the rise of the sex gland in the past it be accept that with puberty the thymus atrophy and be replace by some sort of fatty tissue nowadays it be hold that secretion cell persist throughout life when the extent of this persistence be too great the gland be from five to ten time as large as the normal a number of other feature become prominent to make the extraordinary individual the status lymphaticus who amid the hazard of life will react in a extraordinary way he will be take up in the consideration of internal secretion personality then there be the varied and remarkable phenomenon of thymus enlargement and hyperactivity in childhood itself when a enlarged thymus be present in a infant the initiation of breathing in the new-born the introduction of the newcomer to the oxygen of the air may be a exceedingly prolonged difficult matter such a baby be say to be bear blue and the breathing may be stridorous for day become normal for a time to be follow later by spell of trouble in breathing breathlessness or breathlessness with blueness and threaten extinction sometimes these spell come out of a clear sky in a apparently healthy child that some poison probably a oversecretion of the thymus be responsible be show by the relief obtainable by x-ray shrinkage of the gland or the surgical removal of a part of it moreover the gland be influence by and influence the factor of body weight and growth with a extreme readiness and lability deficient general undernutrition lead to rapid decline in its weight back in 1858 the pioneer student of the thymus friedleben declare that the size and condition of the thymus be a index to be the state of nutrition of the body underfeed for four week will reduce it to one thirtieth the normal it seem to act as a storage and reserve organ afford some protection against the limitation of growth by lack of food material in exhausting or waste disease the weight of the gland sink much more quickly than other gland scatter instance have be report of child grow put on inch in height and expand mentally when thymus be feed to they in whom every other measure previously try have fail a french study of over four hundred idiotic child with normal thyroid report that over three fourth have no thymus at all everything point to the most direct and close relation between the gland and nutrition and growth but with nothing tangibly definite like we knowledge of the thyroid and the pituitary there be evidence that the thymus be involve in the health and efficiency of muscle cell and muscularity certain tumor of the thymus presumably destructive of the gland substance proper and thus cut off its secretion be accompany by a singular muscle weakness and atrophy of the muscle cell entirely out of proportion to the general damage suffer by the other cell of the body when affect by the poison of a malignant growth also the thymus have be discover diseased in certain mysterious progressive muscular wasting a remarkable fatigability of muscle which appear after the slightest exertion be a feature the feeding of thymus have cause muscle cramp which apparently depend upon a increase excitability of the muscle nerve ending feed of thymus to some of the lower creature of the animal kingdom will completely hold up differentiation take the unfold of the specialized tissue and organ which transform the tadpole into the frog and the chrysali into the butterfly a tadpole keep supply with enough thymus in a nutrient medium will swell into a extraordinary giant tadpole but will not change into a frog recently this experiment have be contradict yet this effect correspond to the conception of its importance in childhood as a retardant of precocity physical and mental clinical observation emphasize that in childhood it be the chief brake upon the other gland of internal secretion which would hasten development and differentiation check they perhaps for a give time and so profoundly influence growth the pineal the pineal be another gland which have be credit with similar ability and a like holding-the-reins-tight-in-childhood function among the cell like the thymus it have be suppose one of the distinctive organ of childhood and to die with it generation of anatomist solemnly assert repeat each other 's mistake with the aplomb of the historian who declare that history repeat itself that the pineal body be a useless wastefully space consume vestige of a once important structure that be the view in that century of grandly inaccurate assertion the nineteenth not that they relegate it with that statement to the limbo of the dull and the uninteresting quite the contrary they confer upon it a distinguished romance and mystery by identify it as the last heir and vestigial remnant of a third eye situate in the back of the head which may still be observe in certain reptile imagine it somewhere stick away in a cranny of the floor of you head and mine be this descendant of a organ that once sparkle and shine weep and glare take in the star and hawk and eagle and now be condemn to eternal darkness and a ineffectual sandiness today we have not discard that view of its history but we know a little more regard its composition and function what and where be the romantic object it be a cone-shaped bit of tissue hide away at the base of the brain in a tiny cave behind and above its larger colleague the pituitary microscopic scrutiny reveal that it be make up in part of nerve cell contain a pigment similar to that present in the cell of the retina thus clinch the argument for its ancient function as a eye but the outstanding and specifically glandular cell be large secrete affair which too reach back to the tidewater day of we vertebrate ancestor when eurypterus and other crustacean be engross with the fundamental problem of brain versus belly besides these there be the singular mass upon which have be fasten the unnecessarily opprobious epithet of brain sand these note and comment upon from the earliest time consist of collection of crystal of lime salt sometimes small lie about in discrete irregular mass and sometimes group into larger mulberry-like concretion vary much in size these brain sand particle have become of practical importance in the detection of pineal disease because they like all lime salt will stop the x-rays and so can be photograph for a long time indeed up to scarcely more than a few decade or so ago the pineal be believe to have no present function at all or at least no ascertainable or accessible duty in the body economy that it might perhaps be in a sense a gland of internal secretion be a despise theory then a classic case the most extraordinary and curiosity-piquing sort of case with symptom involve the pineal gland in a boy be report by the german neurologist von hochwart that boy provoke a little army of research he come to the clinic complain about he eye and other trouble which point pretty definitely to a brain tumor as the diagnosis to pigeon-hole he nothing extraordinary about he in that respect but the story tell by he parent be quite extraordinary even to the jaded palate of the clinic professor and he assistant they say that he be a little over five year old a statement conclusively prove correct at he death up to the time at which he illness begin he have be quite normal in size intelligence and interest but with the onset of he misfortune he have begin to grow and rapidly until now he look and correspond in all measurement to a normal boy of twelve or thirteen hair develop all over he skin most prominently and abundantly in the typically hairy place of adult he voice become low-pitched and most remarkable of all he sexuality and mentality precocious he become capable of true sexual life and be say to have ask many question about the fate and condition of the soul after death on one occasion he remark reflectively : it be odd how much better i feel when i let other child play with my toy than when i play with they myself other statement attribute to he imply the most astounding maturity of thought and mental process headache finally come and he die about four week later the cause of the whole bizarre tragedy be find to be a tumor of the pineal gland as have happen before in medical history no sooner be the one prodigy report than a score of other of the same ilk spring into the limelight case of precocious genital development especially some of they occur as early as the second year of life be link with they it be a interesting point to be note that in these as in those start by a overaction of the adrenal cortex it be premature masculinity that be stimulate the adrenal cortex must be class as a gland of masculinity the pineal possibly act as a brake upon the adrenal cortex very soon after the report of von hochwart 's prodigy appear a experimental research on the pineal be begin in new york the pineal gland of a number of young bullock be obtain and use for feed to see whether a overaction of the internal secretion could be produce guinea pig kitten and rabbit be use the experiment cover about two year in time of a dozen small kitten the subject outgrow the control rapidly in activity size intelligence and resistance to intercurrent disease of ten small rabbit the control weigh about a third less than the subject which be strikingly clean active fat and salacious feeding of the gland be then extend to a particular class of defective child child with well-shaped head normal eye symmetrically function limb excellent digestion strong muscle and generally normal sometimes rapid growth it be to they particularly when mental normality have progress up to the eighth tenth or twelfth year and stop that the term moron have be apply they have be a hopeless lot belong to the limbo of the incurable moreover they emphatically the physically normal one differ from one another enormously in the extent to which mental operation be possible as all transition and degree exist no definite classification and subdivision of they have be make yet ever since the cretin once look upon as a eternally damned defective be transform by thyroid feeding into a apparently normal be there have be no dearth of effort to find the right kind of internal secretion to fit they desperate situation but in vain in defective with definitely organically damage brain no result of course be to be expect in those of any class over fifteen no response have be elicit by feed pineal gland in the other the result have be contradictory a set of observation have relate the pineal to muscle function invite comparison of it with the thymus there be a singular muscle shrink and deform disease know as progressive muscular dystrophy hitherto a complete and unsolved mystery newer study of the pineal in this disease during life by means of the x-ray have show it calcify that be bury in lime salt which signify put out of business recently thus another hint as to its function have be ferret out the tadpole as a reagent to test out the growth effect of different gland of internal secretion have also be employ for the pineal ten-day-old tadpole feed on pineal present a marked translucency of the skin due to a retraction of the skin pigment cell now without a doubt a number of as yet unknown growth and metabolic effect follow exposure of the body to the complete gamut of light ray the interesting suggestion follow that the pineal influence the body by vary the degree of light ray reaction the pineal the ghost of a once important third eye at the back of we head still hark back in its function to a regulation of we susceptibility to light and its effect upon sex and brain so it become one of the significant regulator of development with a indirect hastening or retardation of puberty and maturity accord as it work in excess or too indolently it appear thus the blood brother of the adrenal cortex which also influence the skin pigment and so susceptibility of the organism to light brain growth and sex ripening it be interesting that descarte in 1628 consider the pineal the seat of the soul the parathyroid sometimes imbed within the substance of the thyroid in the neck sometimes place directly behind it upon the windpipe be four tiny gland each about the size of a wheat seed the parathyroid for long they be swamp in the nearness of they great neighbor and consider merely a variable part of it there be some who contend that even today but it have be prove that they be separate individual gland with a structure and function of they own and a definite importance to the body economy on the animal family tree they appear early contemporaneously with the thyroid in the embryo they develop from about the same site and very often they look very much alike under the microscope especially when the cell be in certain quiescent stage of secretion yet they be wholly independent in nature activity and business first experimenter upon the effect of removal of the thyroid be confuse by contradictory finding with different animal because in some they would take out the parathyroid at the same time without know it and in other they would not that possibility suggest more careful dissector accomplish the job of extirpate the thyroid while leave the parathyroid intact and vice versa in consequence some definite information about the parathyroid be available even though they internal secretion have never be isolate or its existence establish as more than a inference when the parathyroid be remove a astounding increase in the excitability of the nerve follow it be as if the animal be thoroughly poison with strychnine the slightest stimulus will make he jump or throw he into a spasm when the excitability of the nerve be measure by a electrical instrument it be find augment by from five hundred to one thousand per cent the reflex those automatic response of brain and spinal cord to certain stimulus and situation become enormously sensitive so that merely let the light into a darkened room will make the subject of the experiment go into a series of convulsion on the chemical side a explanation for these nervous phenomenon have be advance lime in the blood and cell appear to be necessary in a number of way in the making of bone and tooth in the coagulation of the blood in the keep of fluid within the blood vessel and in maintain the tone of the nerve it play a major rle now the parathyroid among all the gland of internal secretion seem to act as the prime regulator of the amount of lime hold within the blood and cell for when the parathyroid have be completely and aseptically excise without injure any other organ immediately the body begin to lose lime something have go out of it that help it to bind lime and without that essential something the internal secretion presumably of the parathyroid the lime depart as a conspicuous consequence the tooth fail to develop properly particularly as to they enamel for which lime be a essential constituent hair be lose there be a general waste the nail get brittle and the bone soften and the animal die supply lime directly particularly by direct injection into the blood will relieve the symptom in man a condition of nervous over-excitability have be describe as tetany it occur most often in the young the pregnant or in vomit after operation all sort of test have relate the malady to the phenomenon succeed parathyroid deprivation and they be now look upon as aspect of it individual have be report suffer from a insufficiency of the internal secretion of parathyroid with a sudden extreme depression nervousness and restlessness a inability to sleep or sit still and a tremulous handwriting such report round out the evidence for the importance of the parathyroid in a understanding of the factor which control growth especially as regard lime utilization for without lime properly handle no building of cell be possible also the parathyroid be necessary to a steadiness of muscle and nerve the pancreas the business of the parathyroid concern the keep of lime in the body another gland the pancreas or sweetbread this time within the abdomen a close neighbor of the solar plexus alia the abdominal brain be occupy with hold and hoard sugar in the body particularly in the liver the great sugar warehouse this matter of retain sugar and control its output be one of the utmost significance for growth and metabolism the resistance to infection the response to emergency situation and in general to the mobilization of energy for physical and mental purpose for without sugar sufficiently at hand for the cell no muscle work or nerve work the essential of the struggle for existence be possible the pancreas be a organ with both a internal and external secretion the external secretion long know evolve by the major portion of the gland be pour into the small intestine to play the star in digestion scatter here and there among the definitely glandular cell group create the external secretion be smaller collection of cell call the islet of langerhan which have be demonstrate to elaborate the internal secretion there be about a million of these island in each gland the hormone have be call insuline unlike most of the gland with a double secretion in which the internal be absolutely independent and so to speak unconscious of the external these two of the pancreas be often disturb together perhaps because trouble easily hit they both together quite the most well-known disease due to disturbed internal secretory function of the pancreas be diabetes a enormous amount of work have be spend upon the various aspect of it as a mystery hundred of papers in a dozen language upon the subject be in existence in a nutshell they have establish pretty well that diabetes be a disease in which there be a excess of sugar in the blood and urine because of a insufficient amount of the secretion of the island of langerhan in the pancreas removal of the pancreas make the body essentially the liver unable to retain sugar as well as unable to burn up sugar for energy the situation be comparable to a locomotive with its coal bin leak and the coal itself act as if make of slate or some equally uncombustible or only partially combustible material the control of sugar mobilization from the liver where it be store as glycogen or animal starch be divide between the pancreas and the adrenal the pancreas act as the brake the adrenal as the accelerator of the mechanism adrenal and pancreas be therefore direct antagonist the pan of the scale which represent sugar equilibrium in the organism diabetes may be regard as a disturbance of the adrenal-pancreas balance assist by event which produce adrenal overwork like great or prolonged emotion or by strain of the pancreas effect by over-eat for example there be other minor gland of internal secretion but those consider be by far the most important and the most recently explore in a summary one would classify they as follow : _ name secretion function _ 1 thyroid thyroxin gland of energy production controller of growth of specialize organ and tissue -- brain and sex 2 pituitary -- gland of energy consumption and utilization -- continue effort anterior unknown growth of skeleton and support tissue posterior pituitrin nerve cell and involuntary muscle cell brain and sex tone 3 adrenal the gland of combat cortex unknown a brain growth -- tone development of sex gland medullum adrenalin b energy for emergency situation 4 pineal unknown a brain and sex development b adolescence and puberty c light and maturity 5 thymus unknown gland of childhood 6 interstitial testis in male gland of secondary gland of ovary in female sex trait 7 parathyroid unknown a controller of lime metabolism b excitability of muscle and nerve 8 pancreas insuline controller of sugar metabolism chapter iv the gland as a interlock directorate now in consider each gland of internal secretion as a separate entity and label it with certain property and action we of course commit the usual sin of the intellect : the sin of abstraction and isolation of its material this crime of analysis the intellect commit every day in the search for truth before its dissection it seem to have to dip the elusive article in a fixative and bottle it in a vacuum yet nothing in reality be more of a change flux than the body in all of its part and tissue and organ and of all these the gland of internal secretion stand out as the most susceptible to change make to react to stimulus of offense and defense instantaneously responsive to situation involve energy exchange and protective reflex they be never for any minute the same or alone they never function separately each influence the other in a communicate chain let one be disturb and all the other will feel the impact of the disturbance and vibrate with it any break in the somatic or psychic equilibrium a blow or a infection or a startling thing see or a worrisome thought feel will start a process go this will only wind up when every gland have be somehow touch and a final equilibrium reestablish the thyroid maybe be first excited and then in turn the adrenal with a boomerang reinforce effect upon the thyroid and at the same time a stimulating effect upon the pituitary each gland be thus influence and influence agent and reagent in the complex adjustment of the organism endocrine co-operation the body-mind be a perfect corporation not quite perfect for continually there arise little insurgency inadequacy and friction to which in time it will succumb yet in the efficiency of its co-operation and in the co-ordination of the need and supplies of producer middle man and consumer there be no one of the great organization of the captain of industry which can for a moment approach it of this corporation the gland of internal secretion be the director but the huge corporation not to topple over with its own unwieldy size must be compose of smaller unit each within itself a corporation and govern by a directorate there be in the corporation-organism different department and bureau subdivision of function which constitute the smaller corporation within the larger corporation these subsidiary company have they own gland of internal secretion as they director thus the growth of the brain be preside over by the adrenal cortex the thyroid the thymus and the pituitary they determine the size of the brain the number of its cell the complexity of its convolution and the speed of its chemistry which mean the speed of thought and memory and imagination as its directorate therefore they may be entitle the disturbance of one of they mean the disturbance of all of they and a consequent deleterious effect upon the brain now take the burn up of sugar in the organism the great material source of energy which be control by the pancreas the adrenal and the liver the thyroid and the pituitary together they form the directorate of sugar metabolism but as be evident from a glance at the membership of the growth directorate and compare it with the directorate of sugar metabolism there be some member who be present on both board a infection a illness a ailment a exaltation or intoxication of such member will produce reverberation in both directorate a disturbance of sugar metabolism might then cause a disturbance of growth the advantage and disadvantage be before we of have in the gland of internal secretion a interlock directorate ruler over all the varied and manifold activity of the organism behind the body and behind the mind be this board of governor indeed from the administrative and legislative point of view the body-mind may be say to be govern by the house of gland it be the invisible committee behind the throne upon the throne be what man the most baffling of complexity man who be not a mind but own a mind -- man who be not a body but possess a body just as he might have a motor car a fortune or a calamity back of all he daily activity behind the life of body-mind be the mysterious unique individuality the ego the psyche or the soul lately a competitor with these ancient and honorable term have come upon the scene as the subconscious in that darken no man 's land be determine a man 's destiny the endocrine association stand out as at least the most important physical determinant of the state and process of the subconscious antagonism and co-operation as within a corporation there be faction and clique influence that always work together and force that be always pull in opposite direction so within the interlock directorate of the ductless gland there be antagonism and inhibition co-operation and compensation one gland will assist the action of another 's secretion with its own or will in turn be stimulate to secrete by it another will throw out its secretion in order to neutralize the effect produce or its own activity will be depress or completely inhibit by it thus the pituitary arouse the interstitial gland and vice versa whereas the pancreas and the thyroid be mutually inhibitory indeed whole system of gland may work in unison or be pit against each other in certain situation especially when the organism be subject to conflict impulse with the clash of oppose instinct like fear and anger in general there be reciprocity and team work among the internal secretion a certain minimum amount of each must be present if life be to continue along the normal line whether there be to be a excess of any one secretion above this minimum or a deficiency below it decide the fate of the individual if there be deficiency of one the other member of the directorate attempt to make up for what have be lose and to carry on its work by a extra effort to substitute or release from the discipline of the deficient member or the necessity for antagonize it they may be release from its stimulus to secrete and produce less of they own specific secretion a general reaction all along the line will accompany overaction oversecretion of one gland due to consequent stimulation and depression of other gland some may be excite by the event to overwork -- some to assist -- other to act as antidote for -- the excess secretion while still other relieved of a burden do not have to supply as much of they quota under the circumstance and so shut down or limit they output it be important to get clearly in mind these subtle inter-reaction of the different ductless gland they may be antagonistic in they end effect because of the opposed function of the nerve or organ stimulate there be inhibition and restraint produce when a gland will send out its secretion to stop another gland secrete there be compensation result when because of insufficiency of a gland other will endeavor by manufacture more of they own secretion to compensate for the loss there be mutual co-operation partnership when a gland will oversecrete to assist another or in response to another which be also oversecret there be loss of balance so that when one gland cease secrete another will simultaneously or soon after normal secretion oversecretion or undersecretion be thus adjust but leave a train of after effect so with loss or insufficiency of the thyroid there may be pituitary overgrowth because the pituitary may act as vicar for the thyroid the thyroid and thymus be antagonistic for the thyroid hasten differentiation puberty and the come of sexual maturity while the thymus delay and retard they and prolong the period of childhood the thyroid and the pancreas be antagonist for when the thyroid have be excise the pancreas appear no longer necessary to act as a break upon the mechanism of sugar liberation into the blood from the liver the thyroid stimulate the interstitial gland for menstruation and pregnancy be impossible with no thyroid or a insufficient thyroid removal of the pituitary make the thymus shrink because the restrain influence of the latter be no longer need but there be a enlargement of the thyroid to compensate in castrate there be a increase in the size and number of the cell of the anterior pituitary again a compensation or substitution effect the pituitary and the adrenal cortex be mutually assistant alike in they influence upon the tone of the brain and sex cell the kinetic system so there be combination of gland to assist or restrain other or to control a body function or to determine the domination or abeyance of a instinct one such have be name the kinetic system because it come into play in situation which demand prompt adaptation without hesitancy and a consequent immediate transformation of static or store energy into kinetic or active energy accord to this conception the brain the adrenal the liver the thyroid and the muscle together constitute a machine very much like a automobile the self-starter of the machine be the brain with storage battery -lrb- compose of store past memory -rrb- and ignition combine the thing see without or the idea feel within act as the initial spark while the adrenal as the carburetor permit the freer flow of fuel sugar from the liver the thyroid work as the accelerator the original impulse finally landing upon muscle key up and supply with food to meet the situation be it that of remove a poison remove a aggressor -lrb- attack -rrb- or remove the individual himself -lrb- run away -rrb- when one be exhaust by exertion and emotion injury intoxication or infection it be these member of the kinetic system the brain the adrenal thyroid and liver which be exhaust exhaustion diminish when the activity of the brain be diminish by anesthetic and cure when it be abolish by sleep if the adrenal gland may be call the gland of emergency energy the kinetic system be entitle to the name of council of emergency defense for the organism the kinetic drive be the name that have be give to the whole system at work it be one of the best example we have of inter-glandular co-operation and reaction in reply to the threat of danger or the hint of pleasure the check and drive system another instance of the complexity of these inter-glandular reaction be furnish by the thyroid and the adrenal the thyroid and the adrenal be mutually stimulate -- when the thyroid oversecrete the adrenal ditto and vice versa yet they have directly opposed effect upon the economy -- because they act upon antagonistic portion of the involuntary or vegetative nervous system the system which be independent of the will before proceed further it be worth while sketch this division of the nervous system in the construction of a motor car from the point of view of absolute control of it at every moment the first thought of the mechanic be a adequate _ brake _ and a efficient _ regulator _ of speed instrument antagonistic but necessary to work simultaneously or alternately the involuntary or vegetative nervous system be build upon the same principle it supply every organ in the body beyond the control of the will -lrb- that be to say the brain -rrb- with two set of filament which have oppose function one group of filament in general increase or activate the function of the organ to which it be distribute the other group of filament when tingle inhibit or prohibit that function they be like the two button on the wall which regulate the supply of electricity to incandescent bulb one switching on the current the other switching it off it have be agree to call the stimulative or activate portion the autonomic or drive system to its antagonist have be leave the older name of the sympathetic or check system it be because they do not both act upon these two component of the vegetative nervous system but only upon one that the thyroid and adrenal though in themselves complementary come to exert opposite effect for the internal secretion of the thyroid have a selective affinity for the autonomic or activate system while that of the adrenal have a selective affinity for the sympathetic or inhibit system in the stomach for instance extract of the adrenal gland have be prove to intensify the function of the sympathetic or check system in different degree so that there be a lessen of the amount and acidity of the gastric fluid on the other hand thyroid extract will intensify the action of the autonomic or drive system so that the amount and acidity of the digestive juice be increase the stomach cell may therefore be regard as a test-reagent for the different internal secretion as they affect the check and drive system these constitute a automatic device for regulate the activity of every organ three factor enter into the mechanism one be the amount of the circulate internal secretion another be the organic and functional integrity of the nerve filament comprise the check and drive system the third consist of the number and vitality and limitation of the terminal receiving cell act upon by the nerve filament which in they turn have be act upon by the internal secretion upon every organ include the mind through the brain a stimulus from without or within will act accord to its ability to influence one or other of these factor normally the check and drive system be properly balanced but under stress and strain the balance be upset indeed the kinetic drive may be define as a mechanism contrived in the course of evolution as the normal healthy mode for meeting stress and strain the kinetic chain of organ brain adrenal liver thyroid and muscle begin work together in desperate situation for they possessor age ago successful in help he to survive they have survive as a functional unit it be probably evolve in the post-tertiary era about twenty million year ago when the come of the carnivore introduce direct body-to-body conflict and they concomitant a quick and versatile nervous system during the tertiary epoch the earth bask in the heat of a tropical sun nearly everywhere on its surface the luxuriant vegetation of the torrid zone flourish and swarm for the temperature all over be what it be today at the equator gigantic vegetarian be the animal creature like the dinosaur enormous gargoylean monster of a incredible size and strength but clumsy and grotesque with small brain and little intelligence for what need be there for brain and intelligence when food lay about so abundantly at hand for they to gorge themselves as there be no competition for food there be no enemy then as the earth evolve and grow cooler vegetation fail the ancestor of the present carnivora appear the father of the wolf and tiger light lithe and pugnacious with sens acute and ferocious weapon of attack who set out to destroy everybody they destroy pretty nearly all of the huge leaf-eating species and only the more plastic and smaller one who be more keen-sensed and swift-footed -lrb- of whom the deer and antelope horse and ox be the descendant -rrb- escape the smallest either take to the air to become the bat or like the forerunner of the squirrel and ape take to the tree it be the come of the carnivore therefore that accelerate the development of brain matter and start the process which create man but in the million and million of year of conflict instinct grow into be that sink deep into bone and marrow the most fundamental reflex those immediate response to irritation or danger be lay down and among they the drive and check system when the animal have decide to fight its enemy or be force to fight or determine to prey then be the time for the drive system to do its utmost to speed up everything that would help in the fight while the check system come into play to hinder whatever would interfere or burden in the fray first the drive mechanism must have be hit upon and then the value of the check device must have be find in fear and flight and especially in hiding and simulation of death when even breathe have to be inhibit until finally there develop for everyday use a complete check and drive nerve machinery for every organ to be use accord to the exigency of the moment with the thyroid as the primary stimulant and controller of the drive system and the adrenal as the primary dictator over the check system the harmony of the hormone all the gland in fact work in unison with a distribution of the balance of power that diplomatist might envy in the co-ordinate synchronism the vegetative nervous system play the part of a agent that act as well as be act upon the chemical interaction of the internal secretion be not the only way in which they influence each other for as the case of the thyroid and the adrenal so well show secretion which when directly interact be mutually reinforce when affect nerve may become clash opponent the kinetic chain be about as good a case as there be of the gland of internal secretion co-operate the check and drive system with the adrenal and thyroid oppose be one of the best instance of they antagonism besides there be a number of other relationship between they that might be cite they all bear with more or less pressure positive or negative upon the sex gland which will be consider in its place if one wish to consider all the gland in they pro and anti relation a separate volume would be require the vegetative apparatus the combination of the internal secretion and the vegetative system have be speak of as the vegetative or autonomic apparatus the vegetative apparatus be the oldest part of the nervous system and some acquaintance with its constitution be necessary to any understanding of the possibility of control of human nature for modern thought do not regard the brain as the organ of mind at all but as one unit of a complex synthesis of which mind be the product and the vegetative apparatus be the major component that involve the blasting of the last current superstition of the traditional psychology the dogma that the brain be the exclusive seat of mind that a animal be a vast concourse of cell be one of the accept fundamental of biology what be not so generally take into consideration be that the assemblage be form by the agglutination of million of year and that it be hence compose of part of different age and pedigree some exceedingly ancient and hoary some middle-aged and some relatively new and recent in the invertebrate who date further back in the history of the planet than any vertebrate the nervous system consist of discrete patch of nerve cell the ganglion compose the ganglionic system of which the vegetative or autonomic nervous system of man be the direct descendant and representative the brain and central nervous system be definitely later acquisition impose upon the original stratum of the check and drive machine the primitive chassis of the mechanism so to speak be the so-called vegetative nervous system group with that system be the primeval breathing feeding and reproduce invention the viscera box up in the chest and abdomen the third partner be the gland of internal secretion which act upon the viscera both directly and indirectly through the check and drive effect upon the vegetative nerve the gland be like tuning key by which certain string in the instrument may be tighten so that its vibratory activity be increase or they may be loosen the vibration decrease the activity lessen tuning up the motor be a constant process in the organism finally there be the large nerve mass at the base of the brain know as the basal ganglion which contain the nerve center for the co-ordination of the other three all these together constitute the oldest family of the corporate organism beside they the brain and the face and the prehensile organ be mere parvenu the oldest part of the mind grant then that this vegetative apparatus be the most deeply rooted core of we be what warrant be there for the grandiloquence of the phrase : the oldest part of the mind there be indeed room for rhetoric even poetry here for all the evidence point to it as the rightful occupant of the throne upon which shelley place he brownie as the soul of the soul or to put it in another way we think and feel primarily with the vegetative apparatus with we muscle especially the involuntary with we viscera and particularly with we internal secretion whenever there be think and feeling there be movement commotion precedent and concomitant among these they be the oldest seat of feeling thought and will and continue to function as such just what evidence be there for this conception in the first place there be the fascinating story of the origin of vertebrate from invertebrate of the sea scorpion or spider type then there be a whole group of datum which demonstrate that the primitive wish which make up the content of a baby consciousness be determine settle by state of relaxation or tension in different segment or area of the vegetative apparatus accord to this the brain enter as only one of the character in the play of consciousness it be just the organ of awareness by the organism of itself as a integer which must adjust itself to the specific condition within the disturbed vegetative apparatus consequently the brain emerge not as the master tissue but as merely the servant of the vegetative apparatus consciousness be a circuit swing around in it be the wish-feeling generate by the vegetative dynamo from each viscus from the stomach and intestine from the kidney and bladder from the liver and spleen from the blood-vessel from all the gland of external and internal secretion there flow along the vegetative nerve to and from the brain energy of various quality and intensity all the member of the vegetative apparatus be more or less active and so all we wish be all more or less active all we work hour we be aware of hunger satiety or indifference of a desire to empty the intestine or bladder or of a lack of necessity of do so of a state of tranquillity of the blood-vessel and sweat gland or of a perturbation of they of a vary tensity of even the muscle that be as we say under the control of the will of the state in fact of all the element of the vegetative complex the stream of feeling which constitute the undertow of consciousness originate outside of the brain altogether and be compose of current arise from viscera muscle blood-vessel and gland now the component current be of different size and position and variable degree of warmth that be another way of say that whether or not a current be to become the center of the stream or to approach it or whether it be to be hot cold or tepid depend upon the degree of activity of the various part of the vegetative apparatus a convenient name for this be _ tonus _ tonus can be experimentally watch and measure thus hunger the most primitive of the wish-feeling have be find to be simultaneous with certain characteristic contraction of the stomach stop those contraction and you stop the hunger the contraction begin slowly and weakly and no awareness of they occur in the mind as they grow stronger consciousness become a sensation rather like a itch somewhere in the upper abdomen and accompany sometimes by a sense of general weakness the vegetative activity go on as a current almost on the outside of the stream of feeling have swell and warm and so forced itself in a manner of speak into the center of the stream or if you will the rest of the stream have to arrange itself around it as the center a similar mechanism for the tonus of the other member of the vegetative system and how they determine consciousness and behavior be understandable it have be show that when the bladder tone and the intestinal tone be of a definitely measurable size one have the desire to empty they the same apply to the sex gland the pressure within a viscus be dependent upon the ratio between the amount of contraction of the involuntary muscle in its wall the external pressure and the quantity of its distend contents the internal pressure the resultant quotient the internal pressure divide by the external pressure measure the intravisceral pressure the primitive wish-feeling be the direct expression of the various intravisceral pressure or tone the primitive soul be a awareness of the fuse primitive wish-feeling of themselves as a whole and of the struggle between they for recognition isolation and as we say satisfaction this satisfaction consist in a degradation of the highest intravisceral pressure to a point at which some other intravisceral pressure become higher and therefore predominant physics of the wish mind consciousness may then be portray as a ocean comprise of mobile current layer complex build up around the awareness of different intravisceral pressure a shift hierarchy of such pressure form the point of focus of consciousness that result in conduct behavior may be define as the resultant of the organism 's pressure against the environment 's counter pressure until there be a sufficient reduction of the specifically exciting intravisceral pressure just as water flow to its own level so will conduct flow to reduce intravisceral pressure to its own level a physics of the soul come into prospect in which a mathematical analysis will state the process quantitatively in term of some common unit of pressure not only conduct but also character because it be past conduct repeat associate and fix will be so statable for intravisceral tonus or pressure be not simply or only a acute or pass affair there be for it a persistent or average figure the so-called normal for it below which or above which the acute situation will bring it _ character _ be a _ matter then of standard in the vegetative system _ character indeed be a alloy of the different standard intravisceral pressure of the organism a fusion create by the resistance or counter pressure of the obstacle in the environment character in short be the grand intravisceral barometer of a personality thus the comfortable healthy happy well-balanced progressive constructive virile personality be one in whom there be a continuously harmonious reduction of the intravisceral pressure in the environment call society for in a gregarious creature like man fellow being be the most powerful determinant of negative and positive vegetative pressure not so well round be other type exist because of inferiority or excess of the standard visceral tone there be for instance the sexually cold type comfortable by create for itself a anaphrodisiac environment compose of pressure that can be fit into its own or there may be a insufficiency of standard pressure in the alimentary tract and we have the ascetic mal-nourished strive uplifting type different type will be make by the permutation and combination of factor that determine the intravisceral pressure and the environmental ie social resistance or counter pressure internal secretion determinant of vegetative pressure now of all the different factor which determine the tone that be to say the internal pressure of the various part of the vegetative apparatus -lrb- include all structure not control by the will in the term -rrb- the internal secretion or hormone be by far the most important this significance be confer upon they because it be by they activity primarily that these pressure be produce regulated lowered and heighten in short control we have see how the thyroid and adrenal hold the rein of the drive or check system in the vegetative apparatus together with the other ductless gland they decide the advance or halt forward or retreat tension or relaxation charge and discharge of the visceral -- involuntary muscle -- blood vessel combination which be at the core of life here again they emerge as the directorate carlson the chicago physiologist who probably know more about be hungry than any other man on the planet once demonstrate that the injection of a ounce or two of the blood which mean the internal secretion mixture of a starve animal into one not starve increase the sign of hunger and the accompany hunger contraction of the stomach there can be no doubt that hunger be the expression of a certain specific concentration of internal secretion or secretion in the blood when the quantity in the cycle of metabolism become sufficiently great it stimulate the stomach to contract in a way which augment the pressure within it to a point at which the feeling of hungriness and the wish to satisfy it or to get rid of it become imperative and the dominant of consciousness without doubt the sexual craving be likewise so determine sex libido be a expression of a certain concentration a definite amount peculiar to the individual of the substance manufacture by the interstitial cell circulate in the blood it arouse its effect probably by -lrb- 1 -rrb- increase the amount of reproductive material in the sex gland in a direct chemically stimulating effect upon the germinative cell and so raise the internal pressure within they -lrb- 2 -rrb- stimulate the involuntary muscle within the wall and the canal of the sex gland and so by augment the tenseness of the muscle elevate the total intravisceral pressure -lrb- 3 -rrb- by a direct chemical and indirect nervous effect upon the brain the muscle the heart as well as the other gland of internal secretion stimulate the organism as a whole though the isolation in pure form of the substance or substance involve have never be scientifically achieve they inference be entirely justified it be indeed the only comprehensible mechanism conceivable that will fit all the known fact about the matter and even though the assertion of brown-squard be only the exaggeration of a semi-charlatan it be certain that some day in the near future the particular substance that he claim he have discover will be hand about in bottle for the inspection of the curious besides thyroxin adrenalin and the libido-producing secretion of the interstitial cell the substance produce by the paired glandlet situate behind the thyroid the parathyroid have a profound influence upon the vegetative apparatus and the vegetative nervous system these direct the lime exchange within the cell of the organism include the nerve cell it have be show that lime be relatively a sedative to cell it raise the threshold or strength of stimulus necessary to evoke a reaction remove the parathyroid mean remove the lime barrier for with they deficiency there be a change in and then a escape from the blood of the lime by way of the kidney the result be sometimes a enormous increase in the excitability of all the cell and especially of the vegetative apparatus what that mean for the individual whose comfort depend upon a stability of the intravisceral tone and pressure may be readily imagine the pancreas likewise act as a sedative to the vegetative apparatus in particular this apply to the sugar mechanism in the liver under the discipline of the check and drive organization the adrenal and the pancreas be the direct antagonist in the struggle for control of sugar removal of the adrenal will cause a decrease in the amount of sugar in the blood while removal of the pancreas will produce a increase excess of sugar in the blood may thus be concomitant with change of character consider incorrigible in different locale of the vegetative apparatus as indeed of the body in general the directorate seem to be hand over to a committee of control generally make up of two member work in oppose direction such a division of power in the general directorate be analogous to the small hold corporation which divide function in for example the united state steel corporation the relative ratio of tonus in these smaller internal secretion balance be of the utmost significance as cause of difference in the vegetative apparatus which be the basis of difference in structure power and character between individual the general law of the directorate we knowledge of the gland of internal secretion as a interlock directorate preside over all the function of the organism be still exceedingly meager as yet we seem to be knock at the portal of the chemistry of the imponderable there be hole in the bronze door and we glimpse the unfathomable distance of unexplored region but we do see something and we do glimpse a beginning already the outline of a differential anatomy and a different physiology and a differential psychology which will explain to we the unique in the constitution the temperament and character of a individual emerge it be worth while before proceed to the detail so valuable to a society which would become rational to summarize the general principle emerge express the direct power of the ductless gland over the individual _ they may be regard as the present postulate of a new science of the why and wherefore separate and set apart as so recognizably distinct those peregrinate chemical mixture : man and woman _ 1 the life of every individual in every stage be dominate largely by he gland of internal secretion that be they as a complex internal messenger and director system control organ and function conduct and character the orderliness of human life in the sequential march of its episode crisis success and failure depend to a large extent upon they interaction with each other and with the environment 2 one or several of the gland possess a control or superior influence above that of the other in the physiology of the individual and so become the central gland of he life its dominant indeed so far as it cast a decide vote or veto in its everyday existence and incident as well as in its high point the climax and emergency 3 these glandular preponderance be at the basis of personality create genius and dullard weakling and giant cavalier and puritan all human trait may be analyze in term of they because they be expression of they 4 specific type of personality may be directly associate with particular glandular prominence so that we have the thyroid-centered type the pituitary-centered type the adrenal-centered type etc these be the classic three the prototype in they purity most easily describe and recognize 5 combination of these as well as of other gland -- with joint predominance -- occur and indeed form the majority of population the phenomenon of variety in species be thus explain 6 internal secretion trait be inherit and variation in heredity be essentially the structural representation of the resultant of a parallelogram of force exert by each of the parental prepotent gland if they be of the same type they may reinforce each other : if not inhibition and compensation will come into play mendelian law may apply 7 the process of evolution as the play of natural selection upon these variation become comprehensible from a new standpoint 8 certain disease and disease tendency both acute and constitutional as well as trait of temperament and character and predetermined reaction to certain recur situation in life be root in the glandular soil that compose the stuff of the individual 9 the subconscious of which the vegetative apparatus be the physical basis lead back to the internal secretion for the profoundest spring of its secret we shall see how and why 10 give the internal secretory composition so to speak of a individual -- he endocrine formulum -- and so he intravisceral pressure one may predict within limit he physical and psychic make-up the general line of he life disease taste idiosyncrasy and habit 11 within limit if the previous history of a individual be know he physical appearance may be approximately describe and he future outline 12 conversely give the physical and psychic composition of a individual and he past history one may deduce the internal secretion type to which he belong example : a one thyroid-centered type have bright eye good clean tooth symmetrical feature moist flush skin temperamental attitude toward life tendency to heart intestinal and nervous disease b one pituitary-centered type abnormally large or small size musical -- acute sense of rhythm asymmetrical feature tendency to cyclic or periodic disease c one adrenal-centered type hairy dark masculinity marked tendency to diphtheria and hernia these be some of the master type they have they variant depend upon the influence of the other gland especially the interstitial cell of the sex gland ante-natal development in they ensemble the gland of internal secretion wield a determine influence upon the development of the individual from he very inception if he various power may be conceive of as a orchestra they may be say to conduct it from the very beginning of its movement and to cease only with its termination from the moment when the spermatozoon penetrate and fecundate the ovum the fate of the future be be settle by they disposition the seal of he destiny be soak with they substance post-natal development every particle of protoplasm every granule of the impregnate ovum carry the representative of the parental ductless gland as a consequence they transmit chemically with no figure of speech involve the peculiar familial racial and national character from progenitor to offspring they confer upon the child a number of the property commonly recognize as inherit all those feature which distinguish caucasian from mongolian scandinavian from italian italian from jew be determine by they in short at every step of he life in every relation and association in every expression of the inner force that control he be the normal individual be influence by he internal secretion let we now see how chapter v how the gland influence the normal body the origin of the remarkable difference between individual that distinguish species variety and family have long be one of the chief puzzle of biology it may indeed be call the lead puzzle which lead darwin on to the collection of the datum that culminate in the origin of species the why of the unique be the fundamental problem of those who would understand life a explanation be a attempt at a consistent and persistent sometimes a obstinate clarity of mind a vast number of observation gather by laboratory experimentalist as well as by those naturalist of the abnormal physician in active practice prove that the construction of the individual both during development before maturity and maintenance during maturity he constitution in short be direct by the endocrine gland it be possible now to present a explanation of the individuality of the individual to assert that variation be responsible for the individual that it be the mechanism which isolate he as a be like none other of he fellow not even he parent brother and sister be merely to beg the question what be variation the internal secretion theory of the process offer for the first time a explanation that be coherent and comprehensive base upon concrete and detailed observation it provide a adequate interpretation of the numberless hereditary gradation and transition blending and mixture it suggest a control of heredity in the future the pure type in the pure type only one gland either by be present in great excess above the average or by be pretty well below the average come to exercise the dominate influence upon the trait of the organism as the strongest link in the chain or as the weakest it rule the other must accommodate themselves to it among they as commander of growth development and normal function it hold the balance of power in every emergency it stand out by its strength or by its weakness it thus create its own type of man or woman with attribute and characteristic peculiar to itself these pure type as we have see be mainly the thyroid the pituitary and the adrenal-centered each with the sign peculiar to it can be identify among the face that pass one in the street and they differ so markedly among themselves that they provide a new and accurate means of classify variety among the race of the species : man the thyroid type differ as much from the adrenal type as do a greyhound from a bull-dog the greyhound have a certain size form character and capacity the bull-dog have similar quality which be yet quite different each be build for a particular career among human being the pure thyroid type be easily distinguish from the pure adrenal type and both of these from the pure pituitary type each be stamp with a significant figure height skin hair temperament ambition social reaction and predisposition to certain disease the mixed type among the mixed type the line of distinction be less clear and so they be more difficult to classify the mixed type may be say to be hyphenate in they two or even three of the internal secretory gland conflict for predominance the combined action make for a resultant modification in the primary glandular marking and effect a hyphenated classification thus become inevitable especially be this so if the two gland be mutually antagonistic and inhibitory a compromise effect be then necessitate or a individual may be dominate by one gland at one period of he life and by another at a later period one of the gland the thyroid for example will show by the trace it have leave upon the earliest develop feature that it be in control at the very earliest date of he history while other sign will disclose the more recent influence of the adrenal or of the pituitary the combination become classifiable as the thyroid-pituitary type or as the thyroid-adrenal type that the external feature as well as the chronic disease of human being be control by some common factor have long be suspect inquiry into morbid phenomenon with a hereditary trend yield information that have pave the way for the internal secretion theory it have long be know that certain disease effect only certain individual of a definite constitution apoplexy diabetes arteriosclerosis bright 's disease be meet with almost exclusively in what the older clinician talk about as the apopleptic type on the other hand they say anemia tuberculosis hemophilia scrofula occur more among the lymphatic type but they have no idea whatever of the true functional basis of the two different type the truth as we of today view it be that these two type represent different texture of human being fabricate of different internal secretion they be really two different breed of the species homo sapiens the material be different the color and feel of they be different and the resistance to wear and tear be different endocrine analysis the mode of classification glimpse at be certainly exceedingly broad and sweeping it be well enough to establish type and class but beneath they be sheltered the infinite possibility of permutation and combination which explain the countless variety and complexity of form and function every individual bear among the vertebrate for example must have a certain definite amount and percentage of pituitary gland anterior and posterior pineal thyroid parathyroid thymus adrenal pancreas interstitial and so on now if to state it in term of percentage for the sake of argument the pituitary be 25 the pineal 10 the thyroid 36 the parathyroid 15 the thymus 29 the adrenal 60 the pancreas 49 the interstitial 72 -lrb- the gland when act maximally to be grade as 100 -rrb- we see at once how different such a individual must be from one who have say pituitary 84 pineal 39 thyroid 26 parathyroid 42 adrenal 96 pancreas 22 and interstitial 89 one obtain at once from the contrast of such figure some idea of the possibility as each point plus or minus must count to produce some difference in the individual the result be manifest vary within the numerical limit impose by genus species variety and family -lrb- which limit be probably responsible for the persistence of the particular genus species variety or family -rrb- the individual become a individual because of the relative value of the percentage in he blood and tissue of these different internal secretion we thus begin to gain a insight into the pattern accord to which man woman and animal be weave we be as yet far from a exact endocrine analysis of the individual but we know that the endocrine rule over growth and nutrition a vast dominion which incorporate every organ and every tissue by enhance or retard the nutritional change the growth of the organ or tissue be favor or restrict the size and shape of a individual as a whole as well as of the specialize cell mass compose he as hand and foot the nose and ear and so on be therefore control by they whether a organism be to be tall or short lean or corpulent graceful or awkward be decide by they interaction these like human covenant vary with the different reaction of the party to the contract and so a great deal depend upon whether they work harmoniously or discordantly and upon which do the most work and which the least undersecretion and oversecretion it be when a gland either in the course of development or because of the influence of starvation shock injury poisoning or infection begin to undersecrete or oversecrete that its effect upon growth and nutrition become grossly manifest a veritable transfiguration of the individual may occur the black magic of which may perplex he for a lifetime a man make eunuchoid by a accident or by mumps will observe in himself astonishing change in he constitutional make-up mentality and sexuality he would be more astounded to learn that beneath the appearance the change so alarming he there be profound alteration in the rate at which he be take in oxygen burn up sugar accumulate carbon dioxide and excrete waste byproduct through the kidney which be responsible for they the difference between the normal and abnormal be only a matter of degree and so to be sure be difference between type but it be hard to realize that the striking distinction between the thyroid type and the pituitary comparable as say to the difference between a greyhound and a bull-dog be dependent solely upon quantitative variation in the general and local speed of metabolism among the cell division of labor besides the antagonism and co-operation between they there be certain line along which the gland in they effect specialize the thyroid for instance be concerned specially with the regulation of the shape form and finish of a organ the pituitary shine at the period of developmental crisis determine they and modify they it exert the greatest influence upon the time of eruption of the tooth both the temporary and the permanent the onset of puberty the recurrence of menstruation in woman and the time of occurrence of labor the interstitial gland distribute the basis of the power and limitation of masculinity and femininity abnormality of these gland also affect the individual all along the line in all of he aspect so affect he may apparently change into a wholly different be he may change in size in the shape of he head foot and hand as well as in he habit aptitude and disposition so he may find it necessary to purchase a entirely different size of hat more commodious clothes and newly fitting glove and shoe at the same time he family relative and friend discover that the erstwhile generous frank neat and punctual and like have become stingy and suspicious and slovenly and hate and all because a gland have begin to undersecrete or to oversecrete the transformation will be slight or marked depend entirely upon the extent of impairment positive or negative of the gland involve but it be not only in the shaping of the normal individual 's architecture that the internal secretion dominate over that subtle something know in all language as vitality expressive of the intensity of feeling thought and reaction in cell they rule supreme gay vivacity and grim determination the temperament of a loui xiv and the soul of a cromwell be the crystallization of these chemical substance act upon the brain internal secretion variety there be no better way of illustrate the influence of the internal secretion upon the normal than the analysis of the variation of trait with variation in glandular predominance the general build of a individual he skeletal type the proportion between the size of he arm and that of he leg as well as that between he trunk and he lower extremity whether he be to be tall lanky and loutish or short squat and dumpy be to be consider different facial type be the expression of underlie endocrine difference the head and skull offer a number of clue to the control secretion in the blood and tissue whether the forehead be to be broad or narrow the distance between the eye the character of the eyebrow the shape and size and appearance of the eye themselves the mould of the nose and jaw and the peculiarity of the tooth be all so determine the skin in its color texture the quantity and distribution of its fatty and other constituent eruption and weather reaction be influence also the mucous membrane the color and lustre and structure of the hair as well as its general distribution and development be hieroglyphic of the endocrine process below the surface whether the muscle be massive or sparse atrophied or hypertrophied soft or hard easily fatigable or not bespeak condition in the glandular chain in short we must regard the individual as a immensely complicated pattern of design trace by the hormone as the primary etcher of he development though it must be admit that the number of unknown and unsolved relation in the pattern be still enormously great enough have be establish to make possible a rough working analysis of the particular unique organism place before we for examination as mr smith mr jone or miss smith-jone what be the normal anthropologist from the beginning of anthropology have battle in vain for a satisfactory inclusive definition or at least description of the normal with the introduction of the biometric method the goal at last appear within sight a cocked hat curve express the distribution and range of the normal look formidable the attainable turn out a mirage for the curve constructable by the measurement of trait of a population only prove the truth of the old axiom that all transition and variation between extreme exist the problem of the normal seem more elusive than ever and the best that could be do for the elucidation of its mystery be to apply and observe the law of average from the endocrine standpoint the reason for this become clear the biometric method concern itself with externals with as it be symptom since these external sign be but manifestation of the inner chemical reaction of which the internal secretion be the determine reagent or factor with permutation and combination possible in all direction the diversity and variability of each individual and he trait stand explain and understandable the normal as the perfect or nearly perfect balance of force in the organism at any given moment emerge as a more definite and real concept than that which would abstract it from a curve of variation moreover since the directive force within the organism be pre-eminently the internal secretion the normal become definable as they harmonious balancing or equilibrium a state which tend not to undo -lrb- as the abnormal do -rrb- but to prolong itself the potential combination and compensation antagonism and counteraction attainable within the endocrine gland as a interlock directorate point the cause for the elusive quality of the normal tall man and short man blonde woman and dumpy woman lanky hatchet-faced people stout moon-faced people falstaff and queen elizabeth george washington and abraham lincoln disraelus and walt whitman caesar and alexander as well as mr smith and miss jone come within the range of the normal there be all kind and condition and sort of man and woman and all kind and sort and condition of the normal because a incalculable number of harmonious relation and interaction between the endocrine be possible and do actually occur the standard of the normal must obviously not be a single standard but a series of standard depend upon which gland predominate and how the other adapt themselves to its predominance adrenal-centered type thyroid-centered type pituitary-centered type thymus-centered type as well as hyphenated compound of these such as the pituitary-adrenal type exist as normal they can be conceive of as normal type because they exist as normal type the skeletal type now man for as long as we have any knowledge of they thought and classification and attitude have be accustom to first think of one another to classify and size one another as tall or short slender or broad thin or corpulent the biological necessity indeed instinct of the one animal to relate the other animal to aggressive or harmless agency in he surroundings account for this relatively of course for all these mode of description imply offensive or defensive possibility of the stimulus for the recorder in relation to himself the interest in stature be fundamental and have persist in the most civilized nation the relationship of height and weight as well as of length and breadth to other physical trait have form the subject of scientific study there be for instance the classification of bean who divide mankind generally into two type those of a medium size stocky long leg and arm large hand and foot short trunk and face large in comparison to the head -lrb- the meso-onto-morph -rrb- and those who be either tall and slender or small and delicate with the smaller face eye close together long high narrow nose and trunk longer as compare with the extremity -lrb- the hyper-onto-morph -rrb- bean show too that the hyper -lrb- to use a short word to contrast with the meso -rrb- be present to the extent of almost a hundred per cent in a series of tuberculosis and about ninety per cent in a series of central nervous system disease all of which be exceedingly interesting and suggestive but throw no light upon the underlying mechanism of stature stature and growth stature be essentially determine by the growth of the long bone they be the pace-maker and the muscle and soft tissue follow the pace they set now the primary determinant catalyst or sensitizer of the growth of the long bone be the anterior pituitary all stature should therefore be first scrutinize from the point of view of the pituitary individual over six foot tall or under five foot five inch should be look upon as have a pituitary trend this pituitary trend may be primary due to its own undergrowth or overgrowth or it may be due to lack of inhibition from the sex gland such as occur in eunuch and eunuchoid or excessive or premature inhibition from they as happen in certain salacious dwarf the long bone grow at a point of junction between the bone proper and a overlying layer of gristle or cartilage know as the zone of ossification it be upon this zone of ossification that the various growth influence appear to focus and concentrate they effort among they the internal secretion after growth have be finish that be after adolescence these zone of ossification close so that growth be no longer possible unless they become reactivate upon the zone of ossification must act the pituitary and indirectly the thyroid the interstitial cell the thymus and the adrenal individual oversized or undersized either belong to the pituitary type or if hyphenate have the pituitary as one of the dominant in they composition the necessity of child-bearing determine a greater angle between trunk and lower extremity in the female underactivity of the pituitary for instance will prevent the development of the normal angle the ratio in length of the upper limb to the lower be a fairly constant relationship for each sex normally deviation occur with a break somewhere in the chain of cooperation of the internal secretion control the growth of bone hand finger and toe the size and shape and general configuration of the hand finger and toe be detail that tell a endocrine tale student of hand naturally have group they as the long slender and the short broad the bony and the well-filled out the taper finger and the stumpy the character of a hand be determine anatomically by the length and breadth of the bone the amount and distribution of fat and the thickness and elasticity of the skin over these the essential control lie in the pituitary and the thyroid so we find that pituitary type have when there be oversecretion large bony gross hand spade-shaped or when there be undersecretion hand that be plump with peculiarly taper fleshy finger the hyperthyroid have long slender finger the subthyroid pudgy coarse ugly foreshortened hand often cold and bluish facial type a artist will see in a face the past history of generation a narrative of the adventure of the blood a record of tear and smile wrinkle and dimple the victory and defeat of bury drudgery and romance these signature which the faculty of life have scribble or engrave over it as upon a diploma bespeak for he spiritual moment to the student of the internal secretion the line expression attitude be important for they tell of the state of tension and strain in the vegetative apparatus with which they be inseparably connect it be when one come to the consideration of the face as a complex of brow eye nose lip and jaw that he become most interested for in the modeling and tone of every one of the feature each of the endocrine gland have something to say in consequence there have be describe the hyperpituitary face and the hyperthyroid face the subthyroid face and the subpituitary face the adrenal face the eunuchoid face and the ovarian face and also the thymic to bring to mind a immediate complete image of the hyperthyroid face one should think of shelley the oval shape of it with the delicate modeling of all the feature the wide high brow the large vivacious prominent eye with the glint of a divine fire in they and the sensitive lip all belong to the classical picture generally flush over the cheek-bone there be undoubtedly a certain effeminate effect associate with it at least it be the least animal and brutish of the face of man on the other hand the subthyroid face be that of the cretin and cretinoid idiot in a mild degree so characteristic that we recognize the portrait in the description of pliny in early roman tune and of marco polo in he asiatic travels coarseness dullness pudginess be its keynote irregular feature tendency to wide separation of the eye and pug nose sallow puffy complexion waxy thicken nose and eyelid deep-set listless lacklustre eyebrow and thick prominent lip comprise the catalogue of the physiognomy on the whole the sort of face one pass in the street as stupid and common but there be a number of fascinating and marvelous variety of the stupid and common the adrenal face be most often dark or freckled it tend to be irregularly broadish it be hairy one be strike forcibly there be a low hair line which make the brow appear rather low and there be a good deal of hair over the cheek bone the adrenal type be round head the face of the hyperpituitary be striking and pretty sharply define it be long and narrow with a tendency to prominence of the bony part square protrude jaw high thin straight nose emphasize eyebrow and marked cheek-bone comprise the lead point in its composition on the other hand the subpituitary be more round and trend toward the full moon effect the chin recede the cheek-bone be bury under fat the nose spread more and be flatter in its general expression there be a complacence and tranquillity which be often mistaken for sleepiness and often actually be dullness the eunuchoid face be usually fat with puffy eyelid the skin be smooth and cool marble-like often poor in pigment and color sometimes it be sallow wrinkled and senile in a man in he early twenty at other it be distinctly feminine in its hairlessness and the delicate texture of the skin as well as in the clean-cut patterning of the feature every gradient between premature senility and sex inversion be encounter the thymic face frequently stamp its possessor at sight its owner have a smooth soft skin with little or no hair and a dead white or peaches-and-cream complexion one wonder when unacquainted with the type who the man 's barber be or where he learn to shave himself so well it may be curiously velvety to the touch and sweep by a faint sheen among child occur the most exquisite sample of the kind designate as the angelic child the face be finely mould and beautifully proportion feature artistically chisel eye blue or brown with long lash cheek transparent with rapid fleeting variation in color thin lip and oval chin in the adult the chin be recede and the mouth seem underdeveloped in one variety the tooth as closely connect with the internal secretion as be the bone of the face and the skull be the tooth tooth formation be essentially a modify bone formation and as the bone of the face be influence so be the tooth influence but as each tooth be a miniature organ inspectable by the eye as a unit the action of the ductless gland be more obviously reflect for the observer to read by they tooth shall ye know they upon the whole history of the evolution of each tooth in the growth of the dental follicle and its wall the fruition of the dentinal germ the making of the enamel organ the dental pulp the cementum and the peridental membrane the endocrine leave they mark there be certain general statement about the tooth and the internal secretion that can be make the tooth of the thyroid type be pearly glistening small and regular in other word the tooth to which poet have devote sonnet the pituitary type have tooth that be large and square and irregular with prominence of the middle incisor and a marked separation or crowding of they the interstitial type have small irregular upper tooth with turn stumpy or missing lateral incisor the thymus type have youthful milky white tooth that be thin and translucent and scalloped or crescentic at the grind edge the tooth of the adrenal type be all well-developed tend to have a yellowish color with a reddish tinge to the grind surface the degree and regularity of development of the middle upper cutting bite tooth as distinguish from the grind molar the middle and lateral incisor and the canine offer further guide to the endocrine constitution analysis the size of the central incisor seem to be directly proportional to the degree of pituitary predominance on the other hand the size and regularity of the lateral incisor seem proportional to the influence of the interstitial cell when these be inferior in the make-up of a individual the lateral incisor be nearly always distort the size of the canine appear to be a measure of adrenal activity long sharply pointed canine mean well-functioning adrenal gland equipment to start in with inherit from a bellicose progenitor no individual peculiarity of the tooth be accidental just as the absence of hair on the face in a man or a moustache effect in a woman stand for some definite stress or strain in the mechanic of interaction of the internal secretion so likewise do variation in dentition as to the time of eruption of the tooth they position and quality and they resistance to decay proper balance between the thymus and pituitary will permit the eruption of the tooth within the normal time limit both the milk tooth and the permanent tooth when there be equilibrium between the pituitary and the gonad the tooth will be regular in shape and position carious tooth in child and adult sometimes indicate endocrine imbalance thyroid and adrenal balance determine the resistance to decay of the molar early decay of the molar in child be significant of insufficiency of the thyroid when the first permanent molar which should appear in the upper arch in its usual position between the sixth or eighth year do not there have be a prenatal disturbance of the pituitary accord to chaye and other rapid decay of the tooth in childhood should always call attention to the parathyroid in pregnancy the tooth suffer particularly because of disturbance of the endocrine the say a tooth for every child be say to have its equivalent in every language the bicuspid and second permanent molar erupt around puberty when profound readjustment be go on among the gland of internal secretion they consequently suffer with they abnormality or divergence from type the tooth thus furnish a good deal of information concern the distribution of the balance of power among the hormone the skin the skin be influence in its color moisture hairiness texture fat content and disease vulnerability by the endocrine the question of color be very interesting for it be probably the expression of the blend action of the different internal secretion davenport the american student of heredity and eugenics have show that neither white nor black skin be either perfectly white or perfectly black but be mixture in various proportion of black yellow red and white the exact percentage of the pigment in each particular skin can be determine by means of a rotate disc thus a white person 's skin may have the follow composition : black 8 % red 50 % yellow 9 % white 33 % the composition of the skin of a very black negro may be : black 68 % red 26 % yellow 2 % white 7 % now the fact that in addison 's disease in which the adrenal be destroy there occur a coincident increase in the black in the skin and other evidence point to adrenal implication in dark complexioned white people as well as in those possess pigmented spot seem to indicate the adrenal as controller of the black and white factor davenport have conclude that there be two double factor for black pigmentation in the full-blooded negro which be separately inheritable the determinant of the red and yellow have still to be work out the moistness of the skin as perspiration depend upon the number and activity of the sweat gland it vary with the water content of the body the state of the vegetative nervous system and the body temperature thus the skin of the hyperthyroid and the subadrenal be soft and moist because of they antagonistic effect upon the sympathetic system the subthyroid and the hyperadrenal have dry and harsh skin for the same reason if no other gland intervene however in both of the latter if there be a persistent thymus the skin will retain the bland quality of adolescence there be a curious variation among the different internal secretion type in the reaction of the skin to stroke when the skin especially the skin over the shoulder the breast and the abdomen be stroke with some blunt object the blood vessel react either by a greater fill up or emptying of themselves the latter occur most regularly in the subadrenal type the former in the hyperthyroid both form of reaction run parallel to the different check or drive effect of the vegetative apparatus with too much drive that be too much thyroid there be the flushing reaction with too little check that be with too little adrenal there be the whitening these difference probably explain the emotional reaction of the face in anger for example some people become a dead white other a fiery red whether one will do one or the other may depend upon the relative predominance of the thyroid or of adrenal in the individual in the distribution of fat beneath and throughout the skin all of the endocrine gland appear to have a voice the typically hyperthyroid and hyperpituitary individual tend to be thin as well also as those who have well-functioning or excessively functional interstitial cell in all of these the administration of the respective internal secretion increase the burn up of material in the body and all of they have a higher rate of tissue combustion than they confreres with a subthyroid or subpituitary keynote in they cell chemistry or with insufficient interstitial cell action generally the latter have a very dry skin the former a moist skin with delay involution of the pineal obesity result the elasticity of the skin be another quality that vary with the concentration in the blood of the internal secretion elasticity of the skin its recoil upon be stretch like a rubber band may be take as a measure of the activity of all the endocrine gland for as can be notice especially upon the back of the hand the older a man grow the less elastic become the skin in older people raise the skin upon the back of the hand will cause it to stand up as a ridge for a few seconds and then slowly to return to the level of the surround skin whereas in a youthful person it will quickly snap back into place this quality of elasticity of the skin be due to the presence in it of the so-called yellow elastic fiber cell product with a resilience greater than anything devise by man the preservation of the resilience be a function of the internal secretion thus after loss of the thyroid the ridging effect characteristic of senility can be produce in one young as measure by he year it have be say that a man be as old as he artery and also that as he be as old as he skin it might better be say that he be as old as he elastic tissue young when he be rich in it old when poor and lose it and as elastic tissue and internal secretion stand in the relation of create and creator or at least preserved and preserver a man may be say to be as old that be as young fresh and active as he ductless gland the hair there be no characteristic of the human body except perhaps the tooth more influence in its quality texture amount and distribution than the hair and again each of the gland of internal secretion play a part but most importantly the thyroid the suprarenal cortex and the interstitial sex gland all contribute they specific effect and the blend the sum of the addition and subtraction constitute they influence appear as a specific trait of the individual a trait so significant as to be use by the professional absorb in the study of man the anthropologist as a criterion of racial classification some acquaintance with the history of the normal growth of hair be necessary to its understanding there develop during the life of the fetus within the womb a curious sort of wooly hair everywhere over the entire body -lrb- except the palm and sole which remain hairless throughout life -rrb- remarkably soft and fluttery -- the lanugo at about the eighth month of intra-uterine existence a good deal of this lanugo be lose to be replace on the head and eyebrow by a crop of thick coarse pigmented real hair so it happen that at birth the infant 's hair be a queerly irregular growth a mixture of what be leave of the general lanugo development and the localized patch of the more human hair until puberty this child 's hair remain the same although at time particularly after dentition and after infectious disease which undoubtedly alter the relation of the internal secretion change of color and texture occur then with sexual ripening there appear in male the so-called terminal hair over the cheek and lip and chin and in both sex in the fold under the shoulder and over the lower abdomen the hair which might be distinguish as the sex hair in contradistinction to the juvenile hair of the head the extremity and the back now the smoothness of the face in child be connect with the activity of the thymus and pineal gland among individual in whom the juvenile thymus persist after puberty no growth of hair occur on the face and in precocious involution or destruction of the pineal hair appear on the face and in other terminal region in child of six or less a symptom classical in the child who suffer from a tumor of the pineal and discuss immortality with he physician it be probable that these thymus and pineal effect be indirect through they action upon the sex gland for in the type with persistent juvenile thymus there occur a maldevelopment of the sex gland while in those with early pineal recession the sex gland bloom simultanously with the appearance of adolescent hair and mental trait the hastening of sexual hair by tumor of the adrenal gland may also be put down to a release from restraint of the interstitial sex cell there be certain sphere in the hair geography of the body over which particular gland may be say to rule or to possess a mandate the hair of the head seem to be primarily under the control of the thyroid thus in cretin reconstruct by thyroid feed the straight rather animal hair become lustrous and fine silken and curly in the thyroid deficiency of adult a prominent phenomenon often be the fall out of the hair in handful baldness be frequently associate with a progressive decrease of the concentration of thyroid in the blood at the same time there tend to be a thin of the eyebrow especially of the outer third the hair of the face in male and the other terminal hair in both male and female be regulate by the sex gland primarily in the female the ovary that be to say the interstitial cell of the ovary inhibit the growth of hair upon the face in destructive disease of the ovary as well as in other affection of it hair in the form of moustache beard and whisker may appear in female that be why in woman after the grand sex change of life the menopause hair often grow in the typically male region because of loss of the inhibit influence of the ovarian internal secretion upon they after castration of the ovary the same may result removal of the male sex gland or disturbance of they will interfere with the proper development of the normal facial hair of the hair of the chest the abdomen and the back the adrenal seem to be the controller adrenal type have hairy chest in male and hair on the back in female they have also a good deal of hair upon the abdomen the hair on the extremity vary a good deal with the pituitary people with hair upon hand arm and leg alone be generally pituitary or have a striking pituitary streak in they make-up when the adrenal increase in size in childhood a remarkable triad follow -- general hairiness adiposity and sexual precocity one fact should be note when the adrenal evoke precocity and a early awakening of the secondary sex characteristic it be a masculine precocity and a approximation to the masculine even in female there be a definite trend toward a increase of the male in the individual 's composition at the expense of the female we shall have to consider this in greater detail when we analyze the internal secretion basis of masculinity and femininity in general the degree of general hairiness be a index to the amount of adrenal influence upon the organism all the endocrine which affect the hair growth also act upon the sebaceous gland which oil the skin the eye eye present clue to internal secretion constitution dependent upon influence of architecture and function the thyroid eye be typical it be large brilliant and protrude the individual be pop-eyed on the other hand subthyroidize eye tend to be sunken and lustreless the eye of a pituitary type be either set markedly apart or close together with the hair at the root of the nose so prominent as to constitute a separate bridge know as the nasal brow the size of the pupil and its humidity which have so much to do with the expression of the eye vary directly with the activity of the driving and check division of the vegetative system and be a pretty good index as to which at the time of observation be predominant when the check system be in control the pupil be large and dilate when its antagonist and rival the drive system be on top the pupil be small and contract the reaction of the pupil when charge by strong emotion like fear or anger likewise turn upon the status of check or drive internal secretion in the economy of the organism at the time the exciting agent present itself muscle it would seem at first sight that organ like muscle mechanical instrument for the manipulation of the organism in space would be more or less independent of the subtler process of internal chemistry of the blood and tissue but no assumption would be more beside the mark just as much as the bone and viscera the tooth and the hair they show grossly how they be be influence by all the endocrine gland so thyroid type generally have a skeleton sparsely cover with a muscular mantle pituitary type have large well-developed muscle the pineal gland have some definite relation to muscle chemistry not yet probe thus it have be show that when the pineal have be completely destroy prematurely by lime deposit in it there be concomitant a wasting of muscle in place this waste be sometimes replace by fat picture and image in wood and stone of these muscle freak date from the fifteenth sixteenth and seventeenth century be in existence then there be the extraordinary fatigability of the muscle which occur in the thymus type who nevertheless have large well-rounded muscle a paradox of contradiction between anatomy and physiology such a type for instance may be pick out by a football coach for a important position in a line-up simply on the tremendous impressiveness of the muscle make-up only to see he bowl over and out in the first scrimmage the tone of muscle the quality of resist firmness or yield softness be essentially determine by the adrenal gland especially in time of stress and strain brown-squard be the first to show that extract of sex gland could increase the capacity for muscular work whether this be a direct effect upon the muscle or indirect through the nerve or other endocrine no one can say certainly the carriage of a individual outer symptom of the inner tonus among he muscle and tendon may be say to be as distinctively a endocrine affair as the color of he skin and like its variation variation of they tone development reactivity fatigability and endurance may be trace to corresponding state of overaction or underaction and odd combination of the different hormone much remain to be learn about they and the manner of they control such a affliction as flatfoot dependent upon a laxity of the ligament in one who seem perfectly healthy and strong may lead the analyst back to a thymus-centered personality that be but one example since too muscle attitude muscle tension and muscle relaxation play so large a part in the production of fundamental mental state : the attitude mood memory and will reaction the vegetative apparatus enter to play its part as a determinant sex over no domain of the body have the endocrine a more absolute mandatory than over that of the whole complex of sex both as regard the primary reproductive organ they size and shape and the character of they implantation malformation and anomaly as well as the physical and mental trait lump as the secondary sexual puberty maturity and senility voice change and erotic trend virility and femininity the internal secretion be dictator at every step so significant be these that even a rough summary of the discovery and the outlook in the field involve some consideration of the detail chapter vi the mechanic of the masculine and the feminine it need a poet to chant the epic of sex the mystery of it puzzle the mind of the earliest sumerian thinker as a source of deepest excitement it generate the most revolting ceremony bizarre custom astounding cruelty and incomprehensible stupidity of the race man and woman as soon as they have do with they usual business of keep themselves free of disagreeable sensation hunger cold fear of enemy betake themselves to it as a primary interest all over the world the most advanced psychologist of the day link the sex impulse with the winding and twisting of all human activity yet the homer of sex through the age be still to come but at all time the mystery evoke speculation and attempt at explanation act upon they theory as to the nature and function of sex man have ever since the passing of the primeval matriarchate segregate woman equalize they worship they or enslave they opinion have vary from ancient national aphorism to the effect that woman have no soul to the most ultramodern utterance of biologist-publicist that the difference between man and woman be the difference between two species there be other epigram vast sweeping generality extant concern the nature of sex and woman particularly all partake of the complexity of truth and therefore own a certain validity still since as a matter of fact these item have be base upon superficial observation color by the tradition and verbiage of the milieu they be valuable more as human document as material for the psychologist than as scientifically obtain datum able to stand unblinking before the ray of the critical searchlight science vs art not that all the vast accumulation need to be throw pell-mell higgledy-piggledy into the discard the love lyric of the poet the magic of the emotion of shelley and poe for instance with they marvelous music and exquisite intoning of feeling furnish we with important information they be the fact of the sex life as much as the song of the nightingale or the mock laughter of the cuckoo pursue by its mate so sappho and elizabeth browning to take only two sample have contribute some of the feminine reaction the erotic motive in literature have but parallel the erotic motive in life with all of its vagary delusion confusion ecstasy and suffer we have have concern sex not knowledge but a series of attitude the attitude of virtue the attitude of pruriency the attitude of good taste the attitude of the theoretic libertine the attitude of the satyr 's vulgarity all these pose of course have supply not a iota to a understanding of the foundation of the problem of sex biologically consider thus a masculine master have coin that immortal phrase the eternal feminine and in a matriarchate we should undoubtedly hear of the eternal masculine each leave one as unenlightened as the other a rough and ready code of life attribute certain grossly characteristic quality of mind and body to each sex this be suppose to be enough for common sense beyond that the mystery have be wrap in cotton wool that perhaps explain the enormous popularity of contemporary pornographic and so-called sex literature there be bind up with sex feeling and sex knowledge many custom belief and habit many legal statute and social institution in the complex that be call sentiment to which science loom as the sacrilegious ogre who devour romance without spend space upon the ravages of the sentimental idealist certainly responsible for as much human disaster as the brutal realist it be manifest that a revolution in sex standard and relation be inevitable as soon as the new doctrine filter down as matter of fact to the level of the common intelligence and surely nothing else could be wish for in the world desire by all of we the world rule by intelligence and intelligent good will sex chemistry a few general statement may be put down outright as material to go upon before we proceed to detail 1 femininity and masculinity have a definite chemical basis in the reaction of the internal secretion of which they be the expression that be to say that just as a precipitate of chalk be form when one throw some carbonate of soda into lime water so the masculine and the feminine be to be look upon as precipitate and crystallization of a long series of link chemical reaction in the fluid of the body in which the internal secretion play a determine part 2 femininity and masculinity be expression of the interplay of all the internal secretion it use to be say by smart cat and accept by the tabby cat that a woman be a woman because of she ovary alone it be be say by some great discoverer of the day that man be a man because of he testis alone neither of these dogma be true there be individual with ovary who show every deviation from the feminine and there be individual with testis who exhibit every variation from the masculine the other endocrine gland be of equal importance 3 there be no absolute masculine or absolute feminine the ideal of the manly man and the womanly woman be erect by the blind ignorance of the nineteenth century illusionist and a line draw to cleave they but indeed biologically there exist every transition between the masculine and the feminine the explanation of these different sex type consist in the different admixture of the internal secretion possible and actual when we speak of the feminine we really mean the predominantly feminine and when we speak of the masculine we mean the mainly masculine between all sort of transition be possible and occur man in relation to the internal secretion we have consider in review the interstitial cell to he we shall return later let we turn now to that fascinating subject of the age woman what produce and maintain the feminine the cause of sex to all appearance that inscrutable simplest of live thing the fertilize ovum beginning of the human start bisexual double sexed both masculine and feminine or perhaps neither masculine nor feminine then a form develop then within that form a patch of cell arise which the microscopist recognize as the forerunner of the male or the female reproductive cell then some more development and at birth sex be definitely settle as far as the reproductive organ be concern we knowledge here as everywhere be still fragmentary statistical review seem to show that in time of stress war famine pestilence more boy be bear than girl but that be neither here nor there it shed no further light on the subject monosexuality be a distinction of the human species : the sex be pretty clearly differentiate in some animal such as some worm there be a bisexuality of the individual there be present the reproductive organ of both sex capable of impregnate other individual as well as of be impregnate in some of these even self-impregnation may occur this be the condition of hermaphroditism but the higher up one go in the scale of evolution the greater become the distinction between the sex anatomic hermaphroditism become a rare anomaly life appear to have perfect this trick of separate sex sex specialization in short for the sake of the efficiency which go with specialization when a germ cell divide its nuclear material break up into segment know as chromosome now it have be find for example in the case of the common squash bug anasa tristi that there be 22 chromosome in the female and 21 in the male in the female two of these be visibly different from the rest while in the male there be one odd one the remain 20 be like the corresponding 20 of the female before the germ cell become fit to mix with a germ cell of opposite sex in the process of fertilization it must lose one half of these so the number of chromosome for the species be keep the same or constant this be the process of maturation in the process when the chromosome number be halve among the female 11 go into each mature egg but among the male the odd chromosome also know as the x-chromosome can perforce go only into half of the sperm cell leave the other without it so the sperm be form in equal number of 10 and 11 chromosome respectively when fertilization occur and the sperm cell fuse with the egg the follow may take place : -lrb- 1 -rrb- a ten chromosome sperm may unite with the eleven chromosome egg and produce a twenty-one chromosome individual or -lrb- 2 -rrb- a eleven chromosome sperm may unite with a eleven chromosome egg produce a twenty-two chromosome individual it have be find that the twenty-two chromosome individual invariably develop into a female and the twenty-one into a male therefore femaleness be a positive quality dependent upon the action of the x-chromosome and maleness a absence of femaleness due to lack of the extra odd chromosome in man two x-chromosome have be discover half the sperm contain 12 and the other half contain only 10 chromosome the number of chromosome in human cell consequently be 22 in the male and 24 in the female the x-chromosome be the bearer of sex destiny there still remain the work to be do on the actual control of sex by man apart from its natural determination for the time be let the feminist glory in the fact that they have two more chromosome to each cell than they opponent certainly there can be no talk here of a natural inferiority of woman the secondary or endocrine sex trait yet the matter be after all not so simple as this would make it out to be all that can be safely lay down be that the character of the reproductive organ be determine by the extra chromosome and though these reproductive organ have a good deal to do with the masculine or feminine quality of the organism as a whole through they internal secretion they be not alone all the other internal secretion have they say in the final outcome determine what may be call the dominant sex quality but leave inherent the latent soil of the other sex this may become active and dominant in its turn under certain condition of stimulation abnormality or disease dependent upon a rearrangement of status and influence among the ductless gland bisexuality precede monosexuality in the animal pedigree and co-exist with it even at the highest point of the genealogical tree while from the standpoint of the species the criterion of the sex classification of its member will depend upon they capacity to fertilize or to be fertilize a quality that may therefore be speak of as the primary sex character a number of other trait have be evolve by sexual selection the secondary sex trait they have come to be just as important to the individual as far as he or she consciousness of sex attitude and reaction to it be concern the term primary and secondary sex characteristic though inapt must be allow to stand these accessory sex-serving trait undoubtedly survive because of they usefulness in external adornment for attract attention in courtship in the metabolic requirement of sex combat and the sex act and in the necessity of care for the young until well-grown the rooster 's comb and spur the male frog 's clasper the stag 's antler and so on be familiarly and obviously so useful besides there be fundamental difference in inner physiology the human male consume more oxygen than the female per minute since he have more red corpuscle in he blood in some caterpillar the blood be yellow in the male and green in the female wi thoma have devote a essay of some fifty page to a review of the organic difference between man and woman the ordinary criterion employ every day by the man in the street to distinguish man from woman may be arrange as follow : _ man _ _ woman _ hair on face hairless face skin coarse and lean skin fine and plump muscle powerful relatively weak bone heavy bone light aggressive -- bass voice reserve -- treble voice the rle of the ovary while the primary sex character as such be present and distinguishable from birth quite the opposite hold for the secondary sex trait during childhood they be in abeyance or at least pretty sharply suppress girl and boy who be permit to dress alike to play the same game and among whom no consciousness of sex be encourage be often difficult to tell apart the boy will be boy and most of the girl tom-boy with puberty come a marked change of attitude toward the other sex puberty be the time of ripen of the specific germ cell it be then the ovary begin to secrete ovum ripe for fertilization and the testis begin to secrete sperm ready to fertilize before this can happen a event announce in the female by the onset of menstruation two condition must be fulfil in the endocrine history of the individual there must be a certain atrophy and retrogression of the thymus gland and there must likewise be a similar atrophy and retirement of the pineal gland both of these involution of the gland of childhood must occur before the normal hypertrophy and development of the sex gland and they secretion can start besides there must be a minimum activity of the thyroid adrenal and pituitary gland without they below a certain minimum the reproductive organ and they secretion will remain infantile cause a persistent infantilism or delay of puberty formerly there be ascribe to the ovary in a lump and without qualification a absolute despotism over the specifically feminine function of menstruation gestation parturition and lactation nowadays we see its domain as a limited monarchy if not indeed as one sovereign state of a republic a member equal but not superior to the other of a board of director its true business come down to two particular rles : first the production of ovum and second the secretion of a hormone or hormone over the other function once suppose its monopoly all the ductless gland rule what concern we now be its internal secretion or secretion one of they be know as lutein and it have never be chemically isolate in its pure form the existence of lutein like the existence of electricity be a inference something we be sure be there because of its effect it originate in a remarkable part of the ovary the corpus luteum besides there be the product of the interstitial cell the creation of a special layer of cell around the ovum the membrana granulosa they produce a substance tonic to the uterus when the ovary be remove there occur a atrophy of the womb muscle due to loss of this tonic substance this atrophy accompany by a abolition of the normal periodic uterine contraction make condition unfavorable to pregnancy it have be claim that the secretion of the corpus luteum be necessary for the complete progress of a pregnancy case be on record however of ovary take out soon after the onset of pregnancy without interference with the gestation castration be comparable in every way with the menopause or the time of cessation of sexual life a process that might be call self-castration it produce certain general constitutional effect adiposity often develop undoubtedly associate with underfunction of the thyroid and pituitary gland the woman breathe less oxygen per minute and burn up less food and tissue there be some disturbance of the lime balance with a increase excitability of the vegetative nervous system concomitant be the release of some brake upon the blood pressure mechanism so that a family tendency to high blood pressure will flare up some woman be render unstable by the process other be completely transform and still other adapt themselves with little or no discomfort to the new situation the response to the revolution in the cell-republic of the castrate by the other endocrine the thyroid the pituitary and the adrenal determine which it be to be for normally with feminine puberty there be a increase activity of the thyroid the posterior pituitary and the adrenal medullum these change indeed constitute the formulum of normal feminization in the male the ripen of the testis be accompany or perhaps precede by augmented function of the adrenal cortex and the anterior pituitary this difference in biochemistry account for the contrast between the sex in the skin hair fat cartilage -lrb- voice -rrb- and bone change ovary and adrenal medullum and posterior pituitary and thyroid predominance constitute the feminine formulum testis and adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary predominance comprise the masculine endocrine directorate the reaction of the other gland as in so many other aspect the fact about the various influence exert by the endocrine gland upon the reproductive system be complicate and disjoint a chink of light have be let in upon a dark cave and slowly the chink will widen but the gross effect be clear around the ovary and the uterus the endocrine gyrate as the planet around the sun the ovary be the organ for the preservation and maturation of the germ plasm that treasure which the body be build but to cherish and hand on as a sacred heirloom the ovum the female egg cell be the fundamental concern of the ovary secondarily it secrete its messenger to keep the rest of the body and particularly the other endocrine in touch with the necessity of the adventure of these ova it be thus enable to bend every force and power at its command to the service of the reproductive instinct in learn they rle so well in the course of evolution the thyroid the pituitary and the suprarenal have become indispensable stimulant -lrb- in various degree peculiar to the individual -rrb- to the primary function of the ovary as a consequence to hold the sex stimulating gland in check there have to appear other restrain they and so prevent sex precocity these be the thymus and pineal so closely be they all related that insufficient action of the thyroid pituitary or adrenal may cause atrophy of the ovary and uterus with abolition of genital function if the sex gland themselves fail as occur usually in most woman sometime in the forty the thyroid-pituitary-adrenal association must readjust itself to the new development the adaptation evoke the phenomenon of the transition to a new life the climacteric the significance of puberty trace the development of sex life there be a certain order of event in a normal history before puberty the ovum have lie asleep as it be in a cocoon state now with puberty they awaken and with they all those profound mechanism and invention that have to do with they nutrition up to ripening then revolve the cycle that be translate as menstruation the propulsion fertilization and implantation of the ovum in the uterus -- the full development of the fetus -- its birth and feeding after birth -- all of which be ductless gland control samuel butler once note that : all we limb and sensual organ in fact we whole body and life be but a accretion round and a foster of the spermatozoon they be the real he a man 's eye ear tongue nose leg and arm be but so many organ and tool that minister to the protection education increase intelligence and multiplication of the spermatozoon so that we whole life be in reality a series of complex effort in respect of these conscious or unconscious accord to they comparative commonness they be the central fact in we existence the point towards which all effort be direct nothing could be say more truly of woman and the ovum she carry all that transpire during pubescence be symptomatic of the underlie tidal stir in the cell the uterus become gorge with blood periodically to provide a enriched soil for the perhaps to be fertilize ovum to plant itself the breast grow and fat be deposit in particular place as reserve material for the making of milk the quality which be to appeal to the eye and ear and even nostril of the male appear instinct dawn a independence of spirit germinate emulsify with a curious shyness and coyness and a desperate loneliness and secrecy and all because there have be let loose in the blood from the gland of internal secretion the chemical substance that set go the clockwork of sequential incident elaborate and repeat through countless aeon of time feminine precocity ordinarily in the north temperate climate puberty begin about the fourteenth year but may begin anywhere from the tenth to the sixteenth feeding and environment indirectly the state of the internal secretion as a whole directly determine this in girl those definite sign menstruation and the growth of the breast before the age of ten mean premature awakening of the ovary and a concomitant co-reaction of the other endocrine create the ensemble of maturity in female the primary stimulus the initial spark of femininity must originate in the ovary there be other form of precocity in the female dependent upon stimulation of other gland but these form be masculinism a masculinization of the personality and not a true awakening of the feminine constitution so one must distinguish sharply between a precocity by masculinization and precocity of premature feminization the latter always imply the touch of the fairy 's wand upon the sleep ovary sexual precocity in boy may be produce by a premature overactivity not only of the specific reproductive organ : the testis but also by a early excess of secretion on the part of the cortex of the adrenal gland or the pituitary gland or by a too early involution of the pineal or thymus when such abnormality of adrenal pituitary thymus or pineal occur in girl it be the masculine streak in the hastening of growth that be make manifest all this emphasize the relative bisexuality of every normal no matter how pronounced when superficially view he or she form of predominate sex may be under the right condition recession of the most marked virility or femininity become conceivable and occur the secret of the masculine masculinization have enter upon the scene one may well ask : what truly -lrb- which mean chemically -rrb- lie behind all these difference and divergence between male and female what be the secret of the variable internal secretion admixture you can tell we that the recipe be different the ingredient different the result different as a nesselrode pudding be from say a rice pudding but what be the inner mechanism of the process since the masculine and the feminine be but expression of certain relative capacity and potentiality some single principle must run through the making of both recognize of course the qualification inherent in so broad a statement the answer be : the handling of the lime salt life originate or at least live and work for long age in sea water during these era the salt of the sea have come to play a dominant rle in its be the lime salt because of they peculiar property of dissolve or precipitate themselves accord to electrical condition in they medium have come to occupy a central position in all the process of growth metabolism and sex differentiation so it be that masculinity may be describe as a stable constant state in the organism of lime salt and the feminine as a unstable variable state of lime salt the male skeleton contrast with the female as the stronger larger heavier and straighter because it be a expression of a greater capacity to utilize store and keep lime in the system woman throughout they reproductive period be liable to rapid and pendulum-like fluctuation of they lime content menstruation pregnancy lactation all draw upon the store of lime sometimes deplete they to the point of softening of the bone and wreck the whole skeleton the endocrine control the transport and course combination and permutation in the history of lime 's progress among the cell and be in turn themselves affect by it man be relatively free of these liability and so remain man by he freedom from the recurrent crisis involve the lime salt reserve which constitute the essence of the life story of woman the sex index it follow from these consideration that when it become necessary to size the sex composition of a man or woman a measurement become establishable which may be speak of as the sex index to be able to say of mr llewylln jone that he be sixty per cent masculine and forty per cent feminine or of mr worthington that she be seventy per cent feminine and thirty per cent masculine would be of the utmost value under all kind of circumstance unfortunately lack as we do the exact figure of a advanced blood chemistry -lrb- yet in its most infantile infancy -rrb- a direct indexing of the sort be impossible but it be certainly conceivable along the line of measurement suggest by the binet test and other that a scale of evaluation of the secondary sex trait may be elaborate which would turn out as valuable in understand the friction of the individual and more concretely that aspect of it to which pathologist of the mind be trace so much needless misery and suffering : maladjusted sexuality express and suppress nothing will contribute more to harmonious adjustment for these sufferer than recognition of the fact that we be all more or less partial hermaphrodite the functional hermaphrodite the complete or total hermaphrodite we define as the individual who possess the reproductive organ of the male and the female both testis and ovary so rare be such a combination in man that for a long time its occurrence be doubt description of it regard as myth however undoubted case be on record examine by the most careful of observer of ovo-testis or mixed reproductive organ strangely enough the history of these case show that at one time the masculine set and at another the feminine set will hold sway over the sex trait and function blend do not happen rare though the true hermaphrodite may be the partial hermaphrodite be relatively frequent the mixed ensemble of the directly contrast type such as the concomitance of testis with feminine secondary sex trait or of ovary with masculine sex trait have be describe from time immemorial as freak occur even more frequently be the mixed sex ensemble in which the type of reproductive organ and of secondary sex trait run roughly parallel emulsify with certain trait of the opposite sex physical feature of one sex instinct and mental attitude of the other co-exist in the same individual by reason of a excess in one direction or a deficiency in another of the internal secretion the degree of masculine trend in a woman be a crude measure of adrenal domination the degree of feminine deviation in a man be roughly proportional to the amount of pituitary influence in he make-up whether one or the other sex tendency will dominate depend upon the quantity of sex hormone divergence from the ideal normal but also determinant be the environment stimulus provoke excessive or deficient secretory reaction from the other endocrine involve through the vegetative nervous system such especially be the associate of the mixed sex individual ordinarily the combative male and the submissive female be differentiate by contrast of skin and hair fat and bone structure the combative male be build as a fight machine the submissive female as a organism of attractive grace and beauty for impregnation and parturition when one see the fragile woman aggressive the masculinoid woman submissive one may infer a education of experience that have bring the usually recessive gland into the foreground and by they hyperactivity impose a bisexuality of function upon a unisexual anatomic structure a man apparently as formidable as a tyrannosaurus may be rule by he wife for the same reason these combination of a single organic sexuality with a functional bisexuality base upon internal secretion disturbance be frequent and merit the name of functional hermaphrodite or mixed sex type mixed sex and the family the psychology of the family in its relation to the endocrine trait of its member be something that still remain to be thoroughly work out as a problem of tremendous importance particularly be the reaction of the mixed sex type to be carefully consider for since the family be fundamentally a sex institution devise to satisfy the sex need all the way from companionship to parenthood it be apparent that the mixed sex type will be try the hardest by its inexorable condition it be in relation to the mother -lrb- or nurse -rrb- first the father next and other associate in proportion to they proximity that the primary endocrine-vegetative mechanism the germ of the grow soul become establish these be superimpose upon the hereditary instinct apparatus fear rage and love reaction develop first in association with the suckle reflex and the accompaniment the mother 's smile and voice the color of she hair eye and skin she breast and odor each time the babe react to a pleasant or unpleasant stimulus there be a outpouring of certain internal secretion a cessation of other a tingling of certain vegetative nerve and organ a hushing of other the ensemble of reaction tend to be repeat around the same stimulus until the whole become automatic one may observe the same process in the lower animal offer a piece of meat to a dog and he mouth water ring a bell before offer the meat repeat this a number of time and after a while the mere ringing of the bell without the presence of the meat will cause he mouth to water this associate vegetative secretion reflex be the most fundamental to grasp in a understanding of the deepest stratum of personality now there be besides the associate vegetative-endocrine reaction certain inborn automatic process in the vegetative system and in the internal secretion system which work automatically to produce increase intravisceral pressure the reduction of these pressure below the point of they intrusion upon consciousness they relief as we say also form the center of constellation around feeling of satisfaction or love such for example be the void of excretion sooner or later these automatic reaction and the associate reflex form around the mother father and other associate come into conflict inhibition or prohibition of the automatic act at certain time or moment be impose by somebody and so there occur a pit of the automatic mechanism against the associate reflex conflict with adjustment by suppression must occur thus a sense of self as active wisher -lrb- for the automatically pleasant experience -rrb- and punishable suppressor -lrb- of the same in favor of the acquire associate reflex -rrb- develop so far so good compromise by regulation from above from the brain of the automatic reaction follow as training no absolute repression be force no absolute encouragement be indorsed harmonious equilibrium or normality continue but now there come upon the scene the unconscious fear in the paleontology of character these fear be the deepest stratum the eocene era so to speak of the soul they be the hardest to get at and the most silent as well as the most dominant of the influence which guide conduct in sir walter raleigh 's word : passion be best liken to stream and flood the shallows murmur the deep be dumb during the first period of childhood up to five or six the primary fear group themselves around the taboo and secret of its life though we have every reason for believe that the sex gland be act in some way upon the organism during this time nothing definite be know yet as the numerous study of the subconscious recently make prove sex curiosity like the other curiosity flower more than about the automatic visceral reaction these curiosity evoke the repressive imperative of the associate the mother and father especially these repressive influence may be and often be the effect of ignorance prudishness vulgarity or homosexuality or the sex perversion that be know as sadism and masochism but by the necessity of the case the sex wish become overlay by reflex associate with the mother and father and close associate as love this might be term the oligocene as the circle of acquaintance widen other loved object usher in the miocene phase of the development with these become intersperse various hate and detestation deliberately cultivate and accept by the consciousness so we have a cross-slice of the personality in the first five or six year of childhood but now with the onset of the second dentition a subtle change begin in the endocrine equation of the body the second dentition itself be a expression of a certain internal secretion wave pass through the cell a increase of action of some hormone a decrease of other and a consciousness of physical sexuality appear while the outline of character hitherto mere tracing become firmer heavier quasi-indelible line that there be some activity on the part of the internal secretion of the sex gland the ovary and testis can be demonstrate by accurately chart the behavior of a boy or girl after this time it will be find that there be a cyclic variation of health and conduct more or less marked of course in each case a cold may appear periodically at the end of each month a increase of irritability and waywardness may be observe or on the contrary a decrease of the regular restless playfulness the ghost of sex begin to haunt the scene now all kind of possibility of conflict emerge the child be still a bisexual grow into a mixed sex type depend upon the nature and amount of its internal secretion the influencing adult of the family the most important of the external factor encourage or depress the tendency of the child possess a fairly fix ideal of monosexuality which he or she generally quite unconsciously seek to impose upon it a doting feminine mother will make she son as much as possible like she husband : if she dislike she husband as much as possible like she father or grandfather a masculinize mother will tend to make a sex object out of the son however which mean he feminization but on the internal secretion side the boy may be definitely masculine that be after adolescence he would be strongly masculine _ if the vegetative-endocrine mechanism create by the mother 's personality have not slip into the inside track _ so to speak as a consequence continual subconscious conflict between the two set of sex reaction will sooner or later disturb perhaps disrupt and ruin he life so a infant may start life with a fairly balanced endocrine equipment with its wake of a normal life -lrb- bar accident and infection -rrb- and yet he may end as a inferior insane criminal or failure directly because of establishment of conflict between himself as one sort of sex type and he obligatory associate of another sort of mixed sex type this apply also to the mother-daughter the father-son and the father-daughter relationship male and female create he they be a bald misstatement of the fact male and female emerge as final by-product of endocrine heredity environmental treatment and adaptation often the male-female the female-male persist anatomically or be force to persist functionally society construct upon the biblical dogma of man as a fall angel and absolute sex be responsible for much misery and suffer mete out to the functional hermaphrodite as we shall see later in a analysis of the endocrine character of oscar wilde the privilege and power of sex relationship marriage and parenthood should be safeguard for the mixed sex type the man or woman with the variable sex index for there be no tragedy in life more pitiful than those in which a aggressive masculinely build type be force to assume a submissive receptive passive feminine rle and vice versa the tragedy of compel homosexuality because of wrong associate masochism and sadism the functional hermaphrodite enable we too to understand the phenomenon of masochism and sadism to a certain extent on the chemical side the masculine personality the combination of masculine eg adrenal cortex and gonad internal secretion predominance be build for aggression the feminine personality the union of feminine eg thyroid and ovarian superiority be construct for submission reverse the possibility or confuse they as occur in the functional hermaphrodite and the attitude become reverse or pervert so a masculinoid personality in woman will make for sadism a feminoid personality in a man for masochism variant and refinement of these perversion will often be find in the functional hermaphrodite who must satisfy two doubly flow stream of visceral pressure within himself persistence of the thymus or pineal gland tend to a prolongation of the infantile and child type that will be take advantage of chapter vii the rhythm of sex if one permit a drop of ink to fall into a glass of water amazing figure and shape bizarre and chameleon be bear as the blue swirl and whirl through the resist medium unseen force and current tide and pressure set up a seething and flowing pull and twist of the drop of ink until it become a strange wraith create out of the molecule a temporary individuality live in the water so likewise the force of sex essentially the force of the internal secretion mould and sculpt and mould again the woman out of the flesh and blood adolescence -- puberty -- menstruation : the maid -- pregnancy -- labor -- lactation : the matron thirty year of up and downs of these process around the idea of love or suppress love against a aesthetic background of some sort -- and finally the loss of the stress and strain of sex the menopause all the landmark of the life of woman in they entirety be erect and dominate by the tide and current the phase of concentration and dilution of the different internal secretion in the endocrine mixture which be the blood marvelous be all the manifestation of the reproductive necessity consider that reproduction be at first merely a form of growth a discontinuous kind of growth that seize upon sex as a splendid means to escape death the chemical method evolve arouse a sense of awe a baby be bear with she or he gland practically as fix for she or he as the color of the eye thymus and pineal keep he a child keep he unsexed then at puberty a new current be add to the calmly flow river and behold a turmoil ovary or testis actively function erupt upon the calm spectacle and the girl be transfigure into the maid the boy into the youth after the ovary the corpus luteum : after the corpus luteum the placenta : after the placenta the mammary gland : after that the cycle begin again until the ovary be exhaust and the chain be break besides all the other gland of internal secretion beat in rhythm fluctuate in they activity may divide prematurely the tide or dam they completely innumerable variety and combination of interglandular action supply we with the limitless type of adolescent girl some endocrine cooperative that make one girl stable and settle will make other unstable and unsettled alicium may be hyperthyroid and so excitable nervous restless and subject to palpitation of heart and sleeplessness bettina may have too much post-pituitary and so will menstruate early tend to be short blush easily be sentimentally suggestive and sexually accessible christina may be adrenal cortex centre and so masculinoid : courageous sporty mannish in she taste aggressive toward she companion dorothea may have a balanced thyroid and pituitary and so lead the class as good-looking studious bright serene and mature florence who have rather more thyroid than she pituitary can balance will be bright but flighty gay but moody energetic but not as persevere and so on and so on environment habit-formation training education serve only to bring out the internal secretion make-up of the girl or to suppress and distort and so spoil she adolescence will be peaceful calm semi-conscious or disturbing revolutionary and obsessive accord to the reaction of the other endocrine to the rise of the ovary harmony and so continued happiness of the mind and body mean that they have be welcome into the fold disharmony ailment unhappiness difficulty mean that they be be treat as intruder or be act as marauder the after life sexually the period of maturity bar accident disease and shock will bear the same character the kind of adolescence provide the clue to the kind of maturity for both be effect of the same endocrine factor the sex gland chain furthermore the activity of a normal woman involve a series of sex gland since there function in addition to the ovary the gland of the uterus the breast or mammary gland and the placental gland -lrb- the secreting cell of the tissue which come out as the after-birth -rrb- each of these contribute directly to the reproductive life of the individual to call the ovum the sex gland be to confer upon they a name which really belong to a chain of gland all of the member of the sex chain include those of the thyroid the adrenal and the pituitary be necessary to the function of menstruation impregnation settlement of fertilize ovum in the wall of the uterus labor and lactation a disturbance of one of they will set up disturbance all along the line and a resonance of distress or compensation upon the part of all of they as a interlock directorate over the sexual function of the female they be member one of the other so what help or hurt one help or hurt all the cycle of menstruation essentially the ovary be a collection of follicle nest of cell act as safe deposit vault for the ovum that be to become candidate for fertilization at birth there be some 30000 to 200000 of these of which a good many atrophy during childhood so that there be no more than about 30000 leave at puberty of the 30000 only a lite 400 actually mature between the age of fifteen and forty-five about every twenty-eight day one of the follicle swell become fill with liquid push or be push to the surface of the ovary there to rupture and expel into the abdominal cavity the tiny ripe ovum the rest of the tear follicle make itself over into a peculiar yellowish body the true corpus luteum should pregnancy occur if pregnancy and the consequent placenta do not occur it shrink and turn into a scar the false corpus luteum the true corpus luteum resemble closely the adrenal cortex in make-up and staining reaction it seem as if once successful impregnation have be achieve the feminine organism adrenalize itself make itself more masculine and less feminine inhibit the posterior pituitary and the adrenal medullum as well as the ovary besides the corpus luteum stimulate the thyroid to prepare for the heavy demand to be make upon it during pregnancy before menstruation there be a stage of preparation a stir and twitter of the endocrine the premenstrual state current of communication flow between the different gland message and reply pass to and fro when these be properly balance so that all go well the consciousness of the woman will be disturb by no knowledge of they in some woman abnormal sensation appear a sense of fullness in the breast or of weight in the back or pelvis or pain in the head the last be probably due to swell of the pituitary beyond the capacity of its bony container in a good many woman nervous and mental phenomenon herald the expect menstruation because of a complete upset of the balance between the internal secretion with result disturbance of the nervous system irritability depression excitability melancholia exaltation restlessness hysteria loss of self-control or even more marked mental aberration may appear follow they and roughly parallel they may come various abnormality of menstruation itself the character extent and duration of these furnish we the best clue to the endocrine stability or instability of the particular feminine organism menstruation be simply the uterus say : well not this time as the destine ovum within its nest the follicle grow its fluid affect the interstitial cell to send they specific stuff into the blood there it circulate hit this gland and that make some more active other less transform the chemistry of the cell and engorge the mucous membrane most of all those of the nose and of the uterus it be all to welcome the mature ovum and its possible impregnation to prepare a site for its landing and settlement blood and food for its nutrition safety for its development but it be not to be no sperm at hand or effective enough to penetrate that wander ovum love 's labor 's lose all must return to the so-called normal really the intermenstrual state the womb must surrender some of that blood the gland return to they routine and a sex diastole of the whole organism succeed until again another follicle swell another ovum mature and the premenstrual state of sex high tide cycle back seven to ten day before menstruation we know that sex high tide be begin for that be when the blood pressure go up as this rise of blood pressure be probably control by the posterior pituitary we have a clue to the reason for the rhythmic variation in the rate of production of its secretion by the ovary for since menstruation be so closely connect with the phase of the moon and the tide the rhythmicity of the posterior pituitary may be trace to the day when the pineal be a eye at the top of the head and in direct relation with the pituitary menstruation have be say to be a miniature labor it be not that as much as it be a miniature abortion it be a effort of nature still-born but nature be quite use to its disappointment and return placidly to the daily grind the four phase of a woman 's twenty-eight day cycle succeed each other as the premenstrual the menstrual the postmenstrual and the intermenstrual with the precision of piston move in a motor when no interfere factor as disease profound emotion or climate disturbance be present affect the endocrine the sequence of event appear to be about as follow : the amount of post-pituitary secretion reach a certain concentration this in turn stimulate the thyroid and adrenal medullum they in turn activate the ovarian cell which congest the uterine gland and lining membrane the follicle burst the ovum be discharge and wander the uterus wait and wonder nothing happen the curtain be lower the scenery be remove the actor revert to civilian clothes that be the story of menstruation the central phenomenon of woman 's pre-pregnancy life one see it clearly as a play of a internal secretion syndicate the premenstrual molimina the premenstrual molimina be the traditional title accord symptom sensation feeling observation of woman in the premenstrual phase in the light of endocrine analysis they become exceedingly important indicator of the underlie constitution of the individual concerned indeed the premenstrual period furnish a direct clue to the dominate internal secretion in a woman moreover these premenstrual phenomenon be the shadow cast by come event for they mimic and prophesy the event of the last crisis of feminine sex life the cessation of ovulation which go by the name of menopause gonadopause or change of sex life the premenstrual phenomenon provide a positive film so to speak of the latent negative picture of the endocrine system of the girl or woman thus there be the sub-pituitary or pituitary insufficient type in whom the excessive swell of the gland cause headache and a dull heavy tired feeling a definite depression drowsiness sleepishness indifference to surroundings general sluggishness of thought feeling and reaction a phlegmatic frilosity all go with it it be due to a overweighing of the pituitary controller of good brain tone and alive wakefulness by the demand of the organism on the other hand the hyperthyroid type of woman react with a exaggeration of she tendency when the posterior pituitary begin to secrete more in she its stimulation of the thyroid be enough to tip it over the normal line such a woman in the premenstrual phase become irritable and restless do not know what to do with herself can not concentrate on conversation occupation or any single activity may become excited to the point of mania hot tremulous sleepless or sleep badly she have a much harder time of it than she pituitary sister these sample of premenstrual internal secretion reaction be the extreme of a vast number and variety of type there be woman in a unstable quasi-premenstrual state for the greater part of they life sometimes a infectious disease or a psychic blow will put a woman into this class the significance of these cyclic change have be tremendously increase by the recent formal admission of woman to participation in public activity on a plane of equality with man evidence exist that in man too there be some cyclic rhythmicity of he endocrine which set up a fluctuation in he physical and mental efficiency the curve of these variation have still to be plot and will doubtless contribute no little to we knowledge of the control of human nature one unexpurgated fact stand out : the reproductive mechanism of woman have render she whole internal secretion system and so she nervous system all she organ she mind definitely and sharply more tidal in they current more zigzag in they phase more angular in they up and downs of function and so less predictable reliable and dependable the masculinoid woman the masculinoid woman as a functional hermaphrodite exist first as a congenital entity with a inborn distribution of endocrine predominance that make for masculinity there be also numerous acquire form the infection of childhood measles scarlet fever diphtheria and above all mumps may so damage the hormone system that a inversion of sex type follow however the stimulative and depressive effect of environment be even more significant the effect of environment in produce change in a organism the change the biologist sum up as adaptation can be track in many instance to responsive reaction of the gland of internal secretion to demand make upon they by change external condition so a cold climate which necessitate a more voluminous hair cover for a animal will evoke a hypertrophy of the adrenal cortex secondarily other effect appear as by-product of the adaptation the adrenal cortex make for pugnacity temper animal courage irritability and anger reaction so a hairy animal will in general -lrb- unless other endocrine come in to defeat the primary effect -rrb- be more pugnacious courageous irritable and combative the same apply to woman a environment which tend to encourage the masculine trait in she to arouse repeatedly she pugnacity and combative decision in the more rapid give and take of the masculine world will rouse the adrenal cortex to greater activity and so make she face hirsute she attitude aggressive and perhaps render she sterile concomitantly there may be a disturbance of menstruation the presence or absence of sterility natural or enforced always present or say appear after the birth of one child must all be donate a prominent place in study the endocrine make-up of a woman when there be not enough ovarian secretion the ovum may not be able to burst through the ovary a necessity before it may begin its travels to the uterus next the propulsive action of the genital duct may be insufficient because of defective corpus luteum or the uterus may not have receive enough posterior pituitary or thyroid to make it fit soil for the ovum to plant itself in or there may be too much of these which cause the uterus to massage itself daily by gentle contraction and so keep it well-toned excessive massage will throw the ovum out all these be factor in the sterility problem with its psychic resonance affect the maternal instinct the maternal instinct there have be create high ode to a unknown god sensuous lyric of love apostrophe and address to every human passion but no poet to my knowledge have rise to the height of the maternal instinct some contemporary clap-trap about sentimentalism will perhaps decry and ridicule the demand for a apotheosis of it there be some who deny its existence and assert that maternity be force upon every woman reduce to its element such nonsense turn out the absurd pose of the theorist desperate to pater le bourgeois or to cover up hidden defect in he or she make-up without the maternal instinct without the hope of immortality through somatic or spiritual posterity we should all who be sane enough have to condemn ourselves to the futility of hedonism so that the criminal who be condemn to roll a huge boulder up a hill only to see it roll down again would have to thank he lucky star for he lighter punishment the future tomorrow the kingdom of heaven on earth or if you will the republic of superman mean to all of we what the child mean to the madonna the cynical epicurean careerist and careeristina and the depraved degenerate of a comfort-lusting civilization may have suffer a absolute atrophy and castration of that instinct but they be pathologic specimen and we be not for the moment concern with they the freudian have set up a great hullaballoo about creative activity as sublimation of the sex instinct or as they would have it the libido that be they obsession the confusion of the sex instinct the instinct for sex life and satisfaction in the relation of the male to the female with the maternal instinct the paternal instinct bear the same relation to the maternal as the breast of the male do to those of the female ie a functional hermaphrodite trait the maternal instinct be the instinct to create provide and care for offspring the mother express the deep craving of protoplasm for immortality what drive she be the instinct of life to preserve itself unto eternity in infinite space and time that separate it sharply from the temporary need of the sex instinct the artist the man of science or letter the statesman craftsman and maker of every sort be instigate by the maternal instinct he create for he own pleasure to be sure but it be in its essence the pleasure of the bird make its nest it be necessary therefore to distinguish between the sex instinct and the maternal instinct for different gland of internal secretion have be find responsible for they a distinct difference in the quality and amount of the two instinct may be observe in the same person a strong maternal instinct may be see again and again to dominate a woman with but little or no sex urge or passion numerous physiologically frigid woman have live successful and happy married life because of contented maternity other woman with normal or exaggerated sex instinct who welcome and stimulate the sex life may have no wish for child no function maternal instinct at all and if sterile will accept they fate with indifference or even exultation these variation occur because of a difference in chemical source and determination of the two instinct while the ovary stimulate by the thyroid and the adrenal medullum be the chief determinant of the sex instinct to the posterior pituitary must be credit the chief hormone of the maternal instinct the interaction of the two gland the ovary and the posterior pituitary modify by accessory influence determine the relative intensity of the two instinct in a sense the two gland may be say to be antagonistic and yet one stimulate and complement the other the transfiguration of child-bearing though what happen at puberty what happen all through life through the agency of the endocrine be amazing enough what occur during the period of child-bearing be perhaps the most amazing of all as emphasize pregnancy be the time among the internal secretion of a great uprooting and stir of fundamental and cataclysmic change in the most intimate chemistry of the cell it be as if a dictator inspire by he country 's danger its enemy at the gate of its capitol be to draft and mobilize everyone man woman and child from everyday activity to the necessity of defense or rather it be as if there appear within the heart of we civilization a common purpose and intelligence now so palpably lack which magnetize and draw to itself all the stream of individual self-aggrandizing effort imagine that possibility and how it would change the face of the earth and the entire basic constitution of human life and society so do the profound tide of the hormone center around the new creature be make in the womb transfigure the face and constitution of the child-bearing woman during pregnancy in consequence the integrity of every structure of the body be test a stern relentless accountant go over the cell count up they reserve establish a balance credit and debit accord to the demand of the grow parasite within they follow change in the skin the bone the nervous system and the mind that be all the gland subtle recorder transmitter producer of the vibration of change be influence but the most influential be the most affect as the most dominant personality in a community be most disturb by a revolution in sinclair lewi ' main street the best novel ever make about america as a nation of villager the heroine carol kennicott have this to say to someone sentimentalize about maternity i do not look lovely mr bogar my complexion be rotten and my hair be come out and i look like a potato bag and i think my arch be fall and the whole business be a confound nuisance of a biological process the exploration of the internal secretion have bring we a explanation and a understanding of why child-bearing be a nuisance we know now that if carol kennicott 's complexion become rotten and she hair fall out it be because she thyroid be not adequate to the demand of pregnancy and that if she arch be fall and she figure acquire a potato bag dumpiness it be because she pituitary be insufficient in all probability she be a thymus-centered type which account for much of the material that go to make up the novel different endocrine type react characteristically toward the situation of pregnancy the adrenal type may not be able to respond with the necessary enlargement of its cortex which be normal for the need of gestation so pigmentation darkening and discoloration of the skin especially of the face the traditional chloasma develop the hyperthyroid type may become sharply exaggerate almost to the point of mania and psychosis the subthyroid will suffer a emphasis of she defect and pass on because of pregnancy to the truly diseased state of myxedema the state of dull slow stupid semi-animal semi-idiocy the pituitary type become more masculinize the face become more triangular and coarser the chin and cheek-bone more pronounced and there be a growth of all the bone so that she be see to grow visibly in height and breadth and in the size of the hand and foot concomitantly there be a change a more matured and steadier outlook upon life all due to stimulation of the anterior pituitary controller of growth physical and mental in general the major endocrine the pituitary the adrenal and the thyroid should hypertrophy and hyperfunction during pregnancy should they not should adverse mechanical circumstance or chemical malfunction prevent dire effect may follow a woman with the closed-in type of pituitary shut up in a small non-expansile sellum turcica will suffer the most violent headache will become fat will frequently abort one whose thyroid can not rise to the demand of gestation because of previous disease -lrb- like typhoid or measles -rrb- which injure she thyroid excessively may be poison by the new element introduce into the blood by the grow fetus as it be the job par excellence of the thyroid to render innocuous these poison of adrenal insufficiency failure of the adrenal to hypertrophy sufficiently in pregnancy little be know possibly the corpus luteum the endocrine form of the tear egg nest in the ovary make up for any deficiency in this respect for there be the most curious resemblance imaginable between the cell of the adrenal cortex and those of the corpus luteum some day to be completely explain the placental gland the placenta a organ and gland of internal secretion newly form in the uterus when the fertilize ovum successfully imbed itself within it must be consider in any analysis of the transfiguration of child-bearing bear with the pregnancy its life be terminate with the pregnancy for it be expel in labor as the after-birth its importance and function as a gland of internal secretion have become know only recently many still doubt and question the accordance of that rank to it but feed experiment with it in various endocrine disturbance in human being have prove its right to the title the placenta be create by the fusion of the topmost enlarged cell of the uterine surface and the most advanced cell constitute the vanguard of the grow and multiply ovum these front line invader interact with the cell in contact with they to make a new organ which serve as lung stomach and kidney for the embryo since it be the medium of exchange of oxygen foodstuff and waste product between the blood of the mother and the blood of the embryo ultimately it act too as a gland of internal secretion influence the internal secretion of the mother and also those of the embryo settlement of the fertilize ovum in the womb introduce into the system new secretion new substance which be partly male in origin since the ovum contain within it the substance of the male sperm which have penetrate it this masculine element cause a rearrangement of the balance of power between the endocrine towards the side of masculinity they push down the pan of the scale to inhibit the post-pituitary so menstruation the menstrual wave which follow the increase tide of post-pituitary secretion be postpone for ten lunar month not another ovum break through the covering of the ovary and the uterus be leave undisturbed the placental secretion play a most important rle as brake upon the post-pituitary the most active of the feminize uterus-disturbing endocrine until at last something happen that put the placenta out of commission in this function of restraint and the long bottled up post-pituitary secretion explode the crisis apparent as the process of labor a condition of self-poisoning often occur in pregnancy with symptom orchestrate from mild note like nausea and vomit to the high key of convulsion and insanity they represent what happen when a unbalanced endocrine system be attack by the placenta depend upon where in the internal secretion chain the weak point the achille ' heel spot will be find the nature of the reaction will vary and even after labor after the explosive crisis so much of the reserve endocrine material may be consume that a actual mania or a chronic weakness may come in its wake yet the placental secretion must not be look upon as something wholly evil in its potentiality without enough of it to hold the uterus stimulate endocrine particularly the post-pituitary in check still-birth result if there be enough and not too much of it the woman will not feel ill at all or perhaps only transiently but will be possess of a curious feeling of drowsy content and passive relax happiness let there be relatively too much of it too little of the other gland and the grosser transfiguration and ailment of the child-bearing period follow the mammary gland once pregnancy be terminate by labor the placenta be expel from the body as the after-birth the placenta remove a new arrangement of the balance of power among the endocrine become necessary but a new-comer appear upon the scene to take up the function leave vacant by the absent placenta this new-comer be the secretion of the activate breast the mammary gland they make for a persistence of the state of equilibrium among the endocrine attain during pregnancy the mammary gland be typical gland of external secretion they make the milk and pour it out of the breast through little canal into the mouth of the suckling yet evidence force we to conclude that they be also gland of internal secretion that they internal secretion substitute to a certain extent for the loss of that of the placenta but not quite what seem to happen in fact be this : the corpus luteum secretion stimulate the dormant cell of the mammary gland form during puberty but latent until the advent of pregnancy we know that injection of corpus luteum will cause a hypertrophy of the breast the same effect be produce regularly during the menstrual period with a consciousness of swell of the breast they atrophy at the menopause coincide with the shrinkage of the ovary that take place at that period activity of the breast parallel indeed more or less the activity of the corpus luteum with the prolonged activity of the corpus luteum during pregnancy prolonged stimulation of the breast occur the secretion of the post-pituitary would now cause the change from the internal cell secretion to milk but it be inhibit from so do by the placenta when the placenta be remove after labor the post-pituitary can act and a free flow of milk be establish however to counterbalance this and to prevent the post-pituitary from overact the breast secrete a hormone with a action like that of placenta but not so strong which tend to inhibit the ovary so be put off the imposition of a pregnancy upon a period of lactation obviously bad for mother infant and embryo we have here a exquisite sample of the check and compensation which make for a self-balancing of the whole endocrine system critical age the dangerous age be a phrase coin by a scandinavian writer as a more dramatic euphemism for the time of life when sex function cease the climacteric as a matter of fact the age of adolescence be just as much of a dangerous age as the age of deliquescence the only difference between they be that the danger of the one have be hush up the danger of the other well boom and advertise both be dangerous to the individual because both be period of instability and readjustment of the cell particularly the brain cell to a deranged endocrine system and blood chemistry moral attitude differ at the two age not so much as a effect of experience as expression of different visceral pressure produce by newly dominant internal secretion so in eugene o'neil 's play diff ` rent we see the woman emma crosby as she be in she youth when she ovary have bud and bloom for only a few year and she other endocrine influence be still dormant she break off she engagement to captain caleb william on the eve of she wedding because she be inform of the episode of a sex affair he be involve in on he last voyage under circumstance not discreditable to he the next act show she thirty year later when as a elderly spinster she be pass through the climacteric and be in the state of sexual hyperesthesium some woman be afflict with before the menopause it be as if the ovary and the accessory sex internal secretion erupt into a sort of final geyser before they be exhaust so the captain ever faithful find she and discover to he horror that she be a thousand time more like other woman than he have ever be like other man because of he ignorance of the underlying chemical basis for the transfiguration tragedy follow critic may cackle about a sex starve woman who have repress she natural desire and hail the play as a contribution to the freudian clinic as a matter of fact it be a study of libido variation with endocrine variation at two stage of the inner chemical life of a woman the chain of event at the menopause the acme and then ebb of the sex tide may be sum up something like this : the ovary cease produce they egg and so shrivel as a storage battery atrophy when it dry up a important member of the endocrine board of director thus drop out and so a rearrangement of gland activity a new rgime become necessary if a balance of power be establish quickly and equitably very little happen quickly the woman pass on to the next plane of she existence but if some endocrine prove recalcitrant and take advantage of the situation to make itself dominant trouble and maladjustment and they psychic echo come anterior pituitary control will mean a relative masculinization with hair on the face and aggressive attitude post-pituitary most often refuse to settle down and express its ambition as headache flush obesity and hysteria may cause extreme misery and unhappiness to its possessor sooner or later if the harmonious equilibrium of the normal life be to be revive all the gland must regress thyroid pituitary and adrenal with the wane of the ovarian function the thyroid type will also exhibit its particular flare if there be thyroid excess the woman will be excitable and irritable the thyroid deficient will be depress and dull the thyroid unstable -lrb- that be swing between excess and deficiency -rrb- will have a cyclic up and down alternation of mood and temperament the adrenal centered will have a high blood pressure and masculinoid trait the adrenal inferior will have a low blood pressure and suffer from a constant weakness and fatigability so each form of reaction to the critical age be individualize accord to the predominate glandular influence in the constitution of the woman when the womb have atrophy and the breast have shrink the typical tan complexion and the angular masculinoid figure face and psyche follow and the transfiguration have be complete man have he critical age of sex cell deterioration as well as woman the age period swing between forty-five and fifty-five here enter upon the scene that organ of external and internal secretion the prostate the most important of the accessory sex gland in the male experiment with its extract upon grow tadpole have demonstrate it to have the same differentiating effect as thyroid but without the poisoning effect furthermore the microscope reveal cyclic change in its cell comparable to the menstrual phenomenon of the uterus indeed it be accept as the homolog or male representative of the uterus small and undeveloped during childhood its growth at puberty parallel that of the other reproductive organ its secretion have be show to be necessary to the vitality of the sperm cell the regression of the prostate its retirement from the field of sex competition be the central episode of the male climacteric accompany its shrinking be prominent a irritable weakness despondency and melancholia which may emerge at any time if there be disease or disturbance of it the influence of the prostate upon man 's mental condition and its contribution to the sex index still remain to be investigate in detail sex crisis at the period of interstitial cell hyperactivity when a wave of radicalism in the blood sweep through the tissue the other endocrine be test and they latent stability or instability be make manifest even before puberty cyclic variation of health and conduct may be observe in boy and girl which undoubtedly depend upon current among the internal secretion child who in the best of circumstance habitually be attack by a wanderlust and run away from home or suffer from fit of naughtiness be sample of such endocrine lability child specialist have find that at about the end of the second year they charge begin to individuate in a certain percentage sex trait appear pretty early but the fact of the matter be that it be rather the minority of girl who spontaneously exhibit the traditional stigma of the natural girl the doll-cherishing housekeeping imitator of mother be another story at puberty arise the most exquisite case of life crisis dependent upon hormonic crisis the boy become restless irritable and quick-tempered when he thyroid and adrenal respond to the call of the interstitial cell if they do not he will become dull heavy lazy and listless the girl correspondingly be transform into a vivacious gay nervous and apprehensive butterfly or a sedate dreamy bashful or even morose moth it be interesting to note that poise mental equilibrium be not establish until physical growth cease mark by a cessation of growth of the long bone know as ossification of the epiphys poise seem to be control by the ante-pituitary the growth of the long bone be also dominate by the ante-pituitary it would seem as if its secretion dedicate to the one function could not be available for the other so it happen that those in whom growth cease early -lrb- probably because of a earlier and more vigorous invasion of the internal secretion system by the interstitial cell product -rrb- develop mental maturity more rapidly and possess more of it than those in whom growth continue the acumen and salacity of certain dwarf be proverbial the puberty phenomenon teach that sex crisis of every sort be dependent fundamentally upon fluctuation periodic or aperiodic of the sex index as we have define it the determine factor of sex life the material summarize in the precede paragraph furnish some slight inkling of the vast dominion of sex in all its relation somatic and spiritual over which the gland of internal secretion rule the founder of modern pathology virchow say that woman be woman because of she ovary he mean that woman be a woman the sort of woman she specifically be because of she internal secretion but no divine decree have lay down a line of cleavage between man and woman there be fundamental constitutional difference between man and woman but it be just as true that man be man because of _ he _ internal secretion we have see that the concept of man and woman be the end-point of a curve include variation of every possible combination that be embrace in the construction of a sex index this sex index be not a absolute constant although its range of fluctuation be pretty well fix at birth it vary from day to day year to year depend upon the influence that have be bring to bear upon it but it determine the character of the three plane of sex : the endocrine the vegetative and the psychic the endocrine be concern with the fundamental chemistry of sex the internal secretion which determine the chemical reaction that provide the free energy for the sex process upon the vegetative plane occur those transformation tension and relaxation in the viscera which be control in part by the endocrine and in part by the experience of the individual as register in he subconscious upon the psychic conscious plane appear the echo and reflection of the occurrence upon the other two plane as well as reaction arise in the brain from the necessity of the organism react as a whole to isolate episode accompany be a self-awareness of the organism as a unit the three plane be not like separate plate of glass one raise above the other the usual idea picture of plane they be nebulae swirl into each other influence and be influence continually the reaction among these three complex of sex create the milieu for the variation and aberration of tendency character and conduct which stamp he unique quality upon the individual sex morale be likewise so influence the fundamental of sex ethic will in due time be revise in accordance with these conception chapter viii how the gland influence the mind it be impossible to review here in detail all the fact accumulate concern the influence of the internal secretion upon all the process of mind intellectual and emotional a volume would not suffice for they adequate consideration reflex instinct habit tendency and emotion be involve in they machinery the development and normal functioning of the intellect the pure reason as kant call it be control by they brain without they in solution without enough of they in that wonderful solution the blood sleep or remain dormant like the butterfly in the cocoon the cretin who have not enough thyroid or no thyroid be a imbecile because of he deficiency supply he with thyroid from outside source feed he animal thyroid be it of the sheep the pig or the goat and behold a miracle he be restore to the level of at least the relatively normal intelligence acuteness of perception memory logical thought imagination conception emotional expression or inhibition and the entire content of consciousness be influence by the internal secretion the most ultramicroscopic activity of the molecule and atom in the highest nerve cell and nerve tissue be dominate the speed of they chemistry and they association and thus the speed of thought be regulate iodine have be show to increase the electric conductivity of the brain that be the rate at which electron will fly through it the thyroid may then be regard as manipulate the amount of iodine bring to play upon the brain cell at a particular moment of danger or exaltation adrenalin increase the electric conductivity of the brain nerve impulse and with they sensation and idea travel faster or flow more quickly through iodinize or adrenalinize brain cell in dangerous situation we think more rapidly and keenly for in emergency the blood flood the brain with extra thyroid and adrenal secretion the body-mind complex mind still regard by most of mankind as something distinct and apart from the body be thus exhibit as but part and parcel of it a deaf dumb and blind animal deprive of tongue and olfactory mucous membrane without sensation from the outside world can grow no mind in the sense of intelligence the sense organ of the body mediate the primary mind stuff without internal secretion and a vegetative system there could be no soul in the sense of complex emotion nor those combination of thought and emotion which synthesize attitude sentiment and character the internal secretion and the vegetative system mediate the primary soul stuff mind be thus emulsify with body as a matter of cold literal fact the soul be once a subtlety of metaphysics now when mind appear soak in matter saturate with chemical like the hormone therefore weave out of material thread the independent entity create out of intangible spirit fly like a ghost at dawn view the outlook mind the slippery phantom now become controllable for the purpose of everyday life because we can put we finger upon touch handle and change these material factor the internal secretion and the vegetative system through they we may affect the very quality of the nerve tissue the future of the race the future of human nature depend upon the knowledge to be bear of the research into the vast possibility of this idea man the adventurer the prey of chance and luck will then become indeed now become the captain of fate and destiny it be of itself a revolution in the intellect to conceive of instinct and emotion suggestibility and contra-suggestibility initiative and imitation volition and inhibition as chemical matter in all they relation mutually react effect and defect excess and deficiency the internal secretion set up psychic echo and reflection when morbid and they equilibrium dislocate we may even have phobia and neurose a man 's nature be essentially he endocrine nature primarily when he be bear he represent a particular inherit combination of different gland of internal secretion they constitute the inventory of he vital stock in trade start he in life afterwards food the routine of he existence the accident of experience education disease and misfortune in short environment modify he because they modify he ductless gland and he vegetative apparatus as well as he brain depress some part and stimulate other and so rearrange the system in particular will he be transform as the gland be affect which be the center of the system to which the other adapt and accommodate themselves the inertia of the system be very great almost absolute and always tend to return if he have child he hand on he constellation of endocrine in spite of mishap not at all or only slightly transform sometimes however the experiential transformation have be sufficiently deep and shake the very constitution of he germ-plasm so family disposition and trait national and racial temperament be propagate maintained and vary the sex instinct hormone reaction as we have see initiate the complicated force process and expression of sex the dictum of the founder of modern pathology virchow that woman be in effect a appendix to the ovary have long be take to apply to she psychic trait as well as somatic she mind like she skin she hair and she pelvis be a product of the ovarian endocrine but these determination be by no means she monopoly man be likewise a creation of the chemical wheel within wheel and spring within spring that be he gland of internal secretion that he be not so obviously a appendix to he testis be due to two reason first the male sex hormone have not the instability nor cyclic rhythmicity of the female secondly and perhaps consequently he sex instinct have become overlayer with other more labile instinct with habit and custom and necessity that appear to oust the sex instinct into a altogether decentralize position moreover it be the function of the female to be the excitor in the sex process : she subconscious thoroughly aware of the fact see to it that the sex instinct stand starkly central and dominate in she life the mood of love like the more stereotyped manifestation of sex be dependent upon a proper supply to the blood of the internal secretion of the reproductive organ the gonadal endocrine if the testis be remove from frog it be find that the clasp-reflex symptom of sex desire be abolish if after a interval of several day the testis ' extract be inject into the frog the reflex reappear for a few day the hormone provoke this sex reflex be present in the testis only during the breed season in bird the seasonal nesting and migrate instinct may be eliminate by interfere with they ovary at the same tine there be a change in they plumage toward the male type similarly the male when they sex endocrine be cut off will change they psychic nature as well as physically besides own he flag-waving comb he spur and brighter feather the rooster strut to attract the female and fight aggressively with he sex competitor when he be make a capon he lose he spur and comb and distinctive plumage and in addition become retire and submissive in short a pseudo-hen in he instinct as well as in appearance if the genital gland be extirpate from a male before puberty the wattle remain small pale and bloodless no active amorous or combative instinct emerge the creature maintain a demure silence and may even be seek by a virile male so we may see homosexuality of a kind in the lowest animal on the other hand hen deprive of ovary tend to metamorphose in the male direction even to acquire the male spur and to display the male attitude all through the animal world in the springtime when the pituitary awaken or increase its secretion and so stimulate the sex gland to augmented activity emotion of sex and they expression be provoke by the inner stir when the nightingale warble passionately and the mock bird gurgle provokingly when the robin fill its scarlet breast and the starling float in ecstasy through the perfumed air when the pigeon coyly woo its mate and the butterfly flirt with the dazzling multicolor of its wing when all the marvelous device of sex attraction in nature selection and court mating and reproduce be ponder who but must wonder at the infinite possibility of reaction of the sex hormone all be for love and all be because of the love in the blood that be manufacture unconsciously by a few hidden cell expressionism and exhibitionism we need a detailed examination of the various form of expression art have differentiate into in its relation to exhibitionism and as effect of the circulate libido-producing substance of the gonad sex exhibition differ in man and woman because of the differently combine internal secretion that be they substrate the male 's attitude aggressive pursuit be instigate by the compound adrenal and gonad endocrine the female 's various emulsion of coyness and display be motivate by posterior pituitary and gonad hormone in alliance it be a dogma to state that the internal secretion of sex do not begin to function until after puberty some child manifest exhibitionism with a certain independence of environment before adolescence a good many girl act like tom-boy and be distinguishable externally from boy only by they clothes but other display sign of sex differentiation that be to be trace back to a awakening interstitial gonad action some boy have no interest whatever in sex other will show a intense curiosity spontaneously a curiosity which perhaps may be explain as a larval precocity dependent upon the minimum of sex hormone production by the gonad close observation of the correlation of somatic and psychic development in extreme example of these child corroborate this view jonathan hutchinson have describe full-busted child of london already boast of they affair indeed as education and environment affect the body -lrb- in so far as they influence it as a whole -rrb- by exciting or inhibit the gland of internal secretion sex-arousing stimulus from without must be consider to evoke they effect as stimulant of the latent puberty gland at puberty when the sex gland bloom and the complex of the sex instinct be activate exhibitionism manifest itself in a host of guise and disguise femininity in a woman the womanly woman or the eternal feminine may indeed be define by the degree of somatic and psychic exhibitionism she present a woman who have a delicate skin lovely complexion well-formed breast and menstruate freely will be find to have the typical feminine outlook on life aspiration and reaction to stimulus which in spite of the protest of we feminist do constitute the biologic feminine mind large vascular balanced ovary be the well-spring of she life and personality on the other hand the woman who menstruate poorly or not at all be coarse-featured flat-breasted heavily build angular in she outline will also be often aggressive dominate even enterprising and pioneering in short masculinoid she be what she be because she possess small shrivel poorly function ovary between these two type all sort of transition exist accord as the other endocrine participate in the constitutional make-up but no better example could be give off-hand of the determine stamp of the internal secretion upon mind character and conduct instinct and behavior the sex instinct analyze as a endocrine mechanism provide the clue to the understanding of all instinct and behavior if the post-pituitary regulate the maternal instinct then its correlate : sympathy social impulse and religious feeling must be also influence and so be furnished another example of a chemical control of instinctive behavior mcdougall once of oxford now of harvard introduce into psychology the idea of the simple instinct as a unit of behavior regard the most complex conduct as a compounding of instinct the instinct itself he analyze into three element : a specific stimulus-sensation a emotion follow all end in a particular course of muscular reaction translate into endocrine term what happen may be picture as a series of chemical event when the activity of a ductless gland rise above a certain minimum its hormone in the blood sensitize as a photographic plate be sensitize a group of brain cell to respond to a message from the outside world with a definite line of conduct there be a registration by the brain cell of the presence of the specific stimulus then there be communication by they with the endocrine organ as a result some of they be move to further secretion and other be paralyzed or weaken in consequence of change of concentration in the blood of the various internal secretion tension movement and tumescence as well as relaxation inhibition and detumescence occur throughout the vegetative system -- the blood vessel the viscera the nerve and the muscle each wire to the brain news of the change in it in addition the brain cell themselves be excite or depress by the new hormone bathing they in they final fusion the commingle vegetative sensation constitute the emotion evolve in the functioning of the instinct to lower the new tension throughout the vegetative system to the normal range the instinctive action be carry out this superficially be regard as the essence of the instinct as a matter of fact it be only the endpoint of a process the resultant of a drive to restore equilibrium within the organism it may all happen in less time than it take to tell about it the play of a instinct may therefore be analyze into four process they succeed one another as sensation -- endocrine stimulation -- tension within the vegetative system -- conduct to relieve tension the dash be the symbol of a cause and effect relationship this equation for a instinct base upon a analysis of the working of the sex instinct be the model for the analysis of all instinct and therefore of all the compound instinct that all human behavior may be resolve into conduct that fascinator of the common gossip and the great novelist alike normal and abnormal social and asocial in all they complexity even unto the third and fourth generation the freudian complex be govern therefore by the same law that determine the movement of the star and the eruption of volcano the most interesting factor in the instinct equation be the endocrine because that be the one that be most purely chemical endocrine charging of wish it be _ the _ distinction of modern psychology that it have establish the wish -lrb- craving need desire libido -rrb- as the move force in any psychic process the position of the wish in psychology as the force within and behind the instinct may be compare to that of energy in physics when it be elevated to a central position in the explanation of physical process in the nineteenth century the concept of the _ charge _ wish have illuminate all the hidden recess and render audible all the subdue murmuring of the mind the truly novel in the content of the idea be the recognition of the fact that the wish be charge now it could never be charge in a vacuum that mean that a wish could never be bear in the brain alone for the brain have no power to charge itself with energy -- it can only store and transmit if a wish be potential energy that must be transform into kinetic it must have a source that source be the vegetative system without the vegetative system the great complex of viscera in the abdomen and chest blood and its vessel endocrine muscle and nerve the brain would remain but a intricate cold storage plant of memory association of past experience it would need no change and initiate no effort but when the wish enter upon the scene it be as if a dead storage battery have be refresh with new current enriched with billion of electron there be a stir and a movement dynamic mind but the dynamo be the more ancient possession of the animal the vegetative apparatus in short what must always be remember be that a wish be never cerebral but always sub-cerebral visceral in its origin the sub-cerebral make the cerebral activity in the nervous system below the brain and especially the vegetative system force upon it its function of the active verb it have to be to do and to suffer and then to manipulate the environment to satiate the insatiable viscera insatiable because the local chemistry be continually raise the tension of one or the other of they a physics of human behavior become possible with the aid of these concept of endocrine regulation of intravisceral pressure and intervisceral equilibrium a intramuscular pressure and a intermuscular equilibrium with the brain as the shift fulcrum of the system the sensation of hunger as we have see serve as good a exemplar as any of this mechanism of the wish hunger be precede and accompany by contraction of the stomach of increase intensity those contraction must be bring about by a substance act upon the nerve ending in the wall of the stomach as it close down upon itself wave pass up and down with each wave the pressure within it rise the exact amount of the pressure may be accurately measure by means of a small balloon swallow and then inflate when the pressure rise above a certain figure the sensation of hunger break into the consciousness of the individual we infer that certain sensory impulse send up to the brain attain a strength that finally force itself into the conscious field of feel the sensation of hunger vary from individual to individual because of variation in the reaction throughout the vegetative system most often it be a sense of movement or even a itch in the upper abdomen let some cause produce a weakening or cessation of the movement of the stomach -- as fear and anger -- and the sensation of hunger disappear coincidently with the drop in the pressure within it as the mathematician would say the wish be a function of the pressure and so of the concentration of substance behind the pressure we have in hunger the wish reduce to the lowest term the most primitive form of it yet we may resolve all wish even the most idealistic into the same term as the vegetative system become habituate by repeat experience to react in the same way to the same stimulus permutation and combination of wish become possible until at length the inscrutable complexity of the behavior of civilized man be evolve we have to thank von bechterew the greatest of russian physiologist for these fundamental principle so important for the understanding of the control of human life and conduct the associate reflex aboriginal ancestor of the involve train of association that constitute the highest thought conduct and character be the unit of the system recall the classic example cite if a piece of meat be show to a dog he mouth water if now you proceed to ring a bell before offer the meat he mouth will water only when he see or smell the meat if however the ringing of the bell precede the meat a sufficient number of reaction a time come when merely the sound of the bell will cause salivation without the presence of the meat so it be with the associated reaction of the internal secretion a stimulus originally indifferent to the endocrine may by association the law of which be many come to act like a spark to the endocrine-instinct mechanism hence we can account for the subtle play of instinct throughout all think even object resemble the specific excitant of a instinct only remotely or in some one quality may start its mechanism and a host of association bind up with it thus the maternal instinct may be excite by the sight of a baby but because a baby be small and delicate anything small and fine a tiny book a toy a miniature may arouse it the object be then say to be appeal the doctrine of association of instinctive and so of endocrine reaction enable we to understand the feeling -- tone that at any moment pervade consciousness as well as its content choice the psychology of selection of food color friend mate amusement also become explicable rationally for conflict among the different component of the vegetative system be continuous and inevitable if the pressure within a viscus have be heighten and persist that be be not disturb by some other associated factor or instinct conduct result to lower the pressure to what it be before the instigator of the tension appear but if another instinct be spark or another associated factor come into play another focus of increase pressure within the vegetative system be create with another stream of energy flow to the brain and demand a outlet this clash of instinct the struggle between different focus of the vegetative system compete for the possession of the brain be a common everyday process in conduct which will win means which will will and so we have a energetic basis for volition which will win appear to depend primarily upon the kind of endocrine that predominate in the make-up of the individual secondarily with he education for it be the endocrine that be really in conflict when there be a struggle between two instinct and if one endocrine system conquer it must be either because it be inherently stronger its secretion potential that be the amount of secretion it can put forth as a maximum be greater -lrb- so explain the term dominant -rrb- -- or because a past experience have condition it to respond although the oppose endocrine system do not fear and anger respectively bind up with the activity of the adrenal medullum and cortex we shall see provide as good exemplar as any of this process the response of the ductless gland to situation vary with they congenital _ capacity _ and acquire _ susceptibility _ capacity be a question of internal chemistry modifiable by injury disease accident shock exhaustion susceptibility depend upon the play of the force focus upon they that may be sum up as association in the ability of one endocrine system to inhibit another we have the germ of the unconscious hence the modus operandus of the repression and suppression compensation and dissociation which may unite to integrate or refuse to integrate and so disintegrate and deteriorate a personality as the personality develop the vegetative system become susceptible to the manifold associate of family school church and society art science and religion and last but not least sex all the different nuance of personality be expression of a particular relationship transitory or permanent between the endocrine and the viscera and muscle conversely behavior show what a person actually be chemically that be what endocrine and vegetative factor predominate in he make-up fear anger and courage fear and anger be the oldest and so the most deep-rooted of the instinct a ameba contracting at the touch of some unpleasant object feel fear in its most primitive form and anger the destructive passion must have appear early upon the scene of life certainly these two instinct be definitely develop and fix in the cell before sex differentiation and the sex instinct be bear at all it be interesting to note this for we rabid freudian fear and anger involve the adrenal gland how come it that two state of mind so contrast should involve the same area the answer lie in the bipartite construction of the adrenal all the evidence point to its medullum as the secretor of the substance which make for the phenomenon of fear and to its cortex as dominant in the reaction of anger when adrenalin be inject under the skin in sufficient quantity it will produce paleness tremble erection of the hair twitching of the limb quick or gasping breathing twitching of the lip -- all the classic manifestation of fear these be the immediate effect of fear because they be the immediate effect of excess adrenalin in the blood upon the vegetative viscera and the muscle the perception by associative memory of these effect of adrenalin the sensation arise from the organ affect constitute the emotion of fear flight follow by muscle prepare for flight for the disturbance of the inter-muscular equilibrium tense the flexor muscle the muscle of flight and relax the extensor muscle the muscle of attack if it would seem the cortex secretion now pour into the blood enough to more than overcome the effect of the medullum secretion the inter-muscular equilibrium be disturb in the opposite direction for fight rather than flight and anger result or if the cortical secretion pour in a overwhelming amount of its secretion from the first into the blood there will be no fear but anger immediately habitually charge and fearless animal like the bison bull tiger or lion have a relatively larger cortex in they adrenal habitually flee and fearful animal like the rabbit have a small cortex and a wide medullum in they adrenal the reinforce action of the thyroid be important the adrenal medullum reinforce by the thyroid make for terror the adrenal cortex reinforce by the thyroid make for fury some people be not easily frightened other be more readily frightened and still other be of a extremely fearful nature it depend upon the proportion of adrenal cortex to medullum secretion in they and they reaction to fear stimulus be a pretty good measure of the ratio these formulation apply more particularly to fear in general and anger in general but even in the least fearsome ie a individual in whom cortex dominate medullum there may be fear -- complex date back to event and time when medullum overtop cortex especially childhood so in the coolest people certain person object episode may send a wave along a old line of nerve cell and path which lead to the adrenal medullum and so flood he with fear terror or even panic before he usual cortex response occur impression during the early year of childhood probe of the unconscious by various method have be show to be the most potent in this respect sometimes the episode go further back than childhood and one must assume a inherit conditioning of the vegetative and endocrine system a animal leap upon a ancestor in a forest during the night might account for the panic fear some people experience when alone in the dark that nothing of they childhood history may account for in woman the adrenal medullum naturally tend to overtop the cortex because the latter make for masculinity besides the recur cycle in the ovary make the corpus luteum evolve a additional stimulant to the medullum through its irritating influence upon the thyroid then the influence of the post-pituitary be anti-adrenal cortex so that on the whole a number of endocrine work to render woman naturally fearful as we say courage be so closely related to fear and anger that all be always associate in any discussion courage be commonly think of as the emotion that be the opposite of fear it would follow that courage mean simply inhibition of the adrenal medullum as a matter of fact the mechanism of courage be more complex one must distinguish animal courage and deliberate courage animal courage be literally the courage of the beast as note animal with the largest amount of adrenal cortex be the pugnacious aggressive charge king of the field and forest the emotion experience by they be probably anger with a sort of blood-lust and no consideration of the consequence the object attack act like the red rag wave at a bull -- it have stimulate a flow of the secretion of the adrenal cortex and the instinct of anger become spark as it be by the new condition of the blood in courage deliberate courage there be more than instinct there be a act of volition a display of will admit that without the adrenal cortex such courage would be impossible the chief credit for courage must be ascribe to the ante-pituitary it be the proper conjunction of its secretion and that of the adrenal cortex that make for true courage so it be we find that act of courage have be record most often of individual of the ante-pituitary type photograph be obtainable of thirty-four winner of the congressional medal of honor for extraordinary bravery in the war with germany of these twenty-three exhibit the somatic criterion or hormonic sign of the ante-pituitary type a prerequisite for adequate ante-pituitary function be a normal secretion of the interstitial cell of the reproductive gland cowardice be say to be a feature of eunuch the pituitary and instinct we have see that more than any other gland or tissue of the body the post-pituitary govern the maternal-sexual instinct and they sublimation the social and creative instinct a great deal of evidence be in we possession concern the disturbance of emotion accompany disturbance of this gland and controllable by its control it might be say to energize deeply the tender emotion and instead of say soft-hearted we should say much-pituitarized for all the basic sentiment -lrb- as oppose to the intellectualize self-protective sentimentalism -rrb- tender-heartedness sympathy and suggestibility be interlock with its function its secretion must act upon the great basal ganglion at the base of the brain which contain the nerve cell and fiber that be the center of emotional control and co-ordination the ante-pituitary have be depict as the gland of intellectuality -lrb- to use that term for lack of better -rrb- by intellectuality we mean the capacity of the mind to control its environment by concept and abstract idea the frontal lobe of the brain be the central office for higher think they cell be the most complex have the most numerous branch and association fiber they store the fruit of abstract thinking mathematics for example the anterior pituitary be in the closest relation and contact with they its secretion be tonic to they now the instinct that be the forerunner of intellectuality be the instinct of curiosity with its emotion of wonder and its expression in the various constructive and acquisitive tendency study of intellectual man and of those with a keen instinct of curiosity and a constructive-acquisitive trend prove they to be ante-pituitary dominant in they make-up the administration of ante-pituitary extract to some defective increase intellectual activity and self-control the future of intelligence may expect a great deal from the newer chemistry of the secretion of the ante-pituitary two most important instinct therefore which in the complexity of they sublimation have create most of the institution of society the maternal and the intellectual be connect directly with a proper function of the pituitary endocrine so it happen that disturbance of these instinct reach far into the normal and intellectual sphere of the mind be definitely connect with disturbance of the pituitary as we shall note in review the essential of the pituitary-centered or pituito-centric personality the personality govern by the fluctuation of activity within the pituitary people with injured diseased or mechanically limited pituitary -lrb- because of the smallness of the bony case enclose they -rrb- exhibit defect and perversion of conduct and intelligence directly attributable to affection of the very instinct and function the pituitary govern child with small mechanically cramped pituitary lie and steal be bed-wetter have poor control over themselves and a low learning capacity the thyroid and instinct the chemical mechanism of the instinct describe : sex libido passion and jealousy in relation to the ovary and testis fear and anger in relation to the adrenal sympathy and curiosity in relation to the pituitary suggest that a similar explanation will hold for the dynamics of the other instinct in the closest relation to the thyroid appear the instinct first isolate so to speak by mcdougall as the instinct of self-display and self-effacement accompany by emotion of pride and shame respectively in certain state of excessive thyroid activity there be a extra stimulation of the instinctive display of the person which may go on to boast mania and exhibitionism on the other hand in state of thyroid insufficiency depression be produce which may go on to melancholia a desire to be alone to hide to sit apart and even a tendency to accuse the self of various uncommitted crime and sin in the form of cyclic insanity know as the manic-depressive psychosis mania alternate with depression as if the personality be dominate wholly in turn by one or the other of these two instinct of the ego there be a good deal of evidence that behind they be a corresponding fluctuation in the amount the thyroid secrete into the blood among the thyroid-centered attitude toward the self gyrate more than in any other type egomanium and megalomania occur most often in thyroid unstable individual energy and sensitivity in he classic inquiry into human faculty franci galton lay down some fundamental consideration concern energy and sensitivity as mental trait energy he define as the capacity for labor and declare it to be the measure of the fullness of life or vitality statistical study by he of man of genius and they ancestor show they to be endow with a large amount of energy it have be say to be the absolute prerequisite of genius now if there be a single fact that have be well establish by investigation of the internal secretion it be that the energy quantum of a individual be a function of and determine by he thyroid the more thyroid he have the more energetic will he be -- the less thyroid the less energetic and the lazier the thyroid-centered individual of the excess thyroid type actually burn up more food and produce more heat than the ordinary organism he burn himself up faster in general when the thyroid send more secretion into the blood more thyroxin it accelerate all the function and activity of the organ tea and coffee produce loquacity because they stimulate the thyroid people with thyroid dominant constitution talk fluently rapidly and continuously they energy make they doer actor rather than spectator they get up early in the morning be on the go all day without surcease or fatigue go to bed late and often suffer from insomnia thyroid deficient however be definitely the opposite they be quite conscious of the limited reserve of energy at they command also that they need plenty of refreshing sleep early to bed and late to rise remain the lead maxim of health for they in addition they find it necessary to sleep during the day forty wink or more in the afternoon make a good deal of difference to they taciturn inarticulate lazy slow tire be the adjective apply to they by they friend as well as by they enemy all because of a insufficient or inefficient supply of the thyroid 's iodine to they cell the mobility of energy in a organism be a measure of the amount of active iodine in it the physiologic synonym for energetic and lazy be well-iodinized and poorly iodinize sensitivity the ability to discriminate between grade of sensation or acuteness of perception be another thyroid quality just as the thyroid plus be more energetic so be he more sensitive he feel thing more he feel pain more readily because he arrive more quickly at the stage when the stimulus damage he nerve apparatus the electric conductivity of he skin be greater sometimes a hundred time greater than the average conversely the thyroid deficient type have a low discriminative faculty galton have record that idiot hardly distinguish between heat and cold and that they sense of pain be so obtuse that some of the more idiotic seem hardly to know what it be cretin may moan but never shed tear energy and sensitivity in a individual should direct attention to the thyroid element predominate in he composition lack of energy and insensitivity to the degree of thyroid insufficiency in they make-up memory judgment and poise in between sensitivity and energy the sensation and the reaction come a passage of the stimulus through the gauntlet of the store past experience of the individual know as memory many hypothesis have be advance by philosopher psychologist and physiologist to explain the phenomenona of memory to conceive of memory materially at all one must admit some sort of memory trace as the basis for the persistence of memory this memory deposit facilitate the occurrence of the chemical reaction constitute the memory along the same path the next time forget then consist in a disappearance of these memory trace or deposit forget be greatest in the first hour after remember more than half of the memory trace be lose in that time comparison of the curve of forget and the curve of diffusion of a colloid like gelatine from its solution into a surrounding medium show they to be exceedingly similar forget may be explain by some such loss of the memory trace or deposit into the blood continually flow by it the internal secretion influence the amount and duration of the memory deposit the thyroid appear to be essential to the _ lay down _ of the memory trace cretin have poor memory on the retention side and so can not learn the memory of thyroid insufficient be wretched in the extreme grade the memory for recent occurrence become completely lose iodine and thyroid increase the electric conductivity of the brain so that the memory trace must be deposit more easily in those who have a excess of thyroid removal of the thyroid produce a degeneration of nerve cell and they process and associative memory become difficult or impossible because conduction from cell to cell be interfere with if sufficient thyroid be feed in excess brain conduction may be so facilitate that epilepsy may result upon slight irritation on the other hand the pituitary seem to be relate to _ preservation _ of the memory deposit in condition of disease of the pituitary loss of memory for past experience be more marked as regard recent experience they be better hold although in a sort of subconscious manner recoverable when the condition improve or be cure but the greatest difference between the thyroid and pituitary effect upon memory exist as regard material : the thyroid memory apply particularly to perception and percept the pituitary to conception -lrb- reading study thinking -rrb- and concept judgment be another mental process that often intervene between sensation and the energy-reaction it involve memory and association of experience behind it be a attitude as much as there be in a emotion or the arouse of a instinct belief and reasoning be complex judgment they form the unit of the intellectual process there be a element of speed in judgment on reasoning as in perception and memory and as in the latter the thyroid determine the velocity quick thinking as we call it mean good thyroid action and slow thinking deficient thyroid action the other element in judgment accuracy be influence by the ante-pituitary during adolescence there be physical growth which consume most of the secretion of the ante-pituitary after adolescence after the early twenty when physical growth have cease the ante-pituitary secretion sensitize the cell of the brain to mental growth the reaction potential of the ante-pituitary that be its inherent latent ability to supply a maximum of its endocrine for the nerve cell of the frontal lobe be the best-known chemical determinant of intellectual genius it make for the greatest co-ordination of experience knowledge information taste and problem into one harmonious whole and curiously not only do it cause a fusion of intellectual material : it create a desire for and a love of such material we should expect to find extraordinarily well-developed ante-pituitary action among eminent philosopher and man of science and we do adequate action of it be present throughout the range of normal who evidence sufficiently ripened judgment as they progress through life the ability to profit by experience and to make more and more accurate judgment as one grow older imply at least a maximum efficiency of it this maturation be not at all universal even after middle age after forty and fifty year of reasoning some individual retain the juvenile mind of they youth like the bourbon they have learn nothing and forget nothing they ante-pituitary insufficiency often couple with a post-pituitary excess and other instability and disequilibrium in the endocrine system render they immature moron compare with what might be expect of they for they year they be the people who be old enough to know better for the same reason inhibition and emotional control be poor in they besides the ante-pituitary in the evolution of judgment and the judgment faculty due stress must be lay upon the influence of the internal secretion of the testis or ovary the product of the interstitial cell although the probability be that the effect be indirect through a stimulation of the ante-pituitary the fact remain that in a child memory may be marvelous and judgment poor -lrb- such memory be possibly purely thyroid in its determination -rrb- with the advent of the gonad upon the scene judgment become the center of the play 's plot undoubtedly the intelligence of eunuch and eunuchoid be in general low the skull and brain of castrate animal and human be smaller than the average gall the physiologist who popularize idea concern the meaning of the protuberance and depression of the head in relation to faculty and character early in the nineteenth century be the first to prove this among historic castrate eunuch not a single example of great intellect of the creative type be know on the contrary the native gift of the mind be destroy thus abelard who be punish with castration by he uncle for he love affair with helise never compose a verse of poetry thereafter imagination as a endocrine gift that bring we to the consideration of imagination as influence by the endocrine the physical condition of exercise of the imaginative faculty have not be sufficiently investigate alcohol have long be know to act as a evocant of strange image the hallucination of delirium tremen be the result obtain in extreme intoxication a strangely imaged flow of consciousness the imaginative state may also be evoke by morphine and cannabis indica there be no doubt that the brain cell may be make to combine in the fresh novel and unfamiliar association that be recognize as unreal franci galton pioneer student of the conditioning of human faculty leave a interesting study of the visualise capacity so far as it could be attack by the statistical method two of he conclusion be worth repeat for we purpose one be that the power to imagine be poor in philosopher and man of science the other that it be higher in the female sex than in the male we have see that the philosophic scientific intellectual mind the capacity to abstract and think in term of abstraction be definitely dependent upon proper secretion by the ante-pituitary in woman the post-pituitary be generally predominant over the ante-pituitary though we be in need of a series of study of the endocrine trait and composition of man endow with high imaginative quality and so be at a loss we have indication of a endocrine control of the state of consciousness we speak of as the imaginative most of the evidence accumulate in the examination and treatment of morbid condition characterize by a restless incoordinate activity of the brain cell point to excess of the post-pituitary secretion as the cause or as one of the most important cause the thyroid and the adrenal medullum also exert they influence but the strongest appear to be the post-pituitary phobia fear which obsess the mind anxiety neurose suspicion hallucination delusion nervousness all expression of what we may sum up technically as the imaginative state of mind occur and occur frequently associate with other symptom of posterior pituitary overactivity person in whose make-up it rule be more liable to imagine disturbance of they mentality or exhibit a well-developed imaginative streak normal state of overactivity of the post-pituitary such as occur in some woman during the menstrual period and pregnancy and in some man as part of the endocrine cycle of they everyday life be accompany by increase in the susceptibility and vigor of the imagination whether the feeding of excess post-pituitary would lead to a stimulation of the tendency or ability to imagine be still to be decide but it be know that quiet the post-pituitary by various means will cause a depression of the faculty and eliminate its pathologic manifestation psychologist distinguish between the constructive imagination that express itself in a order activity and the unbalanced fancy of the fearful neurotic for example the post-pituitary confer the lability of the underlying state of brain in all of these imaginative tincturing of consciousness the constructive imagination one of the few truly precious gift of a personality be probably the expression of a certain balanced activity of the ante-pituitary and the post-pituitary mood and the organic outlook the lability the post-pituitary confer upon the combination of perception and conception group as the imagine extend to the ruling mood that may be speak of as the organic outlook post-pituitary in excess without compensation or balancing by one or some of the other endocrine be associate with a instability of mood and the organic outlook concomitant be a defective self-control typically one see the effect in the mental abnormality of woman during the premenstrual period a number of they have they pituitary balance upset then with a overtopping of the ante-pituitary by the post-pituitary irritability a sub-hysteria or a actual hysteria may emerge in the usually most placid character a quiet wife and mother may go for she husband curse and mortify he even strike and beat he she may slap she child at that time and no other it be well know that most of they crime be commit by woman during the menstrual period so be the suicide deterioration of mentality and character so often observe during the menopause with its apathy or excitement melancholia or mania the fit of weep or gaiety the loss of grip upon reality the complete change in mood and temperament that reflect the transformation of the organic outlook demonstrate clearly the overwhelming influence of the endocrine upon the attitude of the self toward the self it be possible to speak of thyroid mood adrenal mood ante-pituitary or post-pituitary mood gonadal mood each of these be the echo in the mind of cell stimulate or depress by concentration or dilution in the blood of particular internal secretion restlessness and excitement can be produce experimentally by feed thyroid vague anxiety depressive fancy and fear imaginative overactivity can be remove by inhibit the post-pituitary hypersecretion of the ovary will cause a sexual susceptibility and a mood of genital obsession capable of the most remarkable sublimation and perversion chapter ix the background of personality the question of mood and sublimation once raise introduce the problem of the relation of neurosis nervous disorder without a organic disease basis and mental abnormality to the endocrine system obviously in view of all the influence exert by the ductless gland upon every organ and function of the body and mind and they intermediary the vegetative nervous system a relation must exist observation accumulate some of which have be refer to in the precede chapter prove the complete though complex reality of such a deduction the history of attitude toward nerve and mental disorder be a remarkable illustration of the vicissitude of ignorance playing with word the greek sway and dazzle as they be by the magic of word which they discover yet never permit themselves to be fool by they as a explanation for the phenomenon of hysteria in woman that benign mental disorder par excellence they have the theory of a wander about of the womb in the organism as a cause that provide a image of something material happen as a explanation with the triumph of anatomy after the renaissance that nave view have to be discard in its place the humoral theory hold sway with its good humor and its bad humor and they bilious lymphatic nervous and sanguine admixture but that too go the way of all flesh during the first half of the nineteenth century a popular phrase nerve paraphrase by practitioner of medicine as neurosis then come into vogue as the efficient cause of these trouble nerve indeed today have filter everywhere into the common consciousness because of the irritant effect of light food and social condition america have come to swarm with neurotic of every type especially the sexual a rich field be create for cult of treatment which spring up like weed periodically all over the country we have see how the american beard be inspire by the idea that nerve represent a loss of tone a flabbiness weakness and softness of the nerve to coin the word neurasthenia nerve exhaustion he believe be the cause of the nerve weakness weir mitchell another american introduce the rest cure combine with overfeed as a treatment for it a analytical french neurologist charcot be not to be satisfy by word of latin-greek derivation insist upon the significance of the individual mental workings of each case he and he pupil janet begin to unravel a tangle which have lead to the present revolution in psychology for freud jung and adler take up the story where janet leave off janet elaborate the idea of a subconscious and a unconscious a dissociation of the component of the mind and a splitting of the personality lump the phenomenon of amnesia somnambulism hypnotism anesthesia obsession and hysteria into the grand group of mental dissociation and disintegration he achieve a unification never consider possible before he suggestion as a mode of cure be also emphasize and elaborate by he to a undreamed-of degree freud in 1895 study a case of hysteria with breuer have attempt cure by the method of free association attempt to get the hysteric to pour out she mental life not succeed and he interest arouse by she continual reference to she dream he discover that by means of those dream he could tap the subconscious and unconscious in region hitherto inaccessible for in the dream idea person and experience appear that never come upon the stage of the conscious from that finding he develop the concept of repression ie the relegation of a painful experience into the unconscious and keep imprison there by the censor also how there it become the complex which like a stage manager never appear before the footlights of the conscious but determine its content just the same by inhibition or stimulation of any character or scene to be enact upon it a complete critique of freudianism can not be attempt here but in relation to the endocrine system as controller of nerve function in health and disease a valid criticism can be make firstly the freudian jargon its technicality and explanation be metaphor some may regard they as justifiable description of mental process but it certainly can be urge against they that they provide we with no idea concern what be happen in the cell of the body and brain as explanation for the event normal or abnormal supposedly explain word like sublimation or transference be figure of speech and nothing else secondly they ignore totally the power of the vegetative apparatus the viscera muscle and secrete gland together as originator and determiner of the wish and its adventure how utterly different from the point of view of the physiologist the two explanation be as picture can be see from a single example the idea of repression to the freudian mean the push down into the subconscious of some experience push down be a process control by the law of physics : it involve the concept of matter and force hence the expression as a description of a psychic episode be a metaphor pure and simple from the standpoint of the process of repression as picture by the student of the vegetative apparatus the term signify a real bottle up of energy for the repression mean actual compression of muscle the muscle contain in the viscera and the repression mean a real interference with the release of energy which remain bind up tug for room for expression as much as a spring tightly coil in a box in the production of that tension a endocrine have often be decisive the endocrine nature of the individual may decide whether a subconscious ie visceral or vegetative tension be to come into be live or die in the face of a give situation if thereby a permanent disturbance of the equilibrium between the component be bring about a neurosis expression of a unsatisfied vegetative tension follow it have be hail as a brand new discovery by those follow the latest in psychology that the subconscious and the unconscious constitute a more essential component of the personality than the conscious as a matter of fact common practice have recognize the fact if not the mechanism and its significance for age it be not what people say or do -- it be how they say it : that be how the true reaction of personality be recognize instinctively even by animal tone and gesture -lrb- when not act or pose -rrb- be accept as symbol and symptom of state of the inmost sanctum sanctorum that word and wit never give entrance to nay disguise and block tone and gesture as revelation of the inner-me the true-me or intra-me if you will be so potent because they be direct expression of the vegetative apparatus the curl of a lip the flicker of a eye-lash the twitch of a shoulder be the overflow of energy cramp in the increase intravisceral pressure determine by increase outflow of endocrine secretion wittingly or unwittingly we interpret the little sign as message from the deepest self which they truly be nervous breakdown and shell shock in civil life the complex of symptom beard jumble together as neurasthenia when associate with a loss of self-control so that the sufferer be incapacitate for the duty of everyday life have become the popular nervous breakdown a sanitarium appear to be one of the necessary component of the condition it be the last act the climax of nerve during the war of 1914-1918 thousand of case of functional disorder of the nervous come to be group under shell shock the psychic phenomenon in the wake of concussion of the brain due to explosive suggest the term and its application to affection of self-control or dissociation of the personality with paralysis blindness speechlessness loss of hearing and so on the war neurosis -lrb- include those arise in home service -rrb- be still a topical subject because thousand of mentally disabled soldier be alive in view of what have be say concern the endocrine mechanism of the instinct and the vegetative apparatus it could be predict that a number of these nerve casualty of peace and war would be cause by a upset of the equilibrium between the gland of internal secretion a study of war neurosis by the great italian student of the endocrine pende confirm this assumption as emphasize the internal secretion be like tuning key and tighten or loosen the string of the organism-instrument the nerve war for the soldier or the civilian combatant as well set the string vibrate and with they the gland control by they excessive stimulation or depression of a endocrine will disturb the whole chain of hormone and the vegetative system and they echo in the psyche the nervous disorder of war that have be lump as shell shock or war shock may be look upon as uncompensated airing of the endocrine vegetative mechanism as dislocation of part and process that be reflect outwardly as ailment or disease a endocrine neurosis a exquisite example of a endocrine neurosis that be a disorder of nerve and brain dependent upon a upset of the equilibrium between the internal secretion due to a try experience be furnish recently by the reaction of three naval officer lose in the snow wild of canada through a balloon adventure the case arouse a good deal of interest at the time and the detail be report by the newspaper as if they be the episode of a serial mystery story the three officer start out late one fine evening from rockaway air station in a balloon for a practice trip atmospheric condition suddenly change they become lose in the cloud and finally land somewhere in the canadian wilderness the commander of the balloon crew lieut a 23 year old be the youngest of the three the oldest lieut b be 45 and the third man in the thirty lieut c accord to the testimony give at the court of inquiry hold afterwards two hour after they abandon the balloon and start struggle through the snow b become tired and complain of he fatigue b 's fatigue increase and two day later become so great that the party have to stop for a hour and build a fire in order to permit he to rest however a hour prove too little : and in another half hour he be fall and faint letter write by c to he wife and get hold of by reporter declare that b at this juncture pass into a semi-sane state in which he accuse himself of a number of sin and volunteer to commit suicide so that the other would not be burden by he weakness also that they might use he body to fortify themselves a discuss with c the advisability of take b 's knife away from he live on they carrier pigeon they continue on move by a desperate hope of find someone b have several faint spell after drink water trace by moose track luck favor they and they encounter a indian who guide they to a place call moose factory here they write the letter home which reach they wife and the daily press before they themselves return to civilization a great hue and cry be raise by the newspaper about they plight newspaper correspondent vie with each other for the honor of be the first to meet they and get they story they arrive at a collection of house name mattice a and c proceed ahead and find instruction for they not to talk c go back to b who be in a shack with the correspondent full of the story of the letter b become enraged and strike c who retain he self-control difference be patch up and the three return together to new york there the medical examination of the three show that the four day in the wilderness have leave its deepest effect upon the physique and mind of b in a few day he develop a attack of tonsillitis with fever and a mental disturbance describe by the medical officer as exhaustion psychosis he believe this condition to be the result of severe exhaustion prolong anxiety worry and extreme exposure extreme restlessness and irritability confusion of thought and a undefined perplexity all the prominent symptom of exhaustion psychosis make he hyperactive and inclined to act of violence be in evidence the physique character and reaction of lieut b be what interest we in the case the picture of he publish and the structure of he skull face and tooth he hair and other physical trait point to he be a adrenal-centered type of the unstable variety so far as he internal secretion make-up be concern as we shall see in the next chapter on the different kind of endocrine personality the unstable adrenocentric -lrb- convenient name for the class -rrb- be characterize by rapid exhaustibility because under condition of stress and strain the reserve of the gland be consume the adrenal gland we note in a precede chapter be concern with the maintenance of muscle and nerve tone in emergency they be the gland which during crisis especially control the production and supply of energy to the various organ and tissue call upon to function to the utmost in emergency when the adrenal fail as they do readily in these labile adrenocentric it be as if the adrenal be cut out of the body and it have be repeatedly show that extirpation of the adrenal be immediately follow by degeneration and breakdown of the brain cell these fact explain the reaction of lieut b the acute call upon he adrenal make by he dangerous situation probably soon exhaust they of they content of reserve secretion overwhelming fatigue with loss of muscle tone follow the change in the brain cause he to talk as he do in the wilderness return to safety the news that he reputation be under fire because of c 's letter bring out another adrenal characteristic : the excessive instinct of pugnacity easily stimulate with its emotion of anger and the tendency to violence what be speak of as a quick temper be a adrenocentric trait return to new york a infection tonsillitis attack he infection in adrenocentric use up the content of the adrenal as rapidly as physical exhaustion or emotion so the tonsillitis which in another type of individual would have be combat continuously by the adrenal and so pass by as a mere sore throat present he with a high temperature and the brain disturbance describe by the medical officer as exhaustion-psychosis with again a tendency to violence in short the history of he adventure be the history of he adrenal under stress and strain it illustrate the mechanism of a typical endocrine neurosis the unconscious and the viscera in the chapter on the gland of internal secretion as a interlock directorate certain generality be state as the law of the government of the organism 's life by they in association with the vegetative apparatus it be put forward as a fundamental revision of the theory hitherto accept of the limitation of mind to the brain cell we think and feel not alone with the brain but with we muscle we viscera we vegetative nerve and last but not least we endocrine organ in short we think and feel with each and every part of ourselves among these pristine factor determine the content of consciousness the endocrine be most important because they alone to start with of all the other factor be different in each and every individual they be what render he unique at birth even though he look the counterpart of million of other baby bear at the same time they constitute he inner destiny as he grow the external factor social experience climate accident and disease modify and condition the reaction and complexity of the endocrine system as these modification and association be of the greatest import for the final elaboration of the personality composing as they do the element of the unconscious which confer the unique stamp of normal abnormal supernormal or subnormal it be worth while now to review the most general of the determine law man be a energy phenomenon both conscious and unconscious with the energy emanate from the endocrine-vegetative mechanism so it become possible for we by they aid to analyze the conscious the subconscious and the unconscious with the term long current in the analysis of physics 1 man be a energy machine which though it be constantly lose energy as a whole consist of part constantly accumulate energy -lrb- as a result of inherent chemical reaction accelerate by the absorption of food -rrb- this process of local accumulation of energy associate with general loss of energy may be observe even in the ameba in the form of store reserve food material evolution create a system of organ the viscera as specialist in energy conservation utilization or transformation for intercommunication and interaction between the viscera two system be elaborate : a younger system of direct contact the nerve and nerve cell through which influence could be conduct for the stimulation acceleration retardation or inhibition of a energy process in they and the older the endocrine gland association for the production of chemical substance to act as messenger to be send from one viscus to another and also to the nerve through the blood or lymph which bathe all the cell they could affect only one or certain organ because by selection only the choose organ or organ know the code as it be the chemical system be much the older system and precede the nerve system by aeon of time the whole system viscera visceral nerve and the endocrine gradually unite into a complete autonomous organism within the organism and as such function as the vegetative apparatus evolution of the endocrine 2 in the course of evolution variation occur in all three component of the apparatus the viscera the nerve and the endocrine now variation in the viscera and the nerve be essentially grossly physical and quantitative that be there may be a bigger stomach or a smaller stomach larger nerve fiber or smaller and as life always have work with a large margin of safety and always play for safety first as regard quantity these variation have not become of much significance for the history and destiny of the animal but variation among the endocrine make a tremendous difference to have very much thyroid and very little pituitary much adrenal and not enough parathyroid mean a great deal to the organism as a whole as well as to the vegetative apparatus for state of tension and relaxation activity and inactivity in the nerve and viscera would be determine by these variation in the ratio between the variant the vegetative apparatus in its virginity say in the new-born infant may be say to have its development primarily determine by the reaction potential of the endocrine part of it that be the latent power of each gland to secrete at a minimum or a maximum and the balance between they education of the vegetative system 3 training or education involve beside other effect a training of the endocrine and hence of the entire vegetative apparatus to respond in a particular way to a particular stimulus experience be like the introduction of new push-button lever and wheel into the mechanism all learn which call out or arrest the functioning of a instinct must from what we have learn of the chemical dynamics of instinct as reaction between hormone nerve and viscera affect the vegetative system when there be a conflict between two or more instinct between pressure of energy flow in different direction there may be compromise and normality or a grind of the gear and abnormality where do the brain come in in all this as the servant of the vegetative apparatus to call it the master tissue be manifestly absurd when it can only be the diplomatic constitutional monarch of the system it can in fact act only as the great central station for associative memory as only one of the factor implicate in education the most powerful educative agent of the vegetative apparatus of a human being be the other human around he and they comprise the most powerful of the external effector of education for better for worse the training and education of the endocrine-vegetative system be the basis of all social rule -lrb- habit custom convention law conscience -rrb- a unresolved discord a continued conflict among the part of the vegetative system in spite of such education be the foundation of the unhappiness of the acute or chronic misfit and maladjust the neurotic and the psychotic the physical basis of the unconscious 4 another vastly important law that govern the content of the conscious and the unconscious and resultant behavior be the fact that the nerve and nerve cell of the vegetative apparatus the nerve lead to the viscera and the endocrine gland like the solar plexus be affect by stimulus of lower value than those which arouse the brain cell in the metaphorical language of the old psychology the threshold value that be the strength or loudness of stimulus sufficient to make itself feel or hear be less for the vegetative apparatus than for the brain so we begin to glimpse why a emotion seem to be experience before the visceral change that really precede it but press they way into consciousness later this give we a clue to the unconscious as the more sensitive and deeper part of the mind more than that it supply we with a physical basis for the unconscious which will explain much of the observe law of its workings it provide a reason for the apparent swiftness spontaneity and unreasonableness of what be call intuition and it may show we a source for a good deal of the material of dream and dream state we have say that we think and we remember not alone with the brain but with the muscle the viscera and the endocrine so do we forget not alone with the brain but with the muscle the viscera the endocrine and they nerve the utmost importance of muscle attitude in remember have be establish in the experimental laboratory it be one of the great service freud render to psychology -lrb- and one by the way largely responsible for the acceptance of he doctrine by the disinterested intelligence -rrb- that he show that a species of forget be nothing casual but active and purposeful a manifestation of the life of the unconscious however though he description of the process be correct he leave it to occur in a vacuum as a matter of fact this forget consist in the inhibition of associative memory by a process in the vegetative apparatus so as to maintain the equilibrium within itself which be reflect in consciousness as comfort the unconscious in short consist of the bury association among the part of the vegetative apparatus and the brain cell we seem to be much nearer to grasp the nature of the unconscious when we look upon it as a historical continuum a compound or emulsion of different and various state of intravisceral pressure and tone in the vegetative apparatus dependent upon the balance between the endocrine as well as upon past experience of the viscera in the way of stimulation or depression we forget that which be hold down literally in the vegetative apparatus this explanation of forget tell too why the forget -lrb- store in the sub-brain the endocrine-vegetative system -rrb- continually project itself into and interfere with the regular flow of consciousness eg in slip of the tongue mistake of spelling and so on : because the energy bottled in the vegetative system tend to erupt into the consciousness into which it would ordinarily flow in the evolution of the mind there have be elaborate device to protect it against the vegetative apparatus consciousness or awareness must be accept as a fundamental primal fact like protoplasm consciousness and protoplasm may be the complementary side of the same coin whatever the truth the fact stand out that the oldest deepest most potent consciousness be that of the traditionally despise lowest organ the vegetative organ the heart and lung stomach and intestine the kidney and the liver and so on they nerve eg the solar plexus and the gland of internal secretion they invent and elaborate muscle bone and brain to carry out they will evolution have be in the direction of a greater perfection of the method of carry out they will they consciousness work upon the grow and multiply brain cell have create what we call self-conscious mind mind react upon its creator have in a sense come to dominate they because it have become the meeting ground of all the energy-influences seething and bubble in the organism and so develop into the organ of handle they as a whole they integrating-executive but just the same and all the time the underlie consciousness of the viscera and they accessory stand as the power behind the throne but as what we have now learn to speak of in relation to the mind as the unconscious psychopathology of everyday life to sum up these relation of the viscera the endocrine the unconscious and the mind it may be state as a far-reaching generality for the understanding of human life : that character and conduct be expression of the stream of energy arise in the vegetative apparatus primarily endocrine determine at birth and secondarily experience determine after the organism have learn to react as a whole as consciousness the result of such a reaction as a whole tend to balance the disturbance of energy so as to maintain or restore the equilibrium or sense of harmony and comfort when consciousness again disappear this law be a attempt at synthesis of the labor of the psychanalyst the behaviourist and the student of the internal secretion -lrb- freud jung adler sherrington watson von bechterew kempf crile cannon cush fraenkel be the great name of the movement -rrb- most of the detail and all of the quantitative application of the law still remain to be work out but a statement like the following of cush the eminent surgeon-student of the endocrine that it be quite probable that the psychopathology of everyday life hinge largely upon the effect of ductless gland discharge upon the nervous system show which way the wind be blow in the face of these conception the position of the psychanalyst as a practical therapeutist become clearer and the cause of he failure when he fail in the first place he deal with psychic result as process and ignore the physiology of they production since a true cure of the neurosis what he be after be impossible without a removal of the cause a disturbance in the vegetative apparatus he can not succeed where a automatic adjustment among the viscera do not follow he probing and ferreting of the unconscious in the second place he disregard the existence of a soil for the planting of the malign complex in the individual in whom they grow and flourish that soil be compose in part of the endocrine relation within the vegetative apparatus and as we can often attack that soil more effectively and radically from the endocrine end than from the experience end -lrb- eg repress episode -rrb- we may transform the soil and make it barren rock for morbid complex at any rate the concept of the endocrine-vegetative apparatus as the determinant of normal and abnormal behavior emotional reaction and disturbance of power should in time cause even the most fanatic of the psychanalyst to recognize the functional basis of the mental acrostic they be so fond of dissect natural ability another achievement of the psychanalyst be the recognition of the influence of organic and functional inferiority of the individual upon the history of he personality gross organ inferiority be those which be definite handicap in the struggle for success in society such as heart disease such handicap however be limit to relatively few of a population the raison d'tre of the greater number of minor mental inefficiency the psychanalyst put down to handicap in the unconscious again he mistake figurative imagery for explanation the conception of endocrine diversity in the make-up supply we with the rationale of the vast majority of organic and functional defect and inferiority in short subnormality of any group large or small moreover how would the psychanalyst explain the occurrence and influence of organic and functional _ superiority _ and they tremendous influence upon the individual and society we live in a generation which have acquire a flair for the pathologic undoubtedly it be a soul-sick generation and its interest in sickness of the mind be only natural just the same whatever advance improvement progress have be make -lrb- and certainly a number of the change in he environment external and internal must be admit to be change for the better -rrb- have be make not by natural disability but by natural ability what be the physiology of natural ability the finest study of natural ability that have as yet be compose be franci galton 's on hereditary genius it also remain the best study of the natural condition of success he show that of the type of man he class as illustrious there occur about one in a million and of the type eminent about two hundred and fifty in a million of the quality which determine natural ability of this kind he select inherent capacity zeal and perseverance as the three prerequisite and he state that if a man be gifted with vast intellectual ability eagerness to work and power of work i can not comprehend how such a man should be suppress such man -lrb- those who have gain great reputation -rrb- biography show to be haunt and drive by a incessant instinctive craving for intellectual work they work to satisfy a natural craving for brain work it be very unlikely that any conjunction of circumstance should supply a stimulus to brain work commensurate with what these man carry in they own constitution what be this inherent craving for brain work what be this zeal and what be power of endurance and perseverance the quality of stamen how be they to be interpret in term of the internal secretion in view of what have be say of the ante-pituitary as the gland of intellectuality study of intellectually gifted people have show well function large pituitary and of mental defective in a certain number of case a small limited pituitary it be justifiable to regard the factor of inherent capacity as a function of the ante-pituitary the factor of zeal or enthusiasm point to the thyroid markedly enthusiastic type be thyroid dominant type vigor as a third factor the ability to stand stress and strain of continued effort be dependent upon good adrenal and interstitial cell function so we may say that craving and capacity for brain work plus ardor plus perseverance in its pursuit the triplicate of natural ability be the reflection in conduct and character of balanced and sufficient ante-pituitary thyroid and adrenal-interstitial contribution in the chemical formulum of the personality in the chapter on historic personage analyze from the endocrine viewpoint we shall see that some of the most eminent and illustrious people of history have be pituitary-centered mental deficiency natural ability grow in a endocrine soil of a particular kind perhaps affect by the internal secretion much as natural soil be by fertilizer like phosphate or nitrate increase production follow increase fertilization natural disability must vary similarly with a perversion or improper mixture deficiency or absence of the hormone that combine in natural ability it be assume as a matter of course that the brain itself be there which to carry out we analogy mean that the crude soil or earth be there sufficient quantity and adequate quality of nerve tissue must be regard as prerequisite if the brain have be damage in any way during development or birth if it have be smash up in any way or if it have fail to evolve the minimum number of healthy nerve cell the endocrine influence become negligible it be like attempt to insert a key into a door which have no lock it be among the specimen of normality of the brain cell that we may look for we example of endocrine mental deficiency include be all sort of example of feeble-mindedness vary from the moron to the imbecile and idiot arrest brain life the cretin be the classic type of mental deficiency due to endocrine insufficiency curable or improvable by the proper handling insanity degeneration of the normal brain life may be cause by a upset of the endocrine balance among the commonest manifestation of insanity be excitement and depression apathy and mania hallucination delusion and obsession all of which be reproducible under known condition of internal secretion excess or failure alternate state of mania and depression be cause in some instance by extreme hyperthyroidism the critical period of life when a profound revolution be overturn the endocrine equilibrium puberty pregnancy and the menopause be the period of most frequent occurrence of insanity when mental instability reveal endocrine instability -lrb- dementia praecox pregnancy psychosis menopause neurosis -rrb- actual insanity need not be the only manifestation by far the greater number of mental disturbance due to aberration of the internal secretion never see a asylum or a doctor they live more or less close to the borderline of insanity as person who have spell eccentricity and peculiarity hysteria tic or just nervousness about two-third of mental deficiency be definitely inherit about one-third acquire it be the opinion of a number of psychologist that it be inherit as what the mendelian call a recessive that be as a trait which will be overshadow if there be admixture of normal mentality but will crop up by breed with another mental defective what we know of the endocrine factor in heredity lead we to suppose that it be the mating of one marked endocrine insufficiency with another that be often responsible for the inherit tendency to feeble-mindedness and insanity the effect of the hormone system upon the vegetative apparatus may create the more obscure insanity and quasi-insanity the direct action of the internal secretion upon the brain cell produce a sort of hair trigger situation within they may cause the explosive discharge from they which appear as overpowering impulse or uncontrollable conduct the wave of feeling which precede they be unquestionably endocrine determine the wave of fear a cat experience upon see a dog be accompany and indeed precede by a increase of the amount of adrenalin in the blood the picture of fright as observe in a so-called normal person stare eye tremble hand dry lip and mouth correspond to the portrait of the appearance in hyperthyroidism in person afflict with uncontrollable impulse the inhibit hormone may not be present in sufficient quantity feeble-mindedness range from stupidity to imbecility may also be a direct effect of insufficient endocrine supply to the brain cell when there be not enough of the thyroid secretion in the blood the tissue between the cell in the brain become clogged and thicken so that a gross barrier to the passage of the nerve impulse be create we have here a illustration of internal secretion lack actually produce gross change in the brain but without a doubt most endocrine influence upon the brain at work every minute and second of its life be the subtle one of molecular chemistry and atomic energetic we know that such mental quality as irritability and stupidity fatigability and the power to recover quickly or slowly from fatigue sexual potency and impotence apathy and enthusiasm be endocrine quality we know also that the thyroid dominant tend to be irritable and excitable the pituitary deficient to be placid and gentle the adrenal dominant to be assertive and pugnacious the thymus-centered to be childish and easy-go-lucky and the gonad deficient to be secretive and shy this bring we to the relation of the internal secretion to the type of personality as a whole chapter x the type of personality the endocrine personality if a single gland can dominate the life history of a individual it become possible to speak of _ endocrine type _ the result of the _ endocrine analysis _ of the individual study endocrine trait of physique life reaction disease tendency hereditary history and blood chemistry one may gain a insight into the composition or constitution of a individual the endocrine type of a individual be a summary of these he behavior in the past and be also a prediction of he reaction in the future much as a chemical formulum outline what we believe to be the skeleton of a compound substance as deducible from its property under vary condition only admittedly as yet the endocrine label be but roughly qualitative and most crudely quantitative whereas the chemical formulum be the essence of the exact however the fact remain that though we be only upon the first rung of the ladder we be upon the ladder the horizon undoubtedly broaden we possess a new way of look upon humanity a fresh transform light upon those strange phenomenon ourselves of the ugly achievement of that dreadful century the nineteenth the most illuminating be the discovery of itself as the _ ape-parvenu _ yes we be all animal now it say to itself and set its tooth in the cut-throat game of survival but there be no understanding in that evil motto of a disillusioned heart the ape-parvenu desperately lonely and secretive have still to understand himself let we be clear if we can there be perhaps a certain presumption in the phrase the endocrine type it be ambitious and perhaps will not fulfill its promise but it be useful because it point a parallel and a ideal as wilhelm ostwald never tire of repeat h _ -lcb- 2 -rcb- o be a complete shorthand record for the bundle of quality commonly know as water it be a example of that highest task of mind synthesis it be the highest synthesis of the study of the internal secretion that certain combination of they permutation and blending of they be responsible for those unique wonder of the universe personality the riddle of personality be we at last upon the track of its uncover that elusive mystery which philosopher have wrap in the thousand veil of greek and latin word and psychologist even unto the third and fourth generation of freudian have flounder about in mole before a dazzling sun be it to be unwound for we inspection think of the human soul what a invisible intangible chameleon be its true reality watch it and you see something that seem to uncurl and expand like a feather with exultation and delight and joy to contract and stiffen into a billiard ball with fear and pride shrewd caution and vigilant malevolence to rear back and spark fire like lightning with anger and temper and to crawl and slither with abjection and smirking slyness when it need to this multiplex thing-behind-life be we really about to dissect it into its element personality embrace much more than merely the psychic attribute it be not the least important of the lesson of endocrine analysis that there be no soul and no body either rather a soul-body or body-soul or the pattern of the living flame the closer tracking of the internal secretion lead we into the secret of the living flame why it live and how it live the strange diversity of its coloring and music and the odd variation in its energy vitality and longevity why it flicker why it flare and glare spurt flutter burn hard or soft orange-blue or yellow the medieval scholiast who fight as fiercely about name as nation about territory divide man into the sanguine the bilious the lymphatic and the nervous it be a pretty crude classification of different constitution the endocrine criterion more exact and concrete divide they into the adrenal centered the thyroid center the thymus center the pituitary centered the gonad centered and they combination the adrenal personality a adrenal personality be one dominate by the up and downs of he adrenal gland in the large the curve of he life be the curve of secretion by this gland both of its cortex and medullum such a adrenal personality be entirely normal within the definition of the normal as something not threaten the duration of life nor comfortable adaptation to it so be the other glandular type no sharp line can be draw between the normal and the abnormal in any case the borderland be wide the transition many the skin be one of the chief clue to the adrenal personality the relation between the adrenal and the skin date way back in the evolutionary scale for adrenalin have be isolate directly from pigment deposit in the epidermis of frog skin pigment bear a direct relation to the reaction of the organism to light especially the ultraviolet ray to the radiation of heat and hence to the fundamental production and consumption of energy by the cell so the gland of energy for emergency write its signature always all over the skin in a adrenal personality the epidermis be always slightly somewhat or deeply pigment the pigmentation be due to a dark brown deposit lightly or thickly scatter over the skin with the general diffuse pigmentation or darken there be often the black spot the pigmented birth mark or the lighter one of freckle the latter signify some permanent or transitory adrenal inadequacy in the past ante-natal or post-natal of the individual and presage the same in he future these spot have be frequently observe to appear after a attack of diphtheria or influenza there seem to be more tuberculosis among those who have they than those who do not we therefore say that diphtheria influenza and tuberculosis stand out as adrenal-attacking disease which have a greater power to kill cripple or hurt those with defective adrenal constitution than other the hair of the adrenal type be characteristic : ubiquitous thick coarse and dry it be prominent over the chest abdomen and back and have a tendency to kink often its color be not the expect : a italian 's will be yellow a norwegian 's jet black it have be state that most red-haired person be adrenal type such person also have well-marked canine tooth which be another adrenal trait they also have a low hair line when the adrenal type have a properly co-operating pituitary and thyroid he possess a striking vigor energy and persistence with a fortunate combination he develop into a progressive win fighter arrive at the top in the long run every time brain work be pretty well lubricate in the well-compensated adrenal type brain fag be closely associate with if not dependent upon adrenal fag particularly of the cortex brain tissue and adrenal cortex tissue be near relative and a normal human brain never develop without a normal adrenal cortex the adrenal type with a hypertrophy adrenal cortex be always efficient among woman the adrenal type be always masculinoid if physically feminine -- due to adequate feminine reaction on the part of the other endocrine -- she will at least show the quality of a psychic virilism a generation ago such a woman have to repress she inherent trend and instinct in the face of public opinion and law and so suffer from a feeling of inferiority nowadays these woman be stride forward and will attain a good many of the masculine height command responsible executive position and high salary a adrenal type will probably be the first woman president of the united state however that presuppose a normal range of action of the other endocrine let there be some quirk or weakness elsewhere in the chain of hormone and instead of the successful woman behold the spinster the maiden aunt the prude and crank who never satisfactorily adapt themselves in society to they must be give a good deal of credit for the suffrage revolution these unadapted adrenal as we may call they once sow the seed expend they masculinism in the struggle of the pioneer ' martyrdom prepare the harvest they sister the more adequate adrenal type will now reap the unadapted adrenal of today will have to look for new world to conquer so much for the compensate adrenal type they be the good worker the efficient the kinetic success of the driven world they make at a certain level good slave driver because they feel within themselves a drive force but suppose the adrenal type become uncompensated or perhaps be inadequate to the demand of life to start with then the story become different the perfect efficient superman of business or profession begin to lag though he be himself in the morning he begin to lag in the afternoon that be when he tire in the evening he be all in more sleep recreational trip vacation slip into the rank of necessity whereas previously they have be laugh at as luxury more minute or large mole emerge in the skin especially if the individual be of a fair type if a strenuous effort be not make to give the adrenal a opportunity to recuperate or if adjustment on the part of the other gland do not occur this stage of intermittent and remittent adrenal inadequacy give way in turn to the state of permanent adrenal insufficiency the adrenal insufficient be important because he be to be see everywhere build along the same line as the adrenal adequate and apt to be take for he he differ and contrast vividly below the surface one may sum he up by say that he be one variety of neurasthenic perhaps the most frequent variety cold hand and foot plague he cold foot psychically as well as physically for a chronic and obsessive indecision be one of he most prominent complaint a fatigability that go with a low blood pressure lower body temperature and a disturbed ability to utilize sugar for fuel purpose be another of he chief complaint the skin often present a instability of the blood vessel so that they now react to stroke with a blanch instead of a reddened effect irritability a liability to go off the handle at the slightest provocation and a consequent complete exhaustion that after a outburst send he to bed be conspicuous dismiss sometimes contemptuously as weakling they be accuse of laziness craziness and haziness in they psychic attempt to compensate they land into all kind of hot water from which friend relative or luck extricate they sometimes the other time they go to the wall the congenital adrenal deficient be a special problem if the history of such a individual be follow from birth one get a pretty typical story the genealogy be nervous nervous be a word of many meaning but when parent confess themselves nervous it generally mean a mental and emotional instability of some sort sometimes the idea be camouflage as high strung in the feed narrative of the child one find not occasional incident or episode but continue trouble difficulty adventure even after the first year or two the nutritional chronicle be not satisfactory lack of appetite lack of energy lack of response to stimulus be its keynote and the motif of the later year of childhood growth be a strain it become a task to make these child grow and gain chronically below the average weight and height herculean effort be make by the conscientious parent but with small success with the entry of school life and competition the curtain rise upon the real tragedy a tragedy in which the avenge fate be the usual ignorance stupidity and misunderstanding if the teacher alone be duty-obsessed or perhaps sadistic the child endure the agony of repeat admonition demotion and punishment however a certain thick-skinned indifference may develop to protect the sufferer if the parent be in addition ambitious or proud or competitive then woe betide the victim with they nervous disposition it be the school and the tutor who be to be blame if not the child from school to school from system to system from novelty to fad from doctor to doctor from fakir to charlatan from pillar to post they wander in search of a education educational cult by the dozen have sprout and grow fat around these unfortunate the chief defect of the congenital adrenal inadequate be a insufficiently develop adrenal cortex that mean a insufficiently develop brain and nervous system for we have see how closely all these be related in development now education can never be the education of a vacuum and we have to deal here with a relative vacuum when there be no potentiality there can be no education where the potentiality be limited education must be limit the congenital adrenal inadequate be define in physical and mental energy hence educator can not drive he up to a certain point he can be lead but no farther he should not be expect to go to a college and waste the opportunity of some one financially unlucky but whose endocrine system be more generously endow not that the outlook be absolutely hopeless puberty with its tremendous change in the gland of internal secretion when one can almost hear the click and the whir of the wheel in the internal machinery may transform the unfathomed possibility of gland therapy be still to be probe but the general rule remain the reaction to modernism the adrenal personality in all they variation must be safeguard and carefully look after in the strained complexity of modern post-bellum civilization in a sense the adrenal type be the atla of the twentieth century world and small wonder that he and he descendant stagger beneath the burden the adrenal be organ for the mobilization of energy physical and mental for emergency they be the gland which meet shock and neutralize the effect of shock in the solitary animal the everyday producer of shock be pain fright and wound the adrenal mechanism oversecrete to encounter the enemy and then there be a period of rest and recuperation man however with the growth of he imagination and the increase in number and density of he surround herd have become the subject of continuous stimulation in the past this be balance by the almost universal dominance of some religious belief as a effective opiate concept like fate predestination a all-guiding and all-wise providence relieved and shield the adrenal and act as valuable adjuvant for the preservation of normality the nineteenth century witness the birth and expansion of a great number of new stimulant reagent the discovery of physics and chemistry which with the climax of the world war of 1914-1918 have make for a more or less complete deliquescence of accept religion for the great majority there be no faith to take its place war pre-war and post-war shock have continue with they incessant pound upon the reserve of energy under these condition the adrenal personality be bind to suffer the other endocrine type suffer too but quite differently today anti-adrenal anti-religious idea be epidemic of these first prize belong to a cult of egotism father by the napoleonic idea consciously assertive and self-conscious in max stirner 's the ego and he own which engender a swarm of imitator and plagiarist human being be all incorrigible egoist more or less furtive or frank but social and religious code curb the most narcissistic of king and conqueror before napoleon all of they vow allegiance and express submission to some sort of deity confess some fear of the lord in they heart but the idea of napoleon flout all that the unscrupulous predatory who put effectual scheming for the self plainly above every other consideration and ride rough shod over all he fellow appeal powerfully to the latent animality of the adrenal type then come the dawn awareness of capital and labor of themselves as class fiercely oppose forever in the policy of cut-throat versus cut-throat the labor organization and the commercial company and corporation pit themselves against each other consciously doctrine like property be but robbery everyone for himself and the devil take the hindmost the iron law of wages and the fact be fact of the gradgrind be the phrase of the nineteenth century that assist finally come the darwinian revelation of man as the ape-parvenu which complete the disintegration of the old restraint man seem to see himself now for the first time stark and naked but man consist of many variety and all react differently to the image in the clouded mirror there be universal attempt at suppression but slowly the anti-adrenal force infiltrate every activity and every soul like a hidden focus of infection in the body it germinate and poison a slow fever creep into life a febrile quality tinge the acquisition of wealth the concentration upon sex and the desperate pursuit of the novel stimulus then like the hand that appear at belshazzar 's feast come the war only it be a hand that stay with a long flash lightning sword in its grip sweeping pitilessly among the erstwhile dancing multitude to mutilate and destroy a good many people with that sturdy animality george santayana speak somewhere of as a trait of mankind set out to enjoy the war it be a new sort of good time upon a incredibly large scale it be a undreamed-of opportunity the mechanism of suppression of the mind render it incapable of appreciate horror until encounter and so thousand with dangerously unstable adrenal be plunge into the most try condition possible hundred of they already shake on the borderland of instability react with the phenomenon of breakdown of control lump with a host of other phenomenon under the general rubric of shell shock that alone be not all if hundred collapse thousand approach the verge of collapse they survive and be discharge from the army as normal they reappear in civil life as case of nerve ordinarily that would mean that they would be class as failure but such have be the psychologic reaction to the war that all kind of compensation in the way of dangerous mental state have become frequent in these inadequate adrenal type a trend to violence and a resentful emotionalism be combine with desperate attempt to spur the jaded adrenal with artificial excitement consequent melancholia and depression the blues be inevitable a survey of drug addict would probably show a definite percentage of this type the same apply to certain petty criminal and law breaker the adrenal element in the personality must be consider in every disturbance morbid personal or social involve brunette type huxley 's dark white mediterranean-iberian red-haired person and even pigment-spotted fair people historian have trace the earliest civilization to the doings of a brunette people the sumerian the first to build city in the euphrates-tigris region more than five thousand year before christ be bear a adrenalized people one would expect to be the first to take advantage of possibility because of they energy capacity the earliest sumerian stone carving of warrior exhibit a undersized skeleton compare with the large head broad face a low hair line and prominent nose that would fit into the ensemble of the adrenal type certain other historical aspect of the adrenal personality have yet to be work out the pituitary personality the presence of two antagonistic element in the one gland complicate any attempt at even the most abstract analysis of a personality dominate by that gland the pituitary compose of a anterior lobe and posterior lobe supply two fairly uncomplicated corresponding type best describe as the masculine pituitary type and the feminine pituitary type the masculine pituitary type be one determine by the rule of the anterior pituitary represent superlative brain tone and action good all-around growth and harmonious general function the ideal masculine organism the feminine pituitary type have a excess of post-pituitary with susceptibility to the tender emotion sentimentalism and emotionalism feminine structural line ante-pituitary dominance in a male reinforce the general masculinity while the post-pituitary depress it the post-pituitary in a woman augment she natural trend ante-pituitary tend to counteract it in other word post-pituitary and ovary be conjunctive ante-pituitary and ovary be disjunctive post-pituitary and testis be opponent ante-pituitary and testis be ally one mechanical circumstance involve in the pituitary personality may be the determinant of the entire life history that be the emphasize fact that the pituitary be encase in a small bony box at the base of the skull the size of this bony box and its capacity to yield to the various pressure of a pituitary enlarge to meet the demand of the organism will often spell happiness or misery success or failure genius or idiocy for the man or woman certain possibility be conceivable all of they occur for the development of x-ray technique have render available almost a direct view of the sellum turcica in the first place the bony box may be definitely too small to start in with that mean a small and so potentially inadequate pituitary both anterior and posterior potentially inadequate in that it will become impossible for it to grow and produce extra secretion upon demand handicapped thus the unfortunate so bear be doom to inferiority and very little can be do for he he will not develop satisfactorily he possess small genital organ which will not evolve properly in adolescence or if they will not stand still tend to revert to the opposite sex type then he tend to be dwarf fatigable adipose among these type be include subject of obsession and compulsion who be dull and apathetic can not learn or maintain inhibition and so without initiative evolve into moral and intellectual degenerate liable to epilepsy and the most remarkable sex aberration all because a cranny of the skull about the size of a thimble be not large enough for they dominate gland if the bone of the cavity of the pituitary be softer and yield so that some enlargement of the gland be possible especially of the anterior there appear rapid growth with a tendency to high blood pressure great mental activity associate with frequent and severe headache -lrb- often of the migraine type -rrb- a combination of initiative and irritability and a marked sexuality x-ray examination of the sellum turcica show what be call erosion of the bone as it yield to the pressure of the grow gland the ideal sellum turcica for the ideal pituitary type be a large room in which the gland may grow and reach its maximum size and so its maximum function without need to exert pressure or destroy and erode bone in front of it to the side of it or behind it the distinctive masculine and feminine type class as the normal belong to this group sometimes the bone in front of the pituitary will yield while the one in the rear will not and sometimes the condition be reverse thus we may have ante-pituitary sufficiency with post-pituitary insufficiency or ante-pituitary insufficiency with post-pituitary sufficiency complex which contribute to create the grosser functional hermaphrodite type of mixed sex in the average feminine pituitary type of personality post-pituitary dominate in a woman and to a lesser degree in a man the general build be slight and rather delicate the skin be soft moist and hairless the face be the doll or dresden china sort with a roseate or creamy complexion flushing easily eye large and prominent the mouth show a high arched palate and crowd tooth rather long the voice be high-pitched one recognize the traditional womanly woman petite and chic who always marry the hero in story she be usually fond of child easily move have a good libido and the traditional feminine trait when unstable the post-pituitary type be restless and hyperactive crave excitement and continual change of interest and scene a new pleasure every moment a good many of the woman of today who fifty year ago would have be nice sedate girl because of they excellent post-pituitary constitution have be irritated by the atmosphere of post-1914 into the excess post-pituitary state the adventurous never-satiated avid pleasure hunter in whom the craving for stimulation will stop at nothing f scott fitzgerald portray a exquisite specimen of the kind in he short story the jellybean with a quasi-heroine of a good southern family build to be a high standard wife and mother who drink swear gamble and finally marry on a dare modern post-pituitary woman be excitement mad and thrill chase the worst of it be that the resultant personal tragedy can not be dismiss as transient inevitable the heredity of the internal secretion determine that the offspring of these woman be bind to be pituitary unstable the least desirable of endocrine instability because of the concomitant mental effect even from the purely selfish point of view the standpoint of enlighten selfishness the post-pituitary type must beware of excess for disturbance of menstruation psychic fear anxiety state of suspicion and obsession various pain be among the penalty a period of post-pituitary excess as a effect of disease pregnancy or the rapid life may be follow by post-pituitary deficiency as a result of exhaustion of the gland the girl or woman then become fat and suffer from headache -lrb- the fair fat and forty type -rrb- yet retain a certain capacity for enjoyment which enable she to continue gay happy and gentle kind interested so she contrast with the thyroid deficient who get fat but also dull stupid even morose the masculine pituitary personality the man with a dominant anterior pituitary gland in a roomy sellum turcica with plenty of space to grow in be the ideal virile type they be generally tall -lrb- unless the growth of the long bone be check too early by a social precocity of the testis -rrb- with a well-developed strong frame large firm muscle and proportionately size hand and foot the head be of the marked dolichocephalic type flatten at the side face be oval more or less with thick eyebrow eye rather prominent nose broadish and long lower jaw prominent and firm prominent bony point like the cheek bone the elbow and the knee the knuckle joint of the hand and foot the tooth be large especially the upper middle incisor and they be usually space the arm and leg be hairy high grade brain the ability to learn and the ability to control self-mastery in the sense of domination of the lower instinct and the automatic reaction of the vegetative nervous system the rule by the individual of himself and he environment be at they maximum in he the ante-pituitary personality be educable for intelligence and even intellect provide the proper educational stimulus be supply man of brain practical and theoretical philosopher thinker creator of new thought and new goods belong to this group the distinction between man of theoretical genius whose mind which could embrace a universe and yet fail to manage successfully they own personal everyday life and the man of practical genius who can achieve and execute the great engineer and industrial man lie in the balance between the ante-pituitary and the adrenal cortex primarily man like abraham lincoln and george bernard shaw belong to this ante-pituitary group the feminine pituitary personality in whom there be predominance of the post-pituitary over the ante-pituitary occur in man the type be short round and stout they have head that seem too large for they body the general hair distribution on the trunk and extremity be poor although that of the scalp and face be plentiful and they acquire a abdominal paunch early they exhibit the feminine tendency to periodicity of function they mood activity efficiency be cyclic remind one of the menstrual variation of the female this rhythmicity saturate they personality so that poetry and music almost morbidly appeal to they a number of the great poet and musician be to be classify as of the feminine pituitary species last but not least they be the hen-pecked lover and husband sex difficulty be frequent in they history the determination of endocrine type and tendency the prediction of the future personality during childhood be one of the development confidently to be look for as we knowledge of the internal secretion will grow the possibility of control loom as one of the most magnificent promise of science yet the high expectation for tomorrow should not depress we respect for the achievement of today in the case of the pituitary for instance a hint as to the method of approach be furnish by the tabulation of the trait of pituitary dominance and pituitary inferiority in child pituitary sufficient and dominant : large spare bony frame eye wide apart broad face tooth broad large unspaced square protrude chin and jaw large foot and hand early hair growth on body thick skin large sex organ aggressive precocious calculate self-contained pituitary inferior : small sometimes delicate skeleton rather adipose weak muscle upper jaw prognathous dry flabby skin small hand and foot abnormal desire for sweet subnormal temperature blood pressure and pulse poor control of lower vegetative function mentally sluggish dull apathetic backward lose self-control quickly cry easily discourage promptly psychic stamen insufficient the pituitary personality in childhood produce by limitation of the size of the gland because its bony box be completely or partially close present typical hall-mark he supply the second and third offender in the juvenile court the delinquent and pathological liar of childhood the incorrigible the precocious hobo mental and moral deficient and defective the prey of the sentimental complex of elderly virgin and helpful futility all around not utilitarianism or futilitarianism be need but pituitarianism the feeding of pituitary gland in large enough quantity to these unfortunate may do more than ten charity organization with the most patrician board of director complete the thyroid personality the accessibility of the thyroid gland in the neck the ease of surgical approach the definite effect follow its removal and then the miraculous marvel of the feeding of thyroid have render it the center of attack by the largest army of endocrine investigator as a result we know more about the thyroid in childhood adolescence adult life and old age than about the other gland in childhood the subthyroid or thyroid deficient the cretinoid type the type resemble the cretin be fairly common the peasant 's face with the broad nose and the tough skin coarse straight hair the undergrowth physical and mental a persistent babyishness and a retardation of self-control development make up the picture he need a excess of sleep sleep heavily need sleep during the day when awaken in the morning still feel tired and rather dull and restless dress slowly have to be coax or force to dress get to school late nearly every morning do badly at the school reaction time learn time and remember time be prolong as compare with the average and be lazy at home lesson he perspire little even after exertion yet fatigue easily be subject to frequent cold adenoids tonsillitis and acquire every disease of childhood that happen along adolescence the come of menstruation the first bloom of youth be delay in the subthyroid the secondary sex trait as they develop tend to be incomplete and to mimic those of the opposite sex yet in adolescence too there may be a sudden change and reversal of the whole process a jump from the subthyroid to the hyperthyroid state so a girl who have be dull and lackadaisical with no complexion and every prospect of evolution into a wall flower may be transform into a bright-eyed woman generally nervous and restless high color and possess of a craving for continual activity and excitement skin hair and tooth become of the thyroid dominant type the heart palpitate under the slightest stimulus she perspire almost annoyingly heat and emotion be prostrate if such a transfiguration do not occur the effect of the reconstruction of puberty be to create a person with about the follow characteristic 1 height below the average 2 tendency to obesity -lrb- toward middle age -rrb- 3 complexion sallow 4 hair dry -- hair line high 5 eyebrow scanty either as a whole or in outer half 6 eyeball deep-set lack lustre in narrow slit 7 tooth irregular become carious early 8 extremity cold and bluish 9 circulation poor subject to chilblain intellectually these people vary enormously depend upon which of the other gland will enlarge to compensate for the deficiency of the thyroid if the growth of the skull have leave a roomy sellum turcica for the pituitary to grow in the intellect may be normal or even superior though energy be below par if this be not possible and the adrenal have to predominate a lower more animal and less self-controlled type of mentality be produce in direct contrast to the subthyroid type be he who originally be hyperthyroid during childhood he be quite healthy thin but striking robust active energetic generally fair-complexioned with nose straight and high bridged eye rather poppy tooth excellent regular firm white with a pearly translucent enamel these child be always on the go never get tired require little sleep seldom will one of the classical child 's disease strike they measle perhaps but no other adolescence for they however be more apt to be stormy and episodic adjustment to the new world of people and thing be much more difficult wanderlust be acute all a expression of cell key up charge with energy that must flow somewhere or explode the ruddy live-wire recognize everywhere as bubble with vitality the life of any group the magnetic personality may however be shock by some seismic event like the death of a father or mother or the ruin of some cherish ambition a break in the balance of the other gland follow quickly and disablement and invalidism which may cure itself after some year remain stationary or descend to the worst form of thyroid deficiency during maturity the type be characterize usually by a lean body or tendency rapidly to become thin under stress they have clean cut feature and thick hair often wavy or curly thick long eyebrow large frank brilliant keen eye regular and well develop tooth and mouth sexually they be well differentiate and susceptible noticeable emotivity a rapidity of perception and volition impulsiveness and a tendency to explosive crisis of expression be the distinctive psychic trait a restless inexhaustible energy make they perpetual doer and worker who get up early in the morning flit about all day retire late and frequently suffer from insomnia planning in bed what they be to do next day certain type of thyroid excess associate with the thymus dominant next to be describe be peculiarly susceptible to emotional instability they be subject to brain storm outbreak of furious rage sometimes associate with a state of semi-consciousness to emphasize the analogy to epilepsy they attack have be call psycholepsy among the italian especially they be watch and report during the war when the explosive fit be see to take the form of irresponsible act of insubordination or violence the thymo-centric personality during the first period of childhood up to five six or seven or more accurately up to the point at which the permanent tooth begin to appear every child may be say to be a thymus-dominated organism because the thymus hold the other endocrine in check control its life that be why up to the third and fourth year at any rate most child seem alike closer observation however reveal point of differentiation and sign of the come potency of the other hormone during the second period up to puberty these mark of the deeper underlying force of the personality make themselves more and more feel the thymus like a brake that be become wear out continue to function in a progressively weaker fashion until with the arrival of the gonadal -lrb- ovary ' or testis ' -rrb- internal secretion its influence be wipe out there be a definite degree of thymus activity during everyone 's childhood unless by its premature involution precocity displace juvenility yet even during childhood there be certain individual with excessive thymus action foreshadow a continued thymus predominance throughout life the angel child be the type : regularly proportion and perfectly make like a fine piece of sculpture with delicately chisel feature transparent skin change color easily long silky hair with a exceptional grace of movement and a alertness of mind they seem the embodiment of beauty but somehow unfit for the coarse conflict of life in english literature several character be recognizable as portrait of the type notably paul dombey whose nurse recognize that he be not for this world they may look the picture of health but they be more liable than any other child to be eliminate by tuberculosis meningitis or even one of the common disease of childhood it be after puberty when the thymus should shrink and pass out of the endocrine concert as a power that the more complex reaction of personality emerge when the thymus persist and refuse to or can not retire the persistent thymus always then throw its shadow over the entire personality to what extent that shadow spread depend upon the strength of the other gland of internal secretion they ability to compensate or to stay inhibit whether or not the pituitary will be able to enlarge in its bony cradle seem to be the most important factor determine these variation if there be space for it to grow at any rate normally the individual may pass for normal although he will have difficulty throughout life he may never understand particularly in sexual direction if the pituitary be limited partially or completely the thymus predominance be more prominent and fixed and the abnormality become obvious both of person and conduct the anatomic architecture of the latter thymo-centric personality be fairly typical the reversion in type of the reproductive organ the slender waist the gracefully form body the rounded limb the long chest and the feminine pelvis strike one at the first glance the texture of the skin be smooth as a baby 's and sometimes velvety to the touch its color may be a opaque white or faintly creamy or there may be a effect of a filmy sheen over a florid complexion little or no hair on the face contribute to the general feminine aspect in the more extreme type they be often double jointed somewhere flat foot knock-kneed in woman the external manifestation of a thymo-centric personality may be limit to thinness and delicacy of the skin narrow waist rather poorly develop breast arched thigh and scanty hair with scanty and delay menstruation or there may be obesity with juvenility if there be a repression of the pituitary secretion for one reason or other in they reaction to the problem physical and psychic of everyday life the thymo-centric be distinctly at a disadvantage in the first place muscular strain stress or shock be dangerous to they because they have a small heart and remarkably fragile blood vessel which render they circulation incapable of respond to a emergency or at least definitely handicapped in infancy they may die suddenly because of this either for no ascertainable cause at all or because of some slight excitement like that attend some slight operation a fall or a mild illness during the run-about epoch they be unable to cope with the necessity of a active child 's existence in play with other child puberty and adolescence be specially perilous to they for they may endeavor to compensate for a inner feeling of physical inferiority by go in strenuously for athletics and sport and so risk a sudden hemorrhage in the brain producible by the tear of a blood vessel as if construct of defective rubber report publish in the newspaper from time to time of child or young man instantly kill by a tap on the jaw in a boxing contest or some other trivial injury be doubtless sample of such reaction in thymo-centric people as a illustration of the conduct aberration of the thymo-centric personality during adult life the follow extract from a newspaper report of a suicide be worth quote a autopsy make yesterday by dr benjamin schwartz first assistant to dr charle norri chief medical examiner remove any mystery that surround the death on Saturday night by pistol bullet of dr jos a arena and the wounding of ` miss ruth jackson ' and ignatio martus dr schwartz say that he post-mortem examination have convince he beyond doubt that the dead physician-dentist have kill himself after he have try to take the life of the young woman with whom he have live and of the youth who be he successful rival ` besides that ' dr schwartz say ` my report to the police will include a statement from the young woman to I that she always have understand that dr arena have kill some one in havana cuba before he come to new york the autopsy leave no doubt that dr arena be a case of status lymphaticus -lrb- thymus-centered personality -rrb- i make a most complete report because of the scientific value of the autopsy ` this confirm my first deduction after see the body on Saturday night in the doctor 's furnished room with alcove bedroom adjoining you will remember that as soon as i have see he i reveal that he be wear corset ` these case of status lymphaticus be intensely interesting in they the blood vessel be very small and the lymphatic clement be greatly in excess they die suddenly from rupture of blood vessel many of they be degenerate most of they be criminal all of they be liable to commit crime of passion among they be find a large percentage of drug addict ` miss jackson in the hospital confirm my scientific theory that the dead man be not normal she be perfectly frank in she statement she say she have leave she husband elmer schultz a automobile salesman in toledo several month ago and have come to new york she say she have live with the doctor for some time ` about ten day ago she leave he to live with martus a healthy normal lad before she go from the doctor 's room she destroy those color collar that be find beside the body she cut they with scissors but that be after so she state the doctor have destroy stocking of hers by cut they ` she tell I in the hospital today and with every appearance of truth that she have meet arena in the subway at the station on seventy-second street and broadway on Friday night and that she have ask he when she could come and get she clothes he say accord to she story : ` come to the house tomorrow afternoon -- but come with martus ' ` she say that she and martus go there accord to this invitation : that first the doctor show she the cut collar and tell she that she would get she clothes back in perfect condition and that the next thing she know she have be shoot she could not remember much after that ' i believe that both she and martus have tell a perfectly straightforward story and the autopsy be proof of it ` there be six bullet in the doctor 's pistol to be account for one in a undischarged cartridge still be in the weapon that leave five one strike miss jackson in the right chest squarely in front and penetrate the flesh about one inch if there have be any power at all behind the missile it would have go right through pierce a lung cause a hemorrhage and the chance be that miss jackson would have die that leave four bullet ` one more strike martus in the left upper chest it pass through the pocket there and the skirt graze the skin and then bounce over to the right hand side in front it be a most amazing case of a bound bullet i be particularly careful about examine its course because at first i be suspicious of the story that be tell by martus and miss jackson now i know they be true ` but anyone might have be puzzle by the queer antic of the missile from the pistol of south american manufacture that the doctor use if it have have any penetrate power -- or rather if the bullet that it send out have any real kick behind they -- the chance be that both miss jackson and martus would be dead now ` two bullet it will be remembered enter the doctor 's left chest quite close together well one nick the heart and lodge between the lung and the heart it do not cause any more damage than a mosquito bite ` the second bullet go through the soft flesh of the chest but it strike a rib and bound back out again that bullet be pick up beside the body ` after these vain attempt to send a bullet through he body to a fatal spot the doctor apparently shift the weapon to he right temple and pull the trigger for the fifth time then the fifth bullet drive likewise by a very weak charge of powder pierce the skull at a point where it be thin and tear into he brain its lack of power however be show by the fact that i find it this morning in the brain tissue ` in all my experience i have never see anything so queer it sound almost like a dream -- a man try to kill with a pistol that shoot bullet that either stop after striking soft flesh or bind out of the body into which they be fire but it be true i have have all of the bullet in my hand ` they be all account for they be all of the same sort there be no reason to doubt that they be all from the same weapon a instrument without manufacturer 's name and of a design that the police say be unfamiliar to they ` the dead doctor be a distinct type and he tragic end be one that should not surprise anyone who have any knowledge of such case the courtroom be throng with friend of the dead physician-dentist who not only be report to be of a wealthy family of bogota colombium but generally be credit with many charitable work in the uptown spanish colony here ' the distinct type to which the first assistant to the chief medical examiner of the city refer be the thymo-centric personality -lrb- status lymphaticus be another technical name for it -rrb- we have be consider the persistence of the thymus after adolescence make for a arrest of masculinization or feminization the end-point arrive at by the process of puberty that be a partial castration take place now as the experiment of steinach upon the transplantation of ovary into male deprive of they testis and of testis into female deprive of they ovary have demonstrate the removal of the interstitial cell of one sex assist enormously in arouse the opposite sex trait that have be latent homosexuality in a thymo-centric tendency to homosexuality and masochism appear and so all the remarkable after-effect of those process that the freudian have so lovingly trace : the father complex in man the inferiority complex and the feminoid complex in general the feminoid complex introduce again the character of the functional hermaphrodite the mixed male-female the sex index will certainly come in time as a measurement of sexuality but until then some more available classification of sex tendency be necessary include sex intergrade one may divide sex type into six class : male _ male _ - female male - _ female _ female _ female _ - male and female - _ male _ the sex intergrade the four hyphenated class nearly all have some degree of persistent thymus if its influence be partial the emphasis be before the hyphen upon the ostensible if its influence be unchecked the emphasis be after the hyphen upon the apparently latent sex the sex difficulty produce in these people by the conflict between they conscious sex and they subconscious sex the sex duel in the same mind siamese twin pull in diametrically opposite direction be comprehensible only from the viewpoint of the internal secretion homosexuality in one form or another frank or conceal haunt the thymo-centric and spoil he life the persistent thymus like a vindictive electra stalk the footstep of its victim its possessor he wish to live accord to society 's remorselessly rigid expectation for virility and happiness but he thymus condition force he also to live for femininity and misery that homosexuality be not purely a psychic matter of complex and introversion as the newest psychology would have we believe have be prove by observation of its development in animal with internal secretion disturbance acquire or experimental thus it have be record that a male dog show a large goitrous swell of the thyroid in the neck with a rapid heart stare eye the loss of flesh and fat and the nervousness of a hyperthyroid condition therewith he become a absolute homosexual observation on the primate along the same line have be make in goitrous hyperthyroid thymus persistence be common what complicate he sex difficulty and make social adjustment almost impossible or completely impossible be that he pituitary frequently can not react to assist he often as emphasize it be bind in by bone on all side and neither ante-pituitary nor post-pituitary can adequately secrete for he need so social instinct and the capacity for inhibition the ability to control himself conceptually and somatically be poor as a child it be difficult to train he along the line of the elementary habit and custom he be into late childhood a bed-wetter and steal and lie quasi-unconsciously he mother realize soon that he can not be make to acquire a sense of responsibility either for himself or for other she become afraid to let he go into the street because of he

discover that he have take something that do not belong to he quite as a matter of course he will fabricate story with no motive fabricate they out of whole cloth for the pure fun of it in a word moral irresponsibility be the keynote of the volitional trait of the thymo-centric personality from childhood up with so much against they physical inferiority mental defect moral lack of every sort it be little wonder that the thymo-centric die young infection hit they badly the case of flu that go off in twenty-four hour belong to the type fulminant meningitis pneumonia diphtheria scarlet fever

practically constant and often pronounced certain of they after a stormy life in the twenty become adapt to they surroundings in the thirty because the pituitary gradually emerge and become dominant in they personality they be then recessive thymocentric a increase in size a broaden together with a greater mental tranquillity and stability accompany the adaptation historically the thymocentric who combine brilliancy and instability play a great part as some of the famous adventurer and restless experimentalist the sex gland centered or gonado-centric personality -lrb- the eunuchoid personality -rrb- among the individual whose personality be dominate by they sex gland the physiognomy physique and life reaction be so distinctive that no better example exist of we main thesis : that the whole life of man be control primarily by he internal secretion these gonado-centric type be not all necessarily sex gland deficient as the term eunuchoid imply they may be rather gonad unstable with a corresponding instability of the entire endocrine system about the face of the eunuchoid the striking feature be the incomplete irregular or absent hair development below thirty it be chubby and ruddy and rather childish in its texture after thirty there be a effect of premature senility : the skin be yellowish leathery and wrinkle as the face of old woman be wrinkle : the upper

functional hermaphroditism in the underlie feminoid constitution the feminoid constitution appear again in the supposedly masculine the feminoid constitution should not be confuse with the infantiloid constitution the former the gonado-centric personality be a digression of growth a deviate evolution of the individual because of the conflicting force some masculine and some feminine in he make-up the infantiloid constitution be one of arrest development and may center around the arrest function in childhood or adolescence of any one or a number of endocrine gland yet the two may resemble one another pretty closely at time a cretin imitate the extreme grade of infantiloid constitution the infantiloid be a sort of enlarged and lengthen child the feminoid be ostensibly a man with a good deal of woman in he the infantiloid be a quite general type but of course when typical be a freak recognize and treat as such how far the eunuchoid may deviate from the normal be suggest by the follow description of one face round moon-like chubby devoid of hair eye puff lip protrude and fleshy cheek round and thick nose little developed skin thick and of clear color disproportion between the size of head and body hair of scalp fine brow and lash scarce trunk elongate and cylindrical limb thick and plump taper from the root to the extremity good fat layer over the entire body reproductive organ

measurement of any large group of population reveal a remarkable percentage of it as below the mental age of 12 juvenile trait and juvenile mind separate or combined should always suggest the possibility of the infantiloid constitution of one type of thymocentric also the eunuchoid or feminoid personality be also find often among artist one must carefully distinguish the two because the ensemble of characteristic of the one may easily stimulate the other yet fundamentally they be as far apart as the pole the infantiloid type never rise above the subnormal which be its habitat while the feminoid type -lrb- or masculinoid in woman -rrb- often produce a abnormal personality which rise above the normal the infantiloid become the slave and the weakling of society the mark tapley and the tom pinch while the eunuchoid have create splendid literature and immortal music the life reaction and especially the sex reaction of the gonado-centric be as complex and difficult as those of the thymo-centric straightforward homosexuality and the eunuchoid constitution have always be intimate the homosexuality of the thymo-centric be more subtle and disguised often bury under the stronger masculine component of the personality homosexuality as a cult have appear correlate with the production of the functional hermaphrodite by artificially create the eunuchoid type of constitution among the aztec homosexual be produce in quantity for religious purpose by a deliberate foster of the eunuchoid constitution they call they the mujerado they method consist in make a healthy man ride horseback constantly until a irritable weakness of the reproductive organ ensue and a paralytic impotence follow the exhaust testis would then atrophy and the voice ring falsetto muscular tone and

and the other type-character of the eunuchoid complex appear these constitution thus may be either congenital or acquire individual apparently normal during childhood and adolescence may be transform injury to the reproductive gland sometimes the slightest bruise may lead to atrophy and a change of personality follow in less than six week mumps may achieve the same result because of the inflammation of the gonad that may accompany or follow it whole family and race may show some of the sign of the eunuchoid constitution for generation accord to darwin -lrb- descent of man -rrb- the development of the beard and the hairiness of the body differ remarkably in the man of distinct race and even in different tribe and family of the same race on the european-asiatic continent beard prevail until we pass beyond indium although with the native of ceylon they be often absent eastward of indium beard disappear as with the siamese kalmuk malay chinese and japanese throughout the great american continent the man may be say to be beardless : but in almost all tribe a few short hair be apt to appear on the face especially in old age hair be a adrenal cortex trait it be to be infer that hairless family and race be more eunuchoid and possess less of the adrenal cortex secretion than the more hairy whatever the exception -- and there have be eunuch general in history -- marce chancellor of justinian who beat the goth at nocera and ali the gallant who command the turkish army after the invasion of hungary in 1856 -- the eunuchoid generally run to type in he mentality and he sexuality he be a introvert he personality be shut in he isolate himself from the world the lower eunuchoid exhibit a curiously child-like personality navely confide communicate to all comer all they joy and sorrow they ask diffidently for confirmation of they statement and they pass quickly from tear to laughter about sexual matter they be extremely timid a moral innocence pervade they speech and conduct usually they have no true conception of crime of jealousy or passion the occupation they go in for be those without responsibility away from crowd or observation such as ship cook steward and so on they marry to find a home without the object of establish sexual relation when they be ask whether they think they wife will be please to look at the matter in the same light and be contented to live with a man upon such condition they be puzzle or perplex as if they have never think seriously about the matter before they simplicity have even extend to propose to they wife to seek gratification from some other man naturally such a arrangement often prove unsatisfactory and desertion follow concern the child sometimes the offspring of these union scepticism as to the identity of the father be decidedly permissible still in some case the best of evidence exist that fertility occur the vitality of the child then be subnormal and the mortality rate high the eunuchoid tendency be transmit variation and transition of every kind be find among the undersexed eunuchoid personality depend upon the quality and degree of the secretion lack when there be a excess of these sex secretion a turbulent tempestuous sexually sensitive temperament that may go on to satyriasis or nymphomania be create it have be show that dove can be render overfeminine in they behavior and characteristic by injection of ovarian material oversex type of personality therefore may exist as well as undersexed combination and permutation the type of personality sketch -- the thyrocentric the pituitocentric the adrenocentric the thymocentric the gonadocentric -- be really prototype the great kingdom of personality to which individual can be assign by hall mark which facilitate they classification they may also be describe as the pure endocrine type which include a minority of a population but the majority consist of dominant mixture hyphenate group which be the species and variety of the greater class combination and variation of control among the adrenal and thyroid pituitary or thymus and so on occur with effect that be sometimes additive reinforce a particular trait of the person and at other conflict and neutralize quantitative variation of the same secretion may occur periodically in the same individual which explain the multiplicity and complexity the inconsistency and contradiction of conduct in a man or woman at the different episode and crisis of life to a certain extent there should be a stable balance between the various endocrine the stability express itself in what we be pleased to call the normal there should also be a balance between the antagonistic element in the same gland for instance the pituitary the pituitary build of two distinct portion the anterior and the posterior be in equilibrium when the two be nicely adjust but the accident and vicissitude of life -lrb- pregnancy for example -rrb- will upset the balance and so there will result change of physique conduct and character like possibility apply to all the other gland of internal secretion in we ability to exercise a control over these disturbance of balance to be develop in the future lie one of the great hope for a chemical perfectability of human life and nature nature 's experiment vs man 's the kind of personality describe as prototype and variant and the fundamental fact support the view that they be the reaction type of the human being we meet in everyday life represent simply a beginning of the work to be do put into we hand a new powerful searchlight that penetrate the interior of body and soul a fresh attitude toward the complicated problem of man in society grow imminent the normal and the abnormal become illuminate with a effect as if we retina be suddenly to get sensitive to the ultraviolet ray to which we be now blind a apparatus be put in we hand which show we not only a static condition at a give moment but the whole life process of a individual normal or abnormal he past and he future upon that fetich of the biologist the struggle for existence the struggle for survival the struggle for possession and satisfaction for happiness victory and virility in short for success as success be measure by the biologist a search spectroscope can play with a yield for we understanding and control of life that will stand comparison with the astronomer 's analysis of the star toward the process of adjustment and adaptation of the environment to the individual as well as of the individual to the environment attitude will change from _ hopeless acquiescence in the inevitable to a complete self-determination of the self and its surroundings _ the adventure of the personality string along as the episode of he career he friendship and sex reaction he mishap and disease and the final fate or fortune that overtake he be he normal subnormal supernormal or abnormal begin to become comprehensible and hence controllable chapter xi some historic personage the internal secretion in history accord to the view fact and guess concern human personality as a body-mind complex dominate by the internal secretion outline in the precede page biography and human history as the interaction of biography become capable of interpretation from a new standpoint if human life in its essential be so much the product of the internal messenger system we speak of as the endocrine then biography should present we with a number of illustration of they power and influence what be the evidence that as huxley anticipate the introduction into the economy of a molecular mechanism which like a cunningly contrived torpedo shall find its way to some particular group of live element and cause a explosion among they leave the rest untouched and the multiplication of such cunningly contrived mechanism be responsible for those personality magnificent chemical compound with whose adventure historian be concern the case of napoleon as a unique will and intelligence napoleon bonaparte the first must be class as one of the betelegeus of the race hg well have call he career the raid of a intolerable egotist across the disorder beginning of a new time the figure of a adventurer and wrecker this saturnine egotist be man dazzle simply by the scale of he floundering by the mere vastness of he notoriety this dark little archaic personage hard compact capable unscrupulous imitative and neatly vulgar there be other opinion the man of destiny be worship by million napoleona bring fortune today interest in the man as a man have multiply with every year and certainly no one can deny he the quality of individuality in its most exaggerated form in the second place he belong among the modern modern science and method of observation have have they chance at he and have leave a conscious record of they result napoleon be the central figure of he time and be watch by trained medical eye during he life and after he death protocol of the examination of he body be accessible and napoleonic specimen preserve by fix agent may still be view at the museum of the royal college of surgeon england dr leonard guthrie have work up the material at hand in a report which he present to the historical section of the international congress of medicine in london in 1913 i propose to relate he finding to some other fact and the general principle roughly sketch in this book there be a number of word portrait of napoleon extant but for we purpose certain of the notable feature of he face and physique be to be consider the first characteristic that strike everyone about he be the matter of he height he be definitely sub-average at death be about five foot six inch in height as have be emphasize several time deficiency or excess of growth will always direct attention to the pituitary he sharply outline feature and a powerful lower jaw combine with oddly small plump hand long straight black hair and dark complexion all point to the pituitary with a secondary adrenal effect he pulse be slow accord to corvisart he personal physician rarely above 50 to the minute he sexual life he libido be abnormal curiously explosive in they appearance and manifestation be he sexual impulse they beset he on occasion which be sometimes inconvenient and a peculiarity about they be that they subside with equal suddenness if not immediately gratify or if meanwhile something occur to discourage he attention all woman be to he ` filles de joie ' sexual rather than social attraction in woman appeal to he he be never in love never possess of permanent affection or tenderness for any woman this explosive periodicity of the sexual life with a tendency to compression of it to the merely physical be another mark of some pituitary-centered personality two other phenomenon that persist throughout he life throw light upon he endocrine constitution one be trouble with he bladder which he tell antommarchus another physician bother he as long as he could remember irritability of the bladder be so pronounced that he could not sleep for more than a few hour at a time after battle the trouble become worse so that it interfere with he ride constitutional difficulty in urination have be connect definitely with the function of the pituitary the other pituitary disturbance which tincture he life be certain brain storm attack of vomit follow by stupor verge on unconsciousness bring on by outburst of temper physical overexertion mental strain or sexual excitement it have be show that such epileptic tendency be present in subject of pituitary disease particularly those with pituitary instability in napoleon 's case the brain attack may have be crisis of pituitary insufficiency in a hyper-pituitary type this supposition be bear out by the headache which follow they the headache of a oversecreting pituitary compensate for a defect in its formation during he prime he intellect be mathematical logical and rational and remarkable for a prodigious memory such a intellect be the product of a extraordinary ante-pituitary that he never permit feeling to interfere with the dictate of he judgment a quality which render he the most unscrupulous careerist of history must be put down to a insufficiency of the post-pituitary what post-pituitary do to the brain cell and the organism as a whole to render they susceptible to sympathy and suggestion the social sublimation of the maternal instinct with its offspring of religion and art we have see napoleon lack a chemical trace of the religious instinct he sympathy be nil and he conquest be make possible only because he be blind to the suffering and misery he greed for glory and dominion generate post-pituitary insufficient of this type patent or conceal gradually become corpulent as they grow older the increase corpulency of napoleon be comment upon by all observer a student of he make-up and acquaint with present development concern the internal secretion give a opportunity to observe he as we have when he be alive and at the height of he success would have have every reason for class he a pituitary-centered ante-pituitary superior post-pituitary inferior with a instability of both that would lead to he final degeneration besides he insatiable energy indicate a excellent thyroid he pugnacity animality and genius for practical affair a superb adrenal give the kind of pituitary he possess with its great intellectual potential energy and the relation between the two part which would further the object of a intellectual machine plus a remarkable thyroid and adrenal plus the military education napoleon have and the character of the revolution into which he be plunge and we have the condition out of which he career emerge as inevitable that it be he pituitary which first fail he rather than the thyroid or adrenal which might have be demonstrate by a number of consideration before he make himself emperor it be notice that he be become fat a pituitary symptom a comparison of portrait at different stage of he rise and fall show a increase abdominal paunch and a lay down of fat in the pituitary area around the hip the leg and so on the beginning of weakness in judgment that he be to exhibit soon in the invasion of russium manifest itself at the same time he keen calculate ability attain the peak of its curve at austerlitz jena and friedland thereafter the descent begin a rash grandiose speculative quality enter he project and divorce the elaborate coordination of means and end from he plan that he thyroid energy capacity do not fail he be indicate by the fact that at st alban he would ride for three hour at the end of the day to tire himself sufficiently for sleep that he adrenal be not affect be indicate by the brutality which remain characteristic to the end of he life the finding after death confirm the view of he as a unstable pituitocentric who succumb to pituitary insufficiency toward the latter half of he life we possess the account of the postmortem by dr henry who perform it the whole surface of the body be deeply cover with fat over the sternum where generally the bone be very superficial the fat be upward of a inch deep and a inch and a half or two inch on the abdomen there be scarcely any hair on the body and that of the head be thin fine and silky the whole genital system -lrb- very small -rrb- seem to exhibit a physical cause for the absence of sexual desire and the chastity which have be state to have characterize the deceased -lrb- during he stay at st helena -rrb- the skin be notice to be very white and delicate as be the hand and arm indeed the whole body be slender and effeminate the pubi much resemble the mon veneri in woman the muscle of the chest be small the shoulder be narrow and the hip wide in other word the typical feminization of the body which accompany pituitary insufficiency be find he die of a cancer of the stomach but before he death there be note the mental transformation that succeed deficiency of he central endocrine apathy indolence fatigability and frilosity be what impress he associate at st helena the deterioration of he mentality be also exemplify in he literary diversion the siege of troy and the essay on suicide the puerility of these production as well as of he conduct a sulk before he captor and the decline of he physical energy once a bottomless well all point to the same conclusion the rise and fall of napoleon follow the rise and fall of he pituitary gland no better illustration exist of the fundamental determination of a personality and its career by a endocrine aside from other factor of education environment accident and opportunity without the sort of endocrine equipment he be bear with however none of the other factor would have find the material to work upon bear say with more of a posterior pituitary than he have which would have render he more sensitive to the suffering of he fellow-creature if nothing else and the force of the revolution probably would have swamp he from the very first moment of he emergence at toulon when the whiff of grape-shot symptom of a inexorable merciless intellect and will start he upon the road that lead to the napoleonic era destiny be always ironic for the deficiency of the internal secretion which make he eligible for glory be responsible as well as for he downfall epilepsy and migraine in genius in the annals of genius there occur a number of instance of those who suffer from attack that have be diagnose epilepsy or migraine because they ailment be associate with they extraordinary ability they attract a attention that concern itself not at all with the circumstance that genius have also be liable to measles scarlet fever and so on epilepsy and migraine certainly occur in people of no supernormal gift and often in degenerate and subnormal yet the fact remain that these affection of the nervous system so terrible to feel and to behold have afflict the finest brain of the race about forty year ago the idea establish itself that epilepsy exhibit itself in one form or another as fit and migraine the severe periodic sick headache be interconvertible manifestation of the same underlie morbid process in the brain nothing in the way of a concrete cause attackable on the material side be elicit by this generalization then the investigation of the pituitary in the last decade produce evidence of epilepsy-like and migraine-like symptom in sufferer from tumor or other enlargement of it reasoning back case of epilepsy and migraine begin to be examine for evidence of involvement of the pituitary in they trouble these accumulate rapidly the physiognomy and physique of the pituito-centric be discover in they the phenomenon note in napoleon 's case be often present : lowering of the pulse chilliness and a increase irritability of the bladder in woman the attack often coincide with the menstrual period a typical time of endocrine unbalance finally x-ray examination of the sellum turcica the bony lodging of the pituitary clinch the matter : it often appear small or enlarged with erosion of the bone signify a desperate attempt of the gland to grow and meet the need of the organism the complex of appearance call migraine now become understandable there be a number of factor such as fatigue intense cold or high sugar food like chocolate which will cause a engorgement of the gland with blood and swell of it but they do not concern we now intense mental occupation concentration as the popular term have it act as a patent excitor of the attack brain work drive more blood into the brain and the gland besides mental activity be accompany by increase function of the ante-pituitary if intellectual or of the post-pituitary if emotional brain work then cause a temporary enlargement of the gland if now the bone container of the endocrine be too small to permit of much swell the bone will be press against or even worn into this mean headache severe easily go on to the kind know as sick-headache the nerve which move the eye in various direction lie next to the pituitary if in its expansion it move sufficiently outward it may press upon irritate they or paralyze and so evolve various eye disturbance in association with the headache no one can overrate this conception of migraine for a number of man of genius have suffer from sick-headache and eye symptom as for epilepsy the problem be more complex one have to rule out first those who have organic destructive disease of the brain but they be out of we field : genius predicate at least a intact brain of the other a number may be interpret upon a endocrine basis at least they will in they physiognomy physique mentality conduct and character document the glandular constellation under which they live and a proper understanding of which be necessary for they to be help one frequently see be the thymo-centric with small enclosed sellum turcica the latter fact explain the occurrence of the epilepsy periodic variation in the secretory tide of the other endocrine the ovary the thyroid and so on may determine the onset of the attack of fit the point be that when epilepsy play a constant part in the life history of a man of genius we be justified in assume a disturbed balance among he hormone and so a reason picture perhaps of the foundation for the erratic in he behavior or he production the neurasthenic genius the fin de sicle intelligentsia of the nineteenth century be quite stir up by a publication of max nordau on degeneration in which a number of revered artist and intelligent be hold up to public scorn as degenerate and neurasthenic so work up be they in fact that bernard shaw be move to compose a defense entitle the sanity of art in spite of the great vegetarian 's dialectic it remain to be explain why a certain species of creative ability have be combine with the fatigability variability and general wretched irritability of every organ and tissue in the body which teach they that they be sensitive soul imprison in the flesh go from doctor to doctor as from pillar to post from this medical creed to that hygienic cult lucky to escape the worst often landing upon the bosom of new think for succor we have note in previous chapter the relation of neurasthenia to the gland of internal secretion in general and to adrenal insufficiency in particular a closer examination of neurasthenic genius will show it to consist essentially of a pituitocentric in whom for one reason or another congenital -lrb- the persistence of the thymus -rrb- or acquire -lrb- shock accident disease -rrb- there have be failure of the adrenal thyroid or the interstitial cell about in the order of they occurrence the case of nietzsche friedrich nietzsche be about as good a case as there be on record of a genius blast by migraine the originality and force of he mind as well as the articulate music of a imaginative poet place nietzsche among the philosophic elect of the race show that he be a unstable pituitary-centered of a certain type will throw light upon he malady as well as upon he life and work in a set of volume entitle biographic clinic dr george m gould of philadelphium contend that the ill health of a number of man and woman of genius of the nineteenth century be due to unconnected eye trouble in attempt to bolster up he thesis he have collect biographic material useful to the student of personality he never appear to have ask himself what be behind the eye trouble the evidence relate to nietzsche 's endocrine personality be derive from some of the datum he collect as well as from the two volume life of the philosopher write by he sister and the other biography of he extant to reconstruct the endocrine formulum or equation of nietzsche inductively one should analyze first the information available concern he parent and relative he grandfather be a conservative bourgeois of a superior type who be the author of treatise design to narcotize the force of rebellion of he time what he be like physically no epitaph declare he father be a clergyman a description of he read tall and slender with a noble and poetic personality and a peculiar talent for music short-sighted that rank he at once as a pituito-centric the mother be dark and have a fiery temper and come of a family distinguish for the powerfully build anatomy of its member in the heredity of nietzsche the father appear therefore to supply a pituitary predominate element the mother a adrenal-pituitary predominate element nietzsche himself work strenuously at the intellectual life -lrb- after 20 when he probably stop grow and the brain tonic action of the ante-pituitary could manifest itself -rrb- early distinction reward he with a professorship in philology at 24 one of prussium 's war of conquest entangled he and present he with diphtheria a friendship with richard wagner mark the turn point of he life and the point of departure for he work on the most fundamental value of human life meanwhile attack of sick-headache of vary degree of severity make he miserable periodically -- they come about every two week and last two to three day -- and leave he wretched and exhaust at last at 44 a species of stroke terminate he suffering cause he to lose he speech and memory and thenceforth there be progressive deterioration physical and spiritual with repeat attack in the sister 's biography there be several good photograph and reproduction of sculpture of nietzsche at different age a examination of the frontispiece picture which show he in profile -lrb- profile view be the best for physiognomy -rrb- as well as of the bust of nietzsche by donndorf exhibit the most striking trait of the head to the student of internal secretion the most prominent feature of the face emphasize by both the camera and the artist be the remarkable prominence of the supra-orbital arch the bony protuberance from which the eyebrow spring this be a definite pituitary character the eyebrow themselves be luxurious and slope to meet the bony development of the face as a whole be sharp and clean-cut the skull tend to be long and narrow and the chin be square all these point to a pituitary-centered personality it be to be regret that we have no picture or record of nietzsche catch smile which would have preserve the state of he tooth for we at any rate consider as check to my interpretation he physiognomy and physique the nature of he genius and the attack which finally ruin he life all fit into the conception of he as one whose life center like napoleon 's around what be happen in he sellum turcica the attack of sick-headache diagnosable symptomatically as migraine be so devastating that in 1883 after the printing of he masterpiece also sprach zarathustra he write my life have be a complete failure extract from he letter collect by gould provide some idea of he suffering in 1888 just before he stroke he say i have in my eye a dynamometer of my entire condition the history of nietzsche 's eye trouble make it probable that not simply a defect in he eye themselves but a deeper condition behind they be responsible up to the age of 15 he be a model scholar essential eye defect of refraction should make themselves feel during childhood then with adolescence he change adolescence be one of the red-letter epoch for the pituitary when its growth and enlargement precede and stimulate the ripening of the sex cell in the reproductive organ until adolescence end and physical development cease he intellectual interest be nil and he be particularly backward in mathematics cold and cough and recur pain in the head and eye bother he -lrb- cold and cough be frequent in those whose pituitary expansion be limit by the bony sellum turcica to any extent -rrb- after he puberty migraine definitely become he demon companion follow the diphtheria in the army -lrb- which must have damage he adrenal -rrb- the attack grow much worse and complaint about they more bitter because the pituitary now in addition to its own burden have to compensate for the insufficient adrenal so he frequent illness make he more and more a subject of treatment and commiseration if only my eye would hold out it seem to I at the age of 30 as if i have live 60 year very frequent suffering of stomach head and eye acidity oppress I and everything except the tenderest food become acid i can not doubt that i be the victim of a serious cerebral disease and that stomach and eye suffer only from this central cause half-dead with pain and exhaustion in December 1888 he fall have to be help home lay silent for two day then become loud active and unbalanced the attack be precede by the drinking of much water the specific quality of the nietzsche genius also direct attention to a pituitocentric to a pituitocentric in whom both ante-pituitary and post-pituitary be extraordinarily well-functioning but be in a state of unbalance in which the post-pituitary get the upper hand now as we have see the post-pituitary make for that instability of association between the brain cell which must be at the bottom of originality and creative thought as well as of phobia obsession hysteria and hallucination person in whom the post-pituitary predominate have a lively fancy and be liable to suffer from the trick of association nietzsche as we have note be poor in mathematics and in the calm cool proportion forward march of scientific thought in general he most brilliant idea come to he in flash and gleam that be why so much of he work have come down to we in the form of aphorism and paragraph he be essentially a poet among the metaphysician which again favor the conception of he as a pituitary-centered with a dominant post-pituitary yet he incisive critical faculty as well as he love of music also document the supernormal ante-pituitary to sum up the physique and physiognomy of nietzsche he migraine attack and the later fate which overtake he he likes and dislike he taste ability and accomplishment follow from he composition as one pituitary-centered with post-pituitary domination a superior thyroid and inferior adrenal darwin as a neurasthenic genius charle darwin as the author of the origin of species and the greatest revolutionist of the nineteenth century have naturally have a great deal of attention pay to he life and personality yet not until the publication of he autobiography and he son 's reminiscence be it generally know that he suffer from chronic ill health for most of he adult life dr wa johnston in a article in the _ american anthropologist _ 1901 have marshal a number of available fact to sustain he thesis that darwin be a victim of neurasthenia now neurasthenia it be now accept be simply a waste-basket word correspond to the class miscellaneous in a classification of any group of real object and as have be emphasize in precede chapter most neurasthenia rise upon a disturbed endocrine foundation most often a insufficiency of the adrenal that be a defect in the chain of co-operation balance and compensation among the internal secretion be the basis for the weakness of the nervous system the term neurasthenia be suppose to explain actually only name darwin 's case be pretty certainly that there can be no doubt that darwin have a abnormal fatigability a lack of stamen and endurance in mental as well as physical application which plague he from the late twenty to the sixty as a child he be strong and healthy fond of outdoors and though underrate by he teacher note to be possess of intense curiosity especially concern natural object at school he be a fleet runner and cultivate a habit of long walk then he be surely no neurasthenic three year which he himself afterwards say be worse than waste at cambridge be fill with shooting ride and hunting he good health last until the time he probably stop grow at 21 or 22 thereafter he trouble begin what be darwin so far as he endocrine composition be concern in the first place he father be a variety of pituitocentric of the post-pituitary inferior type six foot two inch tall exceedingly corpulent and in the eye of he son the sharpest of observer and the most sympathetic of man he wish to make a physician out of he son in order to carry on the medical tradition of the family : erasmus darwin be a physician before he he son however show no inclination for so learn and confine a profession and have to be reproach by he father in these immortal word : you care for nothing but shooting dog and rat-catching and you will be a disgrace to yourself and all you family cambridge come after edinburgh as he be rush from medicine into the clergy but in vain a friendship strike up with a naturalist henslow settle he career for he henslow hear of a trip of general exploration the ship _ beagle _ be to take and recommend darwin as naturalist the captain at first would not hear of the proposal because of darwin 's nose a typical pituitary proboscis but he prejudice be overcome and darwin sail it be upon this voyage that darwin make himself the greatest naturalist of all time and at the same time infected himself with the virus of neurasthenia at plymouth while wait for the ship to sail he complain of palpitation and pain about the heart probably due to a transient hyperthyroidism bring on by excitement during the voyage which last five year he be afflict often by sea-sickness a ship-mate relate that after spend a hour with the microscope he would say old fellow i must take the horizontal for it and lie down he would stretch out on one side of the table then resume he labor for a while when he again have to lie down already fatigability have to be feed with rest a serious illness that darwin claim affected every secretion of he body act probably as the exhausting drain upon he adrenal potential the return to england be the date of onset for a record of continuous illness aggravate by he marriage apparently for he misery increase progressively after it so much so that he be force to leave london altogether so as to avoid the strain of social life even that of meet he scientific friend or attend scientific society meeting fatigue he to exhaustion after such occasion there would be attack of violent shiver with vomit and giddiness it be necessary for he to impose upon himself a absolute rgime of daily routine any interference with it upset he completely and make it impossible for he to do any work early morning be the only time for physical as we as mental exertion evening find he thoroughly use up with every move a effort insomnia make he its prey a curious sensitiveness to heat and cold distressed he in 1859 when the origin of species appear he write to a friend that he health have quite fail and that indigestion headache with a loom hopeless breakdown of body and mind make he life a burden and a curse the twenty year of research he devote to the problem of evolution be one long torture for sixteen more year during which he work upon and produce immortal classic of biology he be the most wretched and unhappy sufferer from neurasthenia he life be a continuous alternation of small dose of work and large dose of rest so he be enable to publish twenty-three volume of original writing and fifty-one scientific papers live a sort of quasi-sanitarium life with the rule and regulation of one undergo a rest cure for thirty-six year he thus accomplish infinitely more than the million who have lead the strenuous life that he thus survive as a genius among the peril of a intellectual nature in a environment for which he adrenal sentence he to destruction must be put down in large measure to the ministration and good sense of wife and child who supply he with the endocrine energy he lack all these detail i have give in the attempt to analyze the internal secretion constitution of this great man of genius to establish that he really suffer from inadequate function of he adrenal gland for the symptom of chronic though benign adrenal insufficiency coincide in they mass effect with the story of he life he be not a good animal as herbert spencer declare be a first sine qua non of the successful life he be a poor animal the poorest of animal because he possess poor adrenal what save he be he congenitally superior pituitary -lrb- the nidus of genius -rrb- and the overact thyroid which combine to compensate to some extent for he fundamental lack accord to he son he rise early because he could not lie in bed and he would have like to get up earlier than he do what other hint have we that in spite of he fatigue disease he be a pituitocentric the record of he physique and physiognomy documentary and that leave in portrait and photograph he be tall and thin and he frame be naturally strong and large face be ruddy and he gray eye look out from under deep overhang brow and bushy eyebrow the ear be large and prominent the hair straight the nose broad and well develop all these be distinctive pituitary trait the photograph of he take by maull and fox in 1854 show he chin to be the square firm kind that go with the ante-pituitary type physique -lrb- this photo be the frontispiece of the collection of essay entitle darwinism and modern science edit by ac seward and publish in 1909 -rrb- charle darwin we may say then live the life of one with a hyperfunction pituitary the anterior portion dominate the posterior a thyroid excess and a adrenal much deficient the combination settle the fate of a grand intellect in a invalid it be interesting to note that a extant portrait of erasmus darwin darwin 's distinguished grandfather show a pituitocentric but with a rounder head and a fatter face which point to a predominance of the post-pituitary over the ante-pituitary correspondingly he be more speculative and poetic intellectually than he grandson and more irascible and imperious in he mood after 1872 when charle darwin be sixty-three year old a marked change for the better occur in he health for the last ten year of he life the condition of he health be a cause of satisfaction and hope to he family he be able to work more steadily with less fatigue and distress afterwards this be probably to be explain as follow the gonadopause hi he -- the cessation of activity of the interstitial cell after this event the adrenal in the male nearly always function more efficiently and well be be improve even though the blood pressure often rise coincidently in the relative vigor of that decade we have another bit of evidence that the adrenal have much to say over darwin 's life epileptic genius he have a fever when he be in spain and when the fit be on he i do mark how he do shake : ` tis true this god do shake he coward lip do from they color fly and that same eye whose bend doth awe the world do lose he lustre : i do hear he groan -- julius caesar epilepsy the fall sickness or fit be generally associate with a deterioration or degeneration of mentality and a inferior personality be frequently a ingredient progressively increase datum accumulate to incriminate more and more a disturbance of the endocrine balance on the side of multiple deficiency as the basic mechanism at the bottom of a good many of they concurrent study reveal that abnormality of the thyroid the parathyroid the ovary and testis and even the thymus exist behind the attack investigation of the content of the consciousness of the different kind of epilepsy from this point of view will doubtless bring to light some interesting information there be much to be do for the epileptic with this new method of approach epilepsy just the same may occur in man gifted with the sort of transcendent ability call genius mohamm lord byron dostoyevsky flaubert to name a few case be famous instance the point to be settle be whether epileptic genius that be epilepsy with superior ability occur most often in pituitocentric the epilepsy be symptomatic of a pituitary struggle against barrier tug against bond as mention in such case epilepsy appear as the twin brother of migraine in genius should that be establish we should have more evidence for the pituitary dominance of most specimen of intellectual power as a case in point let we take the most famous of the epileptic genius -- julius caesar when the fit be on i marked how he do shake ti true this god do shake accord to plutarch julius caesar be of slender build fair-complexioned pale emaciate of a delicate constitution -lrb- remind we of darwin -rrb- subject to severe headache and violent attack of epilepsy in view of the work of cush the concurrence of severe headache and violent attack of epilepsy be sharply suggestive of a pituitary origin for both in he seventeenth year he be already engage to be marry which prove he precocity a overactive erratic pituitary could here also be hold responsible soon after he be proscribe by the dictator sullum and the first of a series of epileptic convulsion be record shock try the pituitary as well as the adrenal he sexual libido be of the quality that stimulate he soldier to sing celebration of he exploit the first woman he be engage to be jilt cornelium he first wife he divorce on the ground that caesar 's wife must be above suspicion matrimony commit twice thereafter land he in the divorce court he devote himself to liaison one with cleopatra this sexual hyperactivity be probably another pituitary trait the compound of intellectual and practical ability he realize be of the rarest it mean a most delicate balance between he ante-pituitary post-pituitary adrenal and thyroid he be a orator politician historian conqueror and statesman that he thyroid function well can be deduce from a career which involve more than three hundred personal triumph as recognition from he native city on horseback ride without use he hand he would often dictate to two or three secretary at once the masculine love of glory and ambition expression of a well-working ante-pituitary be combine with the effeminate echo of a equally well-evolved post-pituitary no prima donna be more concern with the care of she skin complexion and hair than he the analogy extend even to superfluous hair which he have remove not by the modern electrolysis but by depilation with forceps and main force the attendant at he bath would polish he epidermis for he satisfaction until it resemble alabaster or marble caesar be not the kind of great man that darwin be and only a rather muddle careerist because he have too much adrenal and post-pituitary but he be pituitocentric of a certain type we possess no authentic portrait or bust of he to go by but the bust in the museum of naple for which he probably sit -lrb- some hg well among they will not accept this -rrb- present the sort of face that be often see in pituitary epileptic and the feature and skull of a pituitocentric : long large well-modeled head eyebrow prominent with tendency to meet aquiline nose and strong chin in these three napoleon nietzsche and caesar we have male pituitocentric exhibit diversity of life and taste because of difference in the co-working endocrine gland in they makeup we shall consider now a female pituitocentric who present the strangest contrast in physique physiognomy conduct and character dependent upon a variation in the balance between the two portion of the pituitary the legend of florence nightingale all biography consist of prevarication and all autobiography of fiction that sum up of a mass of literature over which industrious student have ruin they eye hold good until after the war when thing change then mr lytton strachey at one fall blow and with one magnificent masterpiece hurdle the old idol and establish a new standard of deliberate accuracy in print in he eminent victorian he set the pace for the host of those who have be stimulate by he good example like lady margot asquith of the four victorian respectable worthy strachey have dissect as ruthlessly as the anatomist a post-mortem he portrait of florence nightingale the founder of the modern science and art of nursing be most interesting because it provide datum of the utmost value to the student of the endocrine basis of human personality in the conventional two-volume biography of this superwoman she be picture as a intellectual saint step from a stain glass window upon she wonderful visit to a clay-smeared earth the biographer present all the in and out of she body and soul as he have make she live before we with a fresh vitality that be startling the species of life florence nightingale live involve as it do struggle with a masculine world and conquest of it imply the existence in she of certain masculine trait and mark for the normal feminine psyche be submissive rather than aggressive toward its environment human and otherwise belong to a family in the highest circle it be upon the table d'hte of she destiny that she should become a regulation debutante careeristina and successful wife and mother instead she choose to question the whole routine of the life of she class and in she diary she record she doubt and craving and she revolt against what be assume by she family and friend to be the normal course of existence for she the attitude and questioning in these passage the religious feeling display be distinctly masculine most easily could the follow for instance pass as have be write by a man : i desire for a considerable time only to lead a life of obscurity and toil for the purpose of allow whatever i may have receive of god to ripen and turn it some day to the glory of he name nowadays people be too much in a hurry both to produce and consume themselves it be only in retirement in silence in meditation that be form the _ man _ who be call to exercise a influence upon society in a note-book she put may 7 1852 as the date upon which she be conscious of a call from god to be a savior now the vast majority of woman who have remain spinster at 32 in spite of considerable personal attraction and high natural ability be visit by wave of emotional fervor for a de-personalization of the self but in the case of the subject as strachey have so well show the call be pursue with a self-willed pitiless unscrupulous determination worthy of satan himself upon the most ferocious evil bent in its pursuit indeed she become what she latest biographer have call a woman possess by a demon all necessary not alone because if she have be meek and mild she would have exist in futility but because of the high percentage of the masculine endocrine in she composition it be most regrettable that we have no statement of the finding of a gynecologic examination of she that she be almost consciously masculine may be infer not only from the way she bully lord pannure and work to death she dearest friend with the angelic temper sidney herbert who be so amiable that he could be drive by one who write : i have do with be amiable it be the mother of all mischief she could also write i attribute my success to this : i never give or take a excuse yes i do see the difference now between I and _ other man _ when a disaster happen i act and they make excuse lytton strachey have paint superbly all this in he essay but for we he most significant passage be the following : when old age actually come something curious happen destiny have wait patiently play a queer trick upon miss nightingale the benevolence and public spirit of that long life have only be equal by its acerbity she virtue have dwell in hardness and she have pour forth she unstinted usefulness with a bitter smile upon she lip and now the sacredness of year bring the proud woman she punishment she be not to die as she have live the sting be to be take out of she : she be to be make soft she be to be reduce to compliance and complacency the change come gradually but at last it be unmistakable _ there appear a corresponding alteration in she physical mould _ the _ thin angular _ woman with she haughty eye and she acrid mouth have vanish and in she place be the _ round bulky form _ of a _ fat old lady _ smile all day long then something else become visible the brain which have be steel at scutarus be indeed literally grow soft senility -- a ever more and more amiable senility -- descend we have here a absolutely typical pituitary history with another case of pituitocentric natural ability what happen when pituitary hyperfunction or superiority become underfunction or inferiority be precisely as strachey have describe so cleverly of the minister angel : the acrid thin and keen degenerate every time into the amiable fat and dull just as napoleon be transform by the mutation of he pituitary so be the saint with the lamp and in both instance the contrasting modification from one extreme of glandular function to the other supply we with the clue to the secret hand of they inner be and become which work upon the twist and turn of circumstance about they as a sculptor upon clay the official biography by sir edward cook contain three portrait represent three different stage which bear out the pituitocentric thesis of she personality and life history one as she be at 25 and picture by mr gaskell : she be tall very straight and willowy in figure thick and shortish rich brown hair very delicate complexion perfect tooth perfect grace and lovely appearance she be so like a saint the face be long and oval of the post-pituitary kind then gradually the ante-pituitary gain a ascendency in the concert of she internal secretion so color she life with its masculine tint and alter she face as well as she disposition the photograph of she take when she be 38 show a quadrangular outline and all the acridity that impress strachey the last picture of she a water color draw make in 1907 show a round visaged old dame who might be the peasant grandmother of two dozen descendant little patch of red over the cheek bone remind one of myxedema and indicate that toward the very end of she life she thyroid fail she as well as she pituitary so that we biographer relate : then by royal command the order of merit be bring to south street and there be a little ceremony of presentation sir dougla dawson after a short speech step forward and hand the order of the insignia to miss nightingale prop up by pillow she dimly recognize that some compliment be be pay she ` too kind -- too kind ' she murmur and she be not ironical in the day of pituitary and thyroid hyperfunction we may be sure she would have be caustically and penetratingly ironical the explanation of oscar wilde the case of oscar wilde as one of the high tragedy of english literature and life attract the attention of the whole world in its heyday and even today evoke controversy as a literary figure and artist the poet of the portrait of dorian gray and de profundis belong without a doubt to the immortal as a convict criminal who serve for two year at hard labor in read jail and afterwards a prey to chronic alcoholism die in obscurity in paris he still remain a subject of whisper conversation in private and he crime a taboo to the public mentionable only at the risk of arouse the terrible odium sexicum of the prurient majority oscar wilde be a homosexual of a certain type in view of the previously lay down consideration concern the endocrine genesis of homosexuality how be we to explain he and he natural history as with the other exemplar of genius examine we need here too to gain some insight into he internal secretion heredity he father sir william wilde be a surgeon photograph of he show the long and broad face of a pituito-adrenal centered individual with a corresponding duplex incarnation in the face the upper half strikingly spiritual the lower curiously animal he be active practical and eminently successful he wife recall florence nightingale in face figure and conduct -lrb- people who be build alike as regard they internal secretion be those whom we recognize as similar physically and psychically -rrb- she too be a pituito-adrenal and in so far resemble she husband but as in a woman ante-pituitary and adrenal superiority make for masculinity she must be class as a masculinoid type of woman she be socially aggressive and take part in the revolutionary movement of she time in ireland thus we find that oscar wilde be the result of a mating of internal secretion act in the same direction the process might be compare to parthenogenesis it be on record that when enceinte he mother often express the wish that she child be a girl when a boy be bear she be immensely disappoint to compensate for she disappointment she bring he up a good deal like a little girl she have he dress in girl ' clothes at a age when most boy be violent destroyer of clothing she would hang massive jewelry upon he for the delight of play with the resultant stage picture as a satisfaction for she discontented desire in the light of modern psychology and we formulization of she endocrine status we must put down she conduct to a suppress homosexual craving have she son be build along the line of strong emphatic masculinity she influence though vicious would probably have find no congenial soil and would have die out altogether after he contact with the outer world begin with school no matter how she would have condition he vegetative system temporarily he internal secretion release then from compression would have assert themselves and determine he fate differently however it be quite possible that if such have be the case oscar wilde the aesthete the paradoxer the disciple of walter pater and baudelaire would have stay in the land of the to be bear i mean that then we would not have have oscar wilde but another person genius or commonplace who also might have bear the name of oscar wilde that be not to be the singular assortment of endocrine that mingle they activity to make oscar wilde shape a personality which we must classify as the thymocentric -lrb- thymus-centered -rrb- why this should be so be a interesting question pituito-adrenal plus pituito-adrenal of he heredity should make two pituito-adrenal accord to elementary arithmetic and the rule of three a cancellation of the two factor of the equation rather than addition seem to have occur the result be a persistent thymus superiority with a instability of the other two main gland involve how do we know that oscar wilde be a thymocentric because in he fullest development he exhibit all the earmark of the thymus pattern we possess a number of good picture and description of he as he be really a contemporary and would probably be alive today if he have be put in a hospital for proper treatment instead of in prison a excellent description be that of henri de regnier 's : this foreigner -lrb- wilde -rrb- be _ tall _ and of _ great corpulence _ a _ high _ complexion seem to give still greater width to he clean shaven face it be the _ unbearded _ -lrb- glabre -rrb- face that one see on coin the _ hand _ be rather _ fleshy _ and _ plump _ the point of immediate interest be the height the complexion and the beardlessness one classic variety of the thymocentric be tall have a baby 's skin and have little or no hair on the face a passage from a narrative write by one of he warder confirm the last condition decidedly before leave he cell to see a visitor he be alway careful to conceal as far as possible he unshaven chin by means of he red handkerchief bristle on the chin with little or none on the cheek be the inference it be important to stress the thymocentric significance of this glabrosity of the face another sign to be put in italics be the quality of he voice it have be describe as a beautiful tenor when he have it under perfect control and high pitched and strident when under the influence of passion or temper such a voice would be the product of a larynx remain partly or completely in the infantile state as in a woman 's that and the large breast he be say to have have point again to the thymus-centered constitution all in all there can be no doubt that oscar wilde be a case of status lymphaticus the technical name for the thymus-centered personality as happen in a number of thymocentric he pituitary must have attempt to compensate for the endocrine deficiency always present in they the exceptional size of he head be a pituitary trait finding possibly make plenty of room for itself to grow for some unknown reason in a extraordinary fashion it reinforce the love of the beautiful that be part of the feminine post-pituitary nature with a intellectual ability and maturity that be at first all-conquering in the face of a society organize for pure masculine and pure feminine type disgrace and disaster at last overtake he with almost the ruthlessness of natural selection wipe out a unadapted sport suddenly crop up in a environment in prison he suffer from severe splitting headache which be probably due to change in he pituitary describe as be directly over the eye they haunt he until he death and may have have a good deal to do with the absinthe addiction he acquire the treatment of genius the problem of oscar wilde raise a ethical question that still remain to be finally answer grant that all of society should one day see he and he kind as a peculiar and specific constitutional product of a odd intermixture of internal secretion what should be do with he and they it be easy to play with word like degenerate but still we do not condemn imbecile idiot or defective or other substandard subnormal creature to the prison for the sake of the good opinion society would maintain of itself it send the latter nowadays to hospital sanitarium or they equivalent where protection for itself without punishment for they may be practice but be confinement or even treatment the solution for we have to consider what society would lose by cut such abnormal off from itself and they from its stimulation a number of artist have be build like oscar wilde musician in particular without they would there not be a great gap a yawning absence in the world 's culture modern diagnosis and modern therapy might have do a great deal for napoleon nietzsche julius caesar florence nightingale oscar wilde be they alive today and willing to submit themselves to scientific scrutiny the x-ray would tell we of the state of the pituitary and thymus in they chemical examination of the blood the condition of the thyroid and adrenal detail investigation of the body and mind a flood of light upon they malady as well as they personality therapy might have relieve napoleon of he attack and so halt the creep degeneration of he pituitary make waterloo impossible but then would we have have the emperor at all would there have be enough of that instability that drive on the genius to he goal nietzsche might have be relieve of he headache and caesar of he epilepsy -- but then would not -- with correction of the underlie stream of activity on the part of the other gland of the internal secretion to compensate -- they peculiar superiority and distinction and the fruit of they life as by-product have be destroy florence nightingale too might have be a softer and more human person but then would she have revolutionize the practice of nursing oscar wilde possibly might have be make over into a heterosexual but then would not the world be the poorer without de profundis let we ask to state the problem in the most general term : how much abnormality be we to tolerate -lrb- i speak of course of malignant abnormality and disregard benign abnormality altogether -rrb- for the sake of the valuable that be concomitant how much be we to stand of that which degrade the germ-plasm while it raise the mind-plasm of the race the flower of evil destroy or modify the root change the seed and the bud will bloom if at all not orchid but dull brown commonplace what means may be license for the attainment of a worthy end be perhaps the broadest aspect of the problem the instrument of man 's ascent to divinity may arouse he instinctive repulsion dislike and destructive passion the study of the internal secretion be put and will put the most powerful apparatus for the control of the abnormal into we hand what be we go to do with they it do not follow that because we be begin to understand the normal that we be to establish one fix absolute standard of the normal in view of all the possible mixture permutation and combination of the endocrine gland that may construct a individual it be possible to conceive a million type of normal for normality mean harmony the harmonious equilibrium between the hormone which tend to continue itself because it do no harm to itself so there be all sort and condition of man and woman who be class as normal we need create no inquiry into the value of raise the subnormal to the normal level it be when we come to consider the possibility of lower the supernormal -lrb- in certain respects -rrb- to the normal that we pause and hesitate traditional morality assist not but hinder we here whatever the race may ultimately decide it be safe to predict that it be now somewhat possible and will become more and more possible to regulate or even check the ill of genius without interfere with its highest evolution and expression for example bernard shaw to take a living man of genius be pretty visibly a pituitocentric of the well-balanced variety he have the height the facial feature the hand and the sort of mentality that run together in he endocrine make-up he also have the headache it be quite probable that feed he pituitary gland extract in the proper dosage would relieve he of he headache a process might be start in he pituitary however that would diminish its extraordinary output which have assist to make he brain so brilliant the possibility nevertheless be excessively remote as the pituitary predominance in he be so overwhelming that nothing short of surgery nature 's or the medical graduate 's could really affect that overmaster eminence the time will come though it be not yet by a long long road when we shall be able to intervene and perhaps meddle in nature 's most intimate plan the right of the power to modify like the power to kill will be define and limit by common agreement before that goal will be reach chapter xii application and possibility the knowledge that the shape and action of a man 's body as well as he mind depend on the internal secretion inspire the hope of the emergence of a hitherto inconceivable control power over human life in the future for in the wake of chemical discovery there have always come chemical control the nature of chemical research the necessity for clear thinking accurate measurement and experience in the actual handling of material the fundamental tradition and technique of the science have make and will make the practical application about which we today may only speculate what the study of the internal secretion suffer from at the beginning of the third decade of the twentieth century be insufficient appreciation of its meaning for mankind it be true that there be thousand of worker scatter throughout the world contribute they mite to the general store they increase yearly almost daily and they achievement in spite of a uncritical enthusiasm in some quarter and a semi-charlatanism in other have be and continue magnificent but they be peck at a mountain which require organize massive engineering organization for its blast the cry need be for a international institute endowed and equip for investigation upon the proper scale with all the available appliance and method already work out and at hand such a institution would possess the right chemical laboratory for the making of blood analysis metabolism examination and test of endocrine function there would be x-ray machine and expert to radiograph the pituitary pineal and thymus gland when possible there would be psychologist to carry out intelligence test determine emotional reaction and group mental aberration deficiency and defective there would be statistician train in biometric to criticize and compare datum obtain there would be anthropoligist to note and measure variation in angle and curve ratio and quotient of the external conformation of the body internist would record the history and status of the organ and viscera there would be librarian to collect abstract and collate the vast accumulate literature in short the mystery of personality the most marvelous complex and variable process in the universe would be attack and at length penetrate systematically and persistently with the ideal of absolute control of its composition as the goal in view the nature of the research they would be infinite in they variety and significance they practical by-product drop in the pursuit of knowledge by the scientist as atalanta 's lover the golden apple in he race to assuage the scent of the hard-headed business man would be profitable enough for any country in peace or war to pay for itself ten time over and at compound interest a volume could be fill with suggestion for interesting and promising investigation but we may glance at some of the immediately useful aspect that might exercise those concern with the everyday life of man woman and child the endocrine epoch of life there be no more famous classification of the epoch of life that mark off the milestone of the individual 's evolution than shakespeare 's seven age so different be he at those different stage of he development so change he body and mind that it have become a part of popular physiology that we be entirely make over every seven year and that no cell in the organism last longer than that the tradition certainly do not apply to the brain and nervous system for the number of brain cell be fix at birth and can not be increase only decrease because they be too highly specialize to reproduce themselves what transfigure the individual as the year go by be no simple wear and tear of the tissue nor the replacement of old cell by new it be the rearrangement of relationship among the ductless gland the shift of influence from the predominant to the subordinate and vice versa in the constellation of the internal secretion that determine the unfold of the personality the transformation raise doubt sometimes as to the reality of personal identity what actually happen in the change from childhood to adolescence from adolescence to maturity and so on be the sloughing of one internal glandular dominance for another growth as a general name for the mutation the ensemble of somatic and psychic differentiation from year to year pass through five epoch that be standard for the normal the normal be the be who harmonize with he environment and yet react with it because of recur need within he he endocrine equation settle what be unique and different in he but the gland which flourish during the epoch as its time of triumph when it have its day determine what make he like he fellow from this point of view it become permissible to speak of the five endocrine epoch similarity and resemblance of mind and body between people at a give period of life childhood youth maturity must be put down to they common government by the salient endocrine of the epoch so one may list : infancy as the epoch of the thymus childhood as the epoch of the pineal adolescence as the epoch of the gonad maturity as the epoch of whatever gland be leave in control as the result of the life struggle senility as the epoch of general endocrine deficiency infancy as the epoch of the thymus explain why in any give geographic locality the baby look alike and act alike specialist in the observation and treatment of infant have note that not until after the second year be any tendency to differentiation discernible to any extent among they it be only after the second year or somewhere around that time that the child begin to individuate and distinct individual trait and a personality manifest they outline the thymus be the great inhibitor of all the gland of internal secretion by its checking activity upon the other member of the endocrine system the thyroid and pituitary in particular it give the baby time to grow in bulk which be its chief business during the first two year of its existence it quadruple its birth weight the brain and nervous system complete they growth in mass by the end of the fourth year recall the experiment of gudernatsch work with tadpole who show that feed with thymus produce giant tadpole whose metamorphosis into frog be inhibit while feed thyroid produce frog the size of fly differentiation occur without the preliminary increase in mass usual as differentiation and bulk thus appear antagonistic at least at the beginning of growth the function of the thymus at a maximum during infancy seem then to be to restrain the differentiate endocrine until sufficient material have be accumulate by the organism upon which the differentiate process may work after the second year the thymus begin to shrink that be to say officially its involution begin careful dissection will demonstrate some thymus tissue even in a normal subject up to the fourteenth year this refer to the average normal for the large thymus may continue large and grow larger after the second year in the type of individual designate in a precede chapter as the thymocentric if the thymus retrogress after the second year what take its place as a brake upon the forward drive impulse of the other endocrine we have every reason for assign that rle to the pineal it perform its service mainly in all probability by inhibit the sex stimulating effect of light play upon the skin since it be especially a sex gland inhibitor the thyroid and pituitary become freer to exert they influence than under the thymus rgime and so we find that it be after the second year that thyroid and pituitary tendency manifest they effect the pineal era from the second to the tenth to fourteenth year remain to be investigate from a number of viewpoint interesting to the parent the educator and the student of puericulture precocity be directly related to early involution of the pineal for just as the thymus involute at the second year the pineal atrophy before the onset of adolescence adolescence be the period of stress and strain throughout the somatic and psychic organism because of the volcanic upheaval in the sex gland the history of the individual be dominate by they up to twenty-five or so when maturity commence in the sense of a relative sex stability they continue to exert a powerful pressure throughout maturity but life episode and crisis disease accident and struggle experience of pleasure and pain as well as climatic factor settle finally which endocrine or endocrine be leave in control as a consequence of the series of reaction the period of maturity may be analyze into the interpretation of senility senility inevitably follow maturity not as night follow day by a mathematical necessity but because of the process of degeneration which ultimately overtake all the gland of internal secretion dominant as well as subordinate just why the degeneration must occur no one can say injury to the endocrine organ of one sort or another range all the way from emotional exhaustion to bacterial infection be the reason usually consider sufficient just why recuperation and regeneration do not preserve they in the elderly as they do in youth be a problem to be solve when we understand the law of regeneration at present almost totally beyond we control some say that it be a matter of the wear and tear of we blood vessel those rubber-like tube which transport food and drainage with nonchalant equanimity to all cell as long as they last in the classic phrase : a man be as old as he artery ergo he ductless gland will be as old as they artery and the age of artery be simply a matter of wear and tear the resultant of the function which be universal among molecule arteriosclerosis the hardening of artery might be the whole story but there be certain experiment and consideration which rather confute that easy explanation or at least make clear that the mystery be not so simple the work of steinach a viennese investigator have contribute most to the elucidation of the nonarterial factor in senility no one have assert more loudly the importance of the interstitial cell that fill in the space between the tubule of the testis in the male and the follicle of the ovary in female rat have be he medium of study for they be most easily procurable live fastest breed and withstand experimental and operative procedure better than any other animal a old rat be like a old man in he dotage he bald shrivel skin cover a emaciated body he eye be dim by cataract and he breathing be labor and difficult because he heart muscle have lose its tone huddle in a corner life to he have become concentrated into the desire for a little food and immobility if now something be do to he sex apparatus a marvelous transformation may be effect that something no one could predict it consist in slit the genital duct which lead from the germinal cell to the exterior after the operation the germinal cell which grow into the spermatozoon atrophy and disappear since they can no longer function as if release from some restraint the interstitial cell however multiply enormously with they multiplication the miracle of rejuvenation be perform after some week the sluggish current of be in the rat which have slow down as a preliminary to stop altogether flow fast and furious wave of new chemical substance inundate he cell and they respond like the field that border the nile after the annual flood all he tissue skin muscle nerve even bone be restore a vitality be create which make he bind and dart like a youth of he species in due time though senility return it be as if a storage battery recharge run down and become dead again slit the genital duct of the other testis cause its interstitial cell to hypertrophy and multiply repeat the effect of the first experiment the organism respond again to the new wave of vitality that vibrate through it that it be recharge be demonstrate again by a revival of sex appetite and sex activity the female which have become a object of indifference be reinstate as a creature to be seek and pursue the second period end in its turn and now entirely new interstitial gland in the form of fresh testis remove from a young animal be transplant into the body of the old rat once more youth return but now it burn itself more quickly than even before a acute exhaustion of the mind appear first then all the other phenomenon of old age steal back upon the old rat and senility firmly establish in the saddle ride he to the end the possibility of rejuvenation whatever other deduction may be extract from these experiment they prove beyond a doubt the existence of a endocrine factor in the process of aging as well as a arterial they also demonstrate that the internal secretion of the sex gland well advertise as it have be as the elixir of youth that ponce de leon and brown-squard with so many other pursue in vain be not the whole story for if it be the duration of the new youth should be another span of life whereas in actuality it be only a fraction of that time this fact together with a number of other make clear that while the gonad may be the jeune premier of the drama the vitality of the plot depend upon the other endocrine since old age be a exhaustion permanent and irreparable of _ all _ the member of the ductless gland directorate the reason become clear for the temporary quality of the rejuvenation effect by the procedure of steinach practically then the question at once arise : which of the gland in particular be involve there be first that ubiquitous agent in the system the thyroid chemical analysis of it have show that the iodine content decrease with the age of the individual and become specially low after forty it be after the menopause in woman that myxedema the disease of complete degeneration of the thyroid and of the physical and mental faculty be most frequent the thyroid of old people exhibit in vary degree sign of a similar degeneration thyroid feeding properly control will clear up certain of the deterioration of mind and body observable in the aged the grossness of the feature lessen a number of the pain go muscular endurance increase memory and intelligence do not remind one so forcibly of the old dotard in he second childhood of course the improvement at present achievable be only relative but in the prematurely age decay invade a half accomplished maturity marvel have be achieve at time with feeding of the gland the pituitary too begin to retrogress after the period of maturity and a early retrogression mean a short maturity in woman the onset of a obesity and coincidently of a lazy and dull morale coincide with this declension of the pituitary power all the gland of internal secretion in fact shrink and shrivel as old age advance only as in other relationship the predominate endocrine stamp its signature more visibly upon the document of decadence than the other pituitary type as say get fat and slow thyroidal become bulky and stupid or thin and sour the adrenal dark shrunken and forever tire of life so type emerge even in all-around glandular deficiency the problem of rejuvenation be the problem of recharge or replace all of the gland of internal secretion at least the most important the thyroid the pituitary and the adrenal as well as the gonad longevity be perhaps largely a matter of prevent or postpone they wane beside there be the prophylaxis of bacterial infection and they all embrace corrosion -- which too have a endocrine aspect persistence of youth or juvenility may be manufacture by nature in two way there may be a persistence of early glandular predominance we have see what happen to the thymocentric that a pineal-centered juvenile or infantile type exist may be safely predict nature 's only other mode of secure perpetual youth seem to be by prolong the time allot to the sex gland crescendo as for the golden age of maturity itself what humdrum people and poet have despise as middle age the margin of reserve of the ruling hormone be a quantity almost malleable in we hand but still to be regard with respect as a hard cold proposition by the physiologist in general the continuance of any stage of development mean the maintain of the glandular administration peculiar to it so the chubby debonair irresponsible whom nothing can touch be happy in the possession of a pineal uncorrupted by the year while the genius who can turn out he best work at sixty-five must thank he pituitary for standing by he to the end the science of puericulture there be a specialty now grow in the womb of science which in its own good time will come to fruition as the study of the child 's need or puericulture even today there exist a scientific basis for the formulation of the principle upon which every child should be bring up though we have have marvelous result from the campaign to lower infantile mortality most of what have be do have be medical in its interest and so largely negative in its accomplishment the removal of the cause of evil no doubt give the good its opportunity but how to raise a child endowed with satisfactory ancestral stuff as a grade a normal or supernormal still remain to be erect into a exact science a number of attempt have be abortive in this field why they have fail to arouse the ardor of the parent have puzzle some of the pioneer child-culture as the foundation of all system of education have continue more or less of a hope rather than a achievement because of a lack of appreciation of the different constitutional variety of child a certain amount of attention have be lavish upon child need special attention those mainly suffer from insufficient development of one sort or another in the last decade or so a endeavor to focus upon the exceptional child exceptional in intelligence or some special creative endowment have start a interesting movement all of they have suffer from the fallacy and trouble of the pure psychologist who would handle mind as a entity in a vacuum a realization of the different physical and psychic educational need of various child will arrive only when we see they as build differently just as shoddy and silk cotton and wool alone or in combination all possess different quality as wear material so different child have vary capacity for the wear and tear of education the endocrine classification of the human race apply to child will here yield a harvest to the educator and to the country nothing be more evident than the diversified nature of the need of the various internal secretion type once they be realize as such the history of a thymocentric type for instance be predictable from the very first few month of he life difficulty in feeding in habit formation and adaptation in the reaction to infection in social play and so on one may expect for he the course of event for the other endocrine type also follow law of they own it will be above all in the _ understanding _ of child they make-up reaction and power that the biologist will achieve some of he finest triumph the educator will have to take account of the state of the pituitary in estimate the normal intelligence or influence the abnormal or subnormal intelligence as well will he have to consider the thyroid in the child whose conduct be refractory even though he proficiency in he study be excellent and the condition of the adrenal will be ascertain in the type that tire easily and that seem unable to make the effort necessary or desirable periodic seasonal and critical fluctuation in the equilibrium among the hormone will have to be take into account in the explanation of what have hitherto be put down to laziness naughtiness stupidity or obstinacy a child 's capacity for education essentially its capacity for the highest and most productive kind of life be limit by inherent factor these factor be two : the quality of the nerve tissue its ability to make a number of association and the quantity of the internal secretion measure by the maximum obtainable in a give situation these inherent factor explain too why child bear and breed in virtually the same environment show the most extreme difference in educability that the difference be inherit be make evident by galton 's finding that the chance of the son of a eminent man exhibit eminent ability be 500 time as great as that of the son of a man take at random every baby then be bear with a combination of nerve cell and ductless gland which determine its capacity for mental development that might never be realize but could never be exceed if in any family minor difference in educability be observe they can be put down to disturbance of these two factor occur after the fertilize germ cell have start to divide and reproduce itself but any marked fall off in either the nervous or endocrine factor have to be consider pathologic due to a impairment of they by adverse environment recent study have amply establish that the proportion of certifiable mental defective and of a much larger class the subnormal but not certifiable class be progress by leap and bound it be perhaps the most absurd frailty of we present system of education that it take almost no account of innate difference in educability to spend money upon the teaching of these child along line where they be unteachable be not only waste pure and simple but crime for it deprive the educable of they just due these of course be the crude and simple line upon which the finer and more complex evolution of the endocrine problem of the school child will build the fine art of education itself be crude and gross and simple compare with what it might be even as a begin the science of education have yet to begin as the offspring of that science of the future to which knowledge of the internal secretion will contribute no little the science of puericulture vocational education it be difficult indeed to avoid become merely enthusiastic upon the possibility of the application of the endocrine to the educational domain happiness for the average individual consist of a double success -- success in he vocation -lrb- choose or force upon he -rrb- and success in he sex life a certain hue and cry have be raise in the last few year concern the vast and overwhelming importance of sex in the happiness and even in the success of a man 's everyday life and no doubt there be a relation sublimation play its part in the explanation of vocational idiosyncrasy the fact however that perfect success in sex may occur with absolute failure in the career however split the problem for good into its reality : a physiologic aspect as well as a psychologic so as school education will have to take serious account of endocrine anomaly and possibility will the institution which select and train for a career vocational misfit have arouse the ardor of we efficiency expert and again the sweeping psychological attack have beat its head against the stonewall of ignorance of constitutional predisposition and tendency of material the attempt to erect psychologic type for vocational selection could never make much headway because it could only flounder in a swamp of metaphor product of the vice of its method not that anyone would wish to discard at all the psychologic mode of approach but no science in the sense of accurate examination be possible in the matter of classification for vocation without the insight into the physiology of the candidate that the analysis of he endocrine formulum will provide one need not dilate upon the value of such a examination civilization have not yet learn how to pick its personnel and so artist and scientist philosopher and politician financier and religious leader arise and survive by the operation of the law of probability and chance rather than by any intelligent selection and cultivation of material the case indeed be simply a subdivision of the vast subject : haphazard muddle in the conduct of life a cry have be raise for the superman and a cry have be raise for a method of anthropometry for the lack of these two it have be say all government have be doom to defeat the study of the endocrine will by no means supply a panacea but as it will furnish a means of approach to the determination of how man and woman be build and why they be build differently no one can gainsay the tremendous advantage to the nation that will proceed to classify its population accordingly and know its strength and weakness in term of the actual generator of success and failure suggestion have be offer in the precede page of concrete application of endocrine knowledge to the understanding of behavior of the genius and commonplace criminal and puritan and in the chapter on historic personage we track some of the story in detail this vein when explore will quarry untold riches it have be observe that financier of mark like great musician be special pituitary type also that the financier be voracious meat eater and the musician inordinately fond of sweet difference in anterior and posterior predominance might account for this that we be play here with no phantasy be prove by the fact that we can effect change of taste as well as of intellectual direction by appropriate feeding of various glandular extract just as much indeed as we can influence sex susceptibility and the reaction to sex stimulation by the artificial introduction from without of the proper hormone fatigue and industry in industry business and profession the biologist will come more and more to be call as consultant labor union as well as the large employer of labor and they employment manager have give much thought to the problem of fatigue just what fatigue be why different individual tire at different rate why some be construct for monotonous routine while other must have constant variety and change the relation to accident and to quantity output be a few of the major line of inquiry upon which the endocrine obviously have a large bearing to the employment manager labor turnover and the selection of personnel be adjacent field of research fatigue as a endocrine deficiency -- a depressed state of one or more of the gland of internal secretion abolish when its normal functioning be restore -- be a general principle from which departure of exploration of sub-problem will proceed a endocrine organ will secrete at a certain rate when it be stimulate excessively it will eject extra amount of its secretion how long the period of excessive stimulation may last must depend upon the secretion potential or margin of reserve of the cell vary from organ to organ and from individual to individual after that exhaustion and failure follow with the onset of the symptom of fatigue a pretty demonstration of this process have be work out in the electrical stimulation of muscle if a muscle say the biceps be irritated by a electric current it will contract as the strength of the current be increase the degree of contraction become greater a sort of stepladder effect of increase contraction may be thus obtain after a time the electric shock can not cause a greater contraction but only a lesser and if continue the muscle will cease to function because of fatigue if now when the muscle begin to lag in its response and its contraction to decrease one inject into a vein extract of thyroid parathyroid or adrenal gland they will immediately reinvigorate the fail contraction the injection must be make before the fatigue be carry to the point of absolute exhaustion it follow that these gland normally pour into the circulation substance which counteract the effect of fatigue substance and in fact make possible muscular recuperation from fatigue throughout the day as well as in emergency and crisis fatigue conventionally recognize be something acute and urgent as such it mean a violent drain of the endocrine well but there be also a chronic fatigue which have be dignified with the name of fatigue disease bernard shaw once ask for someone to tell he the name of the germ cause the symptom of overwork that be impossible he will have to be satisfy with the answer that it be not a germ but a internal secretion or rather a defect of internal secretion that be the cause whether or not the adrenal have be damage by past experience and upon they capacity to respond to the necessity of a occasion fatigue reaction primarily depend a quotation from sir jame mackenzie most distinguish of modern english student of medicine summarize the matter neatly abelous and langloi and albanese have study the relation of the adrenal body to fatigue they infer that the muscular weakness follow removal of the adrenal be due to toxic substance in view of we present knowledge of the physiological action of adrenaline in its various form it seem more probable that the weakness be to be explain by the absence of the normal tone produce internal secretion of the body in question in other word the adrenal regulate muscle tone they produce nature 's tonic for weary tissue the chronic lassitude of thousand of we generation suffer from that tired feeling may be put down to chronic adrenal insufficiency it require no superlative imagination to see that a adrenal poor subject do not belong upon a job that involve muscle stress over a long period or indeed fatiguing condition of any sort nor that a thyroid poor individual be not the best choice for a position that demand a keen alert body and mind in the selection of executive the nature and stamen of the pituitary will undoubtedly be take very seriously in the near future a certain hocus-pocus concern character read a perverted revival of the ancient phrenology and physiognomy have invade the employment territory in america as the newest charlatanism the study of the internal secretion include blood and x-ray examination will surely assist the demand for a truly scientific estimate of constitution and character that can be rely upon in the classification and distribution of personnel the prospects for public health by they effect upon the endocrine public health influence like food clothing sleep and overpressure and last but not least _ disease _ the so-called disease of childhood possess a tremendous importance in limit the output of the educable they act to subtract from and so to lower the rating the capacity of the germ-plasm most material and vital of these influence be the common disease of child for they strike directly at the gland of internal secretion measles scarlet fever diphtheria mumps and the other have long be accept as providential visitation for sin know or unknown that child have to have they and be better off when they have they have become part of the tradition of the laity foster by the lazy ignorance of previous medical generation but today we be begin to ask ourselves why child must have these endemic infection of they age the pathologist go farther and ask the reason for certain apparent immunity he ask why the little boy who sleep with he brother sick with scarlet fever do not contract the disease even though not protect by a previous attack determine why susceptibility to a special disease in a particular case exist will constitute the greatest line of advance for the understanding and prevention of disease and so the perfection of public health in the last influenza epidemic countless physician be puzzle by the spectacle of man and woman in the pink of condition carry off in twenty-four hour while puny associate be either pass over or pooh-pooh they cold pathologist have spend they energy fruitfully upon the infectious cause of disease the microbe and parasite especially but now have solve most of those problem the vital question of why a organism permit itself to be attack be push itself to the front why a peculiar ailment select its victim why the bacillus find a fertile soil be the neglect problem which must be solve before the abolition of disease and its carrier will be remotely conceivable long ago hippocrate revered founder of the art of medicine recognize that there be a specific affinity of disease for individual with more or less the same characteristic somatic and psychic trait and trend tuberculosis for instance be note for its frequency in long-skeletoned thin person remarkably optimistic and the plethoric choleric nature of the sufferer from gout have become proverbial before the era of the great bacteriologic discovery of the eighty and ninety the concordance of esoteric racial and personal marking be a great help in diagnosis to the physician for he realize though he sometimes credit it to he clinical intuition that it be a certain type of personality that be liable to the specific disease but personality and its reaction normal and abnormal be determine by the endocrine so we should find that particular infection run with special internal glandular predominance for the picture present by a infection temperature rash prostration be the detail of the general reaction of the organism in the face of a new situation the presence of a powerful destructive invader information have accumulate that the invader be powerful and destructive as well as selective because of endocrine deficiency of one sort or another in the body it have attack work of a number of investigator have indicate that a individual 's susceptibility or its reverse resistance be intimately subject to the derangement or harmony of the endocrine system comparison of the endocrine type and the disease assaulting have yield a even more interesting principle know the state of the internal secretion reservoir enable we to predict the liability to certain of these infection of childhood diphtheria have be find to occur most virulently among adrenal poor individual moreover they be leave poorer in adrenal afterwards it follow that they would be assist by the feeding of adrenal mumps be a sickness that sometimes permanently injure the gonad : the testis or ovary the thyroid dominant whose system be rich in thyroid will rarely suffer from any of the common disease of child -- if at all from measles op the other hand those who have every infection of the period and who as they mother say seem to get everything be those whose system be thyroid poor thyroid poverty be a splendid enticement to the universal microbe the thymocentric stand all disease poorly the pituitary type be more liable to epidemic meningitis and infantile paralysis typhoid and scarlet fever the public health officer of the future will be arm with a new weapon in he fight against the spread of a epidemic he will be able to classify the endocrine trait of the population expose and to advise a course of glandular feeding for the type specially liable the schick test for diphtheria susceptibility be a illustration of one method of approach to the problem of the epidemiologist in settle who need protection the endocrine will assist he in the great body of disease for which no immunity test be at hand should another influenza epidemic come along for instance the proper handling from the endocrine standpoint of the thymocentric and the related adrenocentric would help considerably in lower the mortality endocrine type have other tendency which when study and control will decimate the great assassin of middle age : heart disease and kidney disease with accompany degeneration of the blood vessel and circulation the adrenocentric tend to get up a hyperacidity of the stomach and a high blood pressure besides certain form of disease of the lung the thyrocentric be predispose to heart disease as well as intestinal disturbance the pituitocentric be liable to periodic and cyclic upset in he health narcotism the craving for narcotic or stimulant drug and its subvariety alcoholism have be find most often among the thymocentric any type of endocrine inferiority interfere with success in life may lead to the habit of drug addiction as one way out but the blood and tissue of the thymocentric appear to become habituate to the narcotic stimulant more easily than the other type and so to demand it with a physical imperative comparable to the food or sex urge among artist philosopher and statesman on the other hand actively productive and so contrast with criminal and degenerate drug addiction have frequently be a mode of endocrine compensation that be the drug produce temporarily the effect of the internal secretion lack or insufficient thus the effect of cocaine may be compare with the effect of thyroid but while there be a normal mechanism for thyroid detoxication the cocaine or heroin derivative mark the tissue permanently with they scar and deform the personality the hygiene of the internal secretion all these protean expression of endocrine determination may now begin to be look upon with the hopeful and optimistic attitude of he who understand cause and effect and can control the advance make in the last ten year in the practical manipulation of the ductless gland from without the introduction of glandular extract by feeding or injection and the modification of they structure and function by surgery the x-ray and radium and other procedure enable we to regard more confidently the problem hitherto accept as the insoluble and intricate handiwork of fate fate may have weave the pattern of we be but as we commence to probe the machinery and to examine the loom more carefully we begin to understand why the wheel creak and why there be seconds and odd lot in the product as well as the rare and precious first moreover we be learn how to handle the machinery ourselves the abdication of fate can therefore be confidently expect in due time however we have yet to begin and we can begin with prevention the theory of adler that some organ inferiority be responsible for much unhappiness in life have receive much advertisement in conjunction with the doctrine of the freudian it be a theory of little scope when apply to the eye ear heart and so on because only a small minority of the case be of that kind but as we have see a deficiency of a internal secretion a endocrine inferiority reverberate throughout all the cell not only the mind but all of the member of the organism must strain and co-operate to make up for the break in the balance endocrine inferiority be indeed the most frequent organic inferiority and we may explain a number of mental type upon that basis thus the inferior gonado-centric who have something wrong with he reproductive organ will evolve in one of two direction if he adrenal and thyroid be of poor quality he will become the secluded introvert shut off from the interest of normal life he will enter the borderland of insanity if pituitary difficulty supervene if on the contrary the adrenal thyroid and pituitary be present in a certain proportion he will become the active aggressive never-resting keen and relentless fanatic reformer a woman who be gonad deficient with a superior adrenal will suffer from virilism and specialize in the extreme tactic and mythology of the feminist movement a number of life reaction be classifiable as the striving of endocrine inferior individual to overcome they sense of inferiority the unconscious vegetative system and the system of consciousness be both modify by the weakness of a link in the glandular chain what therefore be to be recommend in the prophylaxis of the natural deterioration of the well of life the ductless gland for even if we may be able to replenish they when they dry up would it not be better to delay they dessication the hormone reply to every call of life and respond in every reaction the normal constructive process of they cell remanufacture what have be lose and the original capacity to respond be restore if though the rate of destruction and loss outrun the rate of repair and construction they will be permanently damage this be what occur in shock serious severe accident and injury prolong infection and disease profound continue emotion and the wear and tear of overwork the prevention of these excessive fatigue of the endocrine system in one or all of its part and especially the prevention and enfeeblement of the disease of child which injure they at a period when they be most sensitive to injury be the task of the endocrine hygienist periodic examination to check up the balance sheet of the hormone factory and to measure the amount of they damage by means of blood analysis will provide the most valuable method in the campaign to lengthen the productive and enjoy span of life the treatment of crime endocrine hygiene will discover no wider or more fruitful area for exploration and control than that of crime for more than a generation there have be attempt at a criminology and a new understanding and control of crime in the united state a concomitant sentimentalism have concoct measure like the honor system which naturally fail of they purpose have undermine confidence in the idea of scientific diagnosis and treatment of crime as someone have note to ask a criminal to promise not to misbehave when discharge from prison be like ask a typhoid fever patient to promise not to have a temperature above ninety-nine degree the next morning for a large proportion of criminal -- the percentage have yet to be determine although the most recent police commissioner of chicago have estimate it at ninety per cent -- punishment for a period of time and then let he go free be like imprison a diphtheria carrier for a while and then permit he to commingle with he fellow and spread the germ of diphtheria of course the doctrine of responsibility be all tangle up with we attitude towards and treatment of crime though clear thought make mandatory the recognition of a universal cause and effect law practical common sense have define free will consent or the withholding of consent to a give course of action have be the criterion of responsibility in practice the limitation of responsibility will depend upon the insertion of extraneous factor into the formulum of consent the pragmatic test have be and will be the probability that the correction of the somatic or psychic condition would have prevent or will prevent the consent to the crime as long as no such condition will be demonstrable society for its own protection will have to confine the unfortunate individual the character of the confinement its duration and the use to which it will be put should be dominate by the idea of discover the unknown criminal predisposition if crime be a abnormality scientifically studiable and controllable like measles court procedure and prison management will have to be transform radically there be scatter throughout the world now a group of people who be apply medical method to the diagnosis and treatment of crime they be the pioneer who will be remember in history as the compeer of those who transform the attitude toward insanity and its therapy the insane be once condemn and handle as criminal be in most civilized country yet the criminologic laboratory as a adjunct to the court of justice like that associate with the court of chief justice olson in chicago remain to be universalized what contribution to a more rational treatment of the criminal will the study of the internal secretion make it have be show that the greater number of convict be mentally and morally subnormal to explain the subnormality the criminologist have conduct and will continue to conduct investigation into the heredity and early environment of the criminal he education and occupation the social and religious influence to which he be subject and the intelligence test quotient the conditioning of the vegetative system and the endocrine status of the prisoner however will without a doubt come to occupy the lead position in any interpretation of crime in the future introspective observation of pre-criminal state of mind by so-called normal person reveal that in many of they there be a impairment of reason and will power in other a exaltation amount almost to hysteria what be these but endocrine state of the cell experimentally reproducible by increase or decrease the influence of the thyroid the adrenal the pituitary crime of passion may be trace in no small part to disturbance of the thyroid a psychologic examiner of a pittsburgh court interested in the subject have find a enlarged thyroid in over ninety per cent of delinquent girl similarly crime of violence may be ascribe to a profound break in the adrenal equilibrium criminal tendency in woman during menstruation and pregnancy period of deep-seated mutation in the internal glandular system have long be note a kleptomania uncontrollable desire to steal confine to the duration of pregnancy alone have be describe we have see how the thymocentric especially if he possess a small bony case for he pituitary be predispose to crime a recent study of twenty murderer in the state of west virginium show they all to have a persistent thymus and the thymocentric constitution a study of the recidivist those who return for second and third offence in one institution disclose that a large majority have a subnormal temperature and a increase heart and breathing rate these be endocrine-controlled function conduct normal or abnormal be the resultant of the conflict of conscious and subconscious impulse and inhibition the internal secretion as controller of the susceptibility of the brain cell to impulse and inhibition must be hold accountable for a portion at least of the chemical reaction behind crime it be possible by x-ray treatment of the thymus to cause it to shrink to more normal proportion it be possible by feed various glandular extract to correct deficiency or excess of they function and so to remedy the underlie basis for a criminal career here and there work of this kind have be successfully carry out in select instance what a suitable drive upon the whole matter would yield in happiness to the individual and dollar and cent to society time alone will show chapter xiii the effect upon human evolution the ubiquitous and deep-seated influence of the internal secretion upon life and personality comprise but a fraction of what be know and only a hint of what be to become know there be a endocrine aspect to every human being and every human activity normal and abnormal internal process and its external expression regulate by law of which we be begin to catch a glimpse they control promise we now a dominion over the most intimate and inaccessible recess of we life in a way comparable only to the control we now exercise over the force and energy once revere as the instrument of the god -- light heat magnetism electricity we have learn how to control and change we environment we be now learn endocrine research be now discover how to control and change ourselves the story of the evolution of the two type of control have many analogy when man cease look upon he surroundings as inhabit by spirit of good and evil as he conceive himself and discover that they be compose of thing malleable and analysable in he hand he become they master when now he drop the old superstition about himself as a spirit a emulsion of a spirit of good and spirit of evil and see himself more and more clearly as the most complex of chemical reaction regulate and determine as be the simple and complex chemical reaction around he he will begin to rule and modify himself as he rule and modify they whether or not he will ultimately come to this final lucidity of thought and action it behoove we to consider some of the use to which we present knowledge might be put since every step of the daily routine or adventure from wake to sleep eat drinking marry and give in marriage work idle fight play feeling enjoy sorrowing every shade of emotion and nuance of mood in short every phase of happiness and unhappiness be endocrine episode in the life history of the individual the sphere of application be as long and broad and deep as life itself not only do the internal secretion open up before we the great hope -- that life at last will cease to stumble and grope and blunder manacle by the iron chain of inexorable cause and effect they provide tool concrete and measurable that can be handle and move weigh and see for the management of the problem of human nature and evolution every department of human life the question of labor and industry science and art education puericulture international problem crime and disease may be illuminate war and sex those two master interest of mankind may be understand and handle sympathetically as they have never before the reaction of man alone and man in the crowd will be clarify the red thread of individuality which run through the woof and warp of all human affair will be unravel inevitably custom moral code of procedure and practice institution all those expression of opinion which make conduct all the current which contrive the infinite variety of life will be transmit into another set of value a remoulding a remodeling will take place all along the line manifestly a unstable thymocentric should not be treat as a criminal but treat in a sanitarium a masculinoid woman need satisfaction not vouchsafe in the old love honor and obey home how absurd it be to find code of morality upon sermon or even the latest psychology during the nineteenth century progress in physics and mechanic overturn tradition thousand of year have painfully toil to erect what be to happen when man come at last to experiment upon himself like a god deal not only with the material without but also with the very constituent of he innermost be will he not then indeed become a god if he do not destroy himself before that be surely he destiny for better or for worse we possess now in the endocrine new instrument for sway the individual as individual and as related to other individual as a member of a type family nation species and genus the basis of variation the sense of likeness and the sense of unlikeness play a decisive rle in the diurnal schedule of the individual he sense of resemblance to he father and mother he kin and clan mark he and they off against the cosmos as a alliance of defense and offense yet no matter how closely he be like they and they like he he differ and vary they differ and vary with a sort of mutual forgiveness because the amount of resemblance overtop the degree of variation in a paper on the rediscovery of the unique hg well emphasize the unique quality of the individual and how in spite of the cleverest device of classification living thing ultimately escape the classify net by virtue of they tendency forever to vary the individual be unique yet when all be say and do the fact remain that between individual there be resemblance and among they variation what be the reason for they resemblance and what be the cause of they variation the conception of a particular chemical make-up of the individual statable and relatively controllable in term of the internal secretion supply a more rational and satisfactory method of approach to the problem than any so far suggest as far as vertebrate be concern at any rate in effect the difference between individual may fundamentally thus be group among the difference which distinguish other chemical substance the difference between water technically know as hydrogen monoxide and the antiseptic fluid label hydrogen dioxide lie wholly in the possession by the latter of a extra atom of oxygen in its molecule all the peculiarity and quality by which hydrogen peroxide be separate from water be refer to that additional quantum of oxygen so the diversity of constitution and appearance of two brother alike in that they have inherit the same internal secretion trend may be trace to the superiority of the pituitary of the one over the other variation and resemblance be large issue crucial material of the science of biology upon which much have be think and write that the proportion of the endocrine determine variation and resemblance heredity and evolution be a hypothesis advance support by a large amount of fact and capable of the most interesting experimental verification and observation if a child resemble particularly either of its parent grandparent or relative there be good reason for believe that it be because they endocrine formula be very much alike when people apparently not blood-related at all resemble one other the same law must hold resemblance may be partial or complete and the degree will depend upon the amount and ratio of the internal secretion involve the same endocrine constitution will produce corresponding physique physiognomy ability and character deviation in endocrine type from that of the original stock more of one endocrine and less of another be at the bottom of the phenomenon of variation basic for the origin of new species as well as the extinction of the old in short view the internal secretion as determinant by they quantitative variation of a host of biologic phenomenon furnish a concrete and detailed foundation for darwin 's theory of pangenesis inheritance of acquire character darwin 's theory of pangenesis be a attempt to harmonize everything know in he time about heredity it suppose that the various organ of the body give off into the blood substance themselves in miniature which be take up by the sex cell and so become responsible for the development of they mother-organ in the newly form individual modern knowledge can not accept all this as a whole but in a modify version it have become the germ of a theory of heredity of which jt cunningham of oxford be the chief backer begin with the trait and quality which distinguish the sex group as the secondary sex character he show that they be correlate with the special sexual function of the species in which they occur these trait appear only when the hormone occur which be present in one sex and that only when the gonad of that sex be mature in some case they appear only at the period of the year when reproduction take place disappear again after the breed season they presence make certain cell develop in excessive number at a particular spot in the organism -lrb- as in the growth of breast from a few sweat gland -rrb- or cause they to specialize -lrb- to make hair on the face in man or to grow antler on the head of a stag -rrb- after castration the hormone be absent all these point of contrast between the sex fail to appear so by analogy we may explain all somatic and psychic differentiation as function of the gland of internal secretion contemplate from the angle of the effect of environment upon the endocrine and a reflect action upon the germ cell we may outline a mechanism of the inheritance of acquire character at certain time and consequent adaptation the cycle of event would be as follow : 1 a state of lability of cell at a point because of increase or decrease use 2 a increase or decrease appropriation by they of the hormone control they function 3 a corresponding increase or decrease in function of the gland of internal secretion and so 4 a increase or decrease representation of it in the reproductive sex cell in the gonad to take a classic illustration the long neck of the giraffe the neck of certain animal live in a district populate by tree with high branch would be in state of instability if at the same time the pituitary for some reason be unstable and react with a extra supply of its secretion it would stimulate the neck cell to reproduce themselves in turn the pituitary would become stabilize in the direction of increase secretion and hand on the component of increase secretion to the sex cell that component in conjunction with other factor would therefore determine the emergence of a definite species character in other word the gland of internal secretion as intermediary between the environment and body and between the body and the reproductive sex cell or germplasm tender the clue to a phase of the puzzle of heredity adaptation and evolution it be only a dot outline of a explanation to be sure but one certainly capable of be fill in the bearing on breed since the endocrine gland be so subtly sensitive and responsive to environment and be at the same time so intimately concern in the process of inheritance -- a law which sum up they influence upon resemblance and variation in animal -- there be no need to stress they importance for the practical science and art of good breeding eugenics another mode of approach to its problem be open up and fresh enthusiasm instil into its hope and aspiration a method of analysis of the factor involve together with rule for the prediction of the outcome of certain mating when finally work out will elevate its procedure to the level of the more exact science a man 's chief gift to he child be he internal secretion composition the endocrine be truly the matter of breed as they be of growth they be the material carrier of the inherit physical and psychic disposition power ability and disability from the soma to the germplasm and back from the germplasm to the soma all kind of question arise as soon as one attempt to consider the bearing of this underlie principle upon concrete situation what happen say when a pituitocentric mate with a thyrocentric or when a pituitocentric marry a pituitocentric be there a reinforcement or a cancellation of the dominant endocrine be there a quantitative addition of internal glandular tendency in the germplasm or a more complex rearrangement dependent upon reaction between all the internal secretion the term endocrine dominant bring up the inquiry of mendelism and the relation of mendelian conception of dominant and recessive to the internal secretion the mendelian have emphasize the rle of the unit factor in heredity and the conservation of the unit factor as a entity through all the adventure of mating also that when unit factor say of the color of the eye come into conflict brown or black be mix with blue or gray one the recessive be submerge and overlay but not destroy by the other the dominant so brown or black eye dark hair curly hair dark skin and so on be dominant while blue or gray eye light or straight hair light skin be recessive a nervous temperament be dominant to the phlegmatic a number of psychic quality have be declare to be mendelian unit factor : memory mechanical instinct mathematical ability literary ability musical ability and even handwriting as architect of human quality the endocrine must be involve in the mendelian unit factor moreover they seem to act upon a particular locale in different degree which be the strongest argument against the resolution of a number of structural trait into mendelian unit character most character somatic or psychic be the product not of the action of one internal secretion alone but of the interlinked activity of all of they the amount of fat deposit under the skin for instance be influence by the pituitary the thyroid the pancreas the liver the adrenal and the sex gland other quality likewise be resultant of a compromise between all the endocrine factor comprise the equation of the individual if we be to look for unit factor at all in endocrine heredity we must look more deeply into constitution and measure the hormone potential and they mobilization or suppression it will in all probability be find that the stability or instability of a endocrine will have a good deal to do with the part play by it in inheritance as well as in the life of the individual a unstable pituitocentric marry another unstable pituitocentric will have child either exceptionally small or tall or abnormally bright or stupid the instability tend to right itself in the next generation or that follow genius as a sport as well as sudden degeneration of family stock the whole problem of mutation may be closely connect with this tendency it have be note that the extinction of species have be precede by a great increase in they size for example the case of the great reptilium of prehistoric time that possibly represent pituitary stabilization and so a abeyance of the ability to vary necessary for fresh adaptation to a change environment indeed endocrine instability appear the fundamental condition of the tendency to vary endocrine stability the opposite certain endocrine fact in relation to heredity should be mention the daughter of mother who menstruate early themselves menstruate early animal feed upon thyroid during pregnancy comparable to the thyrocentric give birth to offspring with a very large thymus comparable to the thymocentric woman with partial thyroid deficiency or myxedema bear cretin these be suggestive of what the internal secretion may do to a individual in inheritance and development inherit endocrine potential be the maximum reaction of which a gland be capable this matter of potential be comparable to the factor of reserve power or margin of safety demonstrate up to the hilt for such organ as the heart and kidney as vary from individual to individual a low potential like instability of a internal secretion gland may be latent and not make manifest until the proper stimulus the maximum amount of stress and strain like accident disease shock or war arrive when the individual be test the effect may be purely local because there be always in the organism a point of least resistance physical change alone may be prominent or because somatic change be minor the psychic will dominate the picture a attack of the blues unaccompanied by any demonstrable transformation of the bodily process may be the sole symptom of a endocrine failure somewhere in the chain due to hereditary weakness or low potential so we may account for family trend and streak for variety and strain among individual upon more precise line base upon endocrine analysis family disturbance of the internal secretion of the extreme sort denominate disease be well know indeed a number of family disease or predisposition to disease have be trace to they predisposition in any direction will probably be show to be cause by they within limit research here have its opportunity the improvement of racial stock a vast new territory of inquiry and achievement as yet totally unexplored be open by the endocrine to the eugenist and those idealist whose most earnest aspiration be the improvement of racial stock as a necessary preliminary to improvement of racial life begin with galton they have bring to light a great collection of datum to prove that human trait and faculty good and bad be inherit ability have be show to run in certain family and degeneracy in other yet all of the practical net result have be sum up in the term negative eugenics the eugenics of prohibition and warn now the concept of personality as weave around a system of chemical reflex hand on from generation to generation be bind to change all that and to create a structure of positive eugenics it have be say that what radium be to chemistry the internal secretion be to physiology just as radium enlighten the chemist about the history of matter and the integration and disintegration constitute the life of a element -- the internal secretion illuminate the history of the individual as part of the life of the race and of its integration and disintegration see the individual as a system of chemical substance interact will assist enormously to predict the nature character and constitution of he descendant which be essentially what the eugenist be after the study of mating the heart of the matter will concern itself with the investigation and comparison of the kind of endocrine personality that mate the internal secretion predominance that cross and the consequent endocrine personality of the offspring datum bear upon physique and physiognomy detail of anatomy and function mind and behavior will so be co-ordinate as no eugenist have hitherto succeed in do law of endocrine inheritance will emerge that will bring the control of heredity within measurable distance standard and norm of a new kind would be obtain a beginning of this study of endocrine inheritance on the pathologic side have be make some of these have be along mendelian line follow up abnormal growth -lrb- make giant and dwarf -rrb- and abnormal metabolism -lrb- goitre diabetes and so on -rrb- it have be state that it would seem that abnormal growth be dominant in the male and recessive in the female while abnormal metabolism be dominant in the female and recessive in the male if a endocrine abnormality like a goitre or cretinism or a dwarf or giant appear in a family as a sign of endocrine instability other member of that family will very likely show internal secretion abnormality if one gland of internal secretion act as the center of the system and the other as satellite we should be able to trace what happen to it in the different generation do it maintain its supremacy or will it be oust by another member of the group the time will come when we shall thus be able to advise prospective parent of the consequence of procreation and to forecast the meaning for the race of a particular marriage internal glandular analysis may become legally compulsory for those about to mate before the end of the present century what be desirable and undesirable mating the general law follow by nature in she helterskelter way seem to be the production of the greatest number of hybrid and variation possible whether for good or evil do not matter certain endocrine type appear to be specially attract to other belong to the same group thus thymus-centered type frequently marry the ante-pituitary type of male the strongly masculine mate often with the post-pituitary type of female the markedly feminine the child exhibit the lineament of the pituitary-centered type the general trend seem to be the establishment of a better balanced equilibrate type yet the child often be apt to segregate into pituitary dominant or pituitary deficient happiness and unhappiness in marriage should be examine from the standpoint of endocrine compatibility or incompatibility likewise those divorce or about to be divorce the correction of endocrine defect disturbance imbalance and instability before mate present another field it remain to be see whether we shall thereby in one generation be able to affect at all the germplasm hitherto revere by all pious biologist as a environment-proof holy of holy no one can deny in the face of the multitude of evidence available that internal secretion disturbance occur in the mother which when grave offer in the infant gross proof of they significance and therefore when slight must more subtly work upon it endocrine disturbance in infancy have be trace to endocrine disturbance in the mother during pregnancy pregnant animal feed on thyroid give birth to young with large thymus gland the diet of the mother have be prove conclusively to influence the development and constitution of the child as the internal secretion influence the history of the food in the body they affect development in the womb indirectly as well as directly certainly whether or no we learn how to change the nature of germplasm within a short time we have in the endocrine the means at hand for affect _ the whole individual that be bear and see the light of day _ the control of mutation the true physical and intellectual evolution of man depend upon the production of mutation of a desirable kind that can survive the information furnish by the study of the endocrine concern the genesis of personality provide the foundation for a positive eugenics a eugenics of the encouragement of desirable mating with the proper legal and social procedure selective breed for the production of the best endocrine type should become practicable but the biologist should be able to go farther if the eugenist be to limit himself to the method of the animal breeder he will have to rest satisfied with the character or hereditary factor give that turn up spontaneously in a individual but with the internal secretion as the controllable controller of mutation the outlook change it should become possible to produce new mutation good and bad to speed up they production at any rate the feeding of thyroid to a gifted father before procreation might enhance immeasurably the chance of transmission of he gift as well as of its intensification in he offspring a field of investigation be open that would embrace in due time the deliberate control of human evolution all the physical trait stature color muscle function and so on offer themselves for improvement as well as brain size and the intellectual and emotional factor which have dominate man 's social evolution the general prevalence of nervous disorder in civilized country visible even in the nervous infant the specialist in child 's disease be call upon to treat show that the nervous system of the better part of mankind be in a state of unstable equilibrium it may be another example of the curious coincidence that have be call the fitness of the environment that the investigation of the endocrine promise to put into we hand the instrument of the control of the future of the nervous system in general meanwhile the eugenist should strive for raise the level of the endocrine potential and discourage its lower that mean the encouragement of mating in which all the internal secretion activity be reinforce on the other hand those internal secretion combination generally lead to a deficiency of all of they which produce type of mental defective delinquency and crime should not be allow to occur the influence of environment what suggestion now be there for the euthenist who would control the influence of environment upon child culture there be certain pertinent fact and lead that be worth consider in analyze environment one must distinguish sharply in the jungle the non-living factor from the living for while the nonliving act upon the endocrine directly the live act upon the vegetative system as a whole the non-living factor be those with the intimate scrutiny of which physics and chemistry have busy themselves : food water air light heat electricity magnetism the living be the animal that prowl all over the planet the predatory spread the gospel of fear the dietetic habit of a person for instance be know to have a influence upon the gland of internal secretion meat-eating produce a greater call upon the thyroid than any other form of food in time this ought to produce a degree of hyperthyroidism in the carniverous population pre-war statistics concern meat-eating in different country show the greatest meat-eating among the english-speaking group who all in all must be admit the most energetic _ meat per day per _ _ country _ _ capita in gram _ australium 306 we of america 149 great britain 130 france 92 belgium and holland 86 austria-hungary 79 russium 59 spain 61 italy 29 japan 25 sea-water contain iodine people live in contact with sea-water would be apt to get more iodine in they system and so a greater degree of thyroid activity on the other hand certain body and source of inland water hold something deleterious to the thyroid so that whole population in europe asia and america drinking such water have become goitrous and cretinous and a large percentage straight imbecile endemic cretinism be the name give to the condition in part of switzerland savoy tyrol and the pyrenee in america around some of the great lake there be still such focus marco polo describe similar area he encounter in he travels through asia certain food with aphrodisiac quality may act by stimulate the internal secretion of the sex gland a type of pituitocentric have a almost uncontrollable craving for sweet alcohol and the endocrine remain to be study light heat and humidity stand in some special relation to the adrenal pigment deposit in the skin as protection against light be control by the adrenal cortex the reaction of the skin blood vessel to heat and humidity be regulate by the adrenal medullum a change in the adrenal as a response to change of temperature and humidity in a environment would result in a number of concomitant transformation throughout the body so variation and adaptation be probably connect most european live for a sufficiently long time in the tropics suffer from a combination of symptom speak of as punjab head or bengal head the condition be probably the result of excessive adrenal stimulation by the excessive heat and light of the tropical sun follow by a reaction of exhaustion and failure with the consequent phenomenon of a form of neurasthenia in the section on the pineal gland there be mention the relation between light and the pineal gland in grow animal and how it serve to keep in check the sex-stimulating action of light the earlier puberty and menstruation of the warmer climate may be explain as due to a earlier regression of the pineal under the pressure of a great amount of light play upon the skin all these and many more could be cite be instance of the direct influence of environmental factor upon one or more of the endocrine and so upon the organism as a whole indeed stimulus may be consider to modify a organism only in so far as they modify the gland of internal secretion consequently climatic factor will tend to make a population possess certain point of resemblance in common variety of the human race exist as do variety of dog the pekinese and the fox terrier be as different as the slav and latin be different : because of difference in internal secretion make-up the slav peasant be definitely subthyroid in he general effect : round head coarse feature stubby hand and he stolid brooding intellectual and emotional reaction the latin show a pronounced adrenal streak in he coloration he emotivity he susceptibility to neurosis and psychosis h lae gordon a scot physician report that of 700 case he study more than twice as many of duplex eyed individual -lrb- brown or black ie adrenal-centered most often -rrb- be susceptible to the mental disturbance of war as the simplex -lrb- blue or gray-eyed ie thyroid-centered most often -rrb- he also point out that such individual tend to have a narrow and abnormally arched palate the anglo-saxon tend to be more sharply pituitarize he feature be more clean-cut he mentality more stable the frenchman be rather a cross between the anglo-saxon pituitary-centered and the italian or spanish adrenal-centered so national resemblance traceable to climatic influence be repeat from generation to generation upon the endocrine may be explain physiologically the physiologic interpretation of history will indeed be find the broadest include as complementary buckle 's climatic theory hegel 's idea on the influence of idea and marx 's on the superiority of the economic motive and force the race of mankind arthur keith conservator of the museum of the royal college of surgeon of england be the first to apply the principle of endocrine differentiation to the problem of the color-line -- the line which have divide mankind crudely into the yellow the red the white and the brown the negro the mongol the caucasian the copper tinted american it have long be recognize by anthropologist that the difference of color march with difference in every comparable trait thus the ideal negro be build upon a pattern in which all the element be specific and singular when the loom revolve that make he there be produce a gleaming black skin kinky black hair squat wide-nostriled nose thick protrude lip large striking tooth prominent jaw and stare eye as he upright carriage and bone-muscle-fat proportion be distinctive so be he musical voice and he easily work upon nerve in contrast the caucasian have a good deal of hair on he body he skin be a pale tan-pink he lip be thin and he nose especially have the definite bridge which narrow it the mongol like the negro have the hairless body and the beardless face but unlike he have lank straight hair on he head while he feature be flatten and fore-shorten upon the basis of these structural functional and mental difference the qualitative and quantitative evolution of which in the race as in the individual be guide by the gland of internal secretion keith present a very good case for the view that the white man be a example of relative excess of the pituitary thyroid adrenal and gonad endocrine the sharp and pronounced nasalization of the face the tendency to strong eyebrow ridge the prominent chin the tendency to bulk of body and height of stature in the majority of european be the sign of pituitary dominance keith be also of the opinion that the sexual differentiation the robust manifestation of the male character be more emphatic in the caucasian than in either the mongol or negro racial type in certain negro type especially in nilotic tribe with they long stork-like leg we seem to have a manifestation of abeyance in the action of the interstitial gland as for the adrenal superiority of the white man it be 150 year since john hunter come to the conclusion that the original color of man 's skin be black and all the knowledge that we have gather since he support the inference he draw from the fact that pigment begin to collect and thus darken the skin when the adrenal body become the seat of a destructive disease we infer that they have to do with the clearing away of pigment and that we european owe the fairness of we skin to some particular virtue resident in the adrenal body finally as regard the thyroid a comparison of the face of a cretin with that of the negro or mongol tell the story a certain variety of idiocy mongolian idiocy in which the face simulate cretinism so closely as to deceive practiced clinical observer be characterize by a chinese cast of the feature and eye hence the name and in the bushman of south africa the cretin 's face be even more startlingly recall there be every reason then for believe that the white man possess more of pituitary adrenal gonad and thyroid internal secretion as compare with the yellow man or black man and since these endocrine control not only physique and physiognomy anatomic and functional minutiae but also mind and behavior we be justified in put down the white man 's predominance on the planet to a greater all-around concentration in he blood of the omnipotent hormone while the negro be relatively subadrenal the mongol be relatively subthyroid they relative deficiency in internal secretion constitute the essence of the white man 's burden man 's attitude toward himself a last but by no means least application we may consider of the develop knowledge of the internal secretion in relation to human evolution be its effect upon man 's attitude toward himself and so toward he fellow man whatever else he be man be a land animal with idea that make he a thought-adventurer among material in a word he be the last word of mind work upon matter but persistently he have refuse to recognize himself as matter and as subject to the law to the physics and chemistry of matter history consist of the protocol that record the high light of the interaction of material and idea which be the adventure of man in time and space material and idea have react the record show material come upon have beget strange fantasy idea that flash from nowhere

of what more than ninety-nine per cent of the million of the race believe about themselves and they fate man 's cruelty to man through the age be a comment upon how vast and ramify may be the consequence of a delusion but now for a couple of century the critical spirit which be the spirit of science have be invade the affair of man humble but persistent corrosive of delusion it have infiltrate the furthest bound of ignorance and superstition it have not dare to assert the supremacy of its fundamental view upon the everyday problem of human life because it be without concrete means of vindicate its claim that lack be now supply by the grow understanding of the chemical factor as the controller and dictator of all the legion aspect of life the profoundest achievement of the physiologist will be the change he teaching and discovery will bring about in man 's attitude toward himself when he come to realize himself as a chemical machine that can within limit be remodel overhaul and repair as a automobile can be within limit when he become saturated with the significance of he endocrine-vegetative system at every turn and move of he life and when sympathy and pity inform by knowledge and understanding will come to regulate he relationship with the lowest and most despise of the man woman and child about he the era of the first real civilization will properly be say to be bear morality as society 's code of conduct for its member will have to change in the direction of a greater flexibility with the establishment of organic difference in human type there be nothing that be more emphasize to the pathologist than that one man 's meat be another man 's poison in the family as nature 's laboratory for the manufacture of fresh combination of the internal secretion allowance will be make for divergence in capacity and deportment from a new angle altogether school will function as the developer stimulator and inhibitor of the endocrine as well as investigator of the individual who have not enough or too much of one or some of they prison will have the same function only they will be name detention hospital the raising of the general level of intelligence by the judicious use of endocrine extract will mean a good deal to the sincere statesman the average duration of life will be prolong for a enormous mass of the population if the prevention of war depend upon the burning into the imagination of the electorate what the consequence of war be a high intelligence quotient and revaluation of life will count for a good deal man be the animal that want utopia so long as human nature be look upon as fix constant in the ebb and flow of life a utopia of fine mind could be conceive only by the dreamer and poet the desire for such a utopia could only be regard as a tragic aspiration for a impossibility the physiology of the internal secretion teach that human nature do change and can be change a relative control of its property be already in view the absolute control will come nor need anyone fear that the science of the internal secretion in its maturity will signify the abolition of the marvelous difference between human being that create the unique personality of history a derangement of the endocrine have be responsible for masterpiece of the human species in the past and will be responsible for they in the future the equality of utopia can be the equality of the highest and fullest development possible for each of its inhabitant the application of endocrine control will not necessarily interfere with the life of the individual there will be breed of the best mixture of gland of internal secretion possible and there will be treatment for those bear with a handicap or who have become handicapped in the life struggle there will be a stimulation of capacity to the limit but beyond that compulsory equalization be a theorist 's bogey the internal secretion be the most hopeful and promising of the reagent for control yet come upon by the human mind they open up limitless prospects for the improvement of the race a few hundred of investigator be engage upon they study throughout the world that be one of the irony of we contemporary civilization a concerted effort at the task of understand they back by the labor of ten of thousand of worker would without a doubt accomplish as much for humanity as the vast
