everything must have change now well after lunch all the people in the county seem to come some of they have drive endless mile and we sit apart i suppose to let they see how ordinary we think they and lady cecilium be hardly polite and the other be more or less rude but presently something happen -- i do not know what -- and the nice man have not to field any more perhaps they could not stand it any longer and so every one who have be yawn wake up and mr wertz who have be write letter all this time appear and lady doraine make room for he beside she and they talk and when we eleven have drunk something they come and lay on the grass near we and we have such a nice time there be a beautiful man here and he name be sir denni desmond and he grandfather be a irish king and he talk to I

must get on well he say i be a perfect _ darling _ but that he never could get a chance to say a word to I alone but that if i would only drop my glove outside my door it would be all right and i think that such a _ ridiculous _ thing to say that i could not help laughing and lady cecilium happen to be pass and so she ask I what i be laugh at and so i tell she what he have say and ask why there happen to be a pause just then and as one have to speak rather loud to lady cecilium to attract she attention every one hear and they all look _ flabergast _ and then all shriek with laughter and sir denni say so crossly little fool and lady desmond simply glare at I and lady cecilium say really elizabeth and sir denni get purple in the face and jane roose whisper how could you dare with he wife listen and every one talk and chaff it be too stupid about nothing but the astonishing part be that funny old thing i thought be the mother turn out to be _ he wife _ imagine year and year older than he jane roose say he have to marry she because she husband die but i think that the most absurd reason i ever hear do not you lot of people 's husband die and they do not have to get marry off again at once -- so why should that ugly old thing specially when there be such heap of nice girl about -lrb- sidenote : _ a man of honor _ -rrb- jane roose say it be so honorable of he but i call it crazy -- unless perhaps he be a great friend of the husband 's who make he promise when he be die and he do not like to break he word how he must have hate it i wonder if he have ever meet she before or if the husband make he take she a pig in a poke i expect that be it because he never could have do it if he have ever see she i can not think why he be so cross with I but i be sorry as he be such a nice man now i be sleepy and it be frightfully late so i suppose i have better get into bed agnès come up and have be fuss about for the last hour best love from you affectionate daughter

in hammock -lrb- and they sit on chair -rrb- -- that you could only do it when you be marry but i believe it be because they do not have pretty enough petticoat anyway lady doraine and that horrid smith creature make a place for I in the empty hammock between they and as i know my frilly be all right i hammock too and it be _ lovely _ lord valmond and mr wertz be lie near and they say agreeable

the day before yesterday about six and the hotel we stop at be quite decent and although the window of my room look upon the inner courtyard they at least have shutter i want to go and see the mark the flame of joan of arc 's burning have make on the wall but every one be so hungry we have to have dinner so early there be not time _ canard à la rouennaise be _ good it be do here with a wine call _ grenache _ i have two helping and just as we be finish the vicomte and antoine come in from the station they be not in uniform now but they hair do stick up so and somehow they clothes do not look comfortable i like they in uniform best madame de vermandoise talk to antoine across the table quite a lot that be the only way one may speak directly to a person it seem after dinner we go in search of some place of amusement but there be no theater open so we have to content ourselves with a walk along the quay and then we come back and drink _ sirop _ it _ be _ sweet and nice and you can have it raspberry or gooseberry or what you like and i be sure if the people in england who drink nasty old port and thing could have it they would like it much better the baronne call all the man by they end name like tournelle croixmare trémors & c and every one be very devoted to she and i daresay she be even older than you mamma be not it wonderful jean now always sit beside I i suppose he think he be my host but i would rather have the vicomte de la trémors who be very amusing but to go back to rouen it be a treat to sleep fearlessly in a clean bed after vernon and i actually have a bath in the morning i do not know where agnès retrieve it from -lrb- sidenote : _ coiffer st catherine _ -rrb- you can see joan of arc 's flame quite plain we go there as soon as we be dress antoine would insist it be only the black from a smoky chimney but i pay no attention to he the _ horloge _ be nice and we do a lot of church but they always look to I just the same and any way they all smell alike and i do not think i shall bother with any more we have breakfast on the _ sauterelle _ but it be so fine after we leave vernon and yesterday that we could have it each day in the bow under the awning and so have not to wash we fork and plate the châteaux be so picturesque and such wood after you leave rouen héloise do not sleep yesterday antoine talk so much no one could really have have a comfortable nap in the afternoon the marquise tell we we fortune she say héloise would marry twice which make she look as pleased as punch but jean do not think it at all funny though every one else laugh she tell I i should probably be a old maid -lrb- _ coiffer st catherine _ -rrb- and so i say in that case i should run pin into the horrid old saint 's head : i simply _ will not _ be a old maid mamma so they need not make any more prediction however it would be worse to be one here than at home because even up to forty if you be not marry you may not go to the nice theater or talk to people alone or even speak much more than yes and no and you generally get a nasty moustache or something we see a whole family of elderly girl at we hotel at rouen and they all have moustache or mole on the cheek we get here -lrb- caudebec -rrb- yesterday soon after four we inn look right on to the seine and be as old nearly as the one at vernon but fortunately beautifully clean only you have to get at you room through somebody else 's mine be beyond the baronne 's and madame de vermandoise get at hers through the comtesse de tournelle 's hers be the most ridiculous place with a red curtain hang across so that sometimes it can be turn into two and such a thing happen last night antoine go in with the comte de tournelle to help he to shut the window as madame de tournelle could not when a gust of wind blow the door shut and whether there be a spring lock or not i do not know but any way nothing would induce it to open again so there they be we have stay up rather late the landlord and the servant be in bed they rattle and shake and push but to no purpose -lrb- sidenote : _ a misadventure _ -rrb- there be only a board partition between my room and madame de vermandoise 's so i could hear everything and tournelle say there be nothing for it but that antoine would have to sleep in the other bed in she room she scream a great deal and they all laugh very much and all talk at once so i suppose that be why i could not understand quite everything they be say at last the baronne rush into my room to discover what the noise be she look perfectly _ odd _ when go to bed a good deal seem to have come off she be as thin as a lath and on the dress table be such a sweet lace nightcap with lovely baby curl sew to its edge and when she put that on she do look sweet it be not that she have no hair herself it be thick and brown but she explain that have to wear a nightcap because of ear-ache she find it more become with the curl i suppose it be on account of the waiter come in with the breakfast that they have to be so particular in france how they look in bed but to go on about the door we send the baronne 's maid and agnès to try and find the landlord but after explore untold depths below and above they only succeed in unearth hippolyte he come up from he bed look just like that very clever miss link that be at barnum 's do you remember -- the one that sometimes be a irishwoman and could do housework in a cage by itself i do not know exactly what hippolyte have on but it end up with a petticoat of red and black plaid and a pair of gray linen trousers over he shoulder he whisker and hair be stand straight on end and he shave bit be bluer than ever at night he say a good deal of the french equivalent of here be a pretty kettle of fish and shrug so that i be afraid the petticoat would slip off and finally when all the push and pull have no effect on the door he say people must resign themselves to the accident of travel and as there be four bed he do not see that they have too much to complain of -lrb- sidenote : _ not much to complain of _ -rrb- at this moment héloise come out of she room to see what the commotion be she understand it be she husband lock in the room and she laugh too very much and say they must just stay there but when she hear the voice of antoine she seem to think the situation grave -- i suppose because he be not marry -- and she also do everything she could to open the door of course if they have be englishmen they would have simply kick it down and get out without more ado but the french be not strong enough for that héloise become quite disagreeable about it though as it be not jean i can not think what business it be of hers she say it be because antoine do not really try and she be sure he have do it on purpose upon which madame de vermandoise gurgle with mirth i could hear both side you see because of the wooden partition antoine come into the inner room and say he be doux comme un petit agneau but the marquise say that he be un loup dan une peau de mouton and must go away finally the whole of the rest of the party in different stage of _ déshabillé _ get collect outside the door no landlord be to be find anywhere then the old baron suggest quite a simple plan which be for madame de tournelle to share madame de vermandoise 's room and to leave the comte and antoine in she room no one seem to have think of this before and that be what they finally do and at last we get to sleep in the morning no landlord could still be find and we have no coffee but presently he arrive accompany by two _ gendarme _ and goodness know what other rabble arm with stick and they want to proceed upstairs we hear every sort of _ sacrés _ go on between they and hippolyte and eventually the landlord almost crawl up apologising and open the door with he key -lrb- sidenote : _ a cautious landlord _ -rrb- it appear that hear the noise of the door be try to be open and madame de vermandoise 's scream he

en ce affaire là il est bien assez tôt d'arriver le lendemain he say everybody be still laugh too much over the situation to be angry with he and the coffee which we get at last be so good it make up for it but you should have hear the _ plaisantery _ they make over the night 's adventure caudebec be a odd place it use to be inhabit by hundred of protestant beaver hat-maker who flee from there after the edict of nante ' affair and so there be street of desert house still and so old one have a stream down the middle i would not go into the church : the usual smell meet I at the door so the

they make it up i just catch this : n'oubliez jamai bien chère madame qu'une église a deux portes héloise say she would not forget and he thank she rapturously but what it mean i do not know they have both smile often since so i expect it be some french idiom for reconciliation the crowd on the pier be common and we return to frascatus 's garden it be so fearfully hot that beyond wonder if the dew be fall no one suggest we should get cold as they always do it really have be a delightful trip and i have enjoy it so they be all charming they seem to have kinder heart than some of the people at nazeby but what strike one as quite different be that every one be witty they be make epigram or clever _ tournure de phrase _ all the time and do not seem to talk of the teeny weeny thing we do in england they have most exquisite manners and extraordinarily unpleasant personal habit like eating and cough and pick they tooth etc but they do have nice under-clothes and lovely soap and scent and

the fearfully straight steep hill we have often notice from the train if you go to pari from dieppe well hippolyte tell we the story when we pass it it be quite close from the river and look as if it have be cut with a knife it be so steep it appear that in the middle age there be a castle on the top and there live a comte who have a tremendously stout daughter he say no one should have she and she fortune unless he be strong enough to carry she from the bottom to the top of the hill hundred try -- it be a beauty then to be fat -- but every one drop she half-way and the poor thing get très

she go into a convent and die hippolyte say also that the other end of the story be that she get so thin from pine for the knight that the next one who come along have no difficulty and so they marry and live happy ever after but i like the tragic end best and he say that the peasant still declare they can hear the knight wheeze on moonlight night but antoine say it be probably a traction engine

flower upon which héloise say that they _ be _ lovely and be the arrangement of she _ chère petite belle-soeur _ and she smile angelically at victorine who look down with conscious pride then héloise say that it be a great joy in life to have the absorb love of flower as victorine have and i could not help laugh because victorine do not know one from another and would not even help I this morning the marquis look and look at I when i laugh and then lift he glass of _ vin ordinaire _ he say : les belles dent rendent gaus be not it nice of he i think it be hard he should be tie to victorine he talk to I all the time after that across héloise and consider she tell I to be agreeable to he i do not see why she should have be annoy after breakfast -- which we leave as usual arm-in-arm -- we sit in the salon while the marquis and jean go back to smoke it be appalling if victorine have be a four-legged cat she would have spit at I but fortunately the two-legged one can not spit in drawing-room so i escape the baronne after a good deal of manoeuvring get by I near the window and then say in a distinct voice ma petite chérie j' be trop chaud donnez-moi votre bras un instant and so we get

to be nice and then when one be to be scold i just say as respectfully as i could that i have do nothing and that héloise have tell I to do it and the reason why that make the baronne think a little i be sure she wish for the advice of hippolyte but the end of it be that she ask I how much _ dot _ you be go to allow I i say i do not know and that seem to stump she at last she say she suppose as we be people of consideration and that i be the only child it would be something considerable i do believe mamma she be think that i might do for the marquis it be only a question of have he debt pay -- any one who could do that would answer it do make I _ cross _ just as if i would dream of marry into a nation that eat badly and do not have a bath except to be smart think of always have to shout across the table day after day and never to be able to do anything except by rule and regulation and the stuffy room and the eight armchair i see myself and probably end up with a moustache or a _

-lrb- the vicomte -rrb- who be really in love with I then if i make he sufficiently miserable he would be willing to fall in with another plan of hers when i be go through sheer _ désoeuvrement _ so you see mamma they look upon I as a regular catspaw and i will not put up with it i shall just talk to the marquis or gaston whenever i like i be quite polite to the baronne because she be such a dear

after I and she must tell I that it be _ inconvenant _ for a young girl to smile or speak to a man as much as i have do to the marquis i be so furious at that that i say as i find it impossible to understand they way i would ask agnès to pack my thing at once if she would kindly spare a servant to go with a telegram to you to say i be come home immediately she be petrified at my answer she it appear no one else ever dare to and she at once try to smooth I down especially when i say i should just like time to write and tell the baronne why i be leave as she have be so kind to I after that they all try to cajole I except victorine who leave the room and slam the door and so i have consent to stay and here i be finish my letter to you -- with best love from you affectionate daughter

scramble in and begin to hold tighter than either of the other i just say my arm would be black and blue and i would rather chance the danger of fall out in a seat by myself than put up with it that make he sit up quite straight i can not see why people want to pinch one can you mamma i call it vulgar and i be sure no englishman would do it it seem that frenchman be awfully respectful and full of ceremony and politeness and then every now and then -- directly they get the opportunity -- they do these horrid little trick the next entertainment be really very curious it be a marble woman down to

should not you lady carriston detest mr trench but as he be a cousin she have to be fairly civil to he and they always get on to ecclesiastical subject and argue when they speak it be the greatest fun to hear they they walk on ahead and leave I with miss garnon until we get back to the hall by this time the gun have all start so we see no more of they then adeline suggest that she and i should

promise he and so make it impossible for they to marry i ask she if mr trench be miss garnon ' anchor too and she seem quite annoyed so i suppose they religion have heap of different mystery but i do

and a diamond necklace and how he be madly in love with she and intend to marry she but he have lose such a lot of money at goodwood that no one know about as he be suppose not to have be there that he could not pay for the necklace unless he grandfather give he a lump sum to pay he debt at oxford with and that what he want be for I to get round the old earl to give he this money and then he could pay for cora de la haye 's necklace he show I she photo which he keep in he pocket it be just like the one in the shop in the rue de rivoli that mademoiselle never would let I stop and look at

you one of the pepper-and-salt do speak nicely and so do one of the new people -- quite a youngish person but they all have such a lot of word when it would have do just as well if they have simply say that of course we side be the right one -- because trade be good when we be in and that there be much better people conservative than radical anyway no one stay a radical when he get to be he own father as it would be absurd to cut off one 's nose to spite one 's face -- do not you think so mamma so it be nonsense talk so much one or two rude people in the back call out thing but no one pay any attention and at last after lot of cheer we get into the omnibus again i _ be _ hungry at supper we sit more or less anyhow and i happen to be next the youngish person who speak i do not know he name but i know he be not any one very grand as lady carriston say before they arrive in the afternoon that thing be change dreadfully that even the conservative party be be invade by people of no family and she give he two finger when she say how d'ye do but if he be nobody i call it very nice of he to be a conservative and then he will not have to change afterwards when he get high up the old earl ask I what i thought of it all so i tell he and he say that it be a great pity they could not have I at the head of affair and then thing would be arrange on a really simple and satisfactory basis after breakfast this morning most of the new people go and the duke and the pepper-and-salts lady carriston drive lady garnon over to see she idiot asylum they be to lunch near there so we have
