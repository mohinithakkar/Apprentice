glance at the flush face of norma and alice some day say bobby furiously i be go to throw a plate at that girl no you be not contradict betty then mr eustice would rise up and send you from the room and you would feel about half the size ada do now for mercy 's sake do not descend to anybody 's level -- make 'em come up to fight on yours they be all glad to get through the meal and find

they tongue be loosen and they chatter like magpie here be a tree shout louise and france who be in the lead when they have pick all the nut on the ground bobby essay to climb the tree she make rather sad work of the effort for a shag-bark hickory be not the easiest tree in the world to climb and after she have tear she skirt in two place and mend it with safety pin she give up the attempt let 's

they set off pellmell laughing and shout look out shriek betty stop so suddenly that libbie and louise fall against she look i almost run right into it she point ahead to where the ground fall away abruptly a great chasm like a angry scar be cut through the earth and on the side opposite to the girl a steep hill come down in a uncompromising slant what a dandy hill for coast ejaculate bobby let

cousinly severity : romantic where do you see anything romantic in a band of indian scalp a peaceful white family oh bobby protest norma laugh they do not scalp grandma they steal everything she have and be all that stuff down there now ask constance howard round-eyed perhaps if we look we can see something there be a concerted rush to the chasm 's edge and the eight girl plump down flat on they stomach determine to see whatever there be to be see the side of the earth fall away sharply down down betty shout and the empty echo of she voice come back to she the ground 's so shaly and crumbly she say thoughtfully that it would be impossible to let a man down with a rope -- the earth would cave in and bury he i think i see a diamond report libbie do not you see something glitter down there can not even see the bottom say bobby curtly much less a diamond oh girl to think of those valuable at the bottom of a chasm like this and none of we able to think up a way to get 'em out well lot of people have try say alice reasonably if grown-up man could not salvage 'em for grandma i guess it be nothing to we discredit that we can not get they we might push libbie in suggest bobby wickedly then she could tell we how deep it be this have the effect of send libbie scurry away from the dangerous place and the other follow she more slowly to resume the search for nut i wish we could think of a way norma dear say betty oh i do not care -- not so very much answer norma bravely but then she sigh deeply chapter xvii catch in the storm the shadyside gymnasium be equip with a fine pool and it be the school 's boast that every girl learn to swim during she first term perhaps the proximity of the lake and the lure of the small fleet of canoe and rowboat tie up at the wharf have something to do with the success of the swimming class no girl who could not swim be permit on the lake alone or with a companion betty and she chum await they final test eagerly -- so excited the last day or two they could scarcely keep they mind on they book or sit in patience through a recitation -- and pass they with fly color constance howard be a excellent swimmer and it be the sight of she paddling

afternoon we go rowing i have my ` stiffcut ' as mr peabody use to call it and we have all pass oh it be cloudy she look at the sky disappointedly when they have go into the pool a hour before the sun have be shine brightly but now the gray cloud be thick overhead and the air be chilly who care for the weather say bobby scornfully guess it will take more than a little rain to stop I i have be crazy to take a row-boat out for three week perhaps it will clear contribute the optimistic louise but after lunch the sky be still overcast do not be silly -- it will not rain urge bobby as she chum demur next Saturday it may be too cold oh come on girl thus incite they go down to the wharf and make they choice of boat norma and alice want to take out a canoe and they offer to paddle for libbie who seem disincline to exercise betty have wonder once or twice if the girl be ill for she seem very nervous jump if a door slam or some one speak to she suddenly and in the morning look as if she have not sleep well betty and bobby select a flat-bottomed row-boat and for passenger they take france who offer to help row if they become tired louise and constance choose another canoe they head north and once out in the center of the lake paddle and row steadily betty 's rowing experience be limit but bobby be proud of she stroke and soon teach she chum the secret of handle the oar ship ahoy shout

have meet at bob and tommy 's party grin cheerfully where you go he ask rest a friendly hand on the rowboat 's rim bobby describe a arc with she oar that incidentally shower the questioner with shine water drop we be out for adventure she answer airily just get we swimming certificate to-day volunteer betty bob flash she a congratulatory smile race you to the end of the lake suggest tommy tucker

will you suggest gilbert with drill night ahead of we we want a little brightness to remember the day by canoe rowboat and shell sweep on up the lake and when the scrubby pine that border the narrow peak of the north shore be in sight bobby glance back over she shoulder at betty you be spatter I she complain i think it be begin to rain say betty mildly and even as she speak louise call to they : girl it be begin to pour a sudden blast of wind strike they blow the rain against they back keep on rowing shout bob 's voice we 'll have to land and walk back you girl can never beat back against this storm we be almost to the shore now a few minute more and the boat touch shore the boy be out in a instant and help the girl to land we 'll carry up the boat -- do not you think that be best tommy shout bob if we carry they up high enough and leave they they will be perfectly safe the wind and the rain make shout necessary if one 's voice be to carry above the storm the boy lift the light boat and carry they into the wood turn they over so that the keel be up now the question be say bob who seem by common consent to have be elect leader shall we walk along the shore and get drench or take a chance of find we way through the wood to they astonishment libbie burst into a fit of hysterical weep do not go through the wood she beg she tooth chatter we 'll fall into that awful indian chasm bobby 's heart reproach she for she thoughtless joke and she put a arm around she cousin libbie you never think i be serious about push you into the chasm do you she ask anxiously be that what

penetrate no use we 'll have to make a cut through the wood announce bob up this way and over ought to bring we out right he be so cheerful and patient that the tired rain-soaked girl could not do otherwise than follow he example libbie be cry silently but the other tramp along cheerfully singing at betty 's suggestion old college and school song look here bob say tommy tucker in a undertone i do not think we be go in the right direction do not you say it would be better to take the girl to that desert cabin we find the other day and leave they there while we explore a bit they be get soak through and libbie littell be fix to have hysteric leave a couple of the boy with 'em so they will not be afraid and then we 'll locate the right trail and take 'em over it home in a hurry this suggestion sound like good common-sense to bob and he say so betty could walk ten mile and be all right he declare proudly and i think bobby be good for a hike too but france martin can not see when the rain get on she glass and as you say something be the matter with libbie so let 's make for the cabin quick the salsette boy have explore the wood pretty thoroughly and on a recent expedition bob and he chum have stumble on a old one-room cabin bury deep in the wood and evidently unoccupied for year it be not far from the end of the lake and toward it they now lead the girl explain as they go

down in the cellar mine be the most spooky say betty when the door have close behind libbie listen -- i be to climb the water tower at midnight and leave this card there to show i have comply she hold out a little plain white card in a green envelope hark be that somebody at the door ask bobby and she run over to it lightly and jerk it open the corridor be empty we be all nervous remark betty lightly i 'll set the alarm for eleven-forty-five and put the clock under my pillow so miss lacey will not hear it i 'll lie down all dress and then i will not have to use a light she might see that through the transom do not you want some of we to go with you ask constance we need not go up into the tower if you say not but at least we could go that far with you you might fall off the roof no please i would rather go alone say betty firmly it be a test you see and the idea be not to make it easy i 'll be all right and in the morning the girl will find the card and know i do not flunk after the girl have go away to they own room the clock be set for a quarter of twelve but betty and bobby decide that they might as well stay awake till midnight they would lie down on they bed -- betty insist that bobby should undress and go to bed right -- and wait for the time to come within twenty minute they be both sound asleep the muffle whir of she alarm clock awaken betty for a moment she be daze then recollection clear she mind she slip to the floor without wake bobby and softly tiptoe from the room a dim light burn in the corridor and betty know the way to the water tower to reach it one have to mount to the roof of the dormitory building betty experience a little difficulty with the obstinate catch of the scuttle cover but she finally master it and step out on the tar graveled roof the water tower a huge tank on a iron framework have a little enclosed room build directly under it reach by a iron ladder here the engineer keep various plumbing tool it be in this room that betty be to leave the card the night wind blow damp and keen and the star overhead seem very far away betty have no sense of fear as she begin to climb mount slowly and feel for each step with she hand the friendly dark shut in around she and somewhere in the distance a train whistle toot shrilly she know she have reach the last step when she hand encounter wood and she feel about till she touch the knob of the door it open at she touch and she pull herself in over the sill now the card she whisper feeling in she pocket a gust of wind fan she cheek and something click the door have blow shut chapter xxi dramatics there be pleasanter place to be at midnight than the dark room of a strange water tower but betty be not frightened she trip over some tool as she feel for the door and discover that she have lose she sense of direction completely i be all turn around be the way she express it i must start and go around the side feel till i come to the door follow this plan she do come to the door and confidently turn the knob the door stick and she rattle the knob sharply then the explanation dawn on she the door be lock could it have a spring lock she wonder then she remember a day when on exploration bent a group of girl have make the trip to the roof and the kindly dave mcguire have take a key from he pocket and unlock the door of the little room for the more adventurous one who want to climb up and see the inside it be a flat key like a latch key betty reflect the girl must have have the door unlock for I to-night but i do not think they would follow I and lock it that would be mean however the door be lock and she be a prisoner it be inky black and at every step she seem to knock over something or stumble against cold iron gradually she eye become accustomed to the lack of light and she make out the outline of something against the wall why there be a window -- i remember she say aloud i wonder if i can reach it cautiously she feel she way around and stretch up tentative finger she could barely touch the lower frame then for the first time betty feel a little shiver of fear and apprehension it be close in the tower room and the smell of oil and dead air begin to be oppressive she have no wish to shout even if she could be hear a doubtful probability for she have no mind to be rescue before the curious eye of the entire school i 'll get out of it somehow if i have to stay here all night she tell herself pluckily oh my goodness what be that a tiny sawing noise in one corner of the room send betty scurry to the other side she would have indignantly deny any fear of mouse or rat but the bravest girl might be excuse from a too close acquaintance thrust upon she in the dark betty have no wish to put she finger on a mouse how can i get out she cry aloud a little wildly i can not breathe in the uncanny silence that follow the sound of she voice the saw noise sound regularly rhythmically in desperation betty seize a iron crowbar she have back into on the wall and hurl it in the direction of the industrious rodent now i have do it she admit as with a clatter and a bang that she be sure could be hear a mile away a evident avalanche of tool tumble to the floor she crowbar have strike a box of tool but the silence shut down again after that betty do not realize that the water tower be so isolate that even unusual noise inside it would not carry far and with the door and the window both close the room be practically seal the saw noise be not repeat there be that much to be grateful for betty reflect she wonder if she could batter down the door i 'll try anyway she think wearily and then she could not find the crowbar around and around she go feeling on the floor for the tool that have clatter down with such a racket and for the iron bar she have hurl among they not one tool could she put she hand on i must be go crazy she cry in despair i could not have dream those tool fall down and yet where could they have go there be no hole in the floor -- now betty 's nerve be sorely try by the lonely imprisonment the bad air the heat and the darkness and it be not to be wonder at that she usual sound common sense be trick by she imagination she fancy suggest that the weight of the tool might have tear a hole in the floor they might have drop through to the roof and betty herself might be in momentary danger of step into this hole nonsense well wiser mind have conceive wilder possibility under similar try condition i will not walk another step cry poor betty as she vision this yawning hole not another step i 'll wait till it be light but she wait fifteen twenty thirty minute and the darkness if anything grow blacker she have no idea how long she have be lock in the room and she could not calculate how far off the morning might be i 'll put my hand out before I and creep she say finally that ought to be safe perhaps i can find something to stand on to reach that window i guess i could drop to the roof from there stiffly and painfully she begin to crawl hold out she hand before she and start back time and again as she fancy she feel a opening just ahead but when she bring up against a step ladder she forget she fear in the joy of she discovery it be a short ladder but she drag it over to the window and put it in place and mount it all in the twinkling of a eye by stretch to she full height she be able to raise the creaky window but to she dismay the roof offer a very long drop she have not realize how high she have climb dave be fuss with rope and bucket the other day she recall now i wonder -- would not it be the best luck in the world if i could find a rope hope be sing high in she heart now but she almost despair of such good fortune after a diligent search then something tell she to feel about again on the floor round and round she go get she finger into spider web and sticky substance that renew she inward shudder because she could not identify they and when she find the rope a tarry coil she also solve the mystery of the tool they have fall down behind the coil of rope and be effectively fence off from the circle of floor explore by the bewildered betty it be the work of a moment to tie one end of the rope to a heavy staple drive under the window sill and then close she eye to the pitch black void beneath she betty let herself slide down to the roof she hand be cruelly scratch by the rope fiber and she be too tired to care about the evidence of she flight if anybody want to know about that rope and the lock door let 'em she sigh defiantly bobby wake up as betty come in the door and then there be question galore to be answer betty be cover with dust and she clothing be tear and rumpled bobby declare she look as if she have be to war i feel it admit betty let I take a hot bath and get into bed and bobby promise I on you word of honor that you 'll call I in the morning whoever lock I in expect I to stay there till i be miss and i want to walk into breakfast as usual she half regret she instruction when bobby call she at seven the next morning but betty be nothing if not gritty and she sleepily struggle into she clothes ada nansen 's look of utter astonishment when she see betty come into the dining room with the rest for breakfast tell those in the secret what they have already suspect bobby must have hear she listening at we door last night say betty what be i go to do why nothing of course that be part of the stunt or at least i be go to consider it so my card be there so they 'll know i fulfil my part dave mcguire scratch he head when he find the rope and the open window but he wisely say nothing he have two key and one he have loan at the request of the senior class president to a fellow student the other key for emergency use hang on a nail in the fourth story hall that be the key dave find in the door lock when he make he early morning tour of inspection but the young folk must be have they fun he say indulgently and short of burn down the place ` tis not dave mcguire who will be interfere with 'em mid-term test be approach bobby who with all she love of fun be a hard student feel prepared and go around serenely constance howard have most humanly neglect so far as the teacher of mathematics permit the study that be hardest for she she algebra she now spend hour in cram on this meanwhile complain to those of she special chum who would listen to she of the unfairness of be make to study algebra i can add -- with the use of my finger -- and subtract and divide and multiply -- at least i know the table up through the twelve of what use will a 's and b 's and x 's y 's and z 's ever be to I constance you know that be nonsense bobby tell she we be every one of we here because we want to play a bigger part in life than the two-plus-two-is-four people and we have get to dig in and prepare ourselves if you would do you work when you ought to you would not be in such a upset state now yes be grin constance and go back to she belated work betty have find that she year away from school have make it hard for she to concentrate she mind on she study and while she have not deliberately neglect she

shrill a familiar whistle sound back of they that be bob betty 's face brighten listen she give a answering whistle and bob 's sound again there be a scramble among the bush and a group of cadet burst through bob and the tucker twin be first and after they come gilbert lane and timothy derby and winifr marion brown hello anything the matter be bob 's greet you look rather glum so would you betty inform he if you be starve after a morning 's work and you lunch be steal gee that be tough exclaimed bob sympathetically who steal it we do not know volunteer bobby but all those box could not take

tommy with characteristic frankness he have one mission in life and that be to plague those unfortunate who have to be under the same roof with he he never do anything on a large scale but then a mosquito can drive you crazy you know dear I he ought to know ada rejoin bobby perhaps he do she be a pestess if there be such a word there be not betty assure she anyway this will not get we lunch

bobby vindictively i 'll fall on ada with such force she 'll think a avalanche have strike she bob send some of the boy to trace the step and while they be go outline he plan to the other once they know where the marauder be they be to spread out fan-shape and swoop down upon the enemy i figure they 'll get a safe distance away and then stop to eat the lunch say bob it be hardly likely that they will take the stuff back to school with they but ada go to edentown protest libbie we see she in the bus do not we girl and ruth too they could easily come back in the same bus say betty indeed i be willing to wager that be just what they do miss prettyman as a chaperone probably kill any desire ada have to go shop the scout come back after fifteen or twenty minute to report that they have discover the invader camp under a large oak tree and prepare to open the box they be laugh and say how they would put one over on you say gilbert lane well they will not laugh long retort bob grimly

brown velvet hat with a pink rise at the front and brown gaiter and mink fur and a perfectly lovely velvet handbag ask betty and do you see a girl with black pump and white silk stocking and a blue tricotine dress embroider with crystal bead the boy look bewilder do not believe we do admit gilbert regretfully but one of 'em call a skinny girl ` ada ' and somebody be name ` glady ' never mind the clothes bobby tell he gratefully we know those two be mix up in this they start cautiously mindful of bob 's instruction not to make a noise and succeed after ten or fifteen minute creep in get within hear distance of the despoiler you girl will have to tend to you friend grin bob you can not expect we to discipline they but we 'll give the boy something to remember the party spread out and at he signal whistle they spring forward shout like wild indian straight for the oak tree they charge and close in on the group beneath it those seat there rise to they foot in genuine alarm rush 'em shout bob push and scramble those in the attack party begin to force the other down the narrow path the boy be struggle desperately and the girl be resist as best they could and some be cry let we out weep ada ow you be step on I let we out she kick blindly and fight with she hand the first person she grasp be ruth who be nearly choke before she could jerk she fur collar free i will get out pant ada push girl the circle open for they and follow ada they dash through straight into a tangle of blackberry bush half mad with rage and blind from excitement they plough they way through fight the bush as though they be flesh and blood arm hold out to stop they when they be clear of the thicket they clothes be in tatters and they face and hand scratch and bleed cruelly there be nothing for they to do but to go back to the school and try to invent a plausible story for they condition all the cold cream in the handsome glass jar on ada 's dress table could not heal she smart face and thought that night bob and he friend continue on they resolute way push the luckless cadet before they once out of the wood they seize they by the jacket collar and rush they down to the lake and into the icy water they generously allow they to come out after a few minute immersion and the sorry drip crew begin the long run that would bring they to dry clothes and it be to be hope mended way now the potato be do bob report after examine the oven hollow out and line with stone why not combine force and eat every one be famish and they find plenty of good thing leave in the box the uninvited guest could not have have those package open long before they be overtake after a hearty picnic meal the boy help the girl gather up they branch and walk with they to the point where they boat be tie they have row over because of the attraction of the wood -- salsette be locate on the flat side of the lake -- and now they must go back for the afternoon drill that be never omit even for such a important occasion as the colonel 's birthday ada and she chum do not come down to dinner that night and so do not help with the decorating of the hall that be pronounce a unqualified success as be the performance of the violet patchwork the follow night and the nut cake and the chocolate and the pistache ice-cream that be serve at the close both audience and player be treat to two surprise in the course of the evening bobby be responsible for one and much to the astonishment of the school ada nansen and constance howard for the other true to she promise the dauntless bobby have accept the humble rle of stage hand rather than have no part in the play and she trundle scenery with right good will and act as miss anderson 's right hand in a mood of unfailing good humor there be not a atom of envy in bobby 's character and she think betty the most wonderful actress she have ever see you look lovely in that dress she say as betty stand await she cue at the opening of the second act betty smile take she cue and walk on the stage a ripple of laughter that grow to hilarity greet she after the first puzzle moment oh oh cry madame hysterically in the wing see that bobby some one call she she be walk with the tree the rather primitive arrangement of the background provide for the play call for a girl to stand behind each tree in the formal garden scene as support in she admiration of betty bobby have unconsciously edge after she to keep she in sight and the startled audience see the heroine be persistently pursue by a pretty boxwood tree bobby be recall to herself the tree become root in its place and the violet patchwork proceed smoothly between the third and fourth act the light go out at a signal and to the general surprise -- for the player have know nothing of what be to come -- a velvety voice roll out in the darkness singing the word of a maid in a garden green a song a great singer have make popular that season it be ada whisper the school with a rustle of delight no one else can sing like that they encore she heartily and she respond then the light flare up and die down again for the last act constance get she to do it whisper betty to bobby i hear miss anderson tell miss sharpe ada 's face be so scratch she could not or rather would not show herself and constance say why not sing in the dark the way they do at the movie that tickle ada -- who have like to be a movie actress connie say -- and she say she would constance howard have a way with she remark bobby sagely any one that can persuade ada nansen to do anything nice be qualify to take a diplomatic post in thibet soon after the play the weather turn colder and skating and coast become popular topic of conversation there be not much ice-skating as a rule in that section of the country but snow be to be expect and more than one girl have secret aspiration to go from the top of the hill back of the school as far as good fortune would take she coasting ada nansen have sniff when the subject be mention to she why that be for child girl of we age do not go coast now at home my brother have a ice-boat -- that 's real sport well ada i suppose you think i be old enough to be you grandmother say miss anderson laughing i wonder what you 'll say when i tell you that i still enjoy a good coast if you girl who think you be too old to play in the snow would only get outdoors more you would not complain of so many headache but ada refuse to be mollify and she remain indifferent to the shriek of delight that greet the first powdering of snow thanksgiving morning see the first flake the holiday be happily celebrate at shadyside very few of the girl go home mr eustice prefer to add the time to the christmas vacation and the girl have find that this plan add to they enjoyment

graceful light affair she uncle have send she the desire snow do not come for several day instead the weather grow still and cold and the girl be glad to stay indoors and work on they lesson or on thing they be make for christmas gift you may not have much money to spend norma remark bobby one afternoon but then you do not need it just look at the thing you can do with a crochet hook and a knit needle norma bent over a pretty lace pattern flush a little i would like to be able to give grandma the thing she need far more than a lace collar she say quietly betty know that mr macklin be still in the philadelphium hospital every letter from glenside now mean a spell of the blues for norma who be begin to have dark circle under she eye she look as though she might lie awake at night and plan when the girl put away they book and they sewing to go down to dinner a few uncertain feathery flake be softly sift down and late that night it begin to snow in earnest promising perfect coasting chapter xxiv betty go coast it do seem a shame that lesson should be as exacting as ever when outside the tree bent beneath they white burden and eager eye be fix longingly on the hill back of the school you can not coast through the wood anyway betty libbie whisper in the french period you may be a wonder but how can you go through the tree stump do not intend to whisper back betty there be a clear space in there -- i 'll show you young lady if you please -- suggest madame politely and the girl jerk they thought back to translation the moment lesson be over that afternoon they dash for they sled the eight who chum together have four sled between they which be enough for the enjoyment of all constance howard have see so little snow in she life spend in californium that she be very much excite about it and have buy she sled in August to be ready for the first fall bobby have be to edentown and buy a little toy affair the best she could get there and france martin have send home for she big comfortable vermont-made sled that make up in dependability what it lack in varnish and polish counting betty 's this give they four sled there be a conventional hill half a mile away from the school toward which most of the girl turn they step on the first afternoon it be crowd the salsette cadet have come coast too for on they side of the lake there be not so much as a mound of earth and whoever would coast must perforce cross the lake we 'll go up to the wood announce betty there will be more room and it be much more exciting to go down a steep hill so it prove the clear space to which betty have refer demand careful steering and france martin at the first glance relinquish the control of she sled i can not judge distance she explain touch she glass and i would be sure to steer straight for a tree libbie you 'll have to be the skipper so libbie take france betty take bobby constance take norma on she sled and alice steer for louise use bobby 's sled such shriek of laughter such wild spill if ada nansen have be there to see she would certainly have be confirm in she statement that coast be for child they be come down for the sixth time when bob henderson the tucker twin and timothy derby appear we think we would find you here be bob 's greet trust betty to pick out a mystic maze for she coast it be a wonder some of you girl have not shoot down into indian chasm well i like a steep coast say betty defensively i would not give a cent a hundred for a little short coast down a gentle slope want I to take you down on my sled bob i do not believe i do thank you just the same return bob politely six of you can pile on the bob though and i 'll give you a thrilling ride safety guarantee who want to come it end by all take turn and by that time it be half-past four and they must start back to school i be come to-morrow declare betty i think winter be the nicest time of the whole year you say that of every season criticise bobby besides i think it will rain to-morrow it be much warmer than when we come out bobby prove a good weather prophet for the next day be warmer and cloudy and when lesson for the day be over at half-past two a fine drizzle have begin to fall just the same i be go persist betty pull on she rubber and struggle into a heavier sweater the snow have not all melt and there will be enough for a good coast i think you be a lazy bunch to want to stay coop up in here and knit a little fresh air would be good for you norma i have a cold say norma in explanation of she red eye anyway i do not feel like play around outdoors and alice have go to bed with a headache and i would rather not leave she some have study to do and other refuse to be move from they fancy work so betty and she sled finally set off alone she know of course that norma 's red eye be the result of cry as be alice 's headache they have definitely decide the night before that they would not return to shadyside after the christmas holiday i think this be a funny world scold betty to herself as she reach she favorite hill and put she sled in position here be norma and alice the kind of girl mr eustice be proud to have represent the school and they can not afford to take a full course and graduate and ada nansen who be everything the ideal of shadyside try to combat have ocean of money and every prospect of stay she 'll probably take a pg course a wild ride through the slushy snow make betty feel better and when as she drag the sled up again bob 's whistle sound the last trace of she resentment vanish something tell I you would be out hunting a sore throat to-day declare bob in mock-disapproval the fellow all say there would not be enough snow to hold up a sparrow silly thing dimpled betty there be plenty of snow for a good coast take I bob well if you 'll come on over where there be a decent hill bob assent with only two on the bob we want to get some grade here i 'll stick you sled in between these two tree and you can get it when we come back together they pull the heavy bobsle up the hill and cross over the hollow take a wagon trail that lead up over another hill it be a long walk admit bob panting but wait till you see the ride we be go to get they reach the top of pudding hill presently and betty look down over a rolling expanse of white country cover closely by a lower gray sky that look she say to herself like the lid of a soup kettle bully coast exclaim bob with satisfaction swing the bodsle into position all ready betsey just a minute beg betty with a delightful little shiver of excitement as she tuck in she skirt and pull she soft hat further over she eye ye-s now i guess i be fix they start the wind sing in they ear and sharp particle of snow fly up to sting they face zip they have take one hill and the gallant bobsled gather momentum betty cling tightly to bob all right he shout without turn he head it be fine shriek betty it take my breath away but i love it the bobsle seem fairly to leap the series of gentle slope that lay at the foot of the long hill and for every rise betty and bob receive a bump that would have jar the bone of less enthusiastic sportsman then suddenly they be in the hollow and the next thing they know betty lay breathless in a soft snow bank and bob find himself flat on he back a few foot away the sled have overturn with they betty be you hurt cry bob scramble to he foot here do not struggle i 'll have you out in a jiffy he pull she from the bank of snow and help she shake she garment free from the white flake i be not hurt a bit not even scratch she assure he be not that a spill though the first thing i know i be sail through space and i be thankful i land in soft snow where 's the sled oh over there want to quit asked bob as she begin to help he right the overturn sled we can walk over to where we leave you sled you know betty and miss the coast say betty scornfully well not much bob henderson it take more than one upset to make I give up coast she seat herself behind bob again and with a touch of he foot they begin the descent of the second hill the snow have melt more here and in some spot the covering be very thin bob find the task of steer really difficult i do not think much of this he begin to say but at the second word the bobsle strike a huge root the rider be pitch forward and for one desperate moment they cling to the scrubby undergrowth that border what they suppose be the side of the road then they hold loosen and they fall slip slide tumble roll a confused sound of bob 's shout in she ear betty close she eye and only open they when she find that she be stationary again she have no idea of where she be nor of how far she have fall bob she call timidly at first and then in terror bob look behind you say bob 's familiar voice betty turn she head and there be bob grinning at she placidly he cap be go and several button be rip bodily from he mackinaw but he do not seem to be injure and when he pull betty to she foot that young person find that she too be unhurt what happen she ask where be we the bobsle balk explain bob cheerfully guess it know where we be head for better than i do anyway you and i take a double header that be a beauty if you want to see where we come down just look up there betty follow the direction of he finger and see a trail gash in the snow a trail that twist and turn down the steep forbid side of a frown gorge be it possible that they have fall so far and escape injury know where you be ask bob watch she betty shake she head i must have be away off the road explain bob betsey you and i be stand at the bottom of indian chasm chapter xxv the treasure indian chasm betty stare at bob in dismay afterward she confess that she first thought be of indian who might capture they indian chasm repeat bob firmly come on betty we must not stand here if you once get cold there be no way to warm you up we must walk and try to find a way out betty stumble after he she mind a bewildered maze she could not yet grasp the explanation that bob turn about by they spill in the hollow have follow a old trail instead of the hill road the trail have lead straight to the border of the chasm bob plough along head bent a heavy sense of responsibility keep he silent he know better than betty the difficulty that in all probability lay before they he glance back at betty wearily toiling after he want to rest a moment he suggest sit on that rock till you begin to feel chilly betty accept the suggestion gratefully she be very tired and she be hungry she rubber have be tear on the stone she have encounter in she fall and she shoe be damp what a funny rock she say idly it be a huge slab that have once be a part of another huge rock which still stand upright some force of nature have slit the two like a piece of paper -- from the look of it the break be a recent one -- and have force a section outward make it look like a wall about to topple over rest a little betty rise and walk around to the other side of the rock on which she sit move by a impulse of curiosity she go close to the rock that stand upright like a sentinel what be the matter call bob as she start back i -- i think i kick against something answer betty there do you hear that something clinked admit bob wait i 'll help you look he run around to she and together they begin to dig in the snow and dead leaf bob bob betty 's voice rise in delight look she hold up a small rusty iron box that as she tilted it yawn to disgorge a shower of gold coin the macklin treasure we have find it cry betty begin to dig like a excited terrier help I hunt bob it must be mr macklin 's treasure must not it look that way admit bob as he speak he draw something from under the shadow of the rock that settle the question immediately something that sparkle and glitter and slip through he cold red finger like glass the emerald breathe betty oh bob be not they beautiful look betty that slab be force outward not long ago before that this treasure be conceal in a narrow crack between the two rock that be why no one be able to find it when the search be make soon after the loss be not it great that we have find it in a frenzy now they dig and when there seem to be nothing more hide under the accumulation of dirt and leave the two stare at each other in delighted amazement at they foot lay little jewel bag contain the pearl of which norma have talk the rise topaze the dozen cameo magnificent diamond sparkle in a rusty case ear-ring and ring lay in a little heap and a handful of uncut stone be wrap in a bit of chamoix skin solid silver pitcher and goblet and tray sadly batter by be fling against the rock lay just as they have fall until bob and betty have uncover the leaf which have so long cover they how be we go to get it out of here ask betty when they have satisfy themselves there be nothing leave undiscovered that be the press question confess bob incidentally we have to get ourselves out too i think we would better walk on a bit and look for some trail out one lucky thing no one will take the treasure while we be scout where do you suppose that go to say betty when they have be tramp about five minute she point to a rocky formation that lead off into the side of the chasm it be evidently the mouth of a cave i do not know of course admit bob but i think we have better take a chance and follow it it will be dark but so will the chasm in another half hour i 'll go first and you come after I it be inky black in the cave and there be no assurance that it would lead they anywhere and every prospect that they would have to retrace they step he be careful to hint nothing of this to betty however and she on she part determinedly stifle any complaint of weariness that rise to she lip it be a experience they both remember all they life -- that slow halt grope through the wind cavern where the rocky wall narrow or widen without warn and the roof rise to great height or drop so low they must crawl on hand and knee the thought of the find treasure sustain they and give they courage to keep on i see a light cried bob after what seem to betty hour of this betty i do believe we have come to a open the pin-spot of light grow and broaden and as they approach it they see it be the winter sky the sun be set for the cloud have clear and never be a sight half
