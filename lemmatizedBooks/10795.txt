pass glimpse of such a great tract of country in a book of this nature but i have endeavor to give my own impression of much of the beautiful coast-line and also some idea of the character of the moor

abbey from ` the terrace ' _ map at end of volume _ chapter i across the moor from picker to whitby the ancient stone-built town of pickering be to a great extent the gateway to the moor of northeastern yorkshire for it stand at the foot of that formerly inaccessible gorge know as newton dale and be the meeting-place of the four great road run north south east and west as well as of railway go in the same direction and this view of the little town be by no means original for the strategic importance of the position be recognize at least as long ago as the day of the early edward when the castle be build to command the approach to newton dale and to be a menace to the whole of the vale of picker the old-time traveller from york to whitby saw practically nothing of newton dale for the great coach-road bear he towards the east and then on climb the steep hill up to lockton low moor he go almost due north as far as sleight but to-day everyone pass right through the gloomy canyon for the railway now follow the winding of pickering beck and nursemaid and child on they way to the seaside may gaze at the frown cliff which seventy year ago be only know to traveller and a few shepherd but although this great change have be bring about by railway enterprise the gorge be still uninhabited and have lose little of its grandeur for when the puny train with its accompany white cloud have disappear round one of the great bluff there be nothing left but the two pair of shine rail lay for long distance almost on the floor of the ravine but though there be steep gradient to be climb and the engine labor heavily there be scarcely sufficient time to get any idea of the astonishing scenery from the window of the train and you can see nothing of the huge expanse of moorland stretch away from the precipice on either side so that we who would learn something of this region must make the journey on foot for a bicycle would be a encumbrance when cross the heather and there be many place where a horse would be a source of danger the side of the valley be closely wood for the first seven or eight mile north of pickering but the surrounding country gradually lose its cultivation at first gorse and bracken and then heather take the place of the green pasture at the village of newton perch on high ground far above the dale we come to the limit of civilization the sun be nearly set the cottage be scatter along the wide roadway and the strip of grass break by two large pond which just now reflect the pale evening sky straight in front across the green some ancient barn be throw up against the golden sunset and the long perspective of white road the goose and some whitewashed gable stand out from the deepen tone of the grass and tree a footpath by the inn lead through some dewy meadow to the wood above levisham station in the valley below at first there be glimpse of the lofty moor on the opposite side of the dale where the side of the bluff be still glowing in the sunset light but soon the pathway plunge steeply into a close wood where the fox be bark and where the intense darkness be only emphasize by the momentary illumination give by lightning which now and then flicker in the direction of lockton moor at last the friendly little oil-lamp on the platform at levisham station appear just below and soon the railway be cross and we be mount the steep road on the opposite side of the valley what be leave of the wane light show the rough track over the heather to high horcum the huge shoulder of the moor be now majestically indistinct and towards the west the brown purple and green be all merge in one unfathomable blackness the tremendous silence and the desolation become almost oppressive but overhead the familiar arrangement of the constellation give a sense of companionship not to be slight in something less than a hour a light glow in the distance and although the darkness be now complete there be no further need to trouble ourselves with the thought of spend the night on the heather the point of light develop into a light window and we be soon stamp we foot on the hard smooth road in front of the saltersgate inn the door open straight into a large stone-flagged room everything be redolent of coaching day for the cheery glow of the fire show a spotlessly clean floor old high-backed settle a gun hook to one of the beam overhead quaint chair and oak stool and a fox 's mask and brush a gamekeeper be warm himself at the fire for the evening be chilly and the firelight fall on he box-cloth gaiter and heavy boot as we begin to talk of the loneliness and the danger of the moor and of the snowstorm in winter that almost bury the low cottage and blot out all but the boldest landmark soon we be discuss the superstition which still survive among the simple country-folk and the dark and lonely wild we have just leave make this a subject of great fascination although we have hear it before we hear over again with intense interest the story of the witch who bring constant ill-luck to a family in these part they pig be never free from some form of illness they cow die they horse lame themselves and even the milk be so far under the spell that on churning-day the butter refuse to come unless help by a crooked sixpence one day when as usual they have be churn in vain instead of resort to the sixpence the farmer secrete himself in a outbuilding and gun in hand watch the garden from a small opening as it be grow dusk he see a hare come cautiously through the hedge he fire instantly the hare roll over dead and almost as quickly the butter come that same night they hear that the old woman whom they have long suspect of bewitch they have suddenly die at the same time as the hare and henceforward the farmer and he family prosper in the light of morning the isolation of the inn be more apparent than at night a compact group of stable building and barn stand on the opposite side of the road and there be two or three lonely-looking cottage but everywhere else the world be purple and brown with ling and heather the morning sun have just climb high enough to send a flood of light down the steep hill at the back of the barn and we can hear the hum of the bee in the heather in the direction of levisham be gallows dyke the great purple bluff we pass in the darkness and a few yard off the road make a sharp double bend to get up saltersgate brow the hill that overlook the enormous circular bowl of horcum hole where levisham beck rise the farmer whose building can be see down below contrive to paint the bottom of the bowl a bright green but the ling come hungrily down on all side with evident longing to absorb the scanty cultivation the dwarf cornel a little mountain-plant which flower in July be find in this ` hole ' a few patch have be discover in the locality but elsewhere it be not know south of the cheviot away to the north the road cross the desolate country like a pale-green ribbon it pass over lockton high moor climb to 700 foot at tom cross rigg and then disappear into the valley of eller beck on goathland moor come into view again as it climb steadily up to sleight moor nearly 1000 foot above the sea a enormous stretch of moorland spread itself out towards the west near at hand be the precipitous gorge of upper newton dale back by picker moor and beyond be the height of northdale rigg and rosedale common with the blue outline of ralph cross and danby head right on the horizon the smooth well-built road with short grass fill the crevice between the stone urge we to follow its straight course northwards but the sternest and most remarkable portion of upper newton dale lie to the leave across the deep heather and we be tempt aside to reach the lip of the sinuous gorge nearly a mile away to the west where the railway run along the marshy and boulder-strewn bottom of a natural cut 500 foot deep the cliff drop down quite perpendicularly for 200 foot and the remain distance to the bed of the stream be a rough slope quite bare in place and in other densely grow over with tree but on every side the fortress-like scarp be as stern and bare as any that face the ocean look north or south the gorge seem completely shut in there be much the same effect when steam through the kyle of bute for there the ship seem to be go full speed for the shore of a entirely enclose sea and here save for the tell-tale railway there seem no way out of the abyss without scale the perpendicular wall the rock be at they finest at killingnoble scar where they take the form of a semicircle on the west side of the railway the scar be for a very long period famous for the breed of hawk which be specially watch by the goathland man for the use of jame i and the hawk be not displace from they eyrie even by the incursion of the railway into the glen and only recently become extinct newton dale well at the foot of the scar use to attract the country people for mile round to the fair hold there on midsummer day when strange ceremony be perform in order to insure the beneficent influence of the water the custom survive until the beginning of last century but now it be not easy to even find the position of the well very few people live in whitby or pickering have any idea of the grandeur of the scenery of newton dale when the first official journey be make by railway between the two town this be in 1836 but the coach be draw by horse on the level and up the incline for it be before the day of the steam-locomotive however the opening of the line cause great enthusiasm and local excitement necessitate the service of number of policeman to keep the people off the rail when the separate coach have be haul to the highest part of the dale the horse be detach and the vehicle be join up with connect bar then the train be allow to rush through the pass at what be consider the dangerous speed of twenty mile a hour for the benefit of those who enjoy the great pace the driver allow the train to go at thirty mile a hour and then to show he complete control over the carriage he apply the brake and come to a standstill on the steep gradient but for the existence of the long narrow ravine right through the heart of these lofty moor we may reasonably doubt whether whitby would ever have be join with york other than by way of the coast-line to scarborough we can cross the line near eller beck and go over goathland moor explore the wooded side of wheeldale beck and its waterfall mallyan 's spout be the most impose have a drop of about 76 foot the village of goathland have throw out skirmisher towards the heather in the form of a ancient-looking but quite modern church with a low central tower and a little hotel stone-built and fitting well into its surroundings the rest of the village be scatter round a large triangular green and extend down to the railway where there be a station name after the village the roll mass of sleight moor rise up steeply towards the east and from the coach-road to whitby that we desert at the saltersgate inn there be a enormous panorama over eskdale whitby and the sea chapter ii along the esk valley to see the valley of the esk in its richest garb one must wait for a spell of fine autumn weather when a prolonged ramble can be make along the riverside and up on the moorland height above for the dense woodland which be often merely pretty in midsummer become astonishingly lovely as the foliage drape the steep hillside take on its gorgeous color and the gill and beck on the moor send down a plentiful supply of water to fill the dale with the music of rush stream climb up the road towards larpool we take a last look at quaint old whitby spread out before we almost like those wonderful old print of english town they love to publish in the eighteenth century but although every feature be plainly visible -- the church the abbey the two pier the harbor the old town and the new -- the detail be all lose in that soft mellowness of a sunny autumn day we find a enthusiastic photographer expend plate on this familiar view which be sell all over the town but we do not dare to suggest that the print however successful will be painfully hackneyed and we go on rejoice that the question of stop and exposure need not trouble we for the world be ablaze with color beyond the great red viaduct whose central pier be wash by the river far below the road plunge into the golden shade of the wood near cock mill and then come out by the river 's bank down below with the little village of ruswarp on the opposite shore the railway go over the esk just below the dam and do its very best to spoil every view of the great mill build in 1752 by mr nathaniel cholmley however from the road towards sleight the huge building look picturesque enough with the river flow smoothly over the broad dam fringe by the delicate fade green and brown of the tree the mill with its massive roof and project eaves suggest in a most remarkable fashion one of the huge gate-house of the chinese imperial palace at peke the road follow close beside the wind river and all the way to sleight there be lovely glimpse of the shimmering water reflect the overhang mass of foliage the golden yellow of a bush grow at the water 's edge will be back by mass of brown wood that here and there have retain suggestion of green contrast with the deep purple tone of they shadowy recess these lovely phase of eskdale scenery be deny to the summer visitor but there be few who would wish to have the riverside solitude rudely break into by the passing of boatload of holiday-maker just before reach sleight bridge we leave the tree-embowered road and go through a gate find a stone-flagged pathway that climb up the side of the valley with great deliberation so that we be soon at a great height with a magnificent sweep of landscape towards the south-west and the keen air blow freshly from the great table-land of egton high moor a little higher and we be on the road in aislaby village the steep climb from the river and railway have keep off those modern influence which have make sleight and grosmont architecturally depressing and thus we find a simple village on the edge of the heather with picturesque stone cottage and pretty garden free from companionship with the painfully ugly modern stone house with its thin slate roof the big house of the village stand on the very edge of the descent surround by high tree now sweep bare of leave the first time i visit aislaby i reach the little hamlet when it be nearly dark sufficient light however remain in the west to show up the large house standing in the midst of the sway branch one dim light appear in the blue-gray mass and the dead leaf be blow fiercely by the strong gust of wind on the other side of the road stand a old gray house whose appearance that gloomy evening well support the statement that it be haunt the classic front appear behind a impose gateway approach by a curious flat bridge across a circular pond which have a solid stone edge the low parapet of the bridge be cut into a strange serpentine form i gaze at the front of the house back by the dim outline of the moor beyond but though the place be silent enough i could hear no strange sound and the window remain black and impassive i leave the village in the gathering gloom and be soon out on the heather away on the left but scarcely discernible be swart houe cross on egton low moor and straight in front lay the skelder inn a light gleam from one of the lower window and by it i guide my step be determine to partake of tea before turn my step homeward i step into the little parlor with its sanded floor and demand ` fat rascal ' and tea the girl be not surprise at my request for the hot turf cake supply at the inn be know to all the neighborhood by this unusual name although they be not particularly fat and be so extremely palatable that one would gladly call they by a friendlier name but though the gloom of a autumn evening emphasize the loneliness of the inn it blot out the beautiful view which extend in every direction over dale and woodland as well as the sea and moor whitby show itself beyond the windmill as a big town dominate by a great rectangular building look as much like a castle as a hotel the abbey be less conspicuous from here than from most point of view northward be the dense wood at mulgrave the coast as far as kettleness and the wide almost limitless moor in the direction of guisborough the road to that ancient town go straight up the hill past swart houe cross which form the horizon in the picture reproduce as the frontispiece of this volume up on that high ground you can see right across the valley of the esk in both direction the course of the river itself be hide by the shoulder of egton low moor beneath we but faint sound of the shunting of truck be carry up to the height even when the deep valley be warmest and when they atmosphere be most suggestive of a hot-house these moorland height rejoice in a keen dry air which seem to drive away the slightest sense of fatigue so easily feel on the lower level and to give in its place a vigor that laugh at distance up here too the whole world seem leave to nature the level of cultivation be almost out of sight and anything under 800 foot seem low towards the end of August the height be cap with purple although the distant moor however brilliant they may appear when close at hand generally assume more delicate shades fading into gray and blues on the horizon but however much the moor may attract we we start out with the intention of see something of eskdale we will therefore take a turn out of the guisborough road and go down the hill to egton village where there be a church with some norman pillar and arch preserve from the rebuilding craze that despoil yorkshire of half its ecclesiastical antiquity make we way along the riverside to grosmont we come to the enormous heap above the pit of the now disused iron-mine this be the birthplace of the cleveland ironworks and grosmont be at one time more famous than middlesbrough the first cargo of ironstone be send from here in 1836 when the pickering and whitby railway be open however interesting grosmont may sound in book it be a dull place for the knowledge that the name be originally grandimont from the small priory found about 1200 and name after the abbey in normandy to which it be attach do not excite much interest when there be nothing to see but a farmhouse on the site and the modern place consist of a railway-junction some desert mine and many example of the modern yorkshire house everything that nature can do to make amends for this uninteresting spot be lavishly squander upon the valley for wherever man have leave thing alone there be heavy canopy of foliage and mossy boulder among the rush stream and if you will but take the trouble to climb up to the heather even the mine be dwarf into insignificance we will go up the steep road to the top of sleight moor it be a long stiff climb of nearly 900 foot but the view be one of the very finest in this country where wide expanse soon become commonplace we be sufficiently high to look right across fylingdale moor to the sea beyond a soft haze of pearly blue over the hard rugged outline of the ling away towards the north too the landscape for many mile be limit only by the same horizon of sea so that we seem to be look at a section of a very large scale contour map of england below we on the western side run the mirk esk drain the height upon which we stand as well as egton high moor and wheeldale moor the confluence with the esk at grosmont be lose in a haze of smoke and a confusion of roof and railway-line and the course of the larger river in the direction of glaisdale be also hide behind the steep slope of egton high moor towards the south we gaze over a vast desolation cross by the coach-road to york as it rise and fall over the swell of the heather the queer isolate cone of blakey top and the summit of gallows dyke close to saltersgate appear above the distant ridge the route of the great roman road from the south to dunsley bay can also be see from these height it pass straight through cawthorn camp on the ridge to the west of the village of newton and then run along within a few yard of the by-road from picketing to egton it cross wheeldale beck and skirt the ancient dyke round July or julian park at one time a hunting-seat of the great de mauley family the road be about 12 foot wide and be now deep in heather but it be slightly raise above the general level of the ground and can therefore be follow fairly easily where it have not be take up to build wall for enclosure of greater antiquity but much more easily discover be the bride stone close at hand on sleight moor several of the stone have fall but three of they be still stand erect the tallest be 7 foot high it be not easy to discover any particular form from the standing and recumbent stone for they neither make a circle nor do they seem to be direct to any particular point of the compass but it be quite possible that these monolith be put up by early man as a means of record the season in somewhat the same manner as stonehenge be a example of the orientated temple of neolithic time if we go down into the valley beneath we by a road bearing south-west we shall find ourselves at beck hole where there be a pretty group of stone cottage back by some tall fir the eller beck be cross by a stone bridge close to its confluence with the mirk esk above the bridge a footpath among the huge boulder wind its way by the side of the rush beck to thomasin foss where the little river fall in two or three broad silver band into a considerable pool great mass of overhang rock shaded by a leafy roof shut in the brimming water it be not difficult to find the way from beck hole to the roman camp on the hillside towards egton bridge the roman road from cawthorn go right through it but beyond this it be not easy to trace although fragment have be discover as far as aislaby all point to dunsley or sandsend bay round the shoulder of the hill we come down again to the deeply-wooded valley of the esk no river can be see but when we enter the shade of the tree the sound of many water fill the air what be once a thick green roof be now thin and yellow and under we foot be a yield carpet of soft brown and orange leaf rare and luxuriant moss grow at the foot of the tree on dead wood and on the damp stone and everywhere the rich woodland scent of decay meet the nostril in the midst of all these evidence of rampant natural condition we come to glaisdale end where a graceful stone bridge of a single arch stand over the rush stream the initial of the builder and the date appear on the eastern side of what be now know as the beggar 's bridge it be formerly call firris bridge after the builder but the popular interest in the story of its origin seem to have kill the old name if you ask anyone in whitby to mention some of the sight of the neighborhood he will probably head he list with the beggar 's bridge but why this be so i can not imagine the wood be very beautiful but this be a country full of the loveliest dale and the presence of this single-arched bridge do not seem sufficient to have attract so much popularity i can only attribute it to the love interest associate with the beggar he be we may imagine the alderman thoma firri who as a penniless youth come to bid farewell to he betrothed who live somewhere on the opposite side of the river find the stream impassable he be say to have determine that if he come back from he travels as a rich man he would put up a bridge on the spot he have be prevent from cross it be not a very remarkable story even if it be true but it have give the bridge a fame scarcely proportionate to its merit chapter iii the coast from whitby to redcar along the three mile of sand run northwards from whitby at the foot of low alluvial cliff i have see some of the finest sea-picture on this part of the coast but although i have see beautiful effect at all time of the day those that i remember more than any other be the early morning when the sun be still low in the heaven when stand on that fine stretch of yellow sand one seem to breathe a atmosphere so pure and to gaze at a sky so transparent that some of those undefined longing for surroundings that have never be realize be instinctively uppermost in the mind it be i imagine that vague recognition of perfection which have its effect on even superficial mind when impress with beautiful scenery for to what other cause can be attribute the remark one hear that such scene ` make one feel good ' heavy wave overlap one another in they fruitless bombardment of the smooth shelve sand be fill the air with a ceaseless thunder the sun shine from a sky of burnish gold throw into silhouette the twin lighthouse at the entrance to whitby harbor and turn the foam wave-top into a dazzling white accentuate by the long shadow of early day away to the north-west be sandsend ness a bold headland full of purple and blue shadow and straight out to sea across the white-capped wave be two tramp steamer make no doubt for south shield or some port where a cargo of coal can be pick up they be plunge heavily and every moment they bow seem to go down too far to recover on morning when the sea be quieter there be few who can resist the desire to plunge into the blue water for at seven o'clock the shore be so entirely desert that one seem to be bathing from some primeval shore where no other form of life may be expect than some giant crustacean this thought perhaps prompt the painful sensation i allow to prey upon I one night when i be walk along this particular piece of shore from whitby i have decide to save time over the road to sandsend by get on to the beach at upgang where the lifeboat-house stand by the entrance to a small beck so dark be the night that i could scarcely be sure that i have not lose my way until i have carefully feel the wall of the boat-house then i step cautiously on to the sand which i discover as soon as my foot begin sink at every step the harbor light of whitby be bright enough but in the other direction i could be sure of nothing at first i seem to have make a mistake as to the state of the tide for there appear to be a whiteness nearly up to the base of the cliff but this prove to be the suffused glow from the lighthouse rain have be fall heavily for the last few day and have produce so many wide stream across the sand that my knowledge of the usual one merely hamper I at first i begin step carefully over large black hollow in the sand and then a great black mark would show itself which offer no resistance to my stick as i draw it across its surface i could only imagine to be cause by a flood of ink pour upon the beach by some horrible squid my musing on whether sea-monster do ever disport themselves on the shore under the cover of sufficiently dark night would be break into by discover that i have plunge into a stream of undiscoverable dimension whose existence only reveal itself by the splash of my boot retreat cautiously i would take a run and then a terrific leap into the darkness sometimes find myself on firm dry sand and as frequently in the water i have decide that i should probably not reach sandsend until daylight when a red lamp near the railway-bridge shine out as a beacon and i realize that i would soon be safe from the tentacle of sea-monster when i awake next morning i dash out on to the beach and commence to walk rapidly in the direction of whitby in the hope that the tide have leave some of those black stain still show i want also to examine some of the queer ridge i have so often step over and some of the river i have leap the river be there wide enough in place but nothing in the way of a ridge or any sign of those inky patch could i discern careful examination show however that here and there the smooth shore be cover with sand of a rather reddish hue quite unworthy of remark in daylight the foolishness of my apprehension seem apparent but nevertheless i urge everyone to choose a moonlit night and a companion of some sort for traverse these three mile after sunset the two little beck find they outlet at east row and sandsend be lovely to-day but they beauty must have be much more apparent before the north-eastern railway put they black lattice girder bridge across the mouth of each valley but now that familiarity with these bridge which be of the same pattern across every wooded ravine up the coast-line to redcar have blunt my impression i can think of the picturesqueness of east row without remember the railway it be in this glen where lord normanby 's lovely wood make a background for the pretty tiled cottage the mill and the old stone bridge which make up east row that the saxon choose a home for they god thor -lrb- since this be write one or two new house have be allow to mar the simplicity of the valley -- g h -rrb- here they build some rude form of temple afterwards it seem convert into a hermitage this be how the spot obtain the name thordisa a name it retain down to 1620 when the requirement of workman from the newly-started alum-works at sandsend lead to build operation by the side of the stream the cottage which arise become known afterwards as east row a very little way inland be the village of dunsley which may have be in existence in roman time for ptolemy mention dunus sinus as a bay frequently use by the roman as a landing-place the foundation of some ancient building can easily be trace in the rough grass at the village cross-road now overlook by a new stone house but whatever surprise dunsley may have in store for those who choose to dig in the likely place the hamlet need not keep one long for on either hand there be a choice of breezy moorland or the astonishing beauty of mulgrave wood before i know this part of yorkshire and have merely read of the wood as a sight to be visit from whitby i be prepare for something at least as hackneyed as hayburn wyke i be prepare for direction-board and artificial help to the charm of certain aspect of the stream i certainly never anticipate that i should one day sigh for a direction-board in this forest it be on my second visit to the wood that i determine to find a particularly dramatic portion of one of the stream my first ramble have be in summer i have be with one who know the path well but now it be late autumn and i be alone i explore the path for hour and traverse long glade ablaze with red and gold i peer down through the yellow leaf to the rush stream below where i could see the great moss-grown boulder choke the narrow channel but this particular spot have go i be almost in despair when two labourer by great luck happen to come along one of the track with they help i find the place i be search for and the result of the time spend there be give in one of the illustration to this chapter go where you will in yorkshire you will find no more fascinating woodland scenery than this from the broken wall and tower of the old norman castle the view over the ravine on either hand -- for the castle stand on a lofty promontory in a sea of foliage -- be entrance and after see the astoundingly brilliant color with which autumn paint these tree there be a tendency to find the ordinary woodland commonplace the narrowest and deepest gorge be hundred of foot deep in the shale east row beck drop into this canyon in the form of a waterfall at the upper end and then almost disappear among the enormous rock strew along its circumscribed course the humid hothouse atmosphere down here encourage the growth of many of the rarer moss which entirely cover all but the newly-fallen rock we can leave the wood by a path lead near lord normanby 's modern castle and come out on to the road close to lythe church where a great view of sea and land be spread out towards the south the long curving line of white mark the limit of the tide as far as the entrance to whitby harbor the abbey stand out in its loneliness as of yore and beyond it be the black-looking precipitous cliff end at saltwick nab lythe church standing in its wind-swept graveyard full of blacken tombstone need not keep we for although its much-modernized exterior be simple and ancient-looking the interior be devoid of any interest it be the same tale at nearly every village in this district and to those who be able to grow enthusiastic in antiquarian matter some part of the county be disappointing in east anglium and the southern county even the smallest hamlet have often a good church with a conspicuous tower or spire but in how many village in this ride do you find no church at all as in the case of staithe and runswick many of the old church of yorkshire be in a state of great dilapidation at the beginning of last century and a great effort have be initiate by the then archbishop a fund be institute to help the various parish to restore they building it be a period when architecture be at a low ebb and the desire to sweep away antiquity be certainly strong for those church not rebuild from the ground be so hack and renovate that they interest and picturesqueness have vanish the church at picker middleton lastingham and kirkdale must however be point out as priceless exception the road drop down a tremendous hill into sandsend where they talk of go ` up t ' bonk ' to lythe church a little chapel of ease in the village accommodate the old and delicate folk but the youth and the generally able-bodied of sandsend must climb the hill every Sunday the beck form a island in the village and the old stone cottage bright with new paint and neatly-trained creeper stand in they garden on either side of the valley in the most picturesque fashion the walk along the rocky shore to kettleness be dangerous unless the tide be carefully watch and the road inland through lythe village be not particularly interesting so that one be tempt to use the railway which cut right through the intervene high ground by means of two tunnel the first one be a mile long and somewhere near the center have a passage out to the cliff so that even if both end of the tunnel collapse there would be a way of escape but this be small comfort when travel from kettleness for the down gradient towards sandsend be very steep and in the darkness of the tunnel the train get up a tremendous speed burst into the open just where a precipitous drop into the sea could be most easily accomplish the station at kettleness be on the top of the huge cliff and to reach the shore one must climb down a zigzag path it be a broad and solid pathway until halfway down where it assume the character of a goat-track be a mere tread down of the loose shale of which the enormous cliff be form the slide down of the crumble rock constantly carry away the path but a little spade-work soon make the track firm again this portion of the cliff have something of a history for one night in 1829 the inhabitant of many of the cottage originally form the village of kettleness be warn of impend danger by subterranean noise fear a subsidence of the cliff they betake themselves to a small schooner lie in the bay this wise move have not long be accomplish when a huge section of the ground occupy by the cottage slide down the great cliff and the next morning there be little to be see but a sloping mound of lia shale at the foot of the precipice the villager recover some of they property by digging and some piece of broken crockery from one of the cottage be still to be see on the shore near the ferryman 's hut where the path join the shore this sandy beach lap by the blue wave of runswick bay be one of the finest spot on the rocky coast-line of yorkshire a trickle waterfall drop perpendicularly down the blackish rock from a considerable height while above it be the towering cliff of shale perfectly bare in one direction and clothe with grass and bracken in another at the foot of the rock a layer of jet appear a few inch above the sand you look northwards across the sunlit sea to the rocky height hide port mulgrave and staithe and on the further side of the bay you see tiny runswick 's red roof one above the other on the face of the cliff here it be always cool and pleasant in the hottest weather and from the broad shadow cast by the precipice above one can revel in the sunny land and sea-scape without that fishy odour so unavoidable in the village when the sun be begin to climb down the sky in the direction of hinderwell and everything be bath in a glorious golden light the ferryman will row you across the bay to runswick but a scramble over the rock on the beach will be repay by a closer view of the now half-filled-up hob hole the fisher-folk believe this cave to be the home of a kindly-disposed fairy or hob who seem to have be one of the slow-dying inhabitant of the world of mythology implicitly believe in by the saxon and these belief die so hard in these lonely yorkshire village that until recent time a mother would carry she child suffer from whooping-cough along the beach to the mouth of the cave there she would call in a loud voice ` hob-hole hob my bairn 's get t ` kink cough tak ' t off tak ' t off ' one can see the child 's parent gaze fearfully into the black depths of the cavern penetrate the cliff for 70 foot and finally turn back to the village in the full belief that the hob would stay the disease the steep path and flight of roughly-built step that wind above and below the cottage be the only means of get about in runswick the butcher 's cart every Saturday penetrate into the center of the village by the rough track which be all that be leave of the good firm road from hinderwell after it have climb down the cliff to this central position close to the post-box the householder come to buy they supply of meat for Sunday have they purchase weigh on scale place on the flap at the back of the cart while the butcher be do he thrive trade the postman arrive to collect letter from the pillar-box place a small horn to he lip he blow a blast to warn the villager that the post be go and have wait for the last letter climb slowly up the steep pathway to hinderwell halfway up to the top he pause and look over the fruit-tree and the tile and chimney-pot below he to the bright blue water of the bay with kettleness beyond now all pink and red in the golden light of late afternoon this scene be more suggestive of the mediterranean than yorkshire for the blueness of the sea seem almost unnatural and the golden green of the pretty little garden among the house seem perhaps a trifle theatrical but the fisher-folk play they part too well and there be nothing make-believe about the delicious bread-and-butter and the newly-baked cake which accompany the tea await we in a spotlessly clean cottage close by the same form of disaster which destroy kettleness village cause the complete ruin of runswick in 1666 for one night when some of the fisher-folk be hold a wake over a corpse they have unmistakable warning of a approach landslip the alarm be give and the villager hurriedly leave they cottage see the whole place slide downward and become a mass of ruin no life be lose but as only one house remain stand the poor fisherman be only save from destitution by the sum of money collect for they relief architecturally speak hinderwell be a depressing village and there be little to remember about the place except a extraordinary block of two or three shop suitable only for a business street in a big city but dump right into the middle of this village of low cottage the church be modern enough to be uninteresting but in the graveyard st hilda 's well from which the name hinderwell be a corruption may still be see in 1603 there be a sudden and terrible outbreak of plague in the village it only last from September 1 to November 10 but in that short time forty-nine people die it seem that the infection be bring by some man from a ` turkey ship ' that have be strand on the coast but strangely enough the disease do not appear to have be carry into the other village in the neighborhood scarcely two mile from hinderwell be the fishing-hamlet of staithe wedge into the side of a deep and exceedingly picturesque beck here -- and it be the same at runswick -- one be oblige to walk warily during the painter 's season for fear of either obstruct the view of the man behind the easel you have just pass or out of regard for the feeling of some girl just in front there be often no more chance of standing still in staithe than may be enjoy on a popular golf-link on a fine Saturday afternoon these folk at staithe do not disturb one with cry of ` fore ' but with that blank chinaman 's stare which come to anyone who paint in public the average artist be a be who be quite unable to recognize architectural merit he see everything to please he if the background of he group be sufficiently tumble-down and derelict if this be incorrect how could such swarm of artistic folk paint and actually lodge in staithe the steep road lead past the station drop down into the village give a glimpse of the beck cross by its ramshackle wooden foot-bridge -- the view one have be prepare for by guide-book and picture postcard lower down you enter the village street here the smell of fish come out to greet you and one would forgive the place this overflow welcome if one be not so shocked at the dismal aspect of the house on either side of the way many be of comparatively recent origin other be quite new and a few -- a very few -- be old but none have any architectural pretension or any claim to picturesqueness and only a few have the neat and respectable look one be accustom to expect after see robin hood 's bay staithe have fill I with so much pleasant expectancy that my first walk down this street of dirty ugly house have bring I into a querulous frame of mind and i wonder irritably why the woman should all wear lilac-coloured bonnet when a choice of color be not difficult as far as calico be concern those woman who be in mourning have dye theirs black and these assorted well with the color of the stone of many of the house i hurry down on to the little fish-wharf -- a wooden structure face the sea -- hope to find something more cheer in the view of the little bay with its bold cliff and the busy scene where the coble be draw up on the shingle here my spirit revive and i begin to find excuse for the painter the little wharf in a bad state of repair like most thing in the place be occupy by group of stalwart fisher-folk man and woman the man be for the most part watch they women-folk at work they be also to a astonishing extent mere spectator in the arduous work of haul the coble one by one on to the steep bank of shingle a tackle hooked to one of the baulk of timber form the staith be be haul at by five woman and two man two other be in a listless fashion lean they shoulder against the boat itself with the last ` heave-ho ' at the shorten tackle the woman lay hold of the net and with casual male assistance lay they out on the shingle remove any fragment of fish and generally prepare they for stow in the boat again it be evidently a accept state of thing at staithe that the work of put out to sea and the actual catch of the fish be sufficient for the men-folk for the feminine population do they arduous task with a methodical matter-of-factness which surprise only the stranger i be particularly strike on one occasion with the sight of a good-looking and very neatly dress young fishwife who be engage in that very necessary but exceedingly unpleasant task of cut open fish and remove the perishable portion with unerring precision the sharp knife be plunge into each cod or haddock and the fish be in its marketable condition in shorter time than one can write a little boy plunge they into a pail of ruddy-looking water and from thence into the regulation fish box or basket that find its way to the metropolis a change have come over the inhabitant of staithe since 1846 when mr ord describe the fisherman as ` exceedingly civil and courteous to stranger and altogether free from that low grasp knavery peculiar to the larger class of fishing-town ' without wish to be unreasonably hard on staithe i be incline to believe that this character be infinitely better than these folk deserve and even when mr ord write of the place i have reason to doubt the civility show by they to stranger it be accord to some who have know staithe for a long while less than fifty year ago that the fisher-folk be hostile to a stranger on very small provocation and only the entirely inoffensive could expect to sojourn in the village without be a target for stone the incursion of the artistic horde have be a great factor in the demoralization of the village for who would not be mercenary when besought at all hour of the day to stand before a canvas or a camera thus the harmless stranger who stray on to the staith with a camera be oblige to pay for ` a afternoon 's ` baccy ' if he want a opportunity to obtain more than a snapshot of a picturesque group he may try to capture a lonely old fisherman by ask if he would mind standing still for ` just one second ' but the old fellow will move away instantly unless he demand for payment be readily comply with no doubt many of the superstition of staithe people have languish or die out in recent year and among these may be include a particularly primitive custom when the catch of fish have be unusually small bad luck of this sort could only be the work of some evil influence and to break the spell a sheep 's heart have to be procure into which many pin be stick the heart be then burn in a bonfire on the beach in the presence of the fisherman who dance round the flame in happy contrast to these heathenish practice be the resolution enter into and sign by the fisherman of staithe in August 1835 bind themselves ` on no account whatever ' to follow they call on sunday ` nor to go out with we boat or cobble to sea either on the Saturday or Sunday evening ' they also agree to forfeit ten shilling for every offence against the resolution and the fund accumulate in this way and by other means be administer for the benefit of aged couple and widow and orphan the man of staithe be know up and down the east coast of great britain as some of the very finest type of fisherman they coble which vary in size and color be uniform in design and the brilliance of they paint brick red emerald green pungent blue and white be the most favored color but orange pink yellow and many other be to be see not only be fish of the present age in evidence at staithe but nowhere along this coast can one find better example of those of the jurassic period when the tide have expose the scaur which run out from colburn nab at the mouth of the beck a one can examine mass of recently fall rock the new face of which be almost invariably cover with ammonite or cluster of fossil bivalve the only hindrance to a close examination of these new fall from the cliff be the serious danger of another fall occur at the same spot the fisher-folk be very kind in point out this peril to ardent geologist and those of a less scientific outlook who merely enjoy the exercise of scramble over great mass of rock after have be warn that most of the face of the cliff above be ` qualify ' to come down at any moment there be a strong inclination to betake one 's self to a safe distance where unfortunately the wear and tear of the wave have in most case so batter the trace of early marine life that there be little to attack with the hammer to compare with what can be see in the new fall the scaur also present a interesting feature in its round ironstone nodule half embedded in the smooth rocky floor look northwards there be a grand piece of coast scenery the mass of boulby cliff rise 660 foot from the sea be the highest on the yorkshire coast the wave break all round the rocky scaur and fill the air with they thunder while the strong wind blow the spray into beard which stream backwards from the incoming crest the upper course of staithe beck consist of two stream flow through deep richly-wooded ravine they follow parallel course very close to one another for three or four mile but they source extend from lealholm moor to wapley moor kilton beck run through another lovely valley densely clothe in tree and full of the richest woodland scenery it become more open in the neighborhood of loftus and from thence to the sea at skinningrove the valley be green and open to the heaven loftus be on the border of the cleveland mining district and it be for this reason that the town have grow to a considerable size but although the miner ' new cottage be unpicturesque and the church only date from 1811 the situation be pretty owe to the profusion of tree among the house skinningrove have railway-siding and branch-line run down to it and on the hill above the cottage stand a cluster of blast-furnace in daylight they be merely ugly but at night with tongue of flame they speak of the potency of labor i can still see that strange silhouette of steel cylinder and connect girder against a blue-black sky with silent mass of flame leap into the heaven it be long before iron-ore be smelt here before even the old alum-works have be start that skinningrove attain to some sort of fame through a wonderful visit as strange as any of those recount by mr well it be in the year 1535 -- for the event be most carefully record in a manuscript of the period -- that some fisherman of skinningrove catch a sea man this be such a astounding fact to record that the writer of the old manuscript explain that ` old man that would be loath to have they credyt crackt by a tale of a stale date report confidently that a _ sea-man _ be take by the fisher ' they take he up to a old disused house and keep he there for many week feed he on raw fish because he persistently refuse the other sort of food offer he to the people who flock from far and near to visit he he be very courteous and he seem to have be particularly please with any ` fayre mayde ' who visit he for he would gaze at they with a very earnest countenance ` as if he phlegmaticke breaste have be touch with a sparke of love ' the sea man be so well behave that the fisher-folk begin to feel sufficiently sure of he desire to live with they to cease to keep watch on he movement ` one day ' we be tell ` he prively stoale out of doore and ere he coulde be overtake recover the sea whereinto he plunge himself yet as one that woulde not unmanerly depart without take of he leave from the mydle upwarde he rayse he shoulder often above the wave and makinge signe of acknowledgee he good enterteinment to such as beheld he on the shore as they interpret yt -- after a pretty while he dive downe and appear no more ' this strangely detailed account say that instead of a voice the sea man ` skreak ' but this be of small interest compare to whether he have a tail or any fish-like attribute the fact that he escape would suggest the presence of leg but the historian be silent on this all-important matter the lofty coast-line we have follow all the way from sandsend terminate abruptly at huntcliff nab the great promontory which be familiar to visitor to saltburn low alluvial cliff take the place of the rocky precipice and the coast become flatter and flatter as you approach redcar and the marshy country at the mouth of the tee the original saltburn consist of a row of quaint fisherman 's cottage still stand entirely alone face the sea on the huntcliff side of the beck and from the wide smooth sand there be little of modern saltburn to be see besides the pier for the rectangular street and block of house have be wisely place some distance from the edge of the grassy cliff leave the sea-front quite unspoiled it would perhaps be well to own that i have never see saltburn during the summer season and for this reason i may think better of the resort than if my visit have be in midsummer it be during October the sun be shine brightly and a strong wind be blow off the land the wide new-looking street be spotlessly clean and in most of they there be no sign of life at all it be the same on the broad sweep of sand for when i commence a drawing on the cliff the only live creature i could see be two small dog about noon a girl ' school be let loose upon the sand and for half a hour a furious game of hockey be fight then i be leave alone again with the great expanse of sea the yellow margin of sand and the reddish-brown cliff all beneath the wind-swept sky the elaborately-laid-out garden on the steep bank of skelton beck be the pride and joy of saltburn for they offer a pleasant contrast to the bare slope on the huntcliff side and the flat country towards kirkleatham but in this seemingly harmless retreat there use to be hear horrible groaning and i have no evidence to satisfy I that they have altogether cease for in this matter-of-fact age such a story would not be listen to and thus those who hear the sound may be afraid to speak of they the groaning be hear they say ` when all wynde be whiste and the sea reste unmoved as a standing poole ' at time they be so loud as to be hear at least six mile inland and the fisherman fear to put out to sea believe that the ocean be ` as a greedy beaste raginge for hunger desyer to be satisfye with man 's carcase ' there be also at that time certain rock towards huntcliff nab leave bare at low-tide where ` seale in greate hearde like swine ' be to be see bask in the sun ` for they better scuritye ' say the old writer ` they put in use a kind of military discipline warily prepare against a soddaine surprize for on the outermost rocke one great seale or more keepe sentinell which upon the first inklinge of any danger giveth the alarme to the rest by throweing of stone or make a noise in the water when he tumble down from the rocke the rest immediately doe the like insomuch that yt be very hard to overtake they by cunning ' in 1842 redcar be a mere village though more apparent on the map than saltburn but like its neighbor it have grow into a great watering-place have develop two pier a long esplanade other feature which i be glad to leave to those for whom they be make and betake myself to the more romantic spot so plentiful in this broad county chapter iv the coast from whitby to scarborough although it be only six mile as the crow fly from whitby to robin hood 's bay the exertion require to walk there along the top of the cliff be equal to quite double that distance for there be so many gully to be climb into and crawl out of that the measure distance be considerably increase it be well to remember this for otherwise the scenery of the last mile or two may not seem as fine as the first stage as soon as the abbey and the jet-seller be leave behind you pass a farm and come out on a great expanse of close-growing smooth turf where the whole world seem to be make up of grass and sky the footpath go close to the edge of the cliff in some place it have go too close and have disappear altogether but these diversion can be avoid without spoil the magnificent glimpse of the rock-strewn beach nearly 200 foot below from above saltwick bay there be a grand view across the level grass to whitby abbey stand out alone on the green horizon down below saltwick nab run out a bare black arm into the sea which even in the calmest weather angrily foam along the windward side beyond the sturdy lighthouse that show itself a dazzling white against the hot blue of the heaven commence the innumerable gully each one have its trickle stream and bush and low tree grow to the limit of the shelter afford by the ravine but in the open there be nothing higher than the wave corn or the stone wall divide the pasture -- a silent testimony to the power of the north-east wind the village of hawsker with its massive though modern church can be see across the field towards the west but it do not offer sufficient attraction to divert you from the cliff unless you have a desire to see in one or two of the field gateway and rubbing-post form of whale ' jaw suggestive of the day when whitby carry on a thrive trade with the great cetacean to enjoy this magnificent coast scenery there must be plenty of time to linger in those place where it seem impossible not to fling yourself on the long brown grass and listen to the droning of insect and the sound of the wave down below at certain time of the day the most striking color be see among the sunlit rock and the boldness of the outline of overhang stratum and great project shoulder be a continual surprise after round the north cheek the whole of robin hood 's bay be suddenly lay before you i well remember my first view of the wide sweep of sea which lay like a blue carpet edge with white and the high escarpment of rock that be in deep purple shade except where the afternoon sun turn they into the brightest green and umber three mile away but seemingly very much closer be the bold headland of the peak and more inland be stoupe brow with robin hood 's butt on the hill-top the fable connect with the outlaw be scarcely worth repeat but on the site of these butt urn have be dig up and be now to be find in scarborough museum the bay town be hide away in a most astonishing fashion for until you have almost reach the two bastion which guard the way up from the beach there be nothing to be see of the charming old place if you approach by the road past the railway-station it be the same for only garishly new hotel and villa be to be see on the high ground and not a vestige of the fishing-town can be discover but the road to the bay at last begin to drop down very steeply and the first old roof appear the path at the side of the road develop into a very long series of step and in a few minute the narrow street flank by very tall house have swallow you up everything be very clean and orderly and although most of the house be very old they be generally in a good state of repair exhibit in every case the seaman 's love of fresh paint thus the dark and worn stone wall have bright eye in they newly-painted door and window over they doorstep the fisherman 's wife be quite fastidious and you seldom see a mark on the ochre-coloured hearthstone with which the woman love to brighten the worn stone even the scraper be sleek with blacklead and it be not easy to find a window without spotlessly clean curtain the little coastguard station by the opening on to the shore have difficulty in show itself superior to the rest in these essential matter of smartness however the coastguard glory in a little stone pathway protect by a low wall in front of they building on this narrow quarter-deck the man love to walk to and fro just as though they be afloat and be limit to this space for exercise at high-tide the sea come halfway up the steep opening between the coastguard ' quarter and the inn which be build on another bastion and in rough weather the wave break hungrily on to the strong stone wall for the bay be entirely open to the full force of gale from the east or north-east all the way from scarborough to whitby the coast offer no shelter of any sort in heavy weather and many vessel have be lose on the rock on one occasion a small sailing-ship be drive right into this bay at high-tide and the bowsprit smash into a window of the little hotel that occupy the place of the present one with angry sea periodically demolish the outermost house it seem almost unaccountable that the little town should have persist in cling so tenaciously to the high-water mark but there be probably two paramount reason for this the deep gully be to a great extent protect from the force of the wind and as it be soon quite brimful of house every inch of space be valuable then smuggling be freely practice along the coast and the more the house be wedge together the more opportunity for secret hiding-place would be afford the whole town have a consciously guilty look in its evident desire to conceal itself and the steep narrow street the curious passage where it be scarcely possible for two people to pass and the little court which look like cul-de-sac but have a hidden flight of step lead down to another passage seem to be purposely intricate and confusing for i can imagine a revenue cutter chase a boat into robin hood 's bay and i can see the smuggler hastily land on the beach and make for the town follow by the excise officer who be as unable to trace the man as though they have be chase rabbit in a warren the stream that make this retreat for the fishing-town be now scarcely more than a drain when it reach the house for after pass along the foot of a great perpendicular mass of shale it rush into a tunnel and only appear again on the shore it be strange that there should be so little information as to the association of robin hood with this fishing-village the story of he shoot a arrow to determine where he should make he headquarters sound improbable although he keep one or two small ship in the bay ready for make he escape if suddenly attack seem a rational precaution and if only there be a little more evidence outside the local tradition to go upon it would be pleasant to let the imagination play upon the wild life lead by the outlaw earl of huntingdon in this then inaccessible coast region the railway southwards take a curve inland and after wind in and out to make the best of the contour of the hill the train finally steam very heavily and slowly into ravenscar station right over the peak and 630 foot above the sea on the way you get glimpse of the moor inland and grand view over the curving bay there be a station name fyling hall after sir hugh cholmley 's old house halfway to ravenscar it be about the year 1625 that sir hugh to a great extent rebuilt fyling hall which be still stand but he come in with he family before the plaster on the wall be thoroughly dry and the household seem to have suffer in health on this account shortly afterwards sir hugh lose he eldest son richard who be only five year old and this great trouble decide he to move to whitby for in 1629 he sell fyling hall to sir john hotham and take up he residence in the abbey house at whitby raven hall the large house conspicuously perch on the height above the peak be now convert into a hotel there be a wonderful view from the castellated terrace which in the distance suggest the remains of some ruin fortress at the present time there be nothing to be see older than the house whose foundation be dig in 1774 while the building operation be in progress however a roman stone now in whitby museum be unearth the inscription have be translate : ` justinian governor of the province and vindician general of the force of upper britain for the second time with the younger provincial soldier build this fort the manager of public work give he assistance ' there be therefore ample evidence for believe that this commanding height be use by the roman as a military post although subsequently there be no further attempt to fortify the place scarborough so much more easily defensible be choose instead a rather pathetic attempt to foster the establishment of a watering-place have however be lately put on foot but beyond some elaborately prepared road and two or three isolate block of house there be fortunately little response to this artificial cultivation of a summer resort on the bare hill-top follow this lofty coast southwards you reach hayburn wyke where a stream drop perpendicularly over some square mass of rock after very heavy rain the waterfall attain quite a respectable size but even under such favourable condition the popularity of the place to a great extent spoil what might otherwise be a pleasant surprise to the rambler the woodland path lead down to the cove from the hotel by the station be exceedingly pretty and in the summer it be not easy to find you way despite the direction-board nail to tree here and there but there be many wooded and mossy-pathed ravine equally pretty where no charge be make for admittance and where you can be away from you fellow-mortal and the silver paper they throw away from the chocolate they eat there be a small stone circle not far from hayburn wyke station to be find without much trouble and those who be interested in early man will scarcely find a neighborhood in this country more thickly honeycomb with tumulus and ancient earthwork there be no particularly plain pathway through the field to the valley where this stone circle can be see but it can easily be find after a careful study of the large scale ordnance map which they will show you at the hotel and if there be any difficulty in locate the exact position of the stone the people at the neighbouring farm be exceedingly kind in give direction there be about fifteen monolith make up the circle and they be all lie flat on the ground so that in the summer they be very much overgrown with rank grass and low bush this be probably the burial-place of some prehistoric chief but no mound remain chapter v scarborough dazzling sunshine a furious wind flap and scream gull crowd of fishing-boat and innumerable people jostle one another on the seafront make up the chief feature of my first view of scarborough by degree i discover that behind the gull and the brown sail be old house they roof dimly red through the transparent haze and above they appear a great green cliff with its uneven outline define by the curtain wall and tower of the castle which have make scarborough a place of importance in the civil war and in earlier time the wide-curving bay be fill with huge breaking wave which look capable of destroy everything within they reach but they seem harmless enough when i look a little further out where eight or ten gray warship be ride at they anchor apparently motionless from the outer arm of the harbor where the sea be angrily attempt to dislodge the top row of stone i could make out the great mass of gray building stretch right to the extremity of the bay i try to pick out individual building from this city-like watering-place but beyond discover the position of the spa and one or two of the mightier hotel i could see very little and instead fall to wonder how many landlady and how many foreign waiter the long line of gray roof represent this raise so many unpleasant recollection of the various type i have encounter that i determine to go no nearer to modern scarborough than the pier-head upon which i stand a specially big wave however soon drive I from this position to a drier if more crowded spot and reconsider my objection i determine to see something of the innumerable gray street which make up the fashionable watering-place the terraced garden on the steep cliff along the sea-front be most elaborately well keep but a more striking feature of scarborough be the magnificence of so many of the shop they suggest a city rather than a seaside town and give you a idea of the magnitude of the permanent population of the place as well as the flood of summer and winter visitor the origin of scarborough 's popularity be undoubtedly due to the chalybeate water of the spa discover in 1620 almost at the same time as those of tunbridge well and epsom the unmistakable sign of antiquity in the narrow street adjoining the harbor irresistibly remind one of the day when sea-bathing have still to be popularize when the efficacy of scarborough 's medicinal spring have not be discover of the day when the place bear as little resemblance to its present size or appearance as the fishing-town at robin hood 's bay we do not know that pier gaveston sir hugh cholmley and other notability who have leave they mark on the page of scarborough 's history might not be they with we to-day welcome the pierrot the switchback the restaurant and other means by which pleasure-loving visitor wile away they hardly-earned holiday but for my part the story of scarborough 's mayor who be toss in a blanket be far more entertaining than the song of nigger minstrel or any of the commercial attempt to amuse this strangely improper procedure with one who hold the highest office in the municipality take place in the reign of jame ii and the king 's leaning towards popery be the cause of all the trouble on April 27 1688 a declaration for liberty of conscience be publish and by royal command the say declaration be to be read in every protestant church in the land mr thoma aislabie the mayor of scarborough duly receive a copy of the document and have hand it to the clergyman mr noel boteler order he to read it in church on the follow Sunday morning there seem little doubt that the worthy mr boteler at once recognize a wily move on the part of the king who under the cover of general tolerance would foster the growth of the roman religion until such time as the catholic have attain sufficient power to suppress protestantism mr mayor be therefore inform that the declaration would not be read on Sunday morning -lrb- August 11 -rrb- when the omission have be make the mayor leave he pew and stick in hand walk up the aisle seize the minister and cane he as he stand at he reading-desk scene of such a nature do not occur every day even in 1688 and the storm of indignation and excitement among the member of the congregation do not subside so quickly as it have rise the cause of the poor minister be champion in particular by a certain captain ouseley and the discussion of the matter on the bowling-green on the follow day lead to the suggestion that the mayor should be send for to explain he conduct as he take no notice of a courteous message request he attendance the captain repeat the summons accompany by a file of musketeer in the meantime many suggestion for deal with mr aislabie in a fitting manner be doubtless make by the captain 's brother officer and further some settle course of action seem to have be agree upon for we do not hear of any hesitation on the part of the captain on the arrival of the mayor whose rage must by this time have be border upon apoplexy a strong blanket be ready and captain carvil fitzherbert hanmer and rodney lead by captain ouseley and assist by as many other as could find room seize the side in a very few moment mr mayor be revolving and bump rise and fall as though he be no weight at all this public degradation be too much to be bear without substantial redress he therefore set out at once for london to obtain satisfaction from he sovereign but ouseley be wise enough to look after he own interest in that quarter himself and in two letter we see the upshot of the matter ` london ` September 22 1688 ` captain ouseley be say to be come to town to give reason for toss the mayor of scarborough in a blanket as part of he plea he have bring with he a collection of article against the say mayor and the attestation of many gentleman of note ' ` london ` September 29 1688 ` the mayor of scarborough and captain ouseley who toss the other in a blanket be hear last night before the council : the captain plead he majesty 's gracious pardon -lrb- which be in the press -rrb- and so both be dismiss ' aislabie be the last of the only five mayor the town have then know and the fact that the office have only be institute in 1684 seem to show that what reverence have gather round the person of the chief magistrate be not sufficient to stand in the face of such outrageous conduct as the public caning of the minister the townsfolk decide that they have have enough of mayor for on November 16 in the same autumn scarborough be once more place under the control of two bailiff as have be the case previous to 1684 if the castle do not show many interesting building beyond the keep and the long line of wall and drum-tower there be so much concern it that be of great human interest that i should scarcely feel able to grumble if there be still fewer remain behind the ancient house in quay street rise the steep grassy cliff up which one must climb by various rough pathway to the fortify summit on the side face the mainland a hollow know as the dyke be bridge by a tall and narrow archway in place of the drawbridge of the seventeenth century and earlier time on the same side be a massive gateway look across a open space to st mary 's church which suffer so severely during the siege of the castle the maim church -- for the chancel have never be rebuild -- look across the dyke to the shattered keep and so apparent be the result of the cannonading between they that no one require to be tell that the parliamentary force mount they ordnance in the chancel and tower of the church and it be equally apparent that the royalist return the fire hotly the great siege last for nearly a year and although he garrison be small and there be practically no hope of relief sir hugh cholmley seem to have keep a stout heart up to the end with he throughout this long period of privation and suffering be he beautiful and courageous wife whose comparatively early death at the age of fifty-four must to some extent be attribute to the strain and fatigue bear during these month of warfare sir hugh seem to have almost worship he wife for in he memoirs he be never weary of describe she perfection ` she be of the middle stature of woman ' he write ` and well shaped yet in that not so singular as in the beauty of she face which be but of a little model and yet proportionable to she body she eye black and full of loveliness and sweetness she eyebrow small and even as if draw with a pencil a very little pretty well-shaped mouth which sometimes -lrb- especially when in a muse or study -rrb- she would draw up into a incredible little compass she hair a sad chestnut she complexion brown but clear with a fresh color in she cheek a loveliness in she look inexpressible and by she whole composure be so beautiful a sweet creature at she marriage as not many do parallel few exceed she in the nation yet the inward endowment and perfection of she mind do exceed those outward of she body be a most pious virtuous person of great integrity and discerning judgment in most thing ' she husband speak of she ` sweet good-nature ' and of how she be always ready to be touch with other people 's want before she own that such nobleness of character should shine out brilliantly during the siege be inevitable and sir hugh tell we that though she be of a timorous nature she bear herself during great danger with ' a courage above she sex ' on one occasion sir john meldrum the parliamentary commander send proposal to sir hugh cholmley which he accompany with savage threat that if he term be not immediately accept he would make a general assault on the castle that night and in the event of one drop of he man 's blood be shed he would give order for a general massacre of the garrison sparing neither man nor woman to a man whose devotion to he beautiful wife be so great a threat of this nature must have be a severe shock to he determination to hold out but from he own writings we be able to picture for ourselves sir hugh 's anxious and troubled face light up on the approach of the cause of he chief concern lady cholmley without any sign of the inward misgiving or dejection which with she gentle and shrink nature must have be a great struggle come to she husband and implore he to on no account let she peril influence he decision to the detriment of he own honor or the king 's affair sir john meldrum 's proposal have be reject the garrison prepare itself for the furious attack commence on may 11 the assault be well plan for while the governor 's attention be turn towards the gateway lead to the castle entrance another attack be make at the southern end of the wall towards the sea where until the year 1730 charle 's tower stand the bloodshed at this point be greater than at the gateway at the head of a choose division of troops sir john meldrum climb the almost precipitous ascent with wonderful courage only to meet with such spirited resistance on the part of the besiege that when the attack be abandon it be discover that meldrum have receive a dangerous wound penetrate to he thigh and that several of he officer and man have be kill meanwhile at the gateway the first success of the assailant have be check at the foot of the grand tower or keep for at that point the rush of drab-coated and helmeted man be receive by such a shower of stone and missile that many stumble and be crush on the steep pathway not even cromwell 's man could continue to face such a reception and before very long the governor could embrace he wife in the knowledge that the great attack have fail in between such scene as these when the air be fill with the shout and yell of attacker and besiege when the crack of the musket and the intermittent report of the cannon almost deafen she lady cholmley be assiduously attend to the wound and the many case of scurvy which be rampant among the garrison one of she maid who share these labor creep out of the castle one night with a view to reach the town and escape further drudgery and privation but a roundhead sentry discover she and send she back to the castle think that she be a spy when the great keep be partially destroy lady cholmley be force ` to lie in a little cabbin on the ground several month together when she take a defluction of rhume upon one of she eye which trouble she ever after and get also a touch of the scurvy then rife in the castle and of which it be think she be not well after ' who can wonder that sir hugh appreciate the courage of this noble lady and i marvel still more at she fortitude when i read of the frailty she husband mention so gently fear no doubt that without a few shadow no one would accept he picture as genuine ` if she have take impression of anything it be hard to remove it with reason or argument till she have consider of it herself neither could she well endure adversity or cross though it please the lord to exercise she with they by my many trouble and the calamity of the time she would be much trouble at evil which could neither be prevent nor remedy and sometimes discontent without any great cause especially in she disposition of health for be of a tender constitution and spin of a fine thread every disaster take impression on she body and mind and would make she both sick and often inclinable to be melancholy especially in my absence ' at last on July 22 1645 -- he forty-fifth birthday -- sir hugh be force to come to a agreement with the enemy by which he honourably surrender the castle three day later it be a sad procession that wind its way down the steep pathway litter with the debris of broken masonry : for many of sir hugh 's officer and soldier be in such a weak condition that they have to be carry out in sheet or help along between two man and the parliamentary officer add rather tersely that ` the rest be not very fit to march ' the scurvy have deplete the rank of the defender to such a extent that the woman in the castle despite the presence of lady cholmley threaten to stone the governor unless he capitulate the reduction of scarborough castle be consider a profound success to the side of the parliament ` the moderate intelligencer ' of July 23 1645 announce the fact with great satisfaction ` we heare likewise that _ scarborough _ be also yeeld into we hand sir hugh have none other condition for himself but with he wife and child passe beyond sea this be excellent good newe and be a very terrible blow to the enemy ' three year later the castle be again besiege by the parliamentary force for colonel matthew boynton the governor have declare for the king the garrison hold out from August to December when term be make with colonel hugh bethell by which the governor officer gentleman and soldier march out with ` they color fly drum beat musquet loaden bandeleer fill match light and bullet in mouth to a close call scarborough common ' where they lay down they arm before i leave scarborough i must go back to early time in order that the antiquity of the place may not be slight owe to the omission of any reference to the town in the domesday book tostus count of northumberland who as everyone know be brother of the harold who fight at senlac hill have bring about a insurrection of the northumbrian and have be dispossess by he brother he revenge himself by invite the help of haralld hadrada king of norway the norseman promptly accept the offer and take with he he family and a army of warrior sail for the shetland where tostus join he the united force then come down the east coast of britain until they reach scardaburgum where they land and prepare to fight the inhabitant the town be then build entirely of timber and there be apparently no castle of any description on the great hill for the norseman find they opponent incline to offer a stout resistance try other tactic they gain possession of the hill construct a huge fire and when the wood be burn fiercely fling the blaze brand down on to the wooden house below the fire spread from one hut to another with sufficient speed to drive out the defender who in the confusion which follow be slaughter by the enemy this occur in the momentous year 1066 when harold have defeat the norseman and slay haralld hadrada at stamford bridge have to hurry southwards to meet william the norman at hasting it be not surprising therefore that the compiler of the conqueror 's survey should have fail to record the existence of the blacken ember of what have once be a town but such a site as the castle hill could not long remain idle in the stormy day of the norman king and william le gro earl of albemarle and lord of holderness recognize the natural defensibility of the rock build the massive wall which have withstand so many assault and even now form the most prominent feature of scarborough chapter vi whitby ` behold the glorious summer sea as night 's dark wing unfold and o'er the water ` neath the star the harbor light behold ' e teschemacher despite a huge influx of summer visitor and despite the modern town which have grow up to receive they whitby be still one of the most strikingly picturesque town in england but at the same time if one except the abbey the church and the market-house there be scarcely any architectural attraction in the town the charm of the place do not lie so much in detail as in broad effect the narrow street have no surprise in the way of carved-oak bracket or curious panelled doorway although narrow passage and steep flight of stone step abound on the other hand the old part of the town when see from a distance be always present themselves in new apparel in the early morning the east cliff generally appear merely as a pale gray silhouette with a square projection represent the church and a fret one the abbey but as the sun climb upwards color and definition grow out of the haze of smoke and shadow and the roof assume they ruddy tone at mid-day when the sunlight pour down upon the medley of house cluster along the face of the cliff the scene be brilliantly color the predominant note be the red of the chimney and roof and stray patch of brickwork but the wall that go down to the water 's edge be green below and full of rich brown above and in many place the side of the cottage be color with a ochre wash while above they all the top of the cliff appear cover with grass on a clear day when detach cloud be pass across the sun the house be sometimes light up in the strangest fashion they quaint outline be suddenly throw out from the cliff by a broad patch of shadow upon the grass and rock behind but there be scarcely a chimney in this old part of whitby that do not contribute to the mist of blue-gray smoke that slowly drift up the face of the cliff and thus when there be no bright sunshine color and detail be subdue in the haze in many town whose antiquity and picturesqueness be more popular than the attraction of whitby the railway deposit one in some distressingly ugly modern excrescence from which it may even be necessary for a stranger to ask he way to the old-world feature he have come to see but at whitby the railway without do any harm to the appearance of the town at once give a visitor as typical a scene of fishing-life as he will ever find when the tide be up and the wharf be crowd with boat this upper portion of whitby harbor be at its best and to step from the railway compartment enter at king 's cross into this busy scene be a experience to be remember in the deepen twilight of a clear evening the harbor gather to itself the additional charm of mysterious indefiniteness and among the long-drawn-out reflection appear sinuous line of yellow light beneath the lamp by the bridge look towards the ocean from the outer harbor one see the massive arm which whitby have thrust into the wave hold aloft the steady light that ` safely guide the mighty ship into the harbor bay ' if we keep to the waterside modern whitby have no terror for we it be out of sight and might therefore have never exist but when we have cross the bridge and pass along the narrow thoroughfare know as church street to the step lead up the face of the cliff we must prepare ourselves for a new aspect of the town there upon the top of the west cliff stand row of sad-looking and dun-coloured lodging-house relieve by the aggressive bulk of a huge hotel with corner turret that frown savagely at the unfinished crescent where there be many apartment with ` room face the sea ' the only redeeming feature of this modern side of whitby be the circumscribed area it occupy so that the view from the top of the 199 step we have climb be not altogether vitiate a distinctive feature of the west side of the river have be lose in the sail of the union mill which be take down some year ago and the solid brick building where many of the whitby people by the excellent method of cooperation obtain they flour at reduce price be now the headquarters of some volunteer the town seem to have no idea of re-erect the sail of the windmill and as i have so far hear of no scheme for demolish the unpleasant-looking house on the west cliff we will shut we eye to these shortcoming and admit that the task be not difficult in the presence of such a superb view over whitby 's glorious surroundings we look over the chimney-stack of the topmost house and see the silver esk wind placidly in the deep channel it have carve for itself and further away we see the far-off moorland height brown and blue where the source of the broad river down below be feed by the unite effort of innumerable tiny stream deep in the heather behind we stand the massive-looking parish church with its norman tower so sturdily build that its height seem scarcely greater than its breadth there be surely no other church with such a ponderous exterior that be so completely deceptive as to its internal aspect for st mary 's contain the most remarkable series of beehive-like gallery that be ever cram into a parish church they be not merely very wide and ill-arranged but they be superpose one above the other the free use of white paint all over the sloping tier of pew have prevent the interior from be as dark as it would have otherwise be but the result of all this paint deal have be to give the build the most eccentric and indecorous appearance still there be few who will fail to thank the good folk of whitby for preserve a ecclesiastical curiosity of such a unusual nature the box-pew on the floor of the church be separate by very narrow gangway -- we can not call they aisle -- and the gallery across the chancel arch be particularly noticeable for the twist wooden column support it various pew in the transept and elsewhere have be reserve for many generation for the use of people from outlying village such as aislaby ugglebarnby and hawskercum-stainsacre and it be this necessity for accommodate a very large congregation that tax the ingenuity of the churchwarden and result in the strange interior exist to-day the early history of whitby from the time of the landing of roman soldier in dunsley bay seem to be very closely associate with the abbey found by hilda about two year after the battle of winwidfield fight on November 15 ad 654 but i will not venture to state a opinion here as to whether there be any town at streoneshalh before the building of the abbey or whether the place that have since become know as whitby grow on account of the presence of the abbey such matter as these have be fight out by a expert in the archaeology of cleveland -- the late canon atkinson who seem to take infinite pleasure in demolish the elaborately construct theory of those painstaking historian of the eighteenth century dr young and mr lionel charlton many fact however which throw light on the early day of the abbey be now unassailable we see that hilda must have be a most remarkable woman for she time instil into those around she a passion for learn as well as right-living for despite the fact that they work and pray in rude wooden building with wall form most probably of split tree-trunk after the fashion of the church at greenstead in essex we find the institution producing among other such man as bosa and john both bishop of york and such a poet as caadmon the legend of he inspiration however may be place beside the story of how the saintly abbess turn the snake into the fossil ammonite with which the liassic shore of whitby be strew hilda who probably die in the year 680 be succeed by aelfleda the daughter of king oswin of northumbrium whom she have train in the abbey and there seem little doubt that she pupil carry on successfully the beneficent work of the foundress aelfleda have the support of she mother 's presence as well as the wise counsel of bishop trumwine who have take refuge at streoneshalh after have be drive from he own sphere of work by the depredation of the pict and scot we then learn that aelfleda die at the age of fifty-nine but from that year -- probably 713 -- a complete silence fall upon the work of the abbey for if any record be make during the next century and a half they have be totally lose about the year 867 the dane reach this part of yorkshire and we know that they lay waste the abbey and most probably the town also but the invader gradually start new settlement or ` bys ' and whitby must certainly have grow into a place of some size by the time of edward the confessor for just previous to the norman invasion it be assess for danegeld to the extent of a sum equivalent to # 3500 at the present time after the conquest a monk name reinfrid succeed in revive a monastery on the site of the old one have probably gain the permission of william de percy the lord of the district the new establishment however be for monk only and be for some time merely a priory the form of the successive building from the time of hilda until the building of the stately abbey church whose ruin be now to be see be a subject of great interest but unfortunately there be few fact to go upon the very first church be as i have already suggest a building of rude construction scarcely better than the humble dwelling of the monk and nun the timber wall be most probably thatched and the window would be of small lattice or board pierce with small hole gradually the improvement bring about would have lead to the use of stone for the wall and the building destroy by the danes probably resemble such example of anglo-saxon work as may still be see in the church of bradford-on-avon and monkwearmouth the building erect by reinfrid under the norman influence then prevail in england must have be a slight advance upon the destroy fabric and we know that during the time of he successor serlo de percy there be a certain godfrey in charge of the building operation and there be every reason to believe that he complete the church during the fifty year of prosperity the monastery pass through at that time but this be not the structure which survive for towards the end of stephen 's reign or during that of henry ii the unfortunate convent be devastate by the king of norway who enter the harbor and in the word of the chronicle ` lay waste everything both within door and without ' the abbey slowly recover from this disaster and if any church be build on the ruin between 1160 and the reconstruction commence in 1220 there be no part of it survive to-day in the beautiful ruin that still make a conspicuous landmark from the sea it be after the dissolution that the abbey building come into the hand of sir richard cholmley who pay over to henry viii the sum of # 333 8 4d the manor of eskdaleside and ugglebarnby with all ` they rights member and appurtenance as they formerly have belong to the abbey of whitby ' henceforward belong to sir richard and he successor sir hugh cholmley whose defense of scarborough castle have make he a name in history be bear on July 22 1600 at roxby near pickering he have be justly call ` the father of whitby ' and it be to he we owe a fascinating account of he life at whitby in stuart and jacobean time he describe how he live for some time in the gate-house of the abbey building 'till my house be repair and habitable which then be very ruinous and all unhandsome the wall be only of timber and plaster and ill-contrived within : and besides the repair or rather re-edify the house i build the stable and barn i heighten the outwall of the court double to what they be and make all the wall round about the paddock so that the place have be improve very much both for beauty and profit by I more than all my ancestor for there be not a tree about the house but be set in my time and almost by my own hand the court level which lay upon a hang ground unhandsomely very ill-watered have only the low well which be in the almsers-close which i cover and also discover and erect the other adjoining conduit and the well in the courtyard from whence i convey by leaden pipe water into the house brewhouse and washhouse ' in the spring of 1636 the reconstruction of the abbey house be finish and sir hugh move in with he family ` my dear wife ' he say ' -lrb- who be excellent at dress and make all handsome within door -rrb- have put it into a fine posture and furnish with many good thing so that i believe there be few gentleman in the country of my rank exceed it i be at this time make deputy-lieutenant and colonel over the train-band within the hundred of whitby strand ryedale pickering lythe and scarborough town for that my father be dead the country look upon I as the chief of my family ' sir hugh have be somewhat addict to gamble in he younger day and have make a few debt of he own before he undertake to deal with he father 's heavy liability and in the early year of he married life he have be very much take up with the difficult and arduous work of pay off the amount due to the clamorous creditor during this process he have be force to live very quietly and have incidentally sift out he real friend from among he relation and acquaintance thus it be with pardonable pride that he say : ` have master my debt i do not only appear at all public meeting in a very gentlemanly equipage but live in as handsome and plentiful fashion at home as any gentleman in all the country of my rank i have between thirty and forty in my ordinary family a chaplain who say prayer every morning at six and again before dinner and supper a porter who merely attend the gate which be ever shut up before dinner when the bell ring to prayer and not open till one o'clock except for some stranger who come to dinner which be ever fit to receive three or four besides my family without any trouble and whatever they fare be they be sure to have a hearty welcome twice a week a certain number of old people widow and indigent person be serve at my gate with bread and good pottage make of beef which i mention that those which succeed may follow the example ' not content with merely benefit the aged folk of he town sir hugh take great pain to extend the pier and in 1632 go to london to petition the ` council-table ' to allow a general contribution for this purpose throughout the country as a result of he effort ` all that part of the pier to the west end of the harbor ' be erect and yet he complain that though it be the means of preserve a large section of the town from the sea the townsfolk would not interest themselves in the repair necessitate by force of the wave ' i wish with all my heart ' he exclaim ` the next generation may have more public spirit ' sir hugh cholmley also build a market-house for the town and remove the bridge to its present position owe to rebuild neither of these actual work remain with we to-day but they influence on the progress of whitby must have be considerable on a June morning in the year after sir hugh have settle down so handsomely in he refurbish house two dutch men-of-war chase into the harbor ' a small pickroon belong to the king of spain ' the hollander have 400 man in one ship and 200 in the other but the spaniard have only thirty man and two small gun the holland ship proceed to anchor outside the harbor and lower they longboat send ashore forty man all arm with pistol but the spaniard have be on the alert and have warped they vessel to a safer position above the bridge they place they two gun on the deck and every man prepare himself to defend the ship ' i have notice of this ' write sir hugh ` fear they might do here the like affront as they do at scarborough where they land one hundred man and take a ship belong to the king of spain out of the harbor send for the holland captain and order they not to offer any act of hostility for that the spaniard be the king 's friend and to have protection in he port after some expostulation they promise not to meddle with the dunkirker -lrb- spaniard -rrb- if he offer no injury to they which i give he strict charge against and to trust to the king 's protection these holland captain leave I and go into the town send for the dunkirk captain to dine with they and soon after take occasion to quarrel with he at the same time order they man to fall on the dunkirk ship which they soon surprise the captain and most of the man be absent i be in my courtyard and hear some pistol discharge and be tell the dunkirker and hollander be at odds make haste unto the town have only a cane in my hand and one that follow I without any weapon think my presence would pacify all difference when i come to the river-side on the sand between the coal-yard and the bridge i find the holland captain with a pistol in he hand call to he man then in the dunkirk ship to send a boat for he i give he good word and hold he in treaty until i get near he and then give a leap on he catch hold of he pistol which i become master of yet not without some hazard from the ship for one from thence level a musket at I but i espying it turn the captain between I and he which prevent he shooting ' when sir hugh have secure the captain he send a boatload of man to retake the ship and as soon as the hollander see it approach they flee to they own vessel outside the harbor in the afternoon sir hugh intercept a letter to he prisoner tell he to be of good cheer for at midnight they would land 200 man and bring he away this be a serious matter and sir hugh send to sir john hotham the high sheriff of the county who at once come from fyling and summon all the adjacent train-band there be about 200 man on guard all through the night and evidently the hollander have observe the activity on shore for they make no attack the ship continue to hover outside the harbor for two or three day until sir hugh send the captain to york he be afterwards take to london where he remain a prisoner after the fashion of those time for nearly two year it be after the troublous time of the civil war that sir hugh re-established himself at whitby and open a new era of prosperity for himself and the townsfolk in the alum-works at saltwick nab chapter vii the cleveland hill on they they northern and western flank the cleveland hill have a most impose and mountainous aspect although they greatest altitude do not aspire more than about 1500 foot but they rise so suddenly to they full height out of the flat sea of green country that they often appear as a coast defend by a bold range of mountain roseberry top stand out in grim isolation on its mass of alum rock like a huge seaworn crag considerably over 1000 foot high but this strangely menacing peak raise its defiant head over nothing but broad meadow arable land and woodland and he only warfare be with the lower stratum of storm-cloud which be a convenient thing for the people who live in these part for long ago they use the peak as a sign of approach storm have reduce the warn to the easily-remembered couplet : ` when roseberry top wear a cap let cleveland then beware of a clap ' in a similar manner the scarborough folk use oliver 's mount the isolate hill at the back of the town as a ready-made barometer for they know that ` when oliver 's mount put on he hat scarborough town will pay for that ' it be difficult to decide on the correct spelling of roseberry top as it be often spell in the same way as the earldom and as frequently in old writings it appear as ` rosebury ' camden who write in tudor time call it ounsberry top which certainly do not help matter from the fact that you can see this remarkable peak from almost every point of the compass except south-westward it must follow that from the top of the hill there be view in all those direction but to see so much of the country at once come as a surprise to everyone stretch inland towards the backbone of england there be spread out a huge tract of smile country cover with a most complex network of hedge which gradually melt away into the indefinite blue edge of the world where the hill of wensleydale rise from the plain look across the little town of guisborough lie near the shelter of the hill to the broad sweep of the north sea this piece of yorkshire seem so small that one almost expect to see the cheviot away in the north but beyond the wind tee and the drift smoke of the great manufacturing town on its bank one must be content with the county of durham a huge section of which be plainly visible turn towards the brown moorland the cultivation be exchange for ridge beyond ridge of total desolation -- a huge tract of land in this crowded england where the population for many square mile at a time consist of the inmate of a lonely farm or two in the circumscribe cultivate area of the dale eight or nine hundred year ago these valley be choke up with forest the early british inhabitant be more inclined to the hill-top than the hollow if the innumerable indication of they settlement be any guide and there be every reason for believe that many of the hollow in the fold of the heathery moorland be rarely visit by man thus the suggestion have be make that a few of the last representative of now extinct monster may have survive in these wild retreat for how otherwise do we find persistent story in these part of yorkshire hand down we can not tell how many century of strange creature describe as ` worm ' at loftus they show you the spot where a ` grisly worm ' have its lair and in many place there be tradition of strange long-bodied dragon who be slay by various valiant man when we remember that the last wolf be kill in scotland in the seventeenth century that africa be still add to the list of live animal and that the cave at kirkdale near kirby moorside reveal the bone of elephant tiger hyena and rhinoceros in a excellent state of preservation though they be all break we be incline to believe that these strange story may have have some basis of fact on easby moor a few mile to the south of roseberry top the tall column to the memory of captain cook stand like a lighthouse on this inland coast-line the lofty position it occupy among these brown and purply-green height make the monument visible over a great tract of the sailor 's native cleveland the people who live in marton the village of he birthplace can see the memorial of they hero 's fame and the country lad of to-day be constantly remind of the success which attend the industry and perseverance of a humble marton boy the cottage where jame cook be bear in 1728 have go but the field in which it stand be call cook 's garth the shop at staithe generally speak of as a ` huckster 's ' where cook be apprentice as a boy have also disappear but unfortunately that unpleasant story of he have take a shilling from he master 's till when the attraction of the sea prove too much for he to resist persistently cling to all account of he early life there seem no evidence to convict he of this theft but there be equally no fact by which to clear he but if we put into the balance he subsequent term of employment at whitby the excellent character he gain when he go to sea and professor jk laughton 's statement that he leave staithe ` after some disagreement with he master ' there seem every reason to believe that the story be untrue if it be otherwise the towering monument on easby moor would be a questionable inspiration to posterity i have seldom see a more uninhabited and inhospitable-looking country than the broad extent of purple hill that stretch away to the south-west from great ayton and kildale moor walk from guisborough to kildale on a wild and stormy afternoon in October i be totally alone for the whole distance when i have leave behind I the baker 's boy who be on he way to hutton with a heavy basket of bread and cake hutton which be somewhat of a model village for the retainer attach to hutton hall stand in a lovely hollow at the edge of the moor the steep hill be richly clothe with sombre wood and the peace and seclusion reign there be in marked contrast to the bleak waste above when i climb the steep road on that autumn afternoon and pass the zone of tall withered bracken reach the open moorland i seem to have come out merely to be the plaything of the element for the south-westerly gale when it choose to do so blow so fiercely that it be difficult to make any progress at all overhead be a dark roof compose of heavy mass of cloud form long parallel line of gray right to the horizon on each side of the rough water-worn road the heather make a low wall two or three foot high and stretch right away to the horizon in every direction in the lull between the fierce blast i could hear the trickle of the water in the rivulet deep down in the springy cushion of heather a few nimble sheep would stare at I from a distance and then disappear or some grouse might hover over a piece of rise ground but otherwise there be no sign of live creature near kildale the road suddenly plunge downward to a stream flow through a green cultivate valley with a lonely farm on the further slope there be a fir-wood above this and as i pass over the hill among the tall bare stem the cloud part a little in the west and let a flood of golden light into the wood instantly the gloom seem to disappear and beyond the dark shoulder of moorland where the cook monument appear against the glory of the sunset there seem to reign a all-pervading peace the wood be quite silent for the wind have drop the rough track through the tree descend hurriedly and soon give a wide view over kildale the valley be full of color from the glowing west and the steep hillside opposite appear lighter than the indigo cloud above now slightly tinge with purple the little village of kildale nestle down below its church half bury in yellow foliage the railway come through eskdale from whitby to stockton-on-tee and thus give the formerly remote valley easy communication with the outside world it be dangerous however not to allow a ample margin for catch the train for there be only two or three in each direction in the autumn and winter and a gap of about four hour generally separate the train i have be a long ramble over the moor on the north side of eskdale and have allow the sun to set while i be still draw on the top of danby beacon but have a good map with I i be quite confident of find the road to lealholm without difficulty as the distance be only a very few mile the crimson globe in the west disappear behind the dark horizon over the two fryup valley and leave the world in twilight but it would not be dark for a hour and except for mistake the sheep for boulder and boulder for sheep and be consequently surprise when what i have imagine be a mass of gray stone suddenly disappear on my approach nothing unusual happen i have no fear of lose my way but what my map have lead I to believe would be a plain road be a mere track in the heather and at time it become too indistinct to follow easily lealholm station lay in the valley on my right but i could find no road lead there and i waste precious time in frequent consultation with the map come to a farm i inquire the way and be direct over a number of muddy field which gradually bring I down into the valley it be now sufficiently dark for all the landmark i have notice to be scarcely visible but on inquire at a cottage i be tell that it would take only ten minute to walk to the station i have a clear quarter of a hour and hurry forward soon find myself on a railway-bridge over a deep cutting there be just enough light to see that no station be in sight and it be impossible to find in which direction the station lay there be no time to go back to the cottage and there be no other to be see look at the map again i could not discover the position of this bridge for it be on no road as it seem merely to connect the pasture on either side however i feel fairly certain that i have rather overstep the station and therefore climb down the bank into the cutting and commence walk towards the west come out into the open i think i see the lamp on the platform about half a mile further on but on press forward the light become suddenly bigger and in a minute my train pass I with a thundering rush evidently lealholm be to the east and not the west of that cut it be then 540 and the next train leave for whitby at about a quarter to ten when the tail-light of the train have disappear into the cut i feel very much alone and the silence of the countryside become oppressive it seem to I that this part of yorkshire be just as lonely as when canon atkinson first commence he work in danby parish and i be remind of he friend 's remark on hearing that he be go there : ` why danby be not find out when they send bonaparte to st helena or else they never would have take the trouble to send he all the way there ' the ruin danby castle can still be see on the slope above the esk but the ancient bow bridge at castleton which be build at the end of the twelfth century be barbarously and needlessly destroy in 1873 a picture of the bridge have fortunately be preserve in canon atkinson 's ` forty year in a moorland parish ' that book have be so widely read that it seem scarcely necessary to refer to it here but without the help of the vicar who know every inch of he wild parish the danby district must seem much less interesting chapter viii guisborough and the skelton valley although a mere fragment of the augustinian priory of guisborough be stand to-day it be sufficiently impose to convey a powerful impression of the former size and magnificence of the monastic church this fragment be the gracefully buttress east end of the choir which rise from the level meadow-land to the east of the town the stonework be now of a greenish-gray tone but in the shadow there be generally a look of blue beyond the ruin and through the opening of the great east window now bare of tracery you see the purple moor with the ever-formidable roseberry top hold its head above the green wood and pasture the destruction of the priory take place most probably during the reign of henry viii but there be no recorded fact to give the date of the spoil of the stately building the material be probably sell to the highest bidder for in the town of guisborough there be scatter many fragment of richly-carved stone and ord one of the historian of cleveland say : ' i have behold with sorrow and shame and indignation the richly ornamented column and carve architrave of god 's temple support the thatch of a pig-house ' the norman priory church found in 1119 by the wealthy robert de brus of skelton be unfortunately burn down on may 16 1289 walter of hemingburgh a canon of guisborough have write a quaintly detailed account of the origin of the fire translate from the monkish latin he say : ` on the first day of rogation-week a devour flame consume we church of gysburn with many theological book and nine costly chalice as well as vestment and sumptuous image and because past event be serviceable as a guide to future inquiry i have think it desirable in the present little treatise to give a account of the catastrophe that accident of a similar nature may be avoid through this calamity allot to we on the day above mention which be very destructive to we a vile plumber with he two workman burnt we church whilst soldering up two hole in the old lead with fresh pewter for some day he have already with a wicked disposition commence and place he iron crucible along with charcoal and fire on rubbish or step of a great height upon dry wood with some turf and other combustible about noon -lrb- in the cross in the body of the church where he remain at he work until after mass -rrb- he descend before the procession of the convent think that the fire have be put out by he workman they however come down quickly after he without have completely extinguish the fire and the fire among the charcoal revive and partly from the heat of the iron and partly from the spark of the charcoal the fire spread itself to the wood and other combustible beneath after the fire be thus commence the lead melt and the joist upon the beam ignite and then the fire increase prodigiously and consume everything ' hemingburgh conclude by say that all that they could get from the culprit be the exclamation ` quid potui ego ' shortly after this disaster the prior and convent write to edward ii excuse themselves from grant a corrody owing to they great loss through the burning of the monastery as well as the destruction of they property by the scot but guisborough next to fountain be almost the richest establishment in yorkshire and thus in a few year ' time there arise from the norman foundation a stately church and convent build in the early decorate style glimpse of the inner life of the priory be give in the archbishop 's register at york which show how close and search be the visitation by the archbishop in person or he commissioner and one of the document throw light on the sad necessity for these inspection it deal with archbishop wickwaine 's visit in 1280 and we find that the canon be censure for many short-coming they be not to go outside the cloister after compline -lrb- the last service of the day -rrb- on the pretext of visit guest they be not to keep expensive school for rich or poor unless with special sanction they be to turn out of the infirmary and punish the person lie there who be only pretend to be ill and the really sick be to be more kindly treat there have evidently be discrimination in the quality of food serve out to certain person in the frater but this be to be stop and food of one kind be to be divide equally a more strict silence be to be keep in the cloister and no one be to refrain from join in the praise of god whilst in the choir there seem to have be much improper conversation among the canon for they be specially adjure in christ to abstain from repeat immoral story some of the canon who have make themselves notorious for quarrel and caballing be to be debar from promotion and be commend to the prior and subprior for punishment in 1309 simon constable a refractory canon of bridlington be send to guisborough to undergo a course of penance change of residence be always consider to give a excellent opportunity for thorough reform however in this case no good seem to have result for about five year later he be send back to bridlington with a worse character than before and besides much prayer and humiliation he be to receive a _ disciplina _ every Friday at the hand of the prior this make no improvement in he conduct for in 1321 he behavior bring he another penance and still greater severity a few year after this the archbishop seem to have reproach the community for the conduct of this unruly brother which be scarcely fair the last vision of simon constable show he to be as impenitent as ever and the archbishop make the awful threat that if he do not reform at once he will be put in a more confine place than he have ever be in before can this suggest that the wicked canon be to be brick up alive these internal trouble be not however generally know to the outside world but the unfaltering searchlight of the record fall upon such great folk as peter de mauley fifth baron mulgrave whose castle at mulgrave near whitby be mention elsewhere lucy de thweng wife of sir william le latimer sir nicholas de meynyl and katherine wife of sir john dentorp whose conduct merely reflect the moral of medieval time it be indeed no uncommon event for the congregation to hear some high-born culprit confess he sin as he walk barefoot and scantily clothe in the procession in york minster a exceedingly beautiful crucifix of copper richly gilded be discover during the early part of last century when some man be digging amongst the foundation of a old building in commondale there seem little doubt that this be a cell or chapel belong to the monastery for the crucifix bear the date 1119 the year of the founding of guisborough priory another metal crucifix probably belong to the thirteenth century be discover at ingleby arncliffe it be beautifully inlay with brilliant white green red and blue enamel and the figure of christ be discover to be hollow and to contain two ancient parchment write in monkish latin and scarcely legible one of they be a charm address to ` ye elf and demon and all kind of apparition ' who be call upon in the name of the trinity the virgin mary the apostle martyr mark matthew luke and john and the elect generally to ` hurt not this servant of god adam osanna by night nor by day but that through the very great mercy of god jesus christ by the help of saint mary the mother of we lord jesus christ he may rest in peace from all the aforesaid and other evil ' another intensely interesting relic of the great priory be the altar-tomb believe to be that of robert de brus of annandale the stone slab be now build into the wall on each side of the porch of guisborough church they may have be remove there from the abbey for safety at the time of the dissolution hemingburgh in he chronicle for the year 1294 say : ` robert de brus the fourth die on the eve of good Friday who dispute with john de balliol before the king of england about the succession to the kingdom of scotland and as he order when alive he be bury in the priory of gysburn with great honor beside he own father ' a great number of other famous people be bury here in accordance with they will guisborough have even be claim as the resting-place of robert bruce the champion of scottish freedom but there be ample evidence for believe that he heart be bury at melrose abbey and he body in the church of dunfermline the memory of mr george venable -- that most excellent man who devote many year to gather fund for a charity school in the town -- be preserve on a monument in the church he have retire from business but in order to find the means to start the school he resume he labor in london and devote the whole of the profit to this useful object the central portion of the town of guisborough by the market-cross and the two chief inn be quaint and fairly picturesque but the long street as it go westward deteriorate into row of new cottage inevitable in a mining country mining operation have be carry on around guisborough since the time of queen elizabeth for the discovery of alum date from that period and when that industry gradually decline it be replace by the iron-mine of to-day mr thoma chaloner of guisborough in he travels on the continent about the end of the sixteenth century see the pope 's alum-works near rome and be determine to start the industry in he native parish of guisborough feeling certain that alum could be work with profit in he own county as it be essential to have one or two man who be thoroughly verse in the process of the manufacture mr chaloner induce some of the pope 's workman by heavy bribe to come to england the risk attend this overt act be terrible for the alum-works bring in a large revenue to he holiness and the discovery of such a design would have mean capital punishment to the offender the workman be therefore induce to get into large cask which be secretly convey on board a ship that be shortly sail for england when the pope receive the intelligence some time afterwards he thunder forth against mr chaloner and the workman the most awful and comprehensive curse they be to be curse most wholly and thoroughly in every part of they body every saint be to curse they and from the threshold of the holy church of god almighty they be to be sequester that they might ` be torment disposed of and deliver over with dathan and abiram and with those who say unto the lord god depart from we we desire not to know thy way ' despite the fearful nature of the curse the venture prosper so much that the darcy family about the year 1600 set up another work in the neighborhood of guisborough and as this also bring considerable wealth to the owner a third be start at sandsend in 1615 many other follow and in 1649 sir hugh cholmley start the work close to saltwick nab within a short distance of he house at whitby but although there must have be more than twenty of these work in operation in the eighteenth century owe to cheaper method of produce alum the industry be now quite extinct in cleveland the broad valley stretch from guisborough to the sea contain the beautifully wood park of skelton castle the tree in great mass cover the gentle slope on either side of the skelton beck and almost hide the modern mansion the building include part of the ancient castle of the bruce who be lord of skelton for many year it be record that peter de brus one of the baron who help to coerce john into sign the great charter at runnymede make a curious stipulation when he grant some land at leconfield to henry percy he sister 's husband the property be to be hold on condition that every christmas day he and he heir should come to skelton castle and lead the lady by the arm from she chamber to the chapel the old church of upleatham standing by the road to saltburn be a quaint fragment of a norman build the tower bear the inscription ` william crow chvrchwarden bvlded stepel -- 1664 ' be a addition to what be probably only part of the nave of the little norman building it be now use merely as a cemetery chapel but it be picturesquely situate and on the north wall the carve norman corbel may still be see chapter ix from picker to rievaulx abbey the broad vale of picker water by the derwent the rye and they many tributary be a wonderful contrast to the country we have be explore the level pasture where cattle graze and cornfield abound seem to suggest that we be separate from the heather by many league but we have only to look beyond the hedgerow to see that the horizon to the north be form by lofty moor only a few mile distant just where the low meadow be begin to rise steadily from the vale stand the town of pickering dominate by the lofty stone spire of its parish church and by the broken tower of the castle there be a wide street border by dark stone building that lead steeply from the river to the church the house be as a rule quite featureless but we have learn to expect this in a county where stone be abundant for only the extremely old and the palpably new building stand christ then come herod 's feast with the king label _ herodus _ the guest be show with they arm on the table in the most curious position and all the royal folk be wear ermine the coronation of the virgin the martyrdom of st thoma a becket and the martyrdom of st edmund who be perforated with arrow complete the series on the north side along the south wall the painting show the story of st catherine of alexandrium and the seven corporal act of mercy further on come scene from the life of we lord there seem little doubt that all the painting include a number of other in the transept and elsewhere that be now destroy be whitewash over at the time of the reformation and it be during some restoration work carry out in 1851 that indication of the painting be accidentally lay bare when the whole of the wall have be clean careful color drawing be make then color wash be apply again and the priceless painting disappear for a generation the objection to what have be consider improper wall decoration for a parish church in the nineteenth century have be reason away the picture once more appear but in a very different condition to they first resurrection however the drawing be in existence so that a careful restoration be possible and as we see they to-day the subdue tone closely follow the original color the simple norman arcade on the north side of the nave have plain round column and semicircular arch but the south side belong to later norman time and have ornate column and capital at least one member of the great bruce family who have a house at picker call bruce 's hall and whose ascendency at guisborough have already be mention be bury here for the figure of a knight in chain-mail by the lectern probably represent sir william bruce in the chapel there be a sumptuous monument bear the effigy of sir david and dame margery roucliffe the knight wear the collar of ss and he arm be on he surcoat when john leland the ` royal antiquary ' employ by henry viii come to picker he describe the castle which be in a more perfect state than it be to-day he say : ` in the first court of it be a 4 toure of the which one be caullid rosamunde 's toure ' also of the inner court he write of ' 4 toure wherof the kepe be one ' this keep and rosamund 's tower as well as the ruin of some of the other be still to be see on the outer wall so that from some point of view the ruin be dignified and picturesque the area enclose be large and in early time the castle must have be almost impregnable but during the civil war it be much damage by the soldier quarter there and sir hugh cholmley take lead wood and iron from it for the defense of scarborough the wide view from the castle wall show better than any description the importance of the position it occupy and we feel as we gaze over the vale or northwards to the moor that this be the dominant power over the whole countryside although lastingham be not on the road to helmsley the few additional mile will scarcely be count when we be on we way to a church which besides be architecturally one of the most interesting in the county be perhaps unique in have at one time have a curate whose wife keep a public house adjoining the church although this will scarcely be believe we have a detailed account of the matter in a little book publish in 1806 the clergyman whose name be carter have to subsist on the slender salary of # 20 a year and a few surplice fee this would not have allow any margin for luxury in the case of a bachelor but this poor man be marry and he have thirteen child he be a keen fisherman and he angling in the moorland stream produce a plentiful supply of fish -- in fact more than he family could consume but this even though he often exchange part of he catch with neighbor be not sufficient to keep the wolf from the door and drastic measure have to be take the parish be large and as many of the people be oblige to come ` from ten to fifteen mile ' to church it seem possible that some profit might be make by serve refreshment to the parishioner mr carter superintend this department and it seem that the meal between the service soon become popular but the story of ' a parson-publican ' be soon convey to the archdeacon of the diocese who at the next visitation endeavor to find out the truth of the matter mr carter explain the circumstance and show that far from be a source of disorder he wife 's public-house be a influence for good ' i take down my violin ' he continue ` and play they a few tune which give I a opportunity of see that they get no more liquor than necessary for refreshment and if the young people propose a dance i seldom answer in the negative nevertheless when i announce time for return they be ever ready to obey my command ' the archdeacon appear to have be a broad-minded man for he do not reprimand mr carter at all and as there seem to have be no mention of a increase stipend the parson-publican must have continue this strange anomaly it be difficult to say whether the public-house be conduct in the crypt beneath the church or not i be incline to think that mr carter 's inn be the present ` blacksmith 's arm ' but there be distinct evidence for state that cock-fighting use to take place secretly in the crypt the writings of the venerable bede give a special interest to lastingham for he tell we how king oidilward request bishop cedd to build a monastery there the saxon building that appear at that time have go so that the present church can not be associate with the seventh century no doubt the destruction be the work of the dane who plunder the whole of this part of yorkshire the church that exist to-day be of transitional norman date and the beautiful little crypt which have a apse nave and aisle be coeval with the superstructure the situation of lastingham in a deep and picturesque valley surround by moor and overhang by wood be extremely rich further to the west there be a series of beautiful dale water by beck whose source be among the cleveland hill on we way to ryedale the loveliest of these we pass through kirby moorside a little town which have gain a place in history as the scene of the death of the notorious george villier second duke of buckingham on April 17 1687 the house in which he die be on the south side of the king 's head and in one of the parish register there be the entry under the date of April 19th ` gorge vilua lord dooke of bookingam etc ' further down the street stand a inn with a curious porch support by turn wooden pillar bear the inscription : ` anno : dom 1632 October xi william wood ' kirkdale with its world-renowned cave to which we have already refer lie about two mile to the west the quaint little saxon church there be one of the few bearing evidence of its own date ascertain by the discovery in 1771 of a saxon sundial which have survive under a layer of plaster and be also protect by the porch a translation of the inscription read : ` orm the son of gamal buy st gregory 's minster when it be all break and fall and he cause it to be make anew from the ground for christ and st gregory in the day of king edward and in the day of earl tostus and hawarth work I and brand the prior -lrb- priest or priest -rrb- ' by this we be plainly tell that a church be build there in the reign of edward the confessor a pleasant road lead through nawton to the beautiful little town of helmsley a bend of the broad swift-flowing rye form one boundary of the place and be feed by a gush brook that find its way from rievaulx moor and form a pretty feature of the main street the cottage in many case have preserve they thatched roof and have seldom more than one story but they invariably appear well preserved and carefully paint although these stone-built house with lead casement give little scope for ornament but the helmsley folk have realize the importance of white paint and the window-frame and even the strip of lead that hold the glass together be pick out in this cheerful fashion in the broad market-square the house be large but they gray respectability be break by creeper and some pleasant spot of color the corner nearest to the church be particularly noticeable on account of a most picturesque gabled house with a timber-framed upper floor -- a style of construction exceedingly rare in these part of yorkshire the old stone cross raise above its worn step stand in the open space close to the modern market hall and humbly allow the central position to be occupy by a gothic cross recently erect to the memory of the late lord feversham of duncombe park a narrow turning by the market-house show the torn and dishevelled fragment of the keep of helmsley castle towering above the thatched roof in the foreground the ruin be surround by tall elm and from this point of view when back by a cloudy sunset make a wonderful picture like scarborough this stronghold be hold for the king during the civil war after the battle of marston moor and the fall of york fairfax come to helmsley and invest the castle he receive a wound in the shoulder during the siege but the garrison have surrender on honorable term the parliament order that the castle should be dismantle and the thoroughness with which the instruction be carry out remind one of knaresborough for one side of the keep be blow to piece by a terrific explosion and nearly everything else be destroy all the beauty and charm of this lovely district be accentuate in ryedale and when we have accomplish the three long uphill mile to rievaulx and come out upon the broad grassy terrace above the abbey we seem to have enter a land of beulah we see a peaceful valley overlook on all side by lofty hill whose steep side be clothe with luxuriant wood we see the rye flow past broad green meadow and beneath the tree-covered precipice below we foot appear the solemn roofless remain of one of the first cistercian monastery establish in this country there be nothing to disturb the peace that brood here for the village consist of a mere handful of old and picturesque cottage and we might stay on the terrace for hour and beyond the distant shout of a few child at play and the crowing of some cock hear nothing but the hum of insect and the singing of bird we take a steep path through the wood which lead we down to the abbey ruin the magnificent early english choir and the norman transept stand astonishingly complete in they splendid decay and the lower portion of the nave which until 1922 lay bury beneath mass of grass-grown dbris be now expose to view the richly-draped hill-side appear as a succession of beautiful picture frame by the column and arch on each side of the choir as they stand expose to the weather the perfectly proportioned
