sunless pit deprive of light without know for what offence be the cry of cold the cry of fear the cry of weariness of all that night disable or disarm the rose shiver alone in the dark the hay want to be dry and go to the mow the sickle forget out of door by the reaper and fear it will rust in the grass the white thing dismay at not look white be so greatly the cry of the innocent among beast who have nothing to conceal of the brook fain to show its crystal clearness and even -- for thy very work o night disown thee -- of the puddle longing to glisten the mud longing to become earth again by dry it be so greatly the magnificent cry of the field impatient to feel its wheat and barley growing of the blossom tree mad for still more blossom of the green grape craving a purple side of the bridge wait for footstep for shadow of bird among shadow of branch the voice of all that yearn to sing to drop the garb of mourning live again serve again be a brink be a bourn a sun-warm seat a stone glad to comfort with warmth the hand touch or the insect overcrawl it finally it be so greatly the cry toward the light of all beauty all health all which wish in sunshine and joy to see its work while do it and do it to be see -- and when i feel that vast call to the day arise within I i so expand my soul to make it more sonorous by make it more spacious that the great cry may still be
