memoir of keat adonai : its composition and bibliography its argument general exposition bion and moschus adonai : preface adonai cancel passage of adonai and its preface note preface _ adonai _ be the first writing by shelley which have be include in the _ clarendon press series _ it be a poem of convenient length for such a purpose be neither short nor decidedly long and -- leave out of count some of the short poem -- be the one by this author which approach nearest to be ` popular ' it be elevated in sentiment classical in form -- in substance biographical in relation to keat and in some minor degree autobiographical for shelley himself on these grounds it claim a reasonable preference over all he other poem for the present method of treatment although some student of shelley myself include might be dispose to maintain that in point of absolute intrinsic beauty and achievement and of the quality most especially characteristic of its author it be not superior or indeed be but barely equal to some of he other composition to take for instance two poem not very different in length from _ adonai _ -- _ the witch of atlas _ be more original and _ epipsychidion _ more abstract in ideal i have endeavor to present in my introductory matter a comprehensive account of all particulars relevant to _ adonais _ itself and to keat as its subject and shelley as its author the account here give of both these great poet be of course meager but i assume they to be not insufficient for we immediate and restricted purpose there be many other book which the reader can profitably consult as to the life and work of shelley and three or four -lrb- at least -rrb- as to the life and work of keat my conclude note be i suppose ample in scale : if they be excessive that be a involuntary error on my part my aim in they have be to illustrate and elucidate the poem in its detail yet without travel far afield in search of remote analogy or discursive comment -- my wish be rather to ` stick to my text ' : wherever a difficulty present itself i have essay to define it and clear it up -- but not always to my own satisfaction i have seldom have to discuss the opinion of previous writer on the same point for the simple reason that of detailed criticism of _ adonai _ apart from merely textual memorandum there be next to none it have appear to I to be part of my duty to point out here and there but by no means frequently some special beauty in the poem occasionally also something which seem to I defective or faulty i be aware that this latter be a invidious office which naturally expose one to a imputation from some quarter of obtuseness and from other of presumption none the less i have express myself with the frankness which accord to my own view belong to the essence of such a task as be here undertake _ adonai _ be a composition which have retort beforehand upon its actual or possible detractor in the poem itself and in the prefatory matter adjoin to it shelley take critic very severely to task : but criticism have its discerning and temperate as well as its ` stupid and malignant ' phase wm rossettus _ July 1890 _ memoir of shelley the life of percy bysshe shelley be one which have give rise to a great deal of controversy and which can not for a long time to come fail to be regard with very diverse sentiment he extreme opinion on question of religion and moral and the great latitude which he allow himself in act accord to he own opinion however widely they might depart from the law of the land and of society could not but produce this result in he own time he be generally account a outrageous and shameful offender at the present date many person entertain essentially the same view although soften by lapse of year and by respect for he standing as a poet : other regard he as a conspicuous reformer some take a medium course and consider he to have be sincere and so far laudable but rash and reckless of consequence and so far censurable he poetry also have be subject to very different construction during he lifetime it obtain little notice save for purpose of disparagement and denunciation now it be view with extreme enthusiasm by many and be generally admit to hold a permanent rank in english literature though faulty -lrb- as some opine -rrb- through vague idealism and want of backbone these be all point on which i shall here offer no personal opinion i shall confine myself to trace the chief outline of shelley 's life and -lrb- very briefly -rrb- the sequence of he literary work percy bysshe shelley come of a junior and comparatively undistinguished branch of a very old and note family he branch be term the worminghurst shelley and it be only quite lately -lrb- 1 -rrb- that the affiliation of this branch to the more eminent and senior stock of the michelgrove shelley have pass from the condition of a probable and obvious surmise into that of a established fact the family trace up to sir william shelley judge of the common plea under henry vii thence to a member of parliament in 1415 and to the reign of edward i or even to the norman conquest the worminghurst shelley start with henry shelley who die in 1623 it will be sufficient here to begin with the poet 's grandfather bysshe shelley he be bear at christ church newark north america and raise to a noticeable height chiefly by two wealthy marriage the fortune of the junior branch handsome keen-minded and adventurous he elope with mary catherine heiress of the rev theobald michell of horsham after she death he elope with elizabeth jane heiress of mr perry of penshurst by this second wife he have a family now represent by the baron de l'isle and dudley : by he first wife he have -lrb- besides a daughter -rrb- a son timothy who be the poet 's father and who become in due course sir timothy shelley bart mp he baronetcy be inherit from he father bysshe -- on whom it have be confer in 1806 chiefly through the interest of the duke of norfolk the head of the whig party in the county of sussex to whose politics the new baronet have adhere mr timothy shelley be a very ordinary country gentleman in essential and a rather eccentric one in some detail he be settle at field place near horsham sussex and married elizabeth daughter of charle pilfold of effingham surrey she be a beauty and a woman of good ability but without any literary turn they first child be the poet percy bysshe bear at field place on aug 4 1792 : four daughter also grow up and a younger son john : the eldest son of john be now the baronet have succeed in 1889 sir percy florence shelley the poet 's only survive son no one have manage to discover in the parent of percy bysshe any quality furnish the prototype or the nucleus of he poetical genius or of the very exceptional cast of mind and character which he develop in other direction the parent be commonplace : if we go back to the grandfather sir bysshe we encounter a man who be certainly not commonplace but who seem to have be devoid of either poetical or humanitarian fervor he figure as intent upon he worldly interest accumulate a massive fortune and spending lavishly upon the building of castle goring in he old age penurious unsocial and almost churlish in he habit he passion be to domineer and carry he point of this the poet may have inherit something he ideal of success be wealth and worldly position thing to which the poet be on the contrary abnormally indifferent shelley 's schooling begin at six year of age when he be place under the rev mr edward at warnham at ten he go to sion house school brentford of which the principal be dr greenlaw the pupil be mostly son of local tradesman in July 1804 he proceed to eton where dr goodall be the head master succeed just towards the end of shelley 's stay by the far severer dr keate shelley be shy sensitive and of susceptible fancy : at eton we first find he insubordinate as well he steadily resist the fagging-system learn more as he choose than as he master dictate and be know as ` mad shelley ' and ` shelley the atheist ' it have sometimes be say that a eton boy if rebellious be term ` atheist ' and that the designation as apply to shelley mean no more than that i do not feel satisfied that this be true at all at any rate it seem to I probable that shelley who constantly call himself a atheist in after-life receive the epithet at eton for some cause more apposite than disaffection to school-authority he finally leave eton in July 1810 he have already be enter in university college oxford in April of that year and he commence residence there in October he one very intimate friend in oxford be thomas jefferson hogg a student from the county of durham hogg be not like shelley a enthusiast eager to learn new truth and to apply they but he be a youth appreciative of classical and other literature and little or not at all less disposed than percy to disregard all prescription in religious dogma by demeanor and act they both court academic censure and they get it in its extremest form shelley write probably with some co-operation from hogg and he publish anonymously in oxford a little pamphlet call _ the necessity of atheism _ he project send it round broadcast as a invitation or challenge to discussion this small pamphlet -- it be scarcely more than a flysheet -- hardly amount to say that atheism be irrefragably true and theism therefore false but it propound that the existence of a god can not be prove by reason nor yet by testimony that a direct revelation make to a individual would alone be adequate ground for convince that individual and that the person to whom such a revelation be not accord be in consequence warrant in remain unconvinced the college authority get wind of the pamphlet and find reason for regard shelley as its author and on march 25 1811 they summon he to appear he be require to say whether he have write it or not to this demand he refuse a answer and be then expel by a written sentence ready draw up with hogg the like process be repeat they offence as enter on the college record be that of ` contumaciously refuse to answer question ' and ` repeatedly decline to disavow ' the authorship of the work in strictness therefore they be expel not for be proclaimed atheist but for defy academic authority which require to be satisfy as to that question shortly before this disaster a engagement between shelley and he first cousin on the mother 's side miss harriet grove have come to a end owe to the alarm excite by the youth 's sceptical opinion settle in lodgings in london and parting from hogg who go to york to study conveyance percy pretty soon find a substitute for harriet grove in harriet westbrook a girl of fifteen schoolfellow of two of he sister at clapham she be exceedingly pretty daughter of a retired hotel-keeper in easy circumstance shelley want to talk both she and he sister out of christianity and he cultivate the acquaintance of herself and of she much less juvenile sister eliza call from time to time at they father 's house in chapel street grosvenor square harriet fall in love with he : besides he be a highly eligible _ partus _ be a prospective baronet absolute heir to a very considerable estate and contingent heir -lrb- if he have assent to a proposal of entail to which however he never do assent profess conscientious objection -rrb- to another estate still larger shelley be not in love with harriet but he like she and be willing to do anything he could to further she wish and plan mr timothy shelley after a while pardon he son 's misadventure at oxford and make he a moderate allowance of # 200 a-year percy then visit a cousin in wale a member of the grove family he be recall to london by harriet westbrook who protest against a project of send she back to school he counsel resistance she reply in July 1811 -lrb- to quote a contemporary letter from shelley to hogg -rrb- ` that resistance be useless but that she would fly with I and throw herself upon my protection ' this be clearly a rather decide step upon the damsel 's part : we may form we own conclusion whether she be willing to unite with percy without the bond of marriage or whether she confidently calculate upon induce he to marry she she family be keep in the dark or whether the whole affair be a family maneuver for force on a engagement and a wedding shelley return to london and have various colloquy with harriet : in due course he elope with she to edinburgh and there on 28th August he marry she he age be then just nineteen and hers sixteen shelley who be a profound believer in william godwin 's _ political justice _ reject the institution of marriage as be fundamentally irrational and wrongful but he see that he could not in this instance apply he own pet theory without involve in discredit and discomfort the woman whose love have be bestow upon he either he opinion or she happiness must be sacrifice to what he deem a prejudice of society : he decide rather to sacrifice the former for two year or up to a advanced date in 1813 the married life of shelley and harriet appear to have be a happy one so far as they mutual relation be concern though rambling and scramble restricted by mediocrity of income -lrb- # 400 a year make up between the two father -rrb- and pester by the continual and to percy at last very offensive presence of miss westbrook as a inmate of the house they live in york keswick in cumberland dublin -lrb- which shelley visit as a express advocate of catholic emancipation and repeal of the union -rrb- nantgwillt in radnorshire lynmouth in devonshire tanyrallt in carnarvonshire london bracknell in berkshire : ireland and edinburgh be also revisit various strange adventure befall the oddest of all be a alleged attempt at assassination at tanyrallt shelley assert it other disbelieve it : after much disputation the biographer suppose that if not a imposture it be a romance and if not a romance at least a hallucination -- shelley besides be wild in talk and wild in fancy be by this time much addict to laudanum-dosing in June 1813 harriet give birth in london to she first child ianthe eliza -lrb- she marry a mr esdaile and die in 1876 -rrb- about the same time shelley bring out he earliest work of importance the poem of _ queen mab _ : its speculative audacity be too extreme for publication so it be only privately print amiable and accommodate at first and neither ill-educated nor stupid harriet do not improve in tone as she advance in womanhood she sympathy or tolerance for she husband 's ideal and vagary flag when they differ she give he the cold shoulder she want luxury -- such as a carriage of she own -- which he neither care for nor could properly afford he even say -- and one can hardly accuse he of say it insincerely -- that she have be unfaithful to he : this however remain quite unproved and may have be a delusion he seek the society of the philosopher godwin then settle as a bookseller in skinner street holborn godwin 's household at this time consist of he second wife who have be a mr clairmont mary he daughter by he first wife the celebrated mary wollstonecraft and he young son by he second wife william also he step-children charle and clare clairmont and fanny wollstonecraft -lrb- or imlay -rrb- the daughter of mary wollstonecraft by she first irregular union with gilbert imlay until may 1814 when she be get on towards the age of seventeen shelley have scarcely set eye on mary godwin : he then see she and a sudden passion spring up between they -- uncontrollable or at any rate uncontrolled harriet shelley have leave it on record that the advance and importunity come from mary godwin to shelley and be for a while resist : it be natural for harriet to allege this but i should not suppose it to be true unless in a very partial sense shelley send for he wife who have go for a while to bath -lrb- perhaps in a fit of pettishness but this be not clear -rrb- and explain to she in June that they must separate -- a resolve which she combate as far as seem possible but finally she return to bath staying there with she father and sister shelley make some arrangement for she convenience and on the 28th of July he once more elope this time with mary godwin clare clairmont choose to accompany they godwin be totally oppose to the whole transaction and mr godwin even pursue the fugitive across the channel but she appeal be unavailing and the youthful and defiant trio proceed in much elation of spirit and not without a good deal of discomfort at time from calai to pari and thence to brunen by the lake of urus in switzerland it be a curious fact and show how differently shelley regard these matter from most people that he write to harriet in affectionate term urge she to join they there or reside hard by they mary before the elopement take place have make a somewhat similar proposal harriet have no notion of comply and as it turn out the adventurer have no sooner reach brunen than they find they money exhaust and they travel back in all haste to london in September -- clare continue to house with they now and for the most part during the remainder of shelley 's life even a poet and idealist might have be expect to show a little more worldly wisdom than this after he grievous experience with eliza westbrook the sister of he first wife shelley might have manage to steer clear of clare clairmont the sister by affinity of he second partner in life he would not take warning and he pay the forfeit : not indeed that clare be want in fine quality both of mind and of character but she prove a constant source of excitement and uneasiness in the household of unfounded scandal and of harass complication in london shelley and mary live in great strait abandon by almost all they acquaintance and play hide-and-seek with creditor but in January 1815 sir bysshe shelley die and percy 's money affair improve greatly a arrangement be arrive at with he father whereby he receive a regular annual income of # 1000 out of which he assign to harriet # 200 for herself and she two child -- a son charle bysshe have be bear in November 1814 -lrb- he die in 1826 -rrb- shelley and mary next settle at bishopgate near windsor forest in may 1816 they go abroad along with miss clairmont and they infant son william and join lord byron on the shore of the lake of geneva a amour be already go on between byron and miss clairmont it result in the birth of a daughter allegra in January 1817 she die in 1822 very shortly before shelley he and mary have return to london in September 1816 very shortly afterwards 9th of November the ill-starred harriet shelley drown herself in the serpentine : she body be only recover on the 10th of December and the verdict of the coroner 's jury be ` find drown ' she name be give as ` harriet smith ' the career of harriet since she separation from she husband be very indistinctly know it have indeed be assert in positive term that she form more than one connexion with other man : she have cease to live along with she father and sister and be say to have be expel from they house in these statement i see nothing either unveracious or unlikely : but it be true that a sceptical habit of mind which insist upon express evidence and upon severe sifting of evidence may remain unconvinced -lrb- 2 -rrb- this be the second suicide in shelley 's immediate circle for fanny wollstonecraft have take poison just before under rather unaccountable circumstance no doubt he feel dismay and horror and self-reproach as well yet there be nothing to show that he condemn he conduct at any stage of the transaction with harriet as heinously wrong he take the earliest opportunity -- 30th of December -- of marry mary godwin and thus he become reconcile to she father and to other member of the family it be towards the time of harriet 's suicide that shelley staying in and near london become personally intimate with the essayist and poet leigh hunt and through he he come to know john keat : they first meeting appear to have occur on 5th February 1817 as this matter bear directly upon we immediate theme the poem of _ adonai _ i deal with it at far greater length than its actual importance in the life of shelley would otherwise warrant hunt in he _ autobiography _ narrate as follow ' i have not know the young poet -lrb- keat -rrb- long when shelley and he become acquaint under my roof keat do not take to shelley as kindly as shelley do to he shelley 's only thought of he new acquaintance be such as regard he bad health with which he sympathise -lrb- this about bad health seem properly to apply to a date later than the opening period when the two poet come together -rrb- and he poetry of which he have leave such a monument of he admiration as _ adonai _ keat be a little too sensitive on the score of he origin feel inclined to see in every man of birth a sort of natural enemy they style in write also be very different and keat notwithstanding he unbounded sympathy with ordinary flesh and blood and even the transcendental cosmopolitic of _ hyperion _ be so far inferior in universality to he great acquaintance that he could not accompany he in he daedal round with nature and he archimedean endeavor to move the globe with he own hand -lrb- a allusion to the motto append to _ queen mab _ -rrb- i be bind to state thus much because hopeless of recover he health under circumstance that make the feeling extremely bitter a irritable morbidity appear even to have drive he suspicion to excess and this not only with regard to the acquaintance whom he might reasonably suppose to have have some advantage over he but to myself who have none for i learn the other day with extreme pain that keat at one period of he intercourse with we suspect both shelley and myself of a wish to see he undervalue such be the trick which constant infelicity can play with the most noble nature for shelley let _ adonai _ answer ' it be to be observe that hunt be here rather put the cart before the horse keat -lrb- as we shall see immediately -rrb- suspect shelley and hunt ` of a wish to see he undervalue ' as early as February 1818 but he ` irritable morbidity ' when ` hopeless of recover he health ' belong to a later date say the spring and summer of 1820 it be say that in the spring of 1817 shelley and keat agree that each of they would undertake a epic to be write in a space of six month : shelley produce _ the revolt of islam _ -lrb- originally entitle _ laon and cythna _ -rrb- and keat produce _ endymion _ shelley 's poem the longer of the two be complete by the early autumn while keat 's occupy he until the winter which open 1818 on 8th October 1817 keat write to a friend ' i refuse to visit shelley that i might have my own unfettered scope meaning presumably that he wish to finish _ endymion _ accord to he own canon of taste and execution without be hamper by any advice from shelley there be also a letter from keat to he two brother 22nd December 1817 say : ` shelley 's poem _ laon and cythna _ be out and there be word about its be object to as much as _ queen mab _ be poor shelley i think he have he quota of good quality ' as late as February 1818 he write ' i have not yet read shelley 's poem ' on 23rd January of the same year he have write : ` the fact be he -lrb- hunt -rrb- and shelley be hurt and perhaps justly at my not have show they the affair -lrb- _ endymion _ in m -rrb- officiously and from several hint i have have they appear much disposed to dissect and anatomize any trip or slip i may have make ' it be at nearly the same date 4th February that keat shelley and hunt write each a sonnet on _ the nile _ : in my judgment shelley 's be the least successful of the three soon after they marriage shelley and he second wife settle at great marlow in buckinghamshire they be shortly disturb by a chancery suit whereby mr westbrook seek to deprive shelley of the custody of he two child by harriet ianthe and charle towards march 1818 lord chancellor eldon pronounce judgment against shelley on the ground of he culpable conduct as a husband carry out culpable opinion uphold in he writings the child be hand over to dr hume a army-physician name by shelley : he have to assign for they support a sum of # 120 per annum bring up to # 200 by a supplement from mr westbrook about the same date he suffer from a illness which he regard as a dangerous pulmonary attack and he make up he mind to quit england for italy accompany by he wife they two infant william and clara miss clairmont and she infant allegra who be soon afterwards consign to lord byron in venice mr charle cowden clarke who be keats 's friend from boyhood write : ` when shelley leave england for italy keat tell I that he have receive from he a invitation to become he guest and in short to make one of he household it be upon the purest principle that keat decline he noble proffer for he entertain a exalted opinion of shelley 's genius -- in itself a inducement he also know of he deed of bounty and from they frequent social intercourse he have full faith in the sincerity of he proposal keat say that in decline the invitation he sole motive be the consciousness which would be ever prevalent with he of he be in its utter extent not a free agent even within such a circle as shelley 's -- he himself nevertheless be the most unrestricted of being ' mr clarke seem to mean in this passage that shelley _ before _ start for italy invite keat to accompany he thither -- a fact if such it be of which i find no trace elsewhere it be however just possible that clarke be only refer to the earlier invitation previously mention for keat to visit at great marlow or he may most probably with some confusion as to date and detail be think of the message which shelley when already settle in italy for a couple of year address to he brother-poet -- of which more anon shelley and he family -- include for the most part miss clairmont -- wander about a good deal in italy they be in milan leghorn the bagnus di lucca venice and its neighborhood rome naple florence pisa the bagnus di pisa and finally -lrb- after shelley have go to ravenna by himself -rrb- in a lonely house name casa magni between lericus and san terenzio on the bay of spezzium they two child die but in 1819 another be bear the sir percy florence shelley who live on till November 1889 they be often isolate or even solitary among they interesting acquaintance at one place or another be besides byron mr and mr gisborne -lrb- the latter have previously be mr reveley and have be seek in marriage by godwin after the death of mary wollstonecraft in 1797 -rrb- the contessina emilium vivianus celebrate in shelley 's poem of _ epipsychidion _ captain medwin shelley 's cousin and schoolfellow the greek prince alexander mavrocordato lieutenant and mr william who join they at casa magni and edward john trelawny a adventurous and daring sea-rover who afterwards accompany byron to greece it be only towards the summer of 1819 that shelley read the _ endymion _ he write of it thus in a letter to he publisher mr ollier September 6 1819 ' i have read keat 's poem much praise be due to I for have read it the author 's intention appear to be that no person should possibly get to the end of it yet it be full of some of the highest and the finest gleam of poetry : indeed everything seem to be view by the mind of a poet which be describe in it i think if he have print about fifty page of fragment from it i should have be lead to admire keat as a poet more than i ought -- of which there be now no danger ' shelley regard the hymn to pan in the first book of _ endymion _ as afford ` the surest promise of ultimate excellence ' the health of keat have break down and consumption have set in shelley write to he from pisa urge he to come over to italy as he guest keat do not however go to pisa but along with the young painter joseph severn to naple and thence to rome i here subjoin shelley 's letter ` pisa -- 27 July 1820 ` my dear keat ' i hear with great pain the dangerous accident you have undergo -lrb- recurrence of blood-spitting from the lung -rrb- and mr gisborne who give I the account of it add that you continue to wear a consumptive appearance this consumption be a disease particularly fond of people who write such good verse as you have do and with the assistance of a english winter it can often indulge its selection i do not think that young and amiable poet be bind to gratify its taste : they have enter into no bond with the muse to that effect but seriously -lrb- for i be joke on what i be very anxious about -rrb- i think you would do well to pass the winter in italy and avoid so tremendous a accident and if you think it as necessary as i do so long as you continue to find pisa or its neighborhood agreeable to you mr shelley unite with myself in urge the request that you would take up you residence with we you might come by sea to leghorn -lrb- france be not worth see and the sea be particularly good for weak lung -rrb- -- which be within a few mile of we you ought at all event to see italy and you health which i suggest as a motive may be a excuse to you i spare declamation about the statue and painting and ruin and -lrb- what be a greater piece of forbearance -rrb- about the mountain and stream the field the color of the sky and the sky itself ' i have lately read you _ endymion _ again and even with a new sense of the treasure of poetry it contain -- though treasure pour forth with indistinct profusion this people in general will not endure and that be the cause of the comparatively few copy which have be sell i feel persuade that you be capable of the greatest thing so you but will i always tell ollier to send you copy of my book _ prometheus unbound _ i imagine you will receive nearly at the same time with this letter _ the cencus _ i hope you have already receive : it be studiously compose in a different style below the _ good _ how far but far above the _ great _ -lrb- 3 -rrb- in poetry i have seek to avoid system and mannerism i wish those who excel I in genius would pursue the same plan ` whether you remain in england or journey to italy believe that you carry with you my anxious wish for you health and success -- wherever you be or whatever you undertake -- and that i be ` yours sincerely ` pb shelley ' keat 's reply to shelley run as follow : -- ` hampstead -- August 10 1820 ` my dear shelley ' i be very much gratify that you in a foreign country and with a mind almost over-occupied should write to I in the strain of the letter beside I if i do not take advantage of you invitation it will be prevent by a circumstance i have very much at heart to prophesy -lrb- 4 -rrb- there be no doubt that a english winter would put a end to I and do so in a linger hateful manner therefore i must either voyage or journey to italy as a soldier march up to a battery my nerve at present be the worst part of I : yet they feel soothed that come what extreme may i shall not be destine to remain in one spot long enough to take a hatred of any four particular bedpost ' i be glad you take any pleasure in my poor poem -- which i would willingly take the trouble to unwrite if possible do i care so much as i have do about reputation ' i receive a copy of _ the cencus _ as from yourself from hunt there be only one part of it i be judge of -- the poetry and dramatic effect which by many spirit nowadays be consider the mammon a modern work it be say must have a purpose which may be the god a artist must serve mammon : he must have self-concentration -- selfishness perhaps you i be sure will forgive I for sincerely remark that you might curb you magnanimity and be more of a artist and load every rift of you subject with ore the thought of such discipline must fall like cold chain upon you who perhaps never sit with you wing furl for six month together and be not this extraordinary talk for the writer of _ endymion _ whose mind be like a pack of scattered card i be pick up and sort to a pip my imagination be a monastery and i be its monk ' i be in expectation of _ prometheus _ every day could i have my own wish effect you would have it still in manuscript or be but now put a end to the second act i remember you advise I not to publish my first blight on hampstead heath -lrb- 5 -rrb- i be return advice upon you hand most of the poem in the volume i send you -lrb- this be the volume contain _ lamium hyperion _ & c -rrb- have be write above two year -lrb- 6 -rrb- and would never have be publish but for hope of gain : so you see i be incline enough to take you advice now ' i must express once more my deep sense of you kindness add my sincere thanks and respects for mr shelley in the hope of soon see you i remain ` most sincerely yours ` john keat ' it may have be in the interval between write he note of invitation to keat and receive the reply of the latter that shelley pen the following letter to the editor of the _ quarterly review _ -- the periodical which have take -lrb- or have share with _ blackwood 's magazine _ -rrb- the lead in depreciate _ endymion _ the letter however be leave uncompleted and be not dispatch -lrb- i omit such passage as be not directly concern with keat -rrb- : -- ` sir ` should you cast you eye on the signature of this letter before you read the contents you might imagine that they relate to a slanderous paper which appear in you review some time since i be not in the habit of permit myself to be disturb by what be say or write of I the case be different with the unfortunate subject of this letter the author of _ endymion _ to whose feeling and situation i entreat you to allow I to call you attention i write considerably in the dark but if it be mr gifford that i be address i be persuade that in a appeal to he humanity and justice he will acknowledge the _ fa ab hoste docerus _ i be aware that the first duty of a reviewer be towards the public and i be willing to confess that the _ endymion _ be a poem considerably defective and that perhaps it deserve as much censure as the page of you review record against it but not to mention that there be a certain contemptuousness of phraseology from which it be difficult for a critic to abstain in the review of _ endymion _ i do not think that the writer have give it its due praise surely the poem with all its fault be a very remarkable production for a man of keat 's age -lrb- 7 -rrb- and the promise of ultimate excellence be such as have rarely be afford even by such as have afterwards attain high literary eminence look at book 2 line 833 & c and book 3 line 113 to 120 read down that page and then again from line 193 -lrb- 8 -rrb- i could cite many other passage to convince you that it deserve milder usage why it should have be review at all except for the purpose of bring its excellence into notice i can not conceive for it be very little read and there be no danger that it should become a model to the age of that false taste with which i confess that it be replenish ` poor keat be throw into a dreadful state of mind by this review which i be persuade be not write with any intention of produce the effect -- to which it have at least greatly contribute -- of embitter he existence and induce a disease from which there be now but faint hope of he recovery the first effect be describe to I to have resemble insanity and it be by assiduous watch that he be restrain from effect purpose of suicide the agony of he suffering at length produce the rupture of a blood-vessel in the lung and the usual process of consumption appear to have begin he be come to pay I a visit in italy but i fear that unless he mind can be keep tranquil little be to be hope from the mere influence of climate ` but let I not extort anything from you pity i have just see a second volume publish by he evidently in careless despair i have desire my bookseller to send you a copy : and allow I to solicit you especial attention to the fragment of a poem entitle _ hyperion _ the composition of which be check by the review in question the great proportion of this piece be surely in the very highest style of poetry i speak impartially for the canon of taste to which keat have conform in he other composition be the very reverse of my own i leave you to judge for yourself : it would be a insult to you to suppose that from motive however honorable you would lend yourself to a deception of the public ' the question arise how do shelley know what he here state -- that keat be throw by read the _ quarterly _ article into a state resemble insanity that he contemplate suicide & c not any document have be publish whereby this information could have be impart to shelley : he chief informant on the subject appear to have be mr gisborne who have now for a short while return to england and some confirmation may have come from hunt as to the statement themselves they have ever since the appearance in 1848 of lord houghton 's _ life of keat _ be regard as very gross exaggeration : indeed i think the tendency have since then be excessive in the reverse direction and the vexation occasion to keat by hostile criticism have come to be underrated shelley address to keat in naple another letter ` anxiously enquire about he health offer he advice as to the adaptation of diet to the climate and conclude with a urgent invitation to pisa where he could assure he every comfort and attention ' shelley do not however re-invite keat to he own house on the present occasion write to miss clairmont ` we be not rich enough for that sort of thing ' the letter to miss clairmont be date 18 February 1821 and appear to have be almost simultaneous with the one send to keat in that case keat can not be suppose to have receive the invitation for he have towards the middle of November quit naple for rome and by 18 February he be almost at he last gasp shelley 's feeling as to keat 's final volume of poem be further exhibit in the following extract -lrb- to thoma love peacock November 1820 -rrb- ` among the modern thing which have reach I be a volume of poem by keat in other respects insignificant enough but contain the fragment of a poem call _ hyperion _ i dare say you have not time to read it but it be certainly a astonishing piece of write and give I a conception of keat which i confess i have not before ' -lrb- to mr leigh hunt 11 November 1820 -rrb- ` keat 's new volume have arrive to we and the fragment call _ hyperion _ promise for he that he be destine to become one of the first writer of the age he other thing be imperfect enough -lrb- 9 -rrb- and what be worse write in the bad sort of style which be become fashionable among those who fancy that they be imitate hunt and wordsworth where be keat now i be anxiously expect he in italy when i shall take care to bestow every possible attention on he i consider he a most valuable life and i be deeply interested in he safety i intend to be the physician both of he body and he soul -- to keep the one warm and to teach the other greek and spanish i be aware indeed in part that i be nourish a rival who will far surpass I and this be a additional motive and will be a added pleasure ' -lrb- to peacock 15 February 1821 -rrb- ` among you anathema of the modern attempt in poetry do you include keat 's _ hyperion _ i think it very fine he other poem be worth little but if the _ hyperion _ be not grand poetry none have be produce by we contemporary ' there be also a phrase in a letter to mr ollier write on 14 may 1820 before the actual publication of the _ lamium _ volume : ` keat i hope be go to show himself a great poet like the sun to burst through the cloud which though dye in the finest color of the air obscure he rise ' keat die in rome on 23 February 1821 soon afterwards shelley write he _ adonai _ he have leave various write reference to _ adonais _ and to keat in connexion with it : these will come more appropriately when i speak of that poem itself but i may here at once quote from the letter which shelley address on 16 June 1821 to mr gisborne who have send on to he a letter from colonel finch -lrb- 10 -rrb- give a very painful account of the last day of keat and especially -lrb- perhaps in more than due proportion -rrb- of the violence of temper which he have exhibit shelley write thus : ' i have receive the heartrending account of the closing scene of the great genius whom envy and ingratitude -lrb- 11 -rrb- scourge out of the world i do not think that if i have see it before i could have compose my poem the enthusiasm of the imagination would have overpower the sentiment as it be i have finish my elegy and this day i send it to the press at pisa you shall have a copy the moment it be complete i think it will please you i have dip my pen in consuming fire for he destroyer : otherwise the style be calm and solemn -lrb- 12 -rrb- as i have already say the last residence of shelley be on the gulf of spezzium he have a boat build name the ariel -lrb- by byron the don juan -rrb- boat be he favorite recreation and on 1 July 1822 he and lieut william along with a single sailor-lad start in she for leghorn to welcome there leigh hunt the latter have come to italy with he family on the invitation of byron and shelley to join in a periodical to be call _ the liberal _ on 8 July shelley with he two companion embark to return to casa magni towards half-past six in the evening a sudden and tremendous squall spring up the ariel sink either upset by the squall or -lrb- as some detail of evidence suggest -rrb- run down near viareggio by a italian fishing-boat the crew of which have plot to plunder she of a sum of money the body be eventually wash ashore and on 16 August the corpse of shelley be burn on the beach under the direction of trelawny in the pocket of he

to mr shelley be bury in rome in the new protestant cemetery the corpse of shelley 's beloved son william have in 1819 be inter hard by and in 1821 that of keat in the old cemetery -- a space of ground which have by 1822 be finally close the enthusiastic and ideal fervor which mark shelley 's poetry could not possibly be simulated -- it be a part the most essential part of he character he be remarkably single-minded in the sense of be constantly ready to do what he profess as in the abstract the right thing to be do impetuous bold uncompromising lavishly generous and inspire by a general love of humankind and a coequal detestation of all the narrow influence of custom and prescription pity which include self-pity be one of he dominant emotion if we consider what be the use and what the abuse of a character of this type we shall have some notion of the excellence and the defect of shelley in person he be well-grown and slim more nearly beautiful than handsome he complexion brilliant he dark-brown but slightly grizzling hair abundant and wavy and he eye deep-blue large and fixed he voice be high-pitched -- at time discordant but capable of agreeable modulation he general aspect uncommonly youthful the roll of shelley 's publication be a long one for a man who perish not yet thirty year of age i append a list of the principal one accord to date of publication which be never very distant from that of composition several minor production remain unspecified 1810 zastrozzus a romance puerile rubbish original poetry by victor and cazire withdraw and ever since unknown

masque of anarchy _ and _ peter bell the third _ both write by shelley in 1819 be publish later on also various minor poem complete or fragmentary _ peter bell the third _ have a certain fortuitous connexion with keat it be write in consequence of shelley 's have read in _ the examiner _ a notice of _ peter bell a lyrical ballad _ -lrb- the production of john hamilton reynold -rrb- : and this notice as have very recently be prove be the handiwork of keat shelley can not have be aware of that fact he prose _ essay and letter _ include _ the defense of poetry _ appear in 1840 the only known work of shelley extant but yet unpublished be the _ philosophical view of reform _ : a abstract of it with several extract be print in the _ fortnightly review _ in 1886 memoir of keat the parent of

which some symptom have appear also in earlier year : it may be regard as the beginning of he fatal malady he cut short he tour and return to hampstead where he have to nurse he younger brother tom a consumptive invalid who die in December of the same year at the house of the dilke in the autumn of 1818 keat make the acquaintance of miss fanny brawne the orphan daughter of a gentleman of independent means : he be soon desperately in love with she have ' a swoon admiration of she beauty : ' towards the spring of 1819 they engage to marry with the prospect of a long engagement on the night of 3 February 1820 on return to the house at hampstead which he share with mr brown the poet have he first attack a violent one of blood-spitting from the lung he rally somewhat but suffer a dangerous relapse in June just prior to the publication of he final volume contain all he best poem -- _ isabellum hyperion the eve of st agne lamium _ and the lead ode he doctor order he off as a last chance to italy previously to this he have be stay in the house of mr and miss brawne who tend he affectionately keat be now exceedingly unhappy he passionate love he easily rouse feeling of jealousy of miss brawne and of suspicious rancor against even the most amicable and attach of he male intimate the general indifference and the particular scorn and ridicule with which he poem have be receive he narrow means and uncertain outlook and the prospect of a early death close a painful and harass illness -- all prey upon he mind with unrelenting tenacity the worst of all be the sense of approach and probably final separation from fanny brawne on 18 September 1820 he leave england for italy in company with mr joseph severn a student of painting in the royal academy who have win the gold medal be entitle to spend three year abroad for advancement in he art they travel by sea to naple reach that city late in October and towards the middle of November go on to rome here keat receive the most constant and kind attention from dr -lrb- afterwards sir jame -rrb- clark but all be of no avail : after continual and severe suffering devotedly watch by severn he expire on 23 February 1821 he be bury in the old protestant cemetery of rome under a little altar-tomb sculpture with a greek lyre he name be inscribe along with the epitaph which he himself have compose in the bitterness of he soul ` here lie one whose name be writ in water ' keat be a undersized man little more than five foot high he face be handsome ardent and full of expression the hair rich brown and curl the hazel eye ` mellow and glowing -- large dark and sensitive ' he be frame for enjoyment but with that acuteness of feeling which turn even enjoyment into suffering and then again extract a luxury out of melancholy he have vehemence and generosity and the frankness which belong to these quality not unmingled however with a strong dose of suspicion apart from the overmastering love of he closing year he one ambition be to be a poet he mind be little concerned either with the severe practicality of life or with the abstraction of religious faith he poem consist of three successive volume have be already refer to here the first volume the _ poem _ of 1817 be mostly of a juvenile kind contain only scattered suggestion of rich endowment and eventual excellence _ endymion _ be lavish and profuse nervous and languid the wealth of a prodigal scatter in largesse of bauble and of gem the last volume -- comprise the _ hyperion _ -- be the work of a noble poetic artist powerful and brilliant both in imagination and in expression of the writings publish since they author 's death the only one of first-rate excellence be the fragmentary _ eve of st mark _ there be also the drama of _ otho the great _ write in co-operation with armitage brown and in keat 's letter many admirable thought be admirably word as to the relation between shelley and keat i have to refer back to the precede memoir of shelley adonai : its composition and bibliography for nearly two month after the death of keat 23 February 1821 shelley appear to have remain in ignorance of the event : he know it on or before 19 April the precise date when he begin he elegy do not seem to be record : one may suppose it to have be in the latter half of may on 5 June he write to mr and mr gisborne : ' i have be engage these last day in compose a poem on the death of keat which will shortly be finish and i anticipate the pleasure of read it to you as some of the very few person who will be interested in it and understand it it be a highly work piece of art and perhaps better in point of composition than anything i have write ' a letter to mr ollier follow immediately afterwards ` pisa June 8th 1821 ` you may announce for publication a poem entitle _ adonai _ it be a lament on the death of poor keat with some intersperse stab on the assassin of he peace and of he fame and will be precede by a criticism on _ hyperion _ assert the due claim which that fragment give he to the rank which i have assign he my poem be finish and consist of about forty spenser stanza -lrb- fifty-five as publish -rrb- i shall send it to you either print at pisa or transcribe in such a manner as it shall be difficult for the reviser to leave such error as assist the obscurity of the _ prometheus _ but in case i send it print it will be merely that mistake may be avoid i shall only have a few copy strike off in the cheapest manner if you have interest enough in the subject i could wish that you enquire of some of the friend and relation of keat respect the circumstance of he death and could transmit I any information you may be able to collect and especially as -lrb- to -rrb- the degree in which -lrb- as i be assure -rrb- the brutal attack in the _ quarterly review _ excite the disease by which he perish ' the criticism which shelley intend to write on _ hyperion _ remain to all appearance unwritten it will be see from the letter of shelley to mr severn cite further on -lrb- p 34 -rrb- that from the notion of write a criticism on _ hyperion _ to precede _ adonai _ he intention develop into the project of write a criticism and biography of keat in general to precede a volume of he entire work but that before the close of November the whole scheme be give up on the ground that it would produce no impression on a unregardful public in another letter to ollier 11 June the poet say : ` adonais be finish and you will soon receive it it be little adapt for popularity but be perhaps the least imperfect of my composition ' shelley on 16 June cause he elegy to be print in pisa ` with the type of didot ' : a small quarto and a handsome one -lrb- notwithstanding he project of cheapness -rrb- the introductory matter fill five page and the poem itself go on from p 7 to p 25 it appear in blue paper wrapper with a woodcut of a basket of flower within a ornamental border its price be three and sixpence : of late year # 40 have be give for it -- perhaps more up to 13 July only one copy have reach the author 's hand : this he then send on to the gisborne at leghorn some copy of the pisa edition be afterwards put into circulation in london : there be no separate english edition the gisborne have acknowledge the elegy with expression of admiration the poet reply as follow : ` bagnus -lrb- di pisa -rrb- July 19 ` my dearest friend ' i be fully repay for the painful emotion from which some verse of my poem spring by you sympathy and approbation which be all the reward i expect and as much as i desire it be not for I to judge whether in the high praise you feeling assign I you be right or wrong the poet and the man be two different nature : though they exist together they may be unconscious of each other and incapable of decide on each other 's power and effort by any reflex act the decision of the cause whether or not i be a poet be remove from the present time to the hour when we posterity shall assemble : but the court be a very severe one and i fear that the verdict will be guilty -- death ' a letter to mr ollier be probably a little later it say : ' i send you a sketch for a frontispiece to the poem _ adonai _ pray let it be put into the engraver 's hand immediately as the poem be already on its way to you and i should wish it to be ready for its arrival the poem be beautifully print and -- what be of more consequence -- correctly : indeed it be to obtain this last point that i send it to the press at pisa in a few day you will receive the bill of lade ' nothing be know as to the sketch which shelley thus send it can not i presume have be he own production nor yet severn 's : possibly it be supply by lieutenant william who have some aptitude as a amateur artist i add some of the poet 's other expression regard _ adonai _ which he evidently regard with more complacency than any of he previous work -- at any rate as a piece of execution hitherto he favorite have be _ prometheus unbound _ : i be fain to suppose that that great effort do not now hold a second place in he affection though he may have consider that the _ adonai _ as be a less arduous feat come nearer to reach its goal -lrb- to peacock August 1821 -rrb- ' i have send you by the gisborne a copy of the elegy on keat the subject i know will not please you but the composition of the poetry and the taste in which it be write i do not think bad ' -lrb- to hunt 26 August -rrb- ` before this you will have see _ adonais _ lord byron -- i suppose from modesty on account of he be mention in it -- do not say a word of _ adonai _ -lrb- 13 -rrb- though he be loud in he praise of _ prometheus _ and -lrb- what you will not agree with he in -rrb- censure of _ the cencus _ ' -lrb- to horace smith 14 September -rrb- ' i be glad you like _ adonais _ and particularly that you do not think it metaphysical which i be afraid it be i be resolve to pay some tribute of sympathy to the unhonoured dead but i write as usual with a total ignorance of the effect that i should produce ' -lrb- to ollier 25 September -rrb- ` the _ adonai _ in spite of its mysticism be the least imperfect of my composition and as the image of my regret and honor for poor keat i wish it to be so i shall write to you probably by next post on the subject of that poem and should have send the promise criticism for the second edition have i not mislay and in vain seek for the volume that contain _ hyperion _ ' -lrb- to ollier 14 November -rrb- ' i be especially curious to hear the fate of _ adonai _ i confess i should be surprise if that poem be bear to a immortality of oblivion ' -lrb- to ollier 11 January 1822 -rrb- ' i be also more than commonly interested in the success of _ adonai _ i do not mean the sale but the effect produce and i should have -lrb- be -rrb- glad to have receive some communication from you respect it i do not know even whether it have be publish and still less whether it have be republish with the alteration i send ' as to the alteration send nothing definite be know but some detail bear on this point will be find in we note p 105 & c -lrb- to gisborne 10 April -rrb- ' i know what to think of _ adonai _ but what to think of those who confound it with the many bad poem of the day i know not ' this expression seem to indicate that mr gisborne have send shelley some of the current criticism -- there be probably but few in all -- upon _ adonai _ : to this matter i shall recur further on -lrb- to gisborne 18 June -rrb- ` the _ adonai _ i wish to have have a fair chance both because it be a favorite with I and on account of the memory of keat -- who be a poet of great genius let the classic party say what it will ' earlier than the latest of these extract shelley have send to mr severn a copy of _ adonai _ along with a letter which i append ` pisa nov 29th 1821 ` dear sir ' i send you the elegy on poor keat and i wish it be better worth you acceptance you will see by the preface that it be write before i could obtain any particular account of he last moment all that i still know be communicate to I by a friend who have derive he information from colonel finch i have venture -lrb- in the preface -rrb- to express as i feel the respect and admiration which _ you _ conduct towards he demand ` in spite of he transcendent genius keat never be nor ever will be a popular poet and the total neglect and obscurity in which the astonishing remains of he mind still lie be hardly to be dissipate by a writer who however he may differ from keat in more important quality at least resemble he in that accidental one a want of popularity ' i have little hope therefore that the poem i send you will excite any attention nor do i feel assure that a critical notice of he writings would find a single reader but for these consideration it have be my intention to have collect the remnant of he composition and to have publish they with a life and criticism have he leave any poem or writings of whatsoever kind and in whose possession be they perhaps you would oblige I by information on this point ` many thanks for the picture you promise I -lrb- presumably a portrait of keat but shelley do not seem ever to have receive one from severn -rrb- : i shall consider it among the most sacred relic of the past for my part i little expect when i last see keat at my friend leigh hunt 's that i should survive he ` should you ever pass through pisa i hope to have the pleasure of see you and of cultivate a acquaintance into something pleasant begin under such melancholy auspices ` accept my dear sir the assurance of my highest esteem and believe I ` you most sincere and faithful servant ` percy b shelley ` do you know leigh hunt i expect he and he family here every day ' it may have be observe that shelley whenever he speak of critical depreciation of keat refer only to one periodical the _ quarterly review _ : probably he do not distinctly know of any other : but the fact be that _ blackwood 's magazine _ be worse than the _ quarterly _ the latter be sneering and supercilious : _ blackwood _ be vulgarly taunt and insulting and seem to have provoke keat the more of the two though perhaps he consider the attack in the _ quarterly _ to be more detrimental to he literary stand the _ quarterly _ notice be of so much import in the life and death of keat and in the genesis of _ adonai _ that i shall give it practically _ in extenso _ before close this section of my work : with _ blackwood _ i can deal at once a series of article _ on the cockney school of poetry _ begin in this magazine in October 1817 be direct mainly and very venomously against leigh hunt no 4 of the series appear in August 1818 fall foul of keat it be difficult to say whether the priority in abuse keat should of right be assign to _ blackwood _ or to the _ quarterly _ : the critique in the latter review belong to the number for April 1818 but this number be not actually issue until September the writer of the _ blackwood _ papers sign himself z z be affirm to have be lockhart the son-in-law of sir walter scott and afterwards editor of the _ quarterly review _ : more especially the article upon keat be attribute to lockhart a different account as to the series in general be that the author be john wilson -lrb- christopher north -rrb- revise by mr william blackwood but z resist more than one vigorous challenge to unmask and some doubt as to he identity may still remain here be some specimen of the amenity with which keat be treat in _ blackwood 's magazine _ : -- ` he friend we understand destine he to the career of medicine and he be bind apprentice some year ago to a worthy apothecary in town the frenzy of the _ poem _ -lrb- keat 's first volume 1817 -rrb- be bad enough in its way but it do not alarm we half so seriously as the calm settle imperturbable drivelling idiocy of _ endymion _ we hope however that in so young a person and with a constitution originally so good even now the disease be not utterly incurable mr hunt be a small poet but a clever man mr keat be a still smaller poet and he be only a boy of pretty ability which he have do everything in he power to spoil it be a better and wiser thing to be a starve apothecary than a starve poet : so back to the shop mr john back to plaster pill and ointment-box & c but for heaven 's sake young sangrado be a little more sparing of extenuative and soporific in you practice than you have be in you poetry ' even the death of keat in 1821 do not abate the rancor of _ blackwood 's magazine _ witness the follow extract -lrb- 1823 -rrb- ` keat have be dish -- utterly demolish and dish -- by _ blackwood _ long before mr gifford 's scribe mention he name but let we hear no more of johnny keat it be really too disgusting to have he and he poem recall in this manner after all the world think they have get rid of the concern ' -lrb- 1824 -rrb- ` mr shelley die it seem with a volume of mr keat 's poetry grasp with one hand in he bosom -- rather a awkward posture as you will be convince if you try it but what a rash man shelley be to put to sea in a frail boat with jack 's poetry on board down go the boat with a swirl i lay a wager that it right soon after eject jack ' -lrb- 1826 -rrb- ` keat be a cockney and cockney claim he for they own never be there a young man so encrust with conceit ' if this be the tone adopt by _ blackwood 's magazine _ in relation to keat live and dead one need not be surprise to find that the verdict of the same review upon the poem of _ adonai _ then newly publish run to the following effect : -- ` locke say the most resolute liar can not lie more than once in every three sentence folly be more engross for we could prove from the present elegy that it be possible to write two sentence of pure nonsense out of three a more faithful calculation would bring we to ninety-nine out of every hundred or -- as the present consist of only fifty-five stanza -- leave about five readable line in the entire a mr keat who have leave a decent call for the melancholy trade of cockney poetry have lately die of a consumption after have write two or three little book of verse much neglect by the public the new school however will have it that he be slaughter by a criticism of the _ quarterly review _ : o flesh how art thou fishify there be even a aggravation in this cruelty of the review -- for it have take three or four year to slay its victim the deadly blow have be inflict at least as long since -lrb- this be not correct : the _ quarterly _ critique have appear in September 1818 precede the death of keat by two year and five month -rrb- the fact be the _ quarterly _ finding before it a work at once silly and presumptuous full of the servile _ slang _ that cockaigne dictate to its servitor and the vulgar indecorum which that grub street empire rejoiceth to applaud tell the truth of the volume and recommend a change of manners -lrb- 14 -rrb- and of master to the scribbler keat write on but he write _ indecently _ probably in the indulgence of he social propensity ' the virulence with which shelley as author of _ adonai _ be assail by _ blackwood 's magazine _ be the more remarkable and the more symptomatic of partizanship against keat and any of he upholder as this review have in previous instance be exceptionally civil to shelley though of course with some serious offset the notice of _ alastor rosalind and helen _ and _ prometheus unbound _ -- more especially the first -- in the year 1819 and 1820 would be find to bear out this statement from the date already cite it may be assume that the pisan edition of _ adonai _ be in london in the hand of mr ollier towards the middle of August 1821 purchasable by whoever might be mind to buy it very soon afterwards it be reprint in the _ literary chronicle and weekly review _ publish by limbird in the strand -- 1 December 1821 : a rather singular not to say piratical proceed a editorial note be word thus : ` through the kindness of a friend we have be favor with the latest production of a gentleman of no ordinary genius mr bysshe shelley it be a elegy on the death of a youthful poet of considerable promise mr keat and be print at pisa as the copy now before we be perhaps -lrb- surely not -rrb- the only one that have reach england and the subject be one that will excite much interest we shall print the whole of it ' this promise be not literally fulfil for stanza 19 to 24 be omit not apparently with any special object after the publication in london of the pisan edition of _ adonai _ the poem remain unreprinted until 1829 it be then issue at cambridge at the instance of lord houghton -lrb- mr richard monckton milne -rrb- and mr arthur hallam the latter have bring from italy a copy of the original pamphlet the cambridge edition a octavo in paper wrapper be now still scarcer than the pisan one the only other separate edition of _ adonai _ be that of mr buxton forman 1876 corresponding substantially with the form which the poem assume in the _ complete work of shelley _ as produce by the same editor it need hardly be say that _ adonai _ be include in mr shelley 's edition of she husband 's poem and in all other edition of any fulness : it have also appear in most of the volume of selection as early as 1830 there be a italian translation of this elegy it be name _ adone nellum morte di giovanni keats elegia di percy bishe shelley tradotta da l a damaso pareto _ _ genova dalla tifografia pellas _ 1830 in this small quarto thirty page be occupy by a notice of the life and poetry of shelley i shall not here enter upon a consideration of the cancel passage of _ adonai _ : they will appear more appositely further on -lrb- see pp 92-94 & c -rrb- i therefore conclude the present section by quote the _ quarterly review _ article upon _ endymion _ -- omit only a few sentence which do not refer directly to keat but mostly to leigh hunt : -- ` reviewer have be sometimes accuse of not read the work which they affect to criticise on the present occasion we shall anticipate the author 's complaint and honestly confess that we have not read he work not that we have be want in we duty far from it indeed we have make effort almost as superhuman as the story itself appear to be to get through it : but with the fullest stretch of we perseverance we be force to confess that we have not be able to struggle beyond the first of the four book of which this poetic romance consist we should extremely lament this want of energy or whatever it may be on we part be it not for one consolation -- namely that we be no better acquaint with the meaning of the book through which we have so painfully toil than we be with that of the three which we have not look into ` it be not that mr keat -lrb- if that be he real name for we almost doubt that any man in he sens would put he real name to such a rhapsody -rrb- -- it be not we say that the author have not power of language ray of fancy and gleam of genius he have all these : but he be unhappily a disciple of the new school of what have be somewhere call cockney poetry which may be define to consist of the most incongruous idea in the most uncouth language ` of this school mr leigh hunt as we observe in a former number aspire to be the hierophant this author be a copyist of mr hunt but he be more unintelligible almost as rugged twice as diffuse and ten time more tiresome and absurd than he prototype who though he impudently presume to seat himself in the chair of criticism and to measure he own poetry by he own standard yet generally have a meaning but mr keat have advance no dogma which he be bind to support by example he nonsense therefore be quite gratuitous he write it for its own sake and be bite by mr leigh hunt 's insane criticism more than rival the insanity of he poetry ` mr keat 's preface hint that he poem be produce under peculiar circumstance know within myself he say the manner in which this poem have be produce it be not without a feeling of regret that i make it public what manner i mean will be quite clear to the reader who must soon perceive great inexperience immaturity and every error denote a feverish attempt rather than a deed accomplish we humbly beg he pardon but this do not appear to we to be quite so clear we really do not know what he mean but the next passage be more intelligible the two first book and indeed the two last i feel sensible be not of such completion as to warrant they pass the press thus the two first book be even in he own judgment unfit to appear and the two last be it seem in the same condition and as two and two make four and as that be the whole number of book we have a clear and we believe a very just estimate of the entire work ` mr keat however deprecate criticism on this immature and feverish work in term which be themselves sufficiently feverish and we confess that we should have abstain from inflict upon he any of the torture of the fierce hell of criticism -lrb- 15 -rrb- which terrify he imagination if he have not beg to be spare in order that he might write more if we have not observe in he a certain degree of talent which deserve to be put in the right way or which at least ought to be warn of the wrong and if finally he have not tell we that he be of a age and temper which imperiously require mental discipline ` of the story we have be able to make out but little it seem to be mythological and probably relate to the love of diana and endymion but of this as the scope of the work have altogether escape we we can not speak with any degree of certainty and must therefore content ourselves with give some instance of its diction and versification and here again we be perplexed and puzzle at first it appear to we that mr keat have be amusing himself and weary he reader with a immeasurable game at _ bout rims _ but if we recollect rightly it be a indispensable condition at this play that the rhyme when fill up shall have a meaning and we author as we have already hint have no meaning he seem to we to write a line at random and then he follow not the think excite by this line but that suggest by the _ rhyme _ with which it conclude there be hardly a complete couplet enclose a complete idea in the whole book he wander from one subject to another from the association not of idea but of sound and the work be compose of hemistich which it be quite evident have force themselves upon the author by the mere force of the catchword on which they turn ` we shall select not as the most striking instance but as that least liable to suspicion a passage from the opening of the poem -- such the sun the moon tree old and young sprout a shady boon for simple sheep and such be daffodil with the green world they live in and clear rill that for themselves a cooling covert make ` gainst the hot season the mid-forest brake rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose bloom and such too be the grandeur of the doom we have imagine for the mighty dead & c here it be clear that the word and not the idea _ moon _ produce the simple sheep and they shady _ boon _ and that the _ doom _ of the mighty dead would never have intrude themselves but for the fair musk-rose _ bloom _ ` again : -- for 'twa the morn apollo 's upward fire make every eastern cloud a silvery pyre of brightness so unsullied that therein a melancholy spirit well might win oblivion and melt out he essence fine into the wind rain-scented eglantine give temperate sweet to that well-wooing sun the lark be lose in he cold spring have run to warm they chilliest bubble in the grass man 's voice be on the mountain and the mass of nature 's life and wonder pulsed tenfold to feel this sunrise and its glory old here apollo 's _ fire _ produce a _ pyre _ -- a silvery pyre -- of cloud _ wherein _ a spirit might _ win _ oblivion and melt he essence _ fine _ and scented _ eglantine _ give sweet to the _ sun _ and cold spring have _ run _ into the _ grass _ and then the pulse of the _ mass _ pulsed _ tenfold _ to feel the glory _ old _ of the new-born day & c ` one example more : -- be still the unimaginable lodge for solitary thinking such as dodge conception to the very bourne of heaven then leave the naked brain be still the leaven that spreading in this dull and clodded earth give it a touch ethereal -- a new birth _ lodge dodge -- heaven leaven -- earth birth _ -- such in six word be the sum and substance of six line ` we come now to the author 's taste in versification he can not indeed write a sentence but perhaps he may be able to spin a line let we see the follow be specimen of he prosodial notion of we english heroic metre : -- dear as the temple 's self so do the moon the passion poesy glory infinite so plenteously all weed-hidden root of some strange history potent to send before the deep intoxication she scarf into a flutter pavilion the stubborn canvas for my voyage prepared endymion the cave be secreter than the isle of delo echo hence shall stir no sigh but sigh-warm kiss or light noise of thy comb hand the while it travel cloy and tremble through my labyrinthine hair ` by this time we reader must be pretty well satisfied as to the meaning of he sentence and the structure of he line we now present they with some of the new word with which in imitation of mr leigh hunt he adorn we language ` we be tell that turtle _ passion _ they voice that a arbor be _ nested _ and a lady 's lock _ gordian _ up and to supply the place of the noun thus verbalize mr keat with great fecundity spawn new one such as men-slug and human _ serpentry _ the _ honey-feel _ of bliss wife prepare _ needments _ and so forth ` then he have form new verb by the process of cut off they natural tail the adverb and affix they to they forehead thus the wine out-sparkled the multitude up-followed and night up-took : the wind up-blow and the hour be down-sunken but if he sink some adverb in the verb he compensate the language with adverb and adjective which he separate from the parent stock thus a lady whisper _ pantingly _ and close make _ hush _ sign and steer she skiff into a _ ripply _ cove a shower fall _ refreshfully _ and a vulture have a _ spread _ tail ` but enough of mr leigh hunt and he simple neophyte if any one should be bold enough to purchase this poetic romance and so much more patient than ourselves as to get beyond the first book and so much more fortunate as to find a meaning we entreat he to make we acquaint with he success we shall then return to the task which we now abandon in despair and endeavor to make all due amends to mr keat and to we reader ' this criticism be not i think exactly what shelley call it in the preface to _ adonais _ -- ` savage : ' it be less savage than contemptuous and be far indeed from compete with the abuse which be from time to time and in various review pour forth upon shelley himself it can not be deny that some of the blemish which it point out in _ endymion _ be real blemish and very serious one the grounds on which one can fairly object to the criticism be that its tone be purposely ill-natured its recognition of merit scanty out of all proportion to its censure of defect and its spirit that of prepense disparagement found not so much on the poetical error of keat as on the fact that he be a friend of leigh hunt the literary and also the political antagonist of the _ quarterly review _ the editor mr gifford seem always to have be regard as the author of this criticism -- i presume correctly so that keat be a friend of leigh hunt in the earlier period of he own poetical career be a fact but not long after the appearance of the _ quarterly review _ article he conceive a good deal of dislike and even animosity against this literary ally possibly the taunt of the _ quarterly review _ and the alienation of keat from hunt have some connexion as cause and effect in a letter from john keat to he brother george and he sister-in-law occur the following passage -lrb- 16 -rrb- dated towards the end of 1818 : ` hunt have ask I to meet tom moore some day -- so you shall hear of he the night we go to novello 's there be a complete set-to of mozart and punning i be so completely tire of it that if i be to follow my own inclination i should never meet any one of that set again not even hunt who be certainly a pleasant fellow in the main when you be with he -- but in reality he be vain egotistical and disgusting in matter of taste and in moral he understand many a beautiful thing but then instead of give other mind credit for the same degree of perception as he himself profess he begin a explanation in such a curious manner that we taste and self-love be offend continually hunt do one harm by make fine thing petty and beautiful thing hateful through he i be indifferent to mozart i care not for white bust and many a glorious thing when associate with he become a nothing this distort one 's mind -- make one 's thought bizarre -- perplex one in the standard of beauty ' for the text of _ adonai _ in the present edition i naturally have recourse to the original pisan edition but without neglect such alteration as have be properly introduce into later issue these will be fully indicate and account for in my note in the minor matter of punctuation & c i do not consider myself bind to reproduce the first or any other edition but i follow the plan which appear to myself most reasonable and correct any point worthy of discussion in these detail will also receive attention in the note adonai : its argument the poem of _ adonai _ can of course be contemplate from different point of view its biographical relation have be already consider in we precede section : its poetical structure and value its ideal or spiritual significance and its particular imagery and diction will occupy we much as we proceed at present i mean simply to deal with the argument of _ adonai _ it have a thread -- certainly a slender thread -- of narrative or fable the personation of the poetic figure adonai as distinct from the actual man john keat and the incident with which that poetic figure be associate the numeral which i put in parenthesis indicate the stanza in which the detail occur -lrb- 1 -rrb- adonai be now dead : the hour which witness he loss mourn he and be to rouse the other hour to mourn -lrb- 2 -rrb- he be the son of the widow uranium -lrb- 6 -rrb- she youngest and dearest son -lrb- 2 -rrb- he be slay by a nightly arrow -- ` pierce by the shaft which fly in darkness ' at the time of he death uranium be in she paradise -lrb- pleasure-garden -rrb- slumber while echo listen to the poem which he have write as death be impending -lrb- 3 -rrb- uranium should now wake and weep yet wherefore ` he be go where all thing wise and fair descend ' -lrb- 4 -rrb- nevertheless let she weep and lament -lrb- 7 -rrb- adonai have come to rome -lrb- 8 -rrb- death and corruption be now in he chamber but corruption delay as yet to strike -lrb- 9 -rrb- the dream whom he nurture as a herdsman tend he flock mourn around he -lrb- 10 -rrb- one of they be deceive for a moment into suppose that a tear shed by itself come from the eye of adonai and must indicate that he be still alive -lrb- 11 -rrb- another wash he limb and a third clip and shed she lock upon he corpse & c -lrb- 13 -rrb- then come other -- desire adoration fantasy & c -lrb- 14 to 16 -rrb- morning lament and echo and spring -lrb- 17 -rrb- aibion wail may ` the curse of cain light on he head who pierce thy innocent breast ' and scared away its angel soul -lrb- 20 -rrb- can it be that the soul alone die when nothing else be annihilate -lrb- 22 -rrb- misery arouse uranium : urge by dream and echo she spring up and -lrb- 23 -rrb- seek the death-chamber of adonai -lrb- 24 -rrb- endure much suffering from ` barbd tongue and thought more sharp than they ' -lrb- 25 -rrb- as she arrive death be shame for a moment and adonai breathe again : but immediately afterwards ` death rise and smile and meet she vain caress ' -lrb- 26 -rrb- uranium would fain have die along with adonai but chained as she be to time this be deny she -lrb- 27 -rrb- she reproach adonai for have though defenceless dare the dragon in he den have he wait till the day of he maturity ` the monster of life 's waste ' would have flee from he as -lrb- 28 -rrb- the wolf raven and vulture have flee from and fawn upon ` the pythian of the age ' -lrb- 30 -rrb- then come the mountain shepherd bewail adonai : the pilgrim of eternity the lyrist of lerne and -lrb- 31 -rrb- among other one frail form a pard-like spirit -lrb- 34 -rrb- uranium ask the name of this last shepherd : he then make bare he branded and ensanguined brow which be like cain 's or christ 's -lrb- 35 -rrb- another mountain shepherd ` the gentlest of the wise ' lean over the deathb -lrb- 36 -rrb- adonai have drunk poison some ` deaf and viperous murderer ' give he the envenomed draught -lrb- i must here point out a singular discrepancy in the poem of _ adonai _ consider as a narrative or apologue hitherto we have be tell that adonai be kill by a arrow or dart -- he be ` pierce by the shaft which fly in darkness ' and the man who ` pierce he innocent breast ' have incur the curse of cain : he have ' a wound ' -lrb- stanza 22 -rrb- there be also the alternative statement that adonai unequipped with the shield of wisdom or the spear of scorn have be so rash as to ` dare the unpastured dragon in he den ' and from this the natural inference be that not any ` shaft which fly in darkness ' but the dragon himself have slaughter the too-venturous youth but now we hear that he be do to death by poison certainly when we look beneath the symbol into the thing symbolize we can see that these divergent allegation represent the same fact and the reader of the elegy be not call upon to form themselves into a coroner 's jury to determine whether a ` shaft ' or a ` dragon ' or ` poison ' be the instrument of murder : nevertheless the statement in the text be neither identical nor reconcileable for purpose of mythical narration and it seem strange that the author should not have take this into account it will be find as we proceed -lrb- see p 66 -rrb- that the reference to ` poison ' come into the poem as a direct reproduction from the elegy of moschus upon bion -- be the passage which form the second of the two motto to _ adonais _ -rrb- -lrb- 36 -rrb- this murderer a ` nameless worm ' be alone callous to the prelude of the forthcoming song -lrb- 37 -rrb- let he live on in remorse and self-contempt -lrb- 38 -rrb- neither should we weep that adonai have ` flee far from these carrion-kite that scream below ' he spirit flow back to its fountain a portion of the eternal -lrb- 39 -rrb- indeed he be not dead nor sleep but ` have awaken from the dream of life ' not he decay but we -lrb- 41 -rrb- let not we nor the power of nature mourn for _ adonai _ -lrb- 42 -rrb- he be make one with nature -lrb- 45 -rrb- in ` the unapparent ' he be welcome by chatterton sidney lucan and -lrb- 46 -rrb- many more immortal and be hail as the master of a ` kingless sphere ' in a ` heaven of song ' -lrb- 48 -rrb- let any rash mourner go to rome and -lrb- 49 -rrb- visit the cemetery -lrb- 53 -rrb- and thou my heart why linger and shrink adonais call thee : be no longer divide from he -lrb- 55 -rrb- the soul of adonais beacon to thee ` from the abode where the eternal be ' this may he the most convenient place for raise a question of lead importance to the argument of _ adonai _ -- who be the personage designate under the name uranium -- a question which so far as i know have never yet be moot among the student of shelley who be uranium why be she represent as the mother of adonai -lrb- keat -rrb- and the chief mourner for he untimely death in mythology the name uranium be assign to two divinity wholly distinct the first be one of the nine muse the muse of astronomy : the second be aphrodite -lrb- venus -rrb- we may without any hesitation assume that shelley mean one of these two : but a decision as to which of the two become on reflection by no means so obvious as one might at first suppose we will first examine the question as to the muse uranium to say that the poet keat figure as adonai be son to one of the muse appear so natural and straightforward a symbolic suggestion as to command summary assent but why out of the nine sister should the muse of astronomy be select keat never write about astronomy and have no qualification and no faintest inclination for write about it : this science and every other exact or speculative science be highly alien from he disposition and turn of mind and yet on cast about for a reason we can find that after all and in a certain sense there be one forthcoming of some considerable amount of relevancy in the eye of shelley keat be principally and above all the poet of _ hyperion _ and _ hyperion _ be strictly speak a poem about the sun in like manner _ endymion _ be a poem about the moon thus from one point of view -- i can not see any other -- keat might be regard as inspire by or a son of the muse of astronomy a subordinate point of some difficulty arise from stanza 6 where adonai be speak of as ` the nursling of thy -lrb- uranium 's -rrb- widowhood ' -- which seem to mean son of uranium bear after the father 's death uranium be credit in mythology with the motherhood of two son -- linus she offspring by amphimacus who be a son of poseidon and hymenaeus she offspring by apollo it might be idle to puzzle over this question of uranium 's ` widowhood ' or to attempt to find upon it -lrb- on the assumption that uranium the muse be refer to -rrb- any theory as to who she deceased consort could have be : for it be as likely as not that the phrase which i have cite from the poem be not really intend to define with any sort of precision the parentage of the supposititious adonai but practically ignore adonais apply to keat himself and mean simply that keat as the son of the muse be bear out of time -- bear in a unpoetical and unappreciative age many of my reader will recollect that milton in the elaborate address which open book 7 of _ paradise lose _ invoke uranium he be careful however to say that he do not mean the muse uranium but the spirit of ` celestial song ' sister of eternal wisdom both of they well-pleasing to the ` almighty father ' thus far for uranium the muse i now come to aphrodite uranium this deity be to be carefully distinguish from the cyprian or pandemic aphrodite : she be different not only in attribute and function but even in personality and origin she be the daughter of heaven -lrb- uranus -rrb- and light she influence be heavenly : she be heavenly or spiritual love as distinct from earthly or carnal love if the personage in shelley 's elegy be to be regard not as the muse uranium but as aphrodite uranium she here represent spiritual or intellectual aspiration the love of abstract beauty the divine element in poesy or art as such aphrodite uranium would be no less appropriate than uranium or any other muse to be designate as the mother of adonai -lrb- keat -rrb- but the more cogent argument in favor of aphrodite uranium be to be base upon grounds of analogy or transfer rather than upon any reason of antecedent probability the part assign to uranium in shelley 's elegy be very closely model upon the part assign to aphrodite in the elegy of bion upon adoni -lrb- see the section in this volume _ bion and moschus _ -rrb- what aphrodite cypri do in the _ adoni _ that uranium do in the _ adonai _ the resemblance be exceedingly close in substance and in detail : the divergence be only such as the altered condition naturally dictate the cyprian aphrodite be the bride of adoni and as such she bewail he : the uranian aphrodite be the mother of adonai and she lament he accordingly carnal relationship and carnal love be transpose into spiritual relationship and spiritual love the hand be the hand in both poem of aphrodite : the voice be respectively those of cypri and of uranium it be also worth observe that the fragmentary poem of shelley name _ prince athanase _ write in 1817 be at first name _ pandemo and uranium _ and be intend as mr shelley inform we to embody the contrast between ` the earthly and unworthy venus ' and the nobler ideal of love the heaven-born or heaven-sent venus the poem would thus have bear a certain relation to _ alastor _ and also to _ epipsychidion _ the use of the name ` uranium ' in this propose title may help to confirm we in the belief that there be no reason why shelley should not have use the same name in _ adonai _ with the imply meaning of aphrodite uranium on the whole i be strongly of opinion that the uranium of _ adonai _ be aphrodite and not the muse adonai : general exposition the consideration which in the precede section we have bestow upon the ` argument ' of _ adonai _ will assist we not a little in grasp the full scope of the poem it may be broadly divide into three current of thought or -lrb- as one might say -rrb- into three act of passion i the sense of grievous loss in the death of john keat the youthful and aspiring poet cut short as he be approach he prime and the instinctive impulse to mourning and desolation 2 the mythical or symbolic embodiment of the event in the lament of uranium and the mountain shepherd and in the denunciation of the ruthless destroyer of the peace and life of adonai 3 the rejection of mourning as one-sided ignorant and a reversal of the true estimate of the fact and a recognition of the eternal destiny of keat in the world of mind couple with the yearning of shelley to have do with the vain show of thing in this cycle of mortality and to be at one with keat in the mansion of the everlasting such be the evolution of this elegy from mourn to rapture : from a purblind consideration of deathly phenomenon to the illumination of the individual spirit which contemplate the eternity of spirit as the universal substance shelley raise in he poem a very marked contrast between the death of adonai -lrb- keat -rrb- as a mortal man succumb to ` the common fate ' and the immortality of he spirit as a vital immaterial essence survive the death of the body : he use term such as might be adopt by any believer in the doctrine of ` the immortality of the soul ' in the ordinary sense of that phrase it would not however be safe to infer that shelley at the precise time when he write _ adonais _ be really in a more definite frame of mind on this theme than at other period of he life or of a radically different conviction as a fact he feeling on the great problem of immortality be acute he opinion regard they vague and unsettled he certainly be not a adherent of the typical belief on this subject the belief that a man on this earth be a combination of body and soul in a state -- he sole state -- of ` probation ' that when the body die and decay the soul continue to be the same absolute individual identity and that it pass into a condition of eternal and irreversible happiness or misery accord to the faith entertain or the deed do in the body he belief amount more nearly to this : that a human soul be a portion of the universal soul subject during its connexion with the body to all the illusion the dream and nightmare of sense and that after the death of the body it continue to be a portion of the universal soul liberate from those illusion and subsist in some condition which the human reason be not capable of define as a state either of personal consciousness or of absorption and so far as the human be exercise during the earthly life the authentic function of soul that same exercise of function continue to be the permanent record of the soul in the world of mind if any reader think that this seem a vague form of belief the answer be that the belief of shelley be indeed a vague one in the poem of _ adonai _ it remain to my apprehension as vague as in he other writings : but it assume a shape of greater definition because the poem be by its scheme and intent a personate poem in which the soul of keat have to be greet by the soul of chatterton just as the body of adonai have to be caress and bewail by uranium use language of a semi-emblematic kind we might perhaps express something of shelley 's belief thus : -- mankind be the microcosm as distinguish from the rest of the universe which form the macrocosm and as long as a man 's body and soul remain in combination he soul pertain to the microcosm : when this combination cease with the death of the body he soul in whatever sense it may be hold to exist lapse into the macrocosm but there be neither knowledge as to the mode of its existence nor speech capable of record this as illustrate we poet 's conception on these mysterious subject i append extract from three of he prose writings the first extract come from he fragment _ on life _ which may have be write -lrb- but this be quite uncertain -rrb- towards 1815 the second from he fragment _ on a future state _ for which some similar date be suggest the third from the note to he drama of _ hella _ write in 1821 later than _ adonai _ -lrb- 1 -rrb- ` the most refined abstraction of logic conduct to a view of life which though startling to the apprehension be in fact that which the habitual sense of its repeat combination have extinguish in we it strip as it be the paint curtain from this scene of thing i confess that i be one of those who be unable to refuse my assent -lrb- 17 -rrb- to the conclusion of those philosopher who assert that nothing exist but as it be perceive it be a decision against which all we persuasion struggle -- and we must be long convict before we can be convince that the solid universe of external thing be such stuff as dream be make of the shocking absurdity of the popular philosophy of mind and matter its fatal consequence in moral and they -lrb- the -rrb- violent dogmatism concern the source of all thing have early conduct I to materialism this materialism be a seduce system to young and superficial mind : it allow its disciple to talk and dispense they from think but i be discontent with such a view of thing as it afford man be a being of high aspiration look both before and after whose thought wander through eternity disclaim alliance with transcience and decay incapable of imagine to himself annihilation exist but in the future and the past be not what he be but what he have be and shall be whatever may be he true and final destination there be a spirit within he at enmity with nothingness and dissolution this be the character of all life and be each be at once the center and the circumference the point to which all thing be refer and the line in which all thing be contain such contemplation as these materialism and the popular philosophy of mind and matter alike forbid : they be only consistent with the intellectual system the view of life present by the most refined deduction of the intellectual philosophy be that of unity nothing exist but as it be perceive the difference be merely nominal between those two class of thought which be vulgarly distinguish by the name of idea and of external object pursue the same thread of reasoning the existence of distinct individual mind similar to that which be employ in now question its own nature be likewise find to be a delusion the word i you they be not sign of any actual difference subsist between the assemblage of thought thus indicate but be merely mark employ to denote the different modification of the one mind let it not be suppose that this doctrine conduct to the monstrous presumption that i the person who now write and think be that one mind i be but a portion of it ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- ` suppose however that the intellectual and vital principle differ in the most marked and essential manner from all other known substance that they have all some resemblance between themselves which _ it _ in no degree participate in what manner can this concession be make a argument for its imperishability all that we see or know perish -lrb- 18 -rrb- and be change life and think differ indeed from everything else : but that it survive that period beyond which we have no experience of its existence such distinction and dissimilarity afford no shadow of proof and nothing but we own desire could have lead we to conjecture or imagine have we exist before birth it be difficult to conceive the possibility of this if we have _ not _ exist before birth if at the period when the part of we nature on which thought and life depend seem to be weave together they _ be _ weave together if there be no reason to suppose that we have exist before that period at which we existence apparently commence then there be no grounds for supposition that we shall continue to exist after we existence have apparently cease so far as thought and life be concern the same will take place with regard to we individually consider after death as have place before we birth it be say that it be possible that we should continue to exist in some mode totally inconceivable to we at present this be a most unreasonable presumption such assertion persuade indeed only those who desire to be persuade this desire to be for ever as we be -- the reluctance to a violent and unexperienced change which be common to all the animated and inanimate combination of the universe -- be indeed the secret persuasion which have give birth to the opinion of a future state ' -lrb- 3 note to the chorus ` world on world be roll ever ' & c -rrb- ` the first stanza contrast the immortality of the living and think being which inhabit the planet and -lrb- to use a common and inadequate phrase -rrb- clothe themselves in matter with the transcience of the noblest manifestation of the external world the conclude verse indicate a progressive state of more or less exalted existence accord to the degree of perfection which every distinct intelligence may have attain let it not be suppose that i mean to dogmatise upon a subject concern which all man be equally ignorant or that i think the gordian knot of the origin of evil can be disentangle by that or any similar assertion that there be a true solution of the riddle and that in we present state that solution be unattainable by we be proposition which may be regard as equally certain : meanwhile as it be the province of the poet to attach himself to those idea which exalt and ennoble humanity let he be permit to have conjecture the condition of that futurity towards which we be all impel by a inextinguishable thirst for immortality until better argument can be produce than sophism which disgrace the cause this desire itself must remain the strongest and the only presumption that eternity be the inheritance of every thinking be ' the reader will perceive that in these three passage the dominant idea very briefly state be as follow : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- mind be the aggregate of all individual mind -lrb- 2 -rrb- man have no reason for expect that he mind or soul will be immortal -lrb- 3 -rrb- no reason except such as inhere in the very desire which he feel for immortality these opinion deliberately express by shelley at different date as a theorist in prose should be take into account if we endeavor to estimate what he mean when as a poet he speak whether in _ hella _ or in _ adonai _ of a individual he mind and he immortality when shelley call upon we to regard keat -lrb- adonai -rrb- as mortal in body but immortal in soul or mind he real intent be probably limit to this : that keat have be liberate by the death of the body from the dominion and delusion of the sens and that he while in the flesh develop certain fruit of mind which survive he body and will continue to survive it indefinitely and will form a permanent inheritance of thought and of beauty to succeed generation keat himself in one of he most famous line express a like conception ' a thing of beauty be a joy for ever ' shelley be faithful to he canon of highest literary or poetical form in give a greek shape to he elegy on keat but it may be allow to he english reader or at any rate to some of they to think that he hereby fall into a certain degree of artificiality of structure undesirable in itself and more especially hamper he in a plain and self-consistent expression both of he real feeling concern keat and of he resentment against those who have cut short or be suppose to have cut short the career and the poetical work of he friend moreover shelley go beyond the mere recurrence to greek form of impersonation and expression : he take two particular greek author and two particular greek poem as he principal model these two poem be the elegy of bion on adoni and the elegy of moschus on bion to imitate be not to plagiarize and shelley can not reasonably be call a plagiarist because he introduce into _ adonai _ passage which be paraphrase or even translate from bion and moschus it do seem singular however that neither in the _ adonai _ volume nor in any of he numerous write remark upon the poem do shelley ever once refer to this state of the fact possibly in use the name ` adonais ' he intend to refer the reader indirectly to the ` adonis ' of bion and he prefix to the preface of he poem as a motto four verse from the elegy of moschus upon bion this may have be intend for a hint to the reader as to the grecian source of the poem the whole matter will receive detailed treatment in we next section as well as in the note the passage of _ adonai _ which can be trace back to bion and moschus be not the finest thing in the poem : mostly they fill out its fabular ` argument ' with brilliancy and suavity rather than with nerve and pathos the finest thing be to be find in the denunciation of the ` deaf and viperous murderer ' in the stanza concern the ` mountain shepherd ' especially the figure represent shelley himself and in the solemn and majestic conclusion where the poet rise from the region of earthly sorrow into the realm of ideal aspiration and contemplation shelley be generally -- and i think most justly -- regard as a peculiarly melodious versifier : but it must not be suppose that he be rigidly exact in he use of rhyme the contrary can be prove from the entire body of he poem _ adonais _ be in this respect neither more nor less correct than he other writings it would hardly be reasonable to attribute he laxity in rhyming to either carelessness indifference or unskilfulness : but rather to a deliberate preference for a certain variety in the rhyme-sound -- as tend to please the ear and avail to satisfy it in the total effect without cloy it by any tight-drawn uniformity such a preference can be justify on two grounds : firstly that the general effect of the slightly varied sound be really the more gratifying of the two method and i believe that practice within reasonable limit it be so and secondly that the requirement of sense be superior to those of sound and that in the effort after severely exact rhyming a writer would often be compel to sacrifice some delicacy of thought or some grace or propriety of diction look through the stanza of _ adonai _ i find the follow laxity of rhyming : compeer dare anew know -lrb- this repetition of a identical syllable as if it be a rhyme be very frequent with shelley who evidently consider it to be permissible and even right -- and in this view he have plenty of support -rrb- : god road last waste teach not break cheek -lrb- two instance -rrb- ground moan both youth rise arise song sting steel fall light delight part depart wert heart wrong tongue brow so moan one crown tone song unstrung knife grief mourn burn dawn moan bear bear blot think renown chatterton think not approve reprove forth earth nought not home tomb thither together weave of riven heaven these be 34 instance of irregularity the number of stanza in _ adonai _ be 55 : therefore there be more than one such irregularity for every two stanza it may not be absolutely futile if we bestow a little more attention upon the detail of these laxity of rhyme the repetition of a identical syllable have be cite 6 time in 4 instance the sound of _ teach _ be assimilate to that of _ not _ -lrb- i take here no account of difference of spelling but only of the sound -rrb- in 4 the sound of _ ground _ and of _ renown _ to that of _ moan _ or of _ chatterton _ in 2 the sound of _ o _ in _ road both _ and _ weave _ to that in _ god youth _ and _ of _ in 3 the sound of _ song _ to that of _ sting _ in 2 the sound of _ ee _ in _ compeer steel cheek _ and _ grief _ to that in _ dare fall break _ and _ knife _ in 2 the sound of _ e _ in _ wert _ and _ earth _ to that in _ heart _ and _ forth _ in 3 the sound of _ o _ in _ moan _ and _ home _ to that in _ one dawn _ and _ tomb _ in 2 the sound of _ thither _ to that of _ together _ the other case which i have cite have only a single instance apiece it result therefore that the vowel-sound subject to the most frequent variation be that of _ o _ whether single or in combination shelley may be consider to allow himself more than a average degree of latitude in rhyming : but it be a fact that if the general body of english poetry be scrutinize it will be find to be more or less lax in this matter this question be complicate by another question -- that of how word be pronounce at different period in we literary history : in order to exclude the most serious consequent difficulty i shall say nothing here about any poet prior to milton i take at haphazard four page of rhymed verse from each of the follow six poet and the result prove to be as follow : -- _ milton _ -- pass be feast rest come room still invisible vouchsafe safe moon whereon ordain land 7 instance _ dryden _ -- alone fruition guard hear pursued good : procure secure 4 instance _ pope _ -- give heaven steer character board lord fault think err singular 5 instance _ gray _ -- beech stretch bear thorn abode god break rock 4 instance _ coleridge _ -- not a single instance _ byron _ -- give heaven moore yore look duke song tongue knot not of enough bestow mood 7 instance in all these case as in that of shelley 's _ adonai _ i have take no count of those instance of lax sound-rhyme which be correct letter-rhyme -- such as the coupling of _ move _ with _ love _ or of _ star _ with _ war _ for these however much some more than commonly purist ear may demur to they appear to be part and parcel of the rhyming system of the english language i need hardly say that if these case have be include my list would in every instance have swell considerably nor yet that i be conscious how extremely partial and accidental be the test as to comparative number of laxity which i have here supply the spenserian metre in which _ adonai _ be write be use by shelley in only one other instance -- he long ideal epic _ the revolt of islam _ bion and moschus the relation of shelley 's elegy of _ adonai _ to the two elegy write by bion and by moschus must no doubt have be observe and be more or less remark upon as soon as _ adonai _ obtain some currency among classical reader captain medwin in he _ shelley papers _ 1832 refer to it i be not however aware that the resemblance have ever be bring out in detail until mr gsd murray of christ church oxford note down the passage from bion which be publish accordingly in my edition of shelley 's poem 1870 since then 1888 lieut-colonel hime ra issue a pamphlet -lrb- dulau & co -rrb- entitle _ the greek material of shelley 's adonai with remark on the three great english elegy _ enter into further yet not exhaustive particulars on the same subject shelley himself make a fragmentary translation from the elegy of bion on adoni : it be first print in mr forman 's edition of shelley 's poem 1877 i append here those passage which be directly relate to _ adonais _ : -- ' i mourn adonis dead -- loveliest adoni -- dead dead adoni -- and the love lament sleep no more venus wrap in purple woof -- wake violet-stoled queen and weave the crown of death -- ` tis misery call -- for he be dead aphrodite with hair unbound be wander through the wood wilder ungirt unsandalled -- the thorn pierce she hastening foot and drink she sacred blood \* \* \* \* \* the flower be wither up with grief \* \* \* \* \* echo resound adonis dead \* \* \* \* \* she clasp he and cry stay adoni stay dearest one and mix my lip with thine wake yet a while adoni -- oh but once -- that i may kiss thee now for the last time -- but for as long as one short kiss may live the reader familiar with _ adonai _ will recognize the passage in that poem of which we here have the original to avoid repetition i do not cite they at the moment but shall call attention to they successively in my note at the end of the volume for other passage also utilise by shelley i have recourse to the volume of mr andrew lang -lrb- macmillan & co 1889 -rrb- _ theocritus bion and moschus render into english prose _ and first from bion 's elegy on adoni : -- ` the flower flush red for anguish this kiss will i treasure even as thyself adoni since ah ill-fated thou art flee I while wretched i yet live be a goddess and may not follow thee persephone take thou my lover my lord for thyself art stronger than i and all lovely thing drift down to thee for why ah overbold didst thou follow the chase and be so fair why wert thou thus over-hardy to fight with beast a tear the paphian shed for each blood-drop of adoni and tear and blood on the earth be turn to flower ah even in

the love be weep and groan aloud clipping they lock for adoni and one upon he shaft another on he bow be tread and one have loose the sandal of adoni and another have break he own feathered quiver and

-lrb- the muse -rrb- not that he be doth to hear but that the maiden of hade doth not let he go ' the next-ensuing passage come from the elegy of moschus for bion : -- ` ye flower now in sad cluster breathe yourselve away now redden ye rose in you sorrow and now wax red ye wind-flower now thou hyacinth whisper the letter on thee graven and add a deeper be be to thy petal : he be dead the beautiful singer ye nightingale that lament among the thick leaf of the tree tell ye to the sicilian water of arethusa the tiding that bion the herdsman be dead thy sudden doom o bion apollo himself lament and the satyr mourn thee and the priapus in sable raiment and the pane sorrow for thy song and the fountain-fairy in the wood make moan and they tear turn to river of water and echo in the rock lament that thou art silent and no more she mimic thy voice and in sorrow for thy fall the tree cast down they fruit and all the flower have fade nor ever sing so sweet the nightingale on the cliff nor so much by the gray sea-wave do ever the sea-bird sing nor so much in the dell of dawn do the bird of memnon bewail the son of the morning flutter around he tomb as they lament for bion dead echo among the reed doth still feed upon thy song this o most musical of river be thy second sorrow -- this mele thy new woe of old didst thou lose homer : now again another son thou weepest and in a new

whether the poison shaft light on a heart make callous by many blow or one like keat 's compose of more penetrable stuff one of they associate be to my knowledge a most base and unprincipled 45

there be nothing to show positively why shelley adopt the name adonai as a suitable hellenic name for john keat i have already suggest -lrb- p 59 -rrb- that he may perhaps have wish to indicate in this indirect way that he poem be found partly upon the elegy of bion for adonis i believe the name adonai be not really in use among the greek and be not anywhere traceable in classical grecian literature it have sometimes be regard as a doricized form of the name adoni : mr william cory say that it be not this but would properly be a female form of the same name dr furnivall have suggest to I that adonai be ` shelley 's variant of adonia the woman 's yearly mourning for adoni ' disregard detail we may perhaps say that the whole subject of he elegy be treat by shelley as a transposition of the lament as conceive by bion of the cyprian aphrodite for adoni and that as he change the cyprian into the uranian aphrodite so he change the dead youth from adonis into adonai 1 4 _ motto from the poet plato _ this motto have be translate by shelley himself as follow : ` thou wert the morning star among the living ere thy fair light have flee : -- now have die thou art as hesperus give new splendor to the dead ' 1 8 _ motto from moschus _ translate on p 66 ` poison come bion ' & c 1 13 _ it be my intention to subjoin to the london edition of this poem a criticism _ & c as to the non-fulfilment of this intention see p 31 1 16 _ my known repugnance prove at least _ in the pisa edition the word be print ` prove ' -lrb- not ` prove ' -rrb- shelley be far from be a exact writer in matter of this sort 1 21 _ john keat die in he twenty-fourth year on the -lrb- 23rd -rrb- of -lrb- February -rrb- _ 1821 keat at the time of he death be not really in he twenty-fourth but in he twenty-sixth year : the date of he birth be 31 October 1795 in the pisa edition of _ adonai _ the date of death be give thus -- ` the -- of -- 1821 ' : for shelley when he write he preface have no precise knowledge of the fact in some later edition ` the 27th of December 1820 ' be erroneously substitute shelley 's mistake in suppose that keat in 1821 be age only twenty-three may be take into account in estimate he previous observation ' i consider the fragment of _ hyperion _ as second to nothing that be ever produce by a writer of the same year ' keat write in August 1820 have tell shelley -lrb- see p 17 -rrb- that some of he poem perhaps include _ hyperion _ have be write ` above two year ' precede that date if shelley suppose that keat be twenty-three year old at the beginning of 1821 and that _ hyperion _ have be write fully two year prior to August 1820 he must have account that poem to be the product of a youth of twenty or at most twenty-one which would indeed be a marvellous instance of precocity as a matter of fact _ hyperion _ be write by keat when in he twenty-fourth year this diminish the marvel but do not make shelley 's comment on the poem any the less correct 1 22 _ be bury in the romantic and lonely cemetery of the protestant in that city under the pyramid which be the tomb of cestius _ as to the burial of the ash of shelley himself in a separate portion of the same cemetery see p 23 shelley lie nearer than keat to the pyramid of c cestius 1 33 _ the savage criticism on he _ endymion _ which appear in the _ quarterly review as to this matter see the prefatory memoirs of shelley and of keat and especially at p 39 & c a transcript of the criticism 1 35 _ the agitation thus originate end in the rupture of a blood vessel in the lung _ see pp 27 and 37 the _ quarterly _ critique be publish in September 1818 and the first rupture of a blood-vessel occur in February 1820 whether the mortification feel by keat at the critique be small -lrb- as be now generally opine -rrb- or great -lrb- as shelley thought -rrb- it can not reasonably be propound that this cause or result in the rupture of the pulmonary blood-vessel keat belong to a consumptive family he mother die of consumption and also he younger brother : and the preliminary of he mortal illness -lrb- even if we do not date they farther back for which some reason appear -rrb- begin towards the middle of July 1818 when in very rough walking in the island of mull he catch a severe and persistent attack of sore throat 1 37 _ the succeed acknowledgment from more candid critic of the true greatness of he power _ the notice here principally refer to be probably that which appear in the _ edinburgh review _ in August 1820 write by lord jeffrey 1 42 _ whether the poison shaft light on a heart make callous by many blow _ shelley in this expression have no doubt himself in view he have have serious reason for complain of the treatment mete out to he by the _ quarterly review _ : see the opening -lrb- partially cite at p 17 -rrb- of he draft-letter to the editor 1 44 _ one of they associate be to my knowledge a most base and unprincipled calumniator _ shelley here refer to the writer of the critique in the _ quarterly review _ of he poem _ laon and cythna -lrb- the revolt of islam -rrb- _ at first he suppose the writer to be southey afterwards the rev mr -lrb- dean -rrb- milman he indignant phrase be therefore level at milman but shelley be mistake for the article be in fact write by mr -lrb- afterwards judge -rrb- coleridge 1 46 _ those who have celebrate with various degree of complacency and panegyric _ pari _ and _ woman _ and _ a syrian tale _ and mr lefanu and mr barrett and mr howard payne _ i presume that most reader of the present day be in the same position as i be myself -- that of know nothing about these performance and they author in order to understand shelley 's allusion i look up the _ quarterly review _ from April 1817 to April 1821 and have ascertain as follow -lrb- 1 -rrb- the _ quarterly _ of April 1817 contain a notice of _ pari in 1815 a poem _ the author 's name be not give nor do i know it the poem numbering about a thousand line be in the spenserian stanza vary by the heroic metre and perhaps by some other rhythm numerous extract be give sufficient to show that the poem be at any rate a creditable piece of write some of the critical dictum be the following : -- ` the work of a powerful and poetic imagination the subject of the poem be a desultory walk through pari in which the author observe with very little regularity but -- with great force on the different object which present themselves sketch with the hand of a master in a strain of poetry and pathos which we have seldom see equal a admirable mirable poet ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- _ woman _ be a poem by the mr barrett whom shelley name term on the title-page ` the author of _ the heroine _ ' it be notice in the _ quarterly _ for April 1818 the very same number which contain the sneering critique of _ endymion _ this poem be write in the heroic metre and the extract give do certainly comprise some tell and felicitous line such be -- ` the beautiful rebuke that look surprise the gentle vengeance of avert eye ' also -lrb- a line which have bear and may yet bear frequent re-quoting -rrb- ` last at he cross and earliest at he grave ' for critical utterance we have the ensue : -- ' a strain of patriotism pure ardent and even sublime versification combine conciseness and strength with a considerable degree of harmony both talent and genius some passage of it and those not a few be of the first order of the pathetic and descriptive ' -lrb- 3 -rrb- _ a syrian tale _ of this book i have fail to find any trace in the _ quarterly review _ or in the catalogue of the british museum -lrb- 4 -rrb- mr lefanu neither can i trace this lady in the _ quarterly _ mr alicia lefanu who be state to have be a sister of richard brinsley sheridan and also she daughter miss alicium lefanu publish book during the lifetime of shelley the former print _ the flower a fairy tale _ 1810 and _ the son of erin a comedy _ 1812 to the latter various work be assign such as _ rosard 's chain a poem _ -lrb- 5 -rrb- mr john howard payne be author of _ brutus or the fall of tarquin a historical tragedy _ criticize in the _ quarterly _ for April 1820 i can not understand why shelley should have suppose this criticism to be laudatory : it be in fact unmixed censure as thus : -- ` he appear to we to have no one quality which we should require in a tragic poet we can not find in the whole play a single character finely conceive or rightly sustain a single incident well manage a single speech -- nay a single sentence -- of good poetry ' it be true that the same article which review payne 's _ brutus _ notice also and with more indulgence sheil 's _ evadne _ : possibly shelley glance at the article very cursorily and fancy that any eulogistic phrase which he find in it apply to payne 1 51 _ a parallel between the rev mr milman and lord byron _ i have not succeed in find this parallel the _ quarterly _ _ review _ for July 1818 contain a critique of milman 's poem _ samor lord of the bright city _ and the number for may 1820 a critique of milman 's _ fall of jerusalem _ neither of these notice draw any parallel such as shelley speak of 1 52 _ what gnat do they strain at here _ the word ` here ' will be perceive to mean ` in _ endymion _ ' or ` in reference to _ endymion _ ' but it be rather far separate from its right antecedent 1 59 _ the circumstance of the closing scene of poor keat 's life be not make know to I until the elegy be ready for the press _ see p 22 1 63 _ the poor fellow seem to have be hoot from the stage of life no less by those on whom he have waste the promise of he genius than those on whom he have lavish he fortune and he care _ this statement of shelley be certainly found upon a passage in the letter -lrb- see p 22 -rrb- address by colonel finch to mr gisborne colonel finch say that keat have reach italy ` nurse a deeply rooted disgust to life and to the world owe to have be infamously treat by the very person whom he generosity have rescue from want and woe ' the colonel 's statement seem -lrb- as i have previously intimate -rrb- to be rather haphazard and shelley 's recast of it go to a further extreme 1 68 _ ` almost risk he own life ' _ & c the substance of the word in inverted comma be contain in colonel finch 's letter but shelley do not cite verbatim \* \* \* \* \* + stanza 1 + 1 1 _ i weep for adonai -- he be dead _ model on the opening of bion 's elegy for adoni see p 63 1 3 _ the frost which bind so dear a head _ : sc the frost of death 11 4 5 _ and thou sad hour rouse thy obscure compeer _ the compeer be clearly the other hour why they should be term ` obscure ' be not quite manifest perhaps shelley mean that the weal or woe attach to these hour be obscure or uncertain or perhaps that they be comparatively obscure undistinguished as not be mark by any such conspicuous event as the death of adonai 11 8 9 _ he fate and fame shall be a echo and a light unto eternity _ by ` eternity ' we may here understand not absolute eternity as contradistinguish from time but a indefinite space of time the year and the century he fate and fame shall be echo on from age to age and shall be a light thereto + stanza 2 + 1 1 _ where wert thou mighty mother _ aphrodite uranium see pp 51 52 shelley constantly use the form ` wert ' instead of ` wast ' this phrase may be model upon two line near the opening of milton 's _ lycida _ -- ` where be ye nymph when the remorseless deep closed o'er the head of you loved lycida ' 1 2 _ the shaft which fly in darkness _ as adoni be mortally wound by a boar 's tusk so -lrb- it be here represent -rrb- be adonais slay by a insidiously or murderously launch dart : see p 49 the allusion be to the truculent attack make upon keat by the _ quarterly review _ it be true that ` the shaft which fly in darkness ' might be understand in merely a general sense as the mysterious and unforeseen arrow of death : but i think it clear that shelley use the phrase in a more special sense 1 4 _ with veil eye _ & c uranium be represent as seat in she paradise -lrb- pleasure-ground garden-bower -rrb- with veil eye -- downward-lidded as in slumber : a echo chaunt or recite the ` melody ' or poem which adonai have compose while death be rapidly advance towards he : uranium be surround by other echo who hearken and repeat the strain a hostile reviewer might have be expect to indulge in one of the most familiar of cheap joke and to say that uranium have naturally fall asleep over keat 's poem : but i be not aware that any critic of _ adonai _ do actually say this the phrase ` one with soft enamoured breath ' mean ` one of the echo ' this be show in stanza 22 ` all the echo whom _ they sister 's song _ ' + stanza 3 + 11 6 7 _ for

-rrb- ` not that he be loth to hear but that the maiden of hade will not let he go ' + stanza 4 + 1 1 _ most musical of mourner _ this phrase apply to uranium be one of those which might seem to favor the assumption that the deity here speak of be the muse uranium and not aphrodite uranium but on this point see pp 50 to 52 1 1 _ weep again _ the poem seem to indicate that uranium slumbering be not yet aware of the death of adonai therefore she can not as yet have weep for he death : but she may have weep in anticipation that he would shortly die and thus can be now adjure to ` weep _ again _ ' -lrb- see also p 143 -rrb- 1 2 _ he die _ milton 1 4 _ when he country 's pride _ & c construe : when the priest the slave and the liberticide trample he country 's pride and mock -lrb- it -rrb- with many a loathd rite of lust and blood this of course refer to the condition of public affair and of court-life in the reign of charle ii the inversion in this passage be not a very serious one although for the sense slightly embarrassing occasionally shelley concede to himself great latitude in inversion : as for instance in the _ revolt of islam _ canto 3 st 34 ` and the swift boat the little wave which bear be cut by its keen keel though slantingly ' which mean ` and the little wave which bear the swift boat be cut ' & c also in the _ ode to naple _ strophe 4 ` florence beneath the sun of city fairest one blush within she bower for freedom 's expectation ' 1 8 _ he clear sprite _ to substitute the word ` sprite ' for ` spirit ' in a elevated passage refer to milton appear to I one of the least tolerable instance of make-rhyme in the whole range of english poetry ` sprite ' be a trivial and distorted misformation of ` spirit ' and can only i apprehend be use with some propriety -lrb- at any rate in modern poetry -rrb- in a more or less banter sense the tricksy elf puck may be a sprite or even the fantastic creation ariel but neither milton 's satan nor milton 's ithuriel nor surely milton himself could possibly be a sprite while the limit of language and of common sense be observe 1 9 _ the third among the son of light _ at first sight this phrase might seem to mean ` the third-greatest poet of the world ' : in which case one might suppose homer and shakespear to be rank as the first and second but it may be regard as tolerably clear that shelley be here think only of _ epic _ poet and that he range the epic poet accord to a criterion of he own which be thus express in he _ defense of poetry _ -lrb- write in the same year as _ adonai _ 1821 -rrb- : ` homer be the first and dante the second epic poet that be the second poet the series of whose creation bear a define and intelligible relation to the knowledge and sentiment and religion of the age in which he live and of the age which follow it -- develop itself in correspondence with they developmentmilton be the third epic poet ' the poet whom shelley admire most be probably homer aeschylus sophocle lucretius dante shakespear and milton he take high delight in the _ book of job _ and presumably in some other poetical book of the old testament calderon also he prize greatly and in he own time goethe byron and -lrb- on some grounds -rrb- wordsworth and coleridge + stanza 5 + 1 2 _ not all to that bright station dare to climb _ the conception embody in the diction of this stanza be not quite so clear as might be wish the first statement seem to amount to this -- that some poet true poet though they be do not aspire so high nor be capable of reach so high as homer dante and milton the typical epic poet a statement so obviously true that it hardly extend in itself beyond a truism but it must be read as introductory to what follow 1 3 _ and happier they they happiness who know _ clearly a recast of the phrase of vergil ' o fortunatus nimium sua si bona nrint agricolae ' but vergil speak of man who do not adequately appreciate they own happiness shelley -lrb- apparently -rrb- of other who do so he seem to intimate that the poetical temperament be a happy one in the case of those poet who unconcerned with the greatest idea and the most arduous scheme of work pour forth they ` native wood-note wild ' i think it possible however that shelley intend he phrase to be accept with the same meaning as vergil 's -- ` happier they suppose they have know they happiness ' in that case the only reason imply why these minor poet be the happier be that they work have endure the longer 11 4 5 _ whose taper yet burn through that night of time in which sun perish _ shelley here appear to say that the minor poet have leave work which survive while some of the work of the very greatest poet have disappear : as for instance he own lyrical model in _ adonai _ bion and moschus be still know by they writings while many of the master-piece of aeschylus and sophocle be lose some _ taper _ continue to burn while some _ sun _ have perish 11 5-7 _ other more sublime strike by the envious wrath of man or god have sink extinct in they refulgent prime _ these other include keat -lrb- adonai -rrb- himself to whom the phrase ` strike by the envious wrath of man ' may be understand as more peculiarly appropriate and generally the ` other ' may be regard as nearly identical with ` the inheritor of unfulfilled renown ' who appear -lrb- some of they point out by name -rrb- in stanza 45 the word god be print in the pisan edition with a capital letter : it may be question whether shelley mean to indicate anything more definite than ` some higher power -- fate ' 11 8 9 _ and some yet live tread the thorny road which lead through toil and hate to fame 's serene abode _ byron must be suppose to be the foremost among these also wordsworth and coleridge and doubtless shelley himself should not he omit + stanza 6 + 1 2 _ the nursling of thy widowhood _ as to this expression see p 51 i be there speak only of the muse uranium but the observation be equally applicable to aphrodite uranium and i be unable to carry the argument any further 11 3 4 _ like a pale flower by some sad maiden cherish and feed with true love tear instead of dew _ it seem sufficiently clear that shelley be here glance at a lead incident in keat 's poem of _ isabellum or the pot of basil _ found upon a story in boccaccio 's _ decameron _ isabellum unbury she murder lover lorenzo preserve he head in a pot of basil and -lrb- as express in st 52 of the poem -rrb- ` hang over she sweet basil evermore and moisten it with tear unto the core ' i give shelley 's word ` true love tear ' as they appear in the pisan edition : ` true-love tear ' might be preferable 1 9 _ the broken lily lie -- the storm be overpast _ as much as to say : the storm come and shatter the lily the storm have now pass away but the lily will never revive + stanza 7 + 1 i _ to that high capital where kingly death _ & c the capital be rome -lrb- where keat die -rrb- death be figure as the king of rome who there ` keep he pale court in beauty and decay ' -- amid the beauty of nature and art and amid the decay of monument and institution 11 3 4 _ and buy with price of purest breath a grave among the eternal _ keat die in rome secure sepulture among the many illustrious person who be there bury this seem to be the only meaning of ` the eternal ' in the present passage : the term do not directly imply -lrb- what be sufficiently enforced elsewhere -rrb- keat 's own poetic immortality 1 4 _ come away _ this call be address in fancy to any person present in the chamber of death they remain indefinite both to the poet and to the reader the conclusion of the stanza word with great beauty and delicacy amount substantially to say -- ` take you last look of the dead adonai while he may still seem to the eye to be rather sleep than dead ' 1 7 _ he lie as if in dewy sleep he lay _ see bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- ` beautiful in death as one that have fall on sleep ' the term ` dewy sleep ' mean probably ` sleep which refresh the body as nightly dew refresh the field ' this phrase be follow by the kindred expression ` liquid rest ' + stanza 8 + 1 3 _ the shadow of white death _ & c the use of ` he ' and ` she ' in this stanza be not wholly free from ambiguity in st 7 death be a male impersonation -- ` kingly death ' who ` keep he pale court ' it may be assume that he be the same in the present stanza corruption on the other hand be a female impersonation : she -lrb- not death -rrb- must be the same as ` the eternal hunger ' as to whom it be say that ` pity and awe soothe _ she _ pale rage ' premise this we read : -- ` within the twilight chamber spread apace the shadow of white death and at the door invisible corruption wait to trace he -lrb- adonai 's -rrb- extreme way to she -lrb- corruption 's -rrb- dim dwelling-place the eternal hunger -lrb- corruption -rrb- sit -lrb- at the door -rrb- but pity and awe soothe she pale rage nor dare she ' & c the unwonted phrase ` he extreme way ' seem to differ in mean little if at all from the very ordinary term ` he last journey ' the statement in this stanza therefore be that corruption do not assail adonai lie on he deathbed but will shortly follow he remains to the grave the dim -lrb- obscure lightless -rrb- abode of corruption itself 11 8 9 _ till darkness and the law of change shall o'er he sleep the mortal curtain draw _ until the darkness of the grave and the universal law of change and dissolution shall draw the curtain of death over he sleep -- shall prove he apparent sleep to be veritable death the prolonged interchange in _ adonai _ between the idea of death and of sleep may remind we that shelley open with a similar contrast or approximation he first considerable -lrb- though in part immature -rrb- poem _ queen mab _ -- ` how wonderful be death -- death and he brother sleep ' & c the mind may also revert to the noble passage in byron 's _ giaour _ -- ` he who have bent he o'er the dead ere the first day of death be flee ' & c -- though the idea of actual sleep be not raise in this admirably beautiful and admirably realistic description perhaps the poem of all other in which the conception of death be associate with that of sleep with the most poignant pathos be that of edgar poe entitle _ for annie _ -- ` thank heaven the crisis the danger be past and the linger illness be over at last and the fever call living be conquer at last ' & c -- where real death be speak of throughout in a series of exquisite and thrilling image as be real sleep in shelley 's own edition of _ adonai _ the line which we be now consider be essentially different they run 'till darkness and the law of mortal change shall fill the grave which be she maw ' this be comparatively poor and rude the change to the present reading be introduce by mr shelley in she edition of shelley 's poem in 1839 she give no information as to she authority : but there can be no doubt that at some time or other shelley himself make the improvement see p 33 + stanza 9 + 1 i _ the quick dream _ with these word begin a passage of some length which be closely model upon the passage of bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- ` and around he the love be weep ' & c : model upon it and also systematically transpose from it the transposition go on the same line as that of adonis into adonai and of the cyprian into the uranian aphrodite ie the personal or fleshly love be spiritualize into dream -lrb- musing reverie conception -rrb- and other faculty or emotion of the mind it be to be observe moreover that the trance of adonis attend by cupid form a incident in keat 's own poem of _ endymion _ book ii -- ` for on a silken couch of rosy pride in midst of all there lay a sleep youth of fondest beauty fonder in fair sooth than sigh could fathom or contentment reach \* \* \* \* \* hard by stand serene cupid watch silently one kneel to a lyre touch the string muffle to death the pathos with he wing and ever and anon uprose to look at the youth 's slumber while another take a willow-bough distil odorous dew and shoot it on he hair another fly in through the weave roof and fluttering-wise rain violet upon he sleep eye ' 1 2 _ the

emotional conception -- such thought as subserve the purpose of poetry and enter into its structure : in a word poetic thought 1 3 _ who be he flock _ & c these dream be in fact the very thought of adonai as convey in he poem he be dead they can not assume new form of beauty in any future poem and can not be thus diffuse from mind to mind but they remain mourn round they deceased herdsman or master it be possible that this image of a flock and a herdsman be consequent upon the phrase in the elegy of moschus for bion -- ` bion the herdsman be dead ' -lrb- p 65 -rrb- + stanza 10 + 1 2 _ and fan he with she moonlight wing _ see bion -lrb- p 65 -rrb- ` and another from behind he with he wing be fan adoni ' the epithet ` moonlight ' may indicate either delicacy of color or faint luminosity -- rather the latter 1 6 _ a tear some dream have loosen from he brain _ i follow shelley 's edition in printing dream with a capital letter i do not however think this helpful to the right sense the capitalized dream might appear to be one of those impersonate dream to whom these stanza relate : but in the present line the word ` dream ' would be more naturally construe as mean simply ` think mental conception ' 1 7 _ lose angel of a ruin paradise _ the ruin paradise be the mind now torpid in death of adonais the ` dream ' which have be speak be a lose angel of this paradise in the sense of be a messenger or denizen of the mind of adonai incapacitate for exercise any further action : indeed the dream forthwith fade and be for ever extinct 1 8 _ with no stain _ leave no trace behind the rhyme have entail the use of the word ` stain ' which be otherwise a little arbitrary in this connexion 1 9 _ she fade like a cloud which have outwept its rain _ a rain-cloud which have fully discharge its rain would no longer constitute a cloud -- it would be disperse and go the image be therefore a very exact one for the dream which have accomplish its function and its life now cease to be there appear to be a further parallel intend -- between the dream whose existence close in a _ tear _ and the rain-cloud which have discharge its _ rain _ : this be of less moment and verge upon a conceit this passage in _ adonai _ be not without some analogy to one in keat 's _ endymion _ -lrb- quote on p 42 -rrb- -- ` therein a melancholy spirit well might win oblivion and melt out he essence fine into the wind ' stanza 11 + 11 1 2 _ one from a lucid urn of starry dew wash he light limb as if embalm they _ see the passage from bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- ` one in a golden vessel bear water and another lave the wound ' the expression ` starry dew ' be rather peculiar : the dew may originally have ` star ' the grass but when collect into a urn it must have lose this property : perhaps we should rather understand nocturnal dew upon which the star have be shine it be difficult to see how the act of wash the limb could simulate the process of embalming 1 3 _ another clipt she profuse lock _ see bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- ` clipping they lock for adoni ' ` profuse ' be here accent on the first syllable although indeed the line can be read with the accent as be usual on the second syllable 11 3-5 _ and throw the wreath upon he like a anadem which freeze tear instead of pearl begem _ the wreath be the lock of hair -- perhaps a plait or curl for otherwise the term wreath be rather wide of the mark the idea that the tear shed by this dream herself -lrb- or perhaps other dream -rrb- upon the lock be ` frozen ' and thus stand in lieu of pearl upon a anadem or circlet seem strained and indeed incongruous : one might wish it away 11 6 7 _ another in she wilful grief would break she bow and wingd reed _ follow bion closely -- ` and one upon he shaft another on he bow be tread ' -lrb- p 64 -rrb- this be perfectly appropriate for the love or cupid : not equally so for the dream for it be not so apparent what concern they have with bow and arrow these may however be ` winged thought ' or ` winged word ' -- -lrb- greek : epea pteroenta -rrb- mr andrew lang observe -lrb- introduction to he theocritus volume -rrb- ` in one or other of the sixteen pompeian picture of venus and adoni the love be break they bow and arrow for grief as in the hymn of bion ' 11 7 8 _ as if to stem a greater loss with one which be more weak _ ` to stem a loss ' be a very lax phrase -- and more especially ` to stem a loss with another loss ' ` to stem a torrent -- or the current of a river ' be a well-known expression indicate one sort of material force in opposition to another hence we come to the figurative expression ` to stem the torrent of he grief ' & c shelley seem to have yield to a certain analogy in the sentiment and also to the convenience of a rhyme and thus to have permit himself a phrase which be neither english nor consistent with sense line 8 seem to I extremely feeble throughout 1 9 _ and dull the barbd fire against he frozen cheek _ the construction run -- ` another would break & c and -lrb- would -rrb- dull & c ' the term ` the barbd fire ' represent of course ` the winged reed ' or arrow : actual reed or arrow be now transmute into flame-tipped arrow -lrb- conformable to the spiritual or immaterial quality of the dream -rrb- : the fire be to be quench against the frost of the death-cold cheek of adonais ` frozen tear -- frozen cheek : ' shelley would scarcely i apprehend have allow this repetition but for some inadvertence i be free to acknowledge that i think the whole of this stanza bad its _ raison d'tre _ be a figurative but perfectly appropriate and straightforward passage in bion : shelley have attempt to turn that into a still more figurative passage suitable for _ adonai _ with a result anything but happy he fail to make it either straightforward or appropriate and decline into the super-subtle or wiredrawn + stanza 12 + 1 1 _ another splendor _ another luminous dream 1 2 _ that mouth whence it be wont to draw the breath _ & c adonai -lrb- keat -rrb- as a poet be here figure as if he be a singer consequently we be refer to he ` mouth ' as the vehicle of he thought or poetic imagining -- not to he hand which record they 1 3 _ to pierce the guard wit _ to obtain entry into the otherwise unready mind of other -- the hearer -lrb- or reader -rrb- of the poet 11 5 6 _ the damp death quench its caress upon he icy lip _ this phrase be not very clear i understand it to mean -- the damp of death -lrb- upon the visage of adonai -rrb- quench the caress of the splendor -lrb- or dream -rrb- imprint on he icy lip it might however be contend that the term ` the damp death ' be use as a energetic synonym for the ` splendor ' itself in this case the sense of the whole passage may be amplify thus : the splendor in imprint its caress upon the icy lip of adonai have its caress quench by the cold and be itself convert into dampness and deathliness : it be no longer a luminous splendor but a vaporous and clammy form of death the assumption that ` the damp death ' stand as a synonym for the ` splendor ' obtain some confirmation from the succeed phrase about the ' _ die _ meteor ' -- for this certainly seem use as a simile for the ` splendor ' 1 7 _ ` and as a die meteor ' _ & c the die meteor in this simile must represent the splendor the wreath of moonlight vapor stand for the pale limb of adonai the cold night may in a general way symbolize the night of death 1 9 _ it flush through he pale limb and pass to its eclipse _ the splendor flush through the limb of adonai and so become eclipse -- fade into nothingness this terminate the episode of the ` quick dream ' beginning with stanza 9 + stanza 13 + 1 1 _ and other come -- desire and adoration _ & c this passage be the first in which shelley have direct recourse no longer to the elegy of bion for adoni but to the elegy of moschus for bion as he have spiritualize the impersonation of bion so he now spiritualize those of moschus the sicilian lyrist give we -lrb- see p 65 -rrb- apollo satyr priapi pane and fountain-fairy shelley give we desire adoration persuasion destiny splendor gloom hope fear phantasy sorrow sigh and pleasure all these ` lament adonai ' -lrb- stanza 14 -rrb- : they be such emotional or abstract being as ` he have love and mould into think from shape and hue and odour and sweet sound ' the adjectival epithet be worth note for they poetic felicity : wingd persuasion -lrb- again hint at -lrb- greek : epea pteroenta -rrb- -rrb- veil destiny glimmer hope and fear twilight phantasy 1 6 _ and pleasure blind with tear _ & c the rev stopford brooke in a eloquent lecture deliver to the shelley society in June 1889 dwelt at some length upon the singular mythopoeic gift of the poet these two line be a instance in point of a very condensed kind pleasure heart-struck at the death of adonai have abrogate she own nature and have become blind with tear she eye can therefore serve no longer to guide she step she smile too be die but not yet dead it emit a faint gleam which in default of eye serve to distinguish the path if one regard this as a mere image it may be allow to approach close to a conceit but it suggest a series of incident and figurative detail which may rather count as a compendious myth 1 8 _ come in slow pomp : -- the move pomp might seem _ the repetition of the word ` pomp ' give a certain poverty to the sound of this line it can hardly i think have be deliberately intend in other respects this stanza be one of the most melodious in the poem + stanza 14 + 11 3 4 _ morning seek she eastern watch-tower and she hair unbound _ & c whether shelley wish the reader to attribute any distinct naturalistic meaning to the ` hair ' of morning be a question which may admit of some doubt if he do so the ` hair unbound ' be probably to be regard as streak of rain-cloud these cloudlet ought to fertilize the soil with they moisture but instead of that they merely dim the eye of morning and dull the beginning of day in this instance and in many other instance ensue shelley represent natural power or natural object -- morning echo flower & c -- as suffer some interruption or decay of essence or function in sympathy with the stroke which have cut short the life of adonais it need hardly be say that in do this he only follow a host of predecessor he follow for example he special model bion and moschus they probably follow earlier model but i have fail in attempt to trace how far back beyond they this scheme of symbolism may have extend something of it can be find in theocritus the legend -- doubtless a very ancient one -- that the sister of phaeton weep amber for he fall belong to the same order of idea -lrb- as a learn friend suggest to I -rrb- 1 8 _ pale ocean _ as not only the real keat but also the figurative adonai die in rome the ocean can not be a feature in the immediate scene it lie in the not very remote distance feel rather than visible to sight of course too ocean -lrb- as well as thunder and wind -rrb- be personate in this passage he be a cosmic deity lie pale in unquiet slumber + stanza 15 + 1 1 _ lose echo sit _ & c echo be introduce into both the grecian elegy that of moschus as well as that of bion bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- simply say that ` echo resound adonis dead ' but moschus -lrb- p 65 -rrb- whom shelley substantially follow set forth that ` echo in the rock lament that thou -lrb- bion -rrb- art silent and no more she mimic thy voice ' also ` echo among the reed doth still feed upon thy song ' it will be observe that in this stanza echo be a single personage -- the nymph know to mythological fable : but in stanza 2 we have various ` echo ' spirit of minor account who in the paradise of uranium be occupy with the poem of adonai 11 6-8 _ he lip more dear than those for whose disdain she pine away into a shadow of all sound _ echo be in mythology a nymph who be in love with narcissus he be enamour of he own beautiful countenance pay no heed to echo who consequently ` pine away into a shadow of all sound ' in this expression one may discern a delicate double meaning -lrb- 1 -rrb- echo pine away into -lrb- as the accustomed phrase go -rrb- ' a mere shadow of she former self ' -lrb- 2 -rrb- just as a solid body light by the sun cast as a necessary concomitant a shadow of itself so a sound emit under the requisite condition cast a echo of itself echo be in relation to sound the same sort of thing as shadow in relation to substance 11 8 9 _ a drear murmur between they song be all the woodman hear _ echo will not now repeat the song of the woodman she merely murmur some snatch of the ` remembered lay ' of adonai + stanza 16 + 1 1 _ grief make the young spring wild _ this introduction of spring may be take as imply that shelley suppose keat to have die in the spring : but in fact he die in the winter -- 23 February as to this point see pp 30 and 96 11 1-3 _ and she throw down she kindling bud as if she autumn be or they dead leaf _ this correspond to a certain extent with the phrase in bion ` the flower be wither up with grief ' and ` yea all the flower be fade ' -lrb- p 64 -rrb- and in moschus ` and in sorrow for thy fall the tree cast down they fruit and all the flower have fade ' -lrb- p 65 -rrb- it may be worth observe that shelley say -- ` as if she autumn be _ or _ they dead leaf ' -lrb- not ' _ and _ they dead leaf ' -rrb- he therefore seem to present the act of spring from two separate point of view : -lrb- 1 -rrb- she throw down the bud as if she have be autumn whose office it be to throw down and not to cherish and develope -lrb- 2 -rrb- she throw down the bud as if they have be not bud of the nascent year but such dead leaf of the olden year as still linger on the spray when spring arrive 1 4 _ for whom should she have wake the sullen year _ the year begin on 1 January may in a certain sense be conceive as sleep until rouse by the call of spring but more probably shelley here treat the year as begin on 25 march -- which date would witness its awakening and practically its first existence 11 5-7 _ to phoebus be not hyacinth so dear nor to himself narcissus as to both thou adonais wan they stand and sere _ & c this passage assimilate two section in the elegy of moschus p 65 : ` now thou hyacinth whisper the letter on thee graven and add a deeper be be to thy petal : he be dead the beautiful singer nor so much do pleasant lesbo mourn for alcaeus ' & c the passage of shelley be rather complicate in its significance because it mix up the personage hyacinthus and narcissus with the flower hyacinth and narcissus the beautiful youth hyacinthus be dear to phoebus on he untimely death -lrb- he be slay by a quoit which phoebus throw and which the jealous zephyrus blow aside so that it strike hyacinthus on the head -rrb- the god change he blood into the flower hyacinth which bear marking interpret by the grecian fancy into the lettering -lrb- greek : be be -rrb- -lrb- alas alas -rrb- the beautiful youth narcissus contemplate himself in a streamlet become enamoured of he own face and pine away be convert into the flower narcissus this account for the line ` to phoebus be not hyacinth so dear nor to himself narcissus ' but when we come to the sequence ` as to both thou adonais ' we have to do no longer with the youth hyacinthus and narcissus but with the flower hyacinth and narcissus : it be the flower which -lrb- accord to shelley -rrb- love adonais better than the youth be love the one by phoebus and the other by himself these flower -- be some of the kindling bud which spring have throw down -- stand ` wan and sere ' -lrb- this last point be rather the reverse of a phrase in bion 's elegy p 64 ` the flower flush red for anguish ' -rrb- it may perhaps be hold that the transition from the youth to the flower and from the emotion of phoebus and of narcissus to those assign to the flower be not very happily manage by shelley : it be artificial and not free from confusion as to the hyacinth the reader will readily perceive that a flower which bear marking read off into -lrb- greek : be be -rrb- -lrb- or -lrb- greek : be be -rrb- seem more correct -rrb- can not be the same which we now call hyacinth ovid say that in form the hyacinth resemble a lily and that its color be ` purpureus ' or deep red john martyn who publish in 1755 _ the georgick of virgil with a english translation _ have a elaborate note on the subject he conclude thus : ' i be pretty well satisfied that the flower celebrate by the poet be what we now be acquaint with under the name ` lilium floribus reflexis ' or martagon and perhaps may be that very species which we call imperial martagon the flower of most sort of martagon have many spot of a deeper color : and sometimes i have see these spot run together in such a manner as to form the letter be in several place ' shelley refer to the hyacinth in another passage -lrb- _ prometheus unbound _ act 2 sc 1 -rrb- which seem to indicate that he regard the antique hyacinth as be the same as the modern hyacinth -- ` as the _ blue bell _ of hyacinth tell apollo 's write grief ' 1 8 _ amid the faint companion of they youth _ in shelley 's edition the word be ` amid the drooping comrade ' & c the change be make under the same circumstance as note on p 105 whether it be a change for the better may admit of some question the faint companion of the youth of the hyacinth and the narcissus must be other flower such as spring have throw down 1 9 _ with dew all turn to tear -- odour to sigh ruth _ the dew upon the hyacinth and narcissus be convert into tear : they exhale sigh instead of fragrance all this be in rather a _ falsetto _ tone it have some resemblance to the more simple and touching phrase in the elegy by moschus -lrb- p 65 -rrb- : ` ye flower now in sad cluster breathe yourselve away ' + stanza 17 + 1 1 _ thy spirit sister the lorn nightingale mourn not she mate _ & c the reason for call the nightingale the sister of the spirit of keat -lrb- adonai -rrb- do not perhaps go beyond this -- that as the nightingale be a supreme songster among bird so be keat a supreme songster among man it be possible however -- and one willingly suppose so -- that shelley single out the nightingale for mention in recognition of the consummate beauty of keat 's _ ode to the nightingale _ publish in the same volume with _ hyperion _ the epithet ` lorn ' may also be note in the same connexion as keat 's ode terminate with a celebrated passage in which ` forlorn ' be the lead word -lrb- but not as a epithet for the nightingale itself -rrb- -- ` forlorn -- the very word be as a knell ' & c the nightingale be also introduce into the elegy of moschus for bion ` ye nightingales that lament ' & c -lrb- p 65 -rrb- and ` nor ever sing so sweet the nightingale on the cliff ' poet be fond of speaking of the nightingale as be the hen-bird and shelley follow this precedent it be a fallacy for the songster be always the cock-bird 1 3 _ not so the eagle _ & c the general statement in these line be that albion wail for the death of keat more melodiously than the nightingale mourning for she lose mate and more passionately than the eagle rob of she young this statement have prove true enough in the long run : when shelley write it be only prospectively or potentially true for the death of keat excite no immediate widespread concern in england it should be observe that by introduce albion as a figurative personage in he elegy shelley disregard he emblematic grecian youth adonai and go straight to the actual englishman keat this passage take as a whole be related to that of moschus -lrb- p 65 -rrb- regard the nightingale the sea-bird and the bird of memnon see also the passage ` and not for sappho but still for thee ' & c 11 4 5 _ could nourish in the sun 's domain she mighty youth with morning _ this phrase seem to have some analogy to that of milton in he _ areopagitica _ : ` methink i see in my mind a noble and puissant nation rouse herself like a strong man after sleep and shake she invincible lock methink i see she as a eagle mue she mighty youth and kindle she undazzled eye at the full mid-day beam -- purge and unseal she long-abused sight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance ' 11 7 8 _ the curse of cain light on he head _ & c a imprecation against the critic of keat 's _ endymion _ in the _ quarterly review _ : see especially p 39 & c the curse of cain be that he should be ' a fugitive and a vagabond ' as well as unsuccessful in till the soil shelley probably pay no attention to these detail but simply mean ` the curse of murder ' + stanza 18 + 11 1 2 _ ah woe be I winter be come and go but grief return with the revolving year _ & c see the passage in moschus -lrb- p 65 -rrb- : ` ah I when the mallow wither ' & c the phrase in bion have also a certain but restricted analogy to this stanza : ` thou must again bewail he again must weep for he another year ' -lrb- p 65 -rrb- as to the phrase ` winter be come and go ' see the note -lrb- p 111 -rrb- on ` grief make the young spring wild ' 1 5 _ fresh leaf and flower deck the dead season ' bier _ this phrase be barely consistent with the statement -lrb- st 16 -rrb- as to spring throw down she kindling bud perhaps moreover it be a error of print to give ` season ' in the plural : ` season 's ' -lrb- mean winter -rrb- would seem more accurate a somewhat similar idea be convey in one of shelley 's lyric _ autumn a dirge _ write in 1820 : -- ` and the year on the earth she death-bed in a shroud of leaf dead be lie ' 1 7 _ brere _ a antiquated form of the word briar 1 9 _ like unimprisoned flame _ flame which after be pen up within some substance or space finally find a vent + stanza 19 + 1 2 _ a quicken life _ & c the present stanza be generally descriptive of the effect of springtime upon the earth this reawaken of nature -lrb- shelley say -rrb- have always take place in annual recurrence since ` the great morning of the world when first god dawn on chaos ' this last expression must be construe with a certain latitude the change from a imagine chaos into a divinely-ordered cosmos be not necessarily coincident with the interchange of season and especially the transition from winter to spring upon the planet earth all that can be safely propound on such a subject be that the sequence of season be a constant and infallible phenomenon of nature in that condition of we planet with which alone we have or can have any acquaintance 1 5 _ in its steam immerse _ : ie in the steam -- or vapor or exhalation -- of the ` quickening life ' + stanza 20 + 11 1 2 _ the leprous corpse touch by this spirit tender exhale itself in flower of gentle breath _ ` this spirit tender ' be the ` quickening life ' of the renascent year or briefly the spring by ` the leprous corpse ' shelley may mean not the corpse of a actual leper but any corpse in a loathsome state of decay even so abhorrent a object avail to fertilize the soil and thus promote the growth of odorous flower 1 3 _ like incarnation of the star _ & c these flower -- star-like blossom -- illumine death and the grave : the light which would belong to they as star be convert into the fragrance proper to they as flower this image be rather confuse and i think rather stilted : moreover ` incarnation ' -lrb- or embodiment in _ flesh _ -rrb- be hardly the right word for the vegetative nature of flower as form of life the flower mock or deride the grave-worm which batten or make merry on corruption the appropriateness of the term ` merry worm ' seem very disputable 1 6 _ nought we know die _ this affirmation spring directly out of the consideration just present to we -- that even the leprous corpse do not through various stage of decay pass into absolute nothingness : on the contrary its constituent take new form and subserve a re-growth of life as in the flower which bedeck the grave from this single and impressive instance the poet pass to the general and unfailing law -- no material object of which we have cognizance really die : all such object be in a perpetual cycle of change this conception have be finely develop in a brace of early poem of lord tennyson _ all thing will die _ and _ nothing will die _ : -- ` the stream will cease to flow the wind will cease to blow the cloud will cease to fleet the heart will cease to beat -- for all thing must die \* \* \* \* \* ` the stream flow the wind blow the cloud fleet the heart beat nothing will die nothing will die all thing will change through eternity ' 11 6-8 _ shall that alone which know be as a sword consume before the sheath by sightless lightning _ from the axiom ` nought we know die ' -- a axiom which should be understand as limit to what we call material object -lrb- which shelley however consider to be indistinguishable in essence from idea see p 56 -rrb- -- he proceed to the question ` shall that alone which know ' -- ie shall the mind alone -- die and be annihilate if the mind be to die while the body continue extant -lrb- not indeed in the form of a human body but in various phase of ulterior development -rrb- then the mind would resemble a sword which by the action of lightning be consume -lrb- molten dissolve -rrb- within its sheath while the sheath itself remain unconsumed this be put as a question and shelley do not supply a answer to it here though the term in which he enquiry be couch seem intend to suggest a reply to the effect that the mind shall _ not _ die the meaning of the epithet ` sightless ' as apply to lightning seem disputable of course the primary sense of this word be ` not-seeing blind ' but shelley would probably not have scruple to use it in the sense of ` unseen ' i incline to suppose that shelley mean ` unseen ' not so much that the lightning be itself unseen as that its action in fuse the sword which remain conceal within the sheath be unseen but the more obvious sense of ` blind unregardful ' could also be justified 11 8 9 _ th ' intense atom glow a moment then be quench in a most cold repose _ the term ` th ' intense atom ' be a synonym for ` that which know ' or the mind by death it be ` quench in a most cold repose ' : but the repose be not necessarily extinction + stanza 21 + 11 1 2 _ alas that all we love of he should be but for we grief as if it have not be _ ` all we love of he ' must be the mind and character -- the mental and personal endowment -- of adonai : he bodily frame be little or not at all in question here by these line therefore shelley seem to intimate that the mind or soul of adonai be indeed now and for ever extinct : it live no longer save in the grief of the survivor but it do not follow that this be a final expression of shelley 's conviction on the subject : the passage should be read as in context with the whole poem 11 5 6 _ great and mean meet mass in death who lend what life must borrow _ the meaning of the last word be far from clear to I i think shelley may intend to say that in this we mortal state death be the solid and permanent fact it be rather a world of death than of life the phenomenon of life be but like a transitory loan from the great emporium death shelley no doubt want a rhyme for ` morrow ' and ` sorrow ' : he have make use of ` borrow ' in a compact but not perspicuous phrase + stanza 22 + 1 2 _ ` wake thou ' cry misery ` childless mother ' _ we here return to uranium of whom we have last hear in st 6 see the passage translate by shelley from bion -lrb- p 63 -rrb- ` sleep no more venus : ` tis misery call ' & c but here the phrase '' ti misery call ' be shelley 's own he more than once introduce misery -lrb- in the sense of unhappiness tribulation -rrb- as a emblematic personage there be he lyric name _ misery _ write in 1818 which begin -- ` come be happy -- sit by I shadow-vested misery : coy unwilling silent bride mourning in thy robe of pride desolation deify ' there be also the briefer lyric name _ death _ 1817 which begin -- ` they die -- the dead return not misery sit near a open grave and call they over a youth with hoary hair and haggard eye ' 11 3 4 _ ` slake in thy heart core a wound -- more fierce than he with tear and sigh ' _ construe : slake with tear and sigh a wound in thy heart 's core -- a wound more fierce than he ' see -lrb- p 101 -rrb- the remark apposite to st 4 upon the use of inversion by shelley 1 5 _ all the dream that watch uranium 's eye _ we have not hitherto hear of ` dream ' in connexion with uranium but only in connexion with adonais himself these ` dream that watch uranium 's eye ' appear to be dream in the more obvious sense of that word-vision which have haunt the slumber of uranium 1 8 _ swift as a think by the snake memory sting _ the context suggest that the ` thought ' here in question be a grievous thought and the term ` the snake memory ' convey therefore a corresponding impression of pain shelley however have not the usual feeling of repulsion or abhorrence for snake and serpent various passage could be cite to prove this more especially canto 1 of _ the revolt of islam _ where the spirit of good be figure under the form of a serpent 1 9 _ front she ambrosial rest the fading splendor spring _ uranium she be in she own nature a splendor or celestial deity : at the present moment she brightness be ` fading ' as be overcast by sorrow and dismay ` she ambrosial rest ' do not appear to signify anything more precise than ` she rest proper to a immortal be ' the form ` spring sing ' & c be constantly use by shelley instead of ` spring sing ' & c + stanza 23 + 1 5 _ have leave the earth a corpse _ shelley in this quasi-greek poem take no count of the fact that the sun when it cease to illumine one part of the earth be shine upon another part he treat the unillumined part as if it be the whole earth -- which have hereby become ' a corpse ' + stanza 24 + 1 2 _ through camp and city _ & c in highly figurative language this stanza picture the passage of uranium from ` she secret paradise ' to the death-chamber of adonai in rome as if the spiritual essence and external form of the goddess be wound by the uncongenial atmosphere of human malice and detraction through which she have to pass the whole description be spiritualize from that of bion -lrb- p 63 -rrb- : -- ` wildered ungirt unsandalled -- the thorn pierce she hastening foot and drink she sacred blood ' 11 45 _ the invisible palm of she tender foot _ shelley more than once use ` palm ' for ` sole ' of the foot see _ prometheus unbound _ act 4 : -- ` we foot now every palm be sandall with calm ' and _ the triumph of life _ : -- ` as she move under the mass of the deep cavern and with palm so tender they tread break not the mirror of the billow glide along the river ' perhaps shelley get this usage from the italian : in that language the web-foot of aquatic bird be term ` palme ' 11 8 9 _ whose sacred blood like the young tear of may pave with eternal flower that undeserving way _ the tear of may be rain-drop young because the year be not far advance ` that undeserving way ' seem a very poor expression see -lrb- p 64 -rrb- the passage from bion : ' a tear the paphian shed for each blood-drop of adoni and tear and blood on the earth be turn to flower ' + stanza 25 + 1 3 _ death blush to annihilation _ this very daring hyperbole will hardly bear -- nor do it want -- manipulation into prose briefly the nature of death be to be pallid : therefore death in blush abnegate he very nature and almost cease to be death 11 3 4 _ the breath revisit those lip _ & c as death tend towards ` annihilation ' so adonais tend towards revival 1 7 _ ` silent lightning ' _ this mean i suppose lightning unaccompanied by thunder -- summer lightning + stanza 26 + 1 1 _ ` stay yet awhile ' _ see bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- : ` stay adonis stay dearest one ' 1 2 _ ` kiss I so long but as a kiss may live ' _ see as above : -- ` that i may kiss thee now for the last time -- but for as long as one short kiss may live ' 1 3 _ ` my heartless breast ' _ uranium 's breast will henceforth be heartless in the sense that have bestow she whole heart upon adonai she will have none to bestow upon any one else : so i understand the epithet 1 4 _ ` that word that kiss shall all thought else survive ' _ & c see bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- : ` this kiss will i treasure ' & c 11 7-9 _ ' i would give all that i be to be as thou now art : -- but i be chained to time and can not thence depart ' _ found on bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- : ` while wretched i yet live be a goddess and may not follow thee ' the alteration of phrase be somewhat remarkable in bion 's elegy the cyprian aphrodite be ' a goddess ' and therefore immortal in shelley 's elegy the uranian aphrodite do not speak of herself under any designation of immortality or eternity but as ` chained to _ time _ ' and incapable of depart from time as long as time life and operate uranium must do the same the dead have escape from the dominion of time : this uranium can not do there be a somewhat similar train of think in _ prometheus unbound _ -- where prometheus the titan after endure the torture of the fury -lrb- act 1 -rrb- say -- ` peace be in the grave : the grave hold all thing beautiful and good i be a god and can not find it _ there _ ' + stanza 27 + 11 1-4 _ ' o gentle child beautiful as thou wert why didst thou leave ' _ & c this be found on -- and as usual spiritualize from -- the passage in bion -lrb- p 64 -rrb- ` for why ah overbold didst thou follow the chase and be so fair why wert thou thus over-hardy to fight with beast ' 1 4 _ ` dare the unpastured dragon in he den ' _ this phrase must no doubt be interpret not only in relation to the figurative adonai but also to the actual keat keat have dare the unpastured dragon in he den in the sense that he make a bold adventure into the poetical field under condition certain to excite the ire of adherent of the old school whether in literature or in politics 1 6 _ ` wisdom the mirror shield or scorn the spear ' _ uranium arraign keat for have make he inroad upon the dragon unguarded by wisdom or by scorn he want of wisdom be show -lrb- we may assume -rrb- by the grave blemish and defect in he _ endymion _ the wilful fault and perverse excess and extravagance which mark its composition and wantonly invite attack he want of scorn be -lrb- accord to shelley 's view of the fact -rrb- clear enough : he have not be equal to despise a spiteful attack but have fret himself to death under it in term these two defensive weapon wisdom and scorn a mirror shield and a spear shelley be i apprehend thinking of the orlando furioso of ariosto in that poem we read of a magic shield which cast a supernatural and intolerable splendor whereby every gazer be cast into a trance and of a spear whose lightest touch overthrow every opponent a sea-monster -- not a dragon so far as i recollect -- become one of the victim of the ` mirror shield ' 11 7 8 _ ` the full cycle when thy spirit should have fill its crescent sphere ' _ the spirit of keat be here assimilate to the moon which grow from a crescent into a spherical form 1 9 _ ` the monster of life 's waste ' _ the noxious creature which infest the wilderness of human life + stanza 28 + 1 1 _ ` the herd wolf ' _ & c these same ` monster ' be now picture under three aspect they be herd wolf which will venture to pursue a traveller but will not face he if he turn upon they boldly and obscene raven which make a uproar over dead body or dead reputation and vulture which follow in the wake of a conqueror and gorge upon that which be already overthrow in the succeed stanza 29 two other epithetal simile be bestow upon the monster -- they become ` reptile ' and ` ephemeral insect ' all these repulsive image be of course here apply to critic of wilfully obtuse or malignant mind such as shelley account the _ quarterly _ reviewer of keat to be 1 5 & c _ ` how they flee when like apollo ' _ & c the allusion be to perfectly well-known incident in the opening poetic career of lord byron he lordship in earliest youth publish a very insignificant volume of verse name _ hour of idleness _ the _ edinburgh review _ -- rightly in substance but with some superfluous harshness of tone -- pronounce this volume to be poor stuff byron retaliate by produce he satire entitle _ english bard and scotch reviewer _ with this book he score a success he next publication be the generally and enthusiastically admire commencement of _ childe harold _ 1812 after which date the critic justly acclaimed he as a poet -- although in course of time they grow lavishly severe upon he from the point of view of moral and religion i reproduce from the pisan edition the punctuation -- ` when like apollo from he golden bow ' but i think the exact sense would be better bring out if we read -- ` when like apollo from he golden bow the pythian ' & c 11 7 8 _ ` the pythian of the age one arrow speed and smile ' _ byron be here assimilate to apollo pythius -- apollo the python-slayer the statue name apollo belvedere be regard as represent the god at the moment after he have discharge he arrow at the python -lrb- serpent -rrb- he countenance irradiated with a half-smile of divine scorn and triumph the term employ by shelley seem to glance more particularly at that celebrated statue : this be the more appropriate as byron have devote to the same figure two famous stanza in the 4th canto of _ childe harold _ -- ` or view the lord of the unerring bow the god of life and poesy and light ' & c 1 9 _ ` they fawn on the proud foot that spurn they lie low ' _ in the pisan edition we read ` that spurn they as they go ' no doubt the change -lrb- introduce as in other instance name on pp 105 and 113 -rrb- must be shelley 's own the picture present to the mind be more consistent accord to the altered read the critic as we be tell in this stanza have at first ` flee ' from byron 's arrow afterwards they ` fawn on he proud foot ' in order to do this they must have pause in they flight and return and in the act of fawn on byron 's foot they must have crouch down or be ` lie low ' -lrb- mr forman in he edition of shelley point this out -rrb- with the word ` as they go ' the image be not self-consistent : for the critic could not be ` go ' or walk away at the same time when they be fawn on the poet 's foot this last remark assume that the word ` as they go ' mean ` as the critic go ' : but perhaps -lrb- and indeed i think this be more than probable -rrb- the real meaning be ` as the foot of byron go ' -- as byron proceeds disdainfully on he way if this be shelley 's original meaning he probably observe after a while that the word ` as _ they _ go ' seem to follow on with ' _ they _ fawn ' and not with ` the proud foot ' and in order to remove the ambiguity he substitute the expression ` lie low ' + stanza 29 + 11 1-3 _ ` the sun come forth and many reptile spawn he set and each ephemeral insect then be gather into death ' _ the spawning of a reptile -lrb- say a lizard or toad -rrb- and the death of a insect -lrb- say a beetle or gnat -rrb- be two thing totally unconnected shelley however seem to link they together as if this spawning be the origin of the life the brief life of the insect he appear therefore to use ` reptile ' not in the define sense which we commonly attach to the word but in the general sense of ' a creep creature ' such for instance as a grub or caterpillar the first form of a insect lead on to its final metamorphosis or development even so he natural history be curiously at fault : for no grub or caterpillar can spawn -- which be the function of the fully-developed insect itself whether ` ephemeral ' or otherwise can shelley have be ignorant of this 1 4 _ ` and the immortal star awake again ' _ the imagery of this stanza -lrb- apart from the ` reptile ' and ` ephemeral insect ' -rrb- deserve a little consideration the sun -lrb- say shelley -rrb- arise and then set : when it set the immortal star awake again similarly a godlike mind -lrb- say the mind of keat -rrb- appear and its light illumine the earth and veil the heaven : when it disappear ` the spirit 's awful night ' be leave to ` its kindred lamp ' this seem as much as to say that the splendor of a new poetic genius appear to contemporary to throw precede poet into obscurity but this be only a matter of the moment for when the new genius sink in death the other shine forth again as star of the intellectual zenith to which the new genius be kindred indeed but not superior with these word conclude the speech of uranium which begin in stanza 25 + stanza 30 + 1 1 _ the mountain shepherd _ these be contemporary british poet whom shelley represent as mourn the death of keat shepherd be such familiar figure in poetry -- utilize for instance in milton 's _ lycida _ as well as by many poet of antiquity -- that the introduction of they into shelley 's elegy be no matter for surprise why they should be ' _ mountain _ shepherd ' be not so clear perhaps shelley mean to indicate a certain analogy between the exalted level at which the shepherd dwelt and the exalted level at which the poet write as the shepherd do not belong to the low-country so neither do the poet belong to the flat of verse shelley may have write with a certain degree of reference to that couplet in _ lycida _ -- ` for we be nurse upon the self-same _ hill _ feed the same flock by fountain shade and rill ' 1 2 _ they garland sere they magic mantle rent _ the garland or chaplet of the mountain shepherd have become sere because -lrb- it may be presume -rrb- the wearer in they grief for the mortal illness and death of adonai have for some little while leave they unrenewed or possibly the garland wither at the moment when spring ` throw down she kindling bud ' -lrb- stanza 16 -rrb- i do not well understand the expression ` magic mantle ' there seem to be no reason why the mantle of the shepherd consider as shepherd should be magic even when we contemplate the shepherd as poet we may fail to discern why any magical property should be assign to they mantle by the use of the epithet ` magic ' shelley must have intend to bridge over the gap between the nominal shepherd and the real poet view as inspired singer : for this purpose he have adopt a bold verbal expedient but not i think a efficient one it may be notice that the ` uncouth swain ' who be represent in _ lycida _ as singing the dirge -lrb- in other word milton himself -rrb- be speak of as have a mantle -- it be a ` mantle blue ' -lrb- see the penultimate line of that poem -rrb- 1 3 _ the pilgrim of eternity _ this be lord byron as inventor of the personage childe harold the hero and so-called ` pilgrim ' of the poem _ childe harold 's pilgrimage _ and as be himself to a great extent identical with he hero byron be frequently term ` the pilgrim ' shelley adopt this designation which he magnify into ` the pilgrim of eternity ' he admire byron most enthusiastically as a poet and be generally on easy -- sometimes on cordial -- term with he as a man he have leave we a fine and discriminate portrait of byron in the ` count maddalo ' of he poem _ julian and maddalo _ write in 1818 at time however shelley feel and express great indignation against byron especially in reference to the ungenerous and cruel conduct of the latter towards miss clairmont see some brief reference to this matter at p 9 11 3-5 _ whose fame over he live head like heaven be bent a early but enduring monument _ these phrase be not very definite when fame be speak of as be bent over byron 's head we must conceive of fame as take a form cognizable by the sens i think shelley mean to assimilate it to the rainbow say substantially -- fame be like a arc bent over byron 's head as the arc of the rainbow be bent over the expanse of heaven the ensue term ` monument ' apply rather to fame in the abstract than to any image of fame as a arc 11 6 7 _ come veil all the lightning of he song in sorrow _ no doubt it would have be satisfactory to shelley if he could have find that byron entertain or express any serious concern at keat 's premature death and at the hard measure which have be mete out to he by critic byron do in fact admire _ hyperion _ writing -lrb- in November 1821 not long after the publication of _ adonai _ -rrb- -- ` he fragment of _ hyperion _ seem actually inspire by the titan and be as sublime as aeschylus ' and other utterance of he show that -- be with difficulty persuade to suppose that keat 's health and life have succumb to the attack in the _ quarterly _ -- he fittingly censure the want of feeling or want of reflection on the critic 's part which have produce so deplorable a result but on the whole byron 's feeling towards keat be one of savage contempt during the young poet 's life and of banter levity after he death here be some specimen -lrb- from a letter to mr murray 12 October 1820 -rrb- ` there be such a trash of keat and the like upon my table that i be ashamed to look at they no more keat i entreat flay he alive : if some of you do not i must skin he myself there be no bear the drivelling idiotism of the manikin ' ` who kill john keat i say the quarterly so savage and tartarly 'twa one of my feat ' ` john keat who be kill off by one critique just as he really promise something great if not intelligible without greek contrived to talk about the god of late much as they might have be suppose to speak poor fellow he be a untoward fate ` tis strange the mind that very fiery particle should let itself be snuff out by a article ' 11 7-9 _ from she wild ierne send the sweetest lyrist of she saddest wrong and love teach grief to fall like music from he tongue _ ierne -lrb- ireland -rrb- send thoma moore the lyrist of she wrong -- a allusion to the _ irish melody _ and some other poem there be not i believe any evidence to show that moore take the slightest interest in keat he doings or he fate : shelley be responsible for moore 's love grief and music in this connexion a letter from keat have be publish show that at one time he expect to meet moore personally -lrb- see p 45 -rrb- whether he do so or not i can not say for certain but i apprehend not : the publish diary of moore of about the same date suggest the negative + stanza 31 + 1 1 _ ` midst other of less note _ shelley clearly mean ` less note ' than byron and moore -- not less note than the ` one frail form ' 1 2 _ come one frail form _ & c this personage represent shelley himself shelley here describe himself under a profusion of characteristic briefly define : it may be interesting to summarize they apart from the other detail with which they be intersperse he be a frail form a phantom among man companionless one who have gaze actaeon-like on nature 's naked loveliness and who now flee with feeble step hound by he own thought a pard-like spirit beautiful and swift a love mask in desolation a power begirt with weakness scarcely capable of lift the weight of the hour a break billow which may even now be break the last of the company neglect and apart -- a herd-abandoned deer strike by the hunter 's dart in keat 's fate he weep he own he brow be brand and ensanguin most of these attribute can be sum up under one head -- that of extreme sensitiveness and susceptibility which meet with no response or sustainment but rather with misjudgment repulse and outrage some reader may think that shelley insist upon this aspect of he character to a degree rather excessive and dangerously near the confines of feminine sensibility rather than virile fortitude apart from this predominant type of character shelley describe he spirit as ` beautiful and swift ' -- which surely it be : and he say that have gaze upon nature 's naked loveliness he have suffer the fate of a second actseon flee ` o'er the world 's wilderness ' and pursue by he own thought like rage hound by this expression shelley apparently mean that he have over-boldly try to fathom the depths of thing and of mind but baffle and dismay in the effort suffer as a man living among man by the very tension and vividness of he thought and they daring in expression see what he say of himself in prose on p 92 11 4 5 _ he as i guess have gaze _ & c the use of the verb ` guess ' in the sense of ` to surmise conjecture infer ' be now mostly count as a americanism this be not correct for the verb have often be thus use by standard english author such a practice be not however common in shelley 's time and he may have be guide chiefly by the rhyming + stanza 32 + 1 4 _ the weight of the superincumbent hour _ this line be scarcely rhythmical : to bring it within the ordinary scheme of ryhthm one would have to lay a exaggerated stress on two of its foot -- ` th suprincumbent ' neither this treatment of the line nor the line itself apart from this treatment can easily be justified + stanza 33 + 11 1 2 _ he head be bind with pansy overblown and fade violet _ the pansy be the flower of thought or memory : we commonly call it heartsease but shelley no doubt use it here with a different or indeed contrary mean the violet indicate modesty a stanza from one of he lyric may be appropriately cite -- _ remembrance _ date 1821 : -- ` lily for a bridal bed rose for a matron 's head violet for a maiden dead pansy let _ my _ flower be on the living grave i bear scatter they without a tear let no friend however dear waste a hope a fear for I ' 1 3 _ a light spear top with a cypress cone _ the funereal cypress explain itself 1 4 _ dark ivy tress _ the ivy indicate constancy in friendship + stanza 34 + 1 1 _ he partial moan _ the epithet ` partial ' be account for by what immediately follow -- viz that shelley ` in another 's fate now weep he own ' he like keat be the object of critical virulence and he be wont -lrb- but on very different grounds -rrb- to anticipate a early death see -lrb- on p 34 -rrb- the expression in a letter from shelley -- ' a writer who however he may differ ' & c 1 4 _ as in the accent of a unknown land he sing new sorrow _ it be not very clear why shelley should represent that he as one of the mountain shepherd use a language different -lrb- as one might infer -rrb- from that of he companion all those whom he particularize be he compatriot perhaps however shelley merely mean that the language -lrb- english -rrb- be that of a land unknown to the greek deity aphrodite uranium the phrase ` new sorrow ' occur in the elegy by moschus -lrb- p 65 -rrb- by the use of this phrase shelley seem to mean not merely that the death of keat be a recent and sorrowful event but more especially that it constitute a new sorrow -- one more sorrow -- to shelley himself 11 3 5 i reproduce the punctuation of the pisan edition with a colon after ` he own ' and a semicolon after ` sorrow ' it appear to I however that the sense would rather require either a full stop after ` he own ' and a comma after ` sorrow ' or else a comma after ` he own ' and a full stop or colon after ` sorrow ' yet it be possible that the phrase ` as in the accent ' & c form a separate clause by itself mean ` as _ if _ in the accent of a unknown land he sing new sorrow ' 11 8 9 _ make bare he branded and ensanguined brow which be like cain 's or christ 's _ shelley represent he own brow as be brand like cain 's -- stamp with the mark of reprobation and ensanguin like christ 's -- bleed from a crown of thorn this indicate the extreme repugnance with which he be generally regard and in especial perhaps the decree of the court of chancery which deprive he of he child by he first marriage -- and generally the trouble and suffering which he have undergo the close coupling-together in this line of the name of cain and christ be not likely to conciliate antagonist and indeed one may safely surmise that it be do by shelley more for the rather wanton purpose of exasperate they than with any other object -- in this stanza uranium appear for the last time + stanza 35 + 1 1 _ what softer voice be hush over the dead _ the personage here refer to be leigh hunt see p 45 1 6 _ gentlest of the wise _ it be apparent that shelley entertain a very sincere affection and regard for leigh hunt he dedicate to hunt the tragedy of _ the cencus _ use the follow expression among other : ` have i know a person more highly endowed than yourself with all that it become a man to possess i have solicit for this work the ornament of he name one more gentle honorable innocent and brave one of more exalted toleration for all who do and think evil and yet himself more free from evil one who know better how to receive and how to confer a benefit though he must ever confer far more than he can receive one of simpler and -lrb- in the highest sense of the word -rrb- of purer life and manners i never know : and i have already be fortunate in friendship when you name be add to the list ' 1 7 _ teach soothed loved honor the depart one _ it have sometimes be maintain that hunt whatever may have be the personal friendship which he feel for keat do not during the latter 's lifetime champion he literary cause with so much zeal as might have be expect from he profession this be a point open to a good deal of discussion from both side mr buxton forman who as editor of keat have occasion to investigate the matter attentively pronounce decidedly in favor of hunt + stanza 36 + 1 1 _ we adonai have drunk poison _ found on those line of moschus which appear as a motto to shelley 's elegy see also p 49 1 2 _ what deaf and viperous murderer _ deaf because insensible to the beauty of keat 's verse and viperous because poisonous and malignant the juxtaposition of the two epithet may probably be also partly dependent on that passage in the psalm -lrb- lviii 4 5 -rrb- which have become proverbial : ` they be as venomous as the poison of a serpent : even like the deaf adder that stoppeth she ear which refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer charm he never so wisely ' 1 4 _ the nameless worm _ a worm as be one of the lowest form of life be constantly use as a term imply contempt but it may be assume that shelley here use ` worm ' in its original sense that of any crawl creature more especially of the snake kind there would thus be no departure from the previous epithet ` viperous ' see the remark as to ` reptile ' st 29 11 5 6 _ the magic tone whose prelude _ & c shelley it will be perceive here figure keat as a minstrel strike the lyre and prepare to sing he strike the lyre in a ` magic tone ' the very ` prelude ' of this be enough to command silent expectation this prelude be the poem of _ endymion _ to which the _ quarterly _ reviewer alone -lrb- accord to shelley -rrb- be insensitive owe to feeling of ` envy hate and wrong ' the prelude be only a induction to the ` song ' -- which be eventually pour forth in the _ lamium _ volume and especially -lrb- as we poet opine -rrb- in _ hyperion _ but now keat 's hand be cold in death and he lyre unstrung as i have already observe -- see p 35 & c -- shelley be mistake in suppose that the _ quarterly review _ have hold a monopoly of ` envy hate and wrong ' -- or as one might now term they detraction spite and unfairness -- in reference to keat + stanza 37 + 1 4 _ but be thyself and know thyself to be _ the precise import of this line be not i think entirely plain at first sight i conceive that we should take the line as immediately consequent upon the precede word -- ` live thou live ' premise this one might amplify the idea as follow ` while keat be dead be it thy doom thou he deaf and viperous murderer to live but thou shalt live in thine own degraded identity and shalt thyself be conscious how degraded thou art ' another suggestion might be that the word ` but be thyself be equivalent to ` be but thyself ' 11 5 6 _ and ever at thy season be thou free to spill the venom when thy fang o'erflow _ this keep up the image of the ` viperous ' murderer -- the viper ` at thy season ' can be understand as a reference to the periodical issue of the _ quarterly review _ the word ` o'erflow ' be in the pisan edition print as two word -- ` o'er flow ' 1 7 _ remorse and self-contempt _ shelley frequently dwell upon self-contempt as one of the least tolerable of human distress thus in the _ revolt of islam _ -lrb- canto 8 st 20 -rrb- : ` yes it be hate -- that shapeless fiendly thing of many name all evil some divine -- whom self-contempt arm with a mortal sting ' & c and in _ prometheus unbound _ -lrb- act i -rrb- -- ` regard this earth make multitudinous with thy slave whom thou requitest for knee-worship prayer and praise and toil and hecatomb of broken heart with fear and self-contempt and barren hope ' again -lrb- act ii sc 4 -rrb- -- ` and self-contempt bitterer to drink than blood ' + stanza 38 + 1 1 _ nor let we weep _ & c so far as the broad current of sentiment be concern this be the turning-point of shelley 's elegy hitherto the tone have be continuously and through a variety of phase one of mourning for the fact that keat the great poetical genius be untimely dead but now the writer pause check himself and recognize that mourning be not the only possible feeling nor indeed the most appropriate one as he thought expand and he rapture rise he soon acknowledge that so far from grieve for keat who _ be _ dead it be far more relevant to grieve for himself who be _ not _ dead this paean of recantation and aspiration occupy the remainder of the poem 1 2 _ these carrion kite _ a term of disparagement corresponding nearly enough to the ` raven ' and ` vulture ' of st 28 1 3 _ he wake or sleep with the endure dead _ with such of the dead as have do something which survive themselves it will be observe that the phrase ` he wake _ or _ sleep ' leave the question of personal or individual immortality quite open as to this point see the remark on p 54 & c 1 4 thou canst not soar where he be sit now this be again address to the ` deaf and viperous murderer ' regard for the moment as a ` carrion kite ' as kite be eminently high flyer the phrase here use become the more emphatic this line of shelley 's be obviously adapt from a passage in milton 's _ paradise lose _ where satan address the angel in eden -lrb- book 4 -rrb- -- ` ye know I once no mate for you there sit where ye durst not soar ' 1 5 _ the pure spirit shall flow _ & c the spirit which once be the vital or mental essence -- the soul -- of adonai come from the eternal soul and now that he be dead be re-absorb into the eternal soul : as such it be imperishable 1 9 _ whilst thy cold ember choke _ & c the spirit of adonai come as a flame from the ` burning fountain ' of the eternal and have now revert thither he be one of the ` enduring dead ' but the ` deaf and viperous murderer ' must not hope for a like destiny he spirit after death will be merely like ` cold ember ' cumber the ` hearth of shame ' as a rhetorical antithesis this serve its purpose well : no doubt shelley would not have pretend that it be a strictly reason antithesis as well or furnish a full account of the _ post-mortem _ fate of the _ quarterly _ reviewer + stanza 39 + 11 1 2 _ peace peace he be not dead he doth not sleep he have awaken from the dream of life _ shelley now proceed boldly to declare that the state which we call death be to be prefer to that which we call life keat be neither dead nor sleep he use to be asleep perturb and tantalize by the dream which be term life have at last awaken from the dream he be no longer asleep : and if life be no more than a dream neither do the cessation of life deserve to be name death the transition from one emotion to another in this passage and also in the precede stanza ` nor let we weep ' & c resemble the transition towards the close of _ lycida _ -- ` weep no more woful shepherd weep no more for lycida you sorrow be not dead ' & c the general view have considerable affinity to that which be expound in a portion of plato 's dialogue _ phaedo _ and which have be thus summarise ` death be merely the separation of soul and body and this be the very consummation at which philosophy aim : the body hinder think -- the mind attain to truth by retire into herself through no bodily sense do she perceive justice beauty goodness and other idea the philosopher have a lifelong quarrel with bodily desire and he should welcome the release of he soul ' 1 3 _ ` tis we who lose in stormy vision _ & c we the so-called living be in fact merely beset by a series of stormy vision which constitute life all we effort be expend upon mere phantom and be therefore profitless we mental conflict be a act of trance exercise upon mere nothing the very energetic expression ` strike with we spirit 's knife invulnerable nothing ' be worthy of remark it will be remember that accord to shelley 's belief ` nothing exist but as it be perceive ' : see p 56 the view of life express with passionate force in this passage of _ adonai _ be the same which form the calm and placid conclusion of _ the sensitive plant _ a poem write in 1820 -- ` but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing be but all thing seem and we the shadow of the dream it be a modest creed and yet pleasant if one consider it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery that garden sweet that lady fair and all sweet shape and odour there in truth have never pass away : ` tis we ` tis ours be change not they for love and beauty and delight there be no death nor change they might exceed we organ which endure no light be themselves obscure ' 11 6 7 _ we decay like corpse in a charnel _ & c human life consist of a process of decay while live we be consume by fear and grief we disappointed hope swarm in we live person like worm in we corpse + stanza 40 + 1 1 _ he have outsoar the shadow of we night _ as human life be in the last stanza represent as a dream so the state of existence in which it be enact be here figure as night 1 5 _ from the contagion of the world 's slow stain _ it may be say that ` the world 's slow stain ' -- the lower influence of the aim and association of all ordinary human life -- be the main subject-matter of shelley 's latest important poem _ the triumph of life _ 1 9 _ with sparkless ash _ see the cognate expression ` thy cold ember ' in st 38 + stanza 41 + 1 1 _ he live he wake -- ` tis death be dead not he _ in the precede three stanza adonai be contemplate as be alive owe to the very fact that he death have awaken he ` from the dream of life ' -- mundane life death have bestow upon he a vitality superior to that of mundane life death therefore have perform a act contrary to he own essence as death and have practically kill not adonais but himself 1 2 _ thou young dawn _ we here recur to the image in st 14 ` morning seek she eastern watch-tower ' & c 1 5 _ ye cavern and ye forest _ & c the poet now adjure the cavern forest flower fountain and air to ` cease to moan ' of the flower we have hear in st 16 : but the other feature of nature which be now address have not previously be individually mention -- except to some extent by implication in st 15 which refer more directly to ` echo ' the reference to the air have also be in a certain degree prepare for in stanza 23 the star be say to smile on the earth 's despair this do not i apprehend indicate any despair of the earth consequent on the death of adonai but a general condition of woe a reference of a different kind to star -- a figurative reference -- appear in st 29 + stanza 42 + 1 1 _ he be make one with nature _ this stanza ascribe to keat the same phase of immortality which belong to nature have ` awaken from the dream of -lrb- mundane -rrb- life ' he spirit form a integral portion of the universe those act of intellect which he perform in the flesh remain with we as thunder and the song of the nightingale remain with we 11 6 7 _ where'er that power may move which have withdraw he be to its own _ this correspond to the expression in st 38 -- ` the pure spirit shall flow back to the burning fountain whence it come a portion of the eternal ' 1 8 _ who wield the world with never wearied love _ & c these two line be about the nearest approach to definite theism to be find in any writing of shelley the conception which may amount to theism be equally consistent with pantheism even in he most anti-theistic poem _ queen mab _ shelley say in a note -- ` the hypothesis of a pervade spirit co-eternal with the universe remain unshaken ' + stanza 43 + 11 1-3 _ he be a portion of the loveliness which one he make more lovely he doth bear he part _ & c the conception embody in this passage may become more clear to the reader if its term be ponder in connexion with the passage of shelley 's prose extract on p 56 -- ` the existence of distinct individual mind ' & c keat while a living man have make the loveliness of the universe more lovely by express in poetry he acute and subtle sense of its beauty -- by lavish on it -lrb- as we say -rrb- ` the color of he imagination ' he be then a ` individual mind ' -- accord to the current but -lrb- as shelley hold -rrb- inexact terminology he have now by death wholly pass out of the class of individual mind and he form a portion of the universal mind -lrb- the ` one spirit ' -rrb- which be the animation of the universe 11 3 4 _ while the one spirit 's plastic stress sweep through the dull dense world _ & c the function ascribe in these line to the one spirit be a formative or animating function : the spirit constitute the life of ` tree and beast and man ' this view be strictly within the limit of pantheism + stanza 44 + 1 1 _ the splendor of the firmament of time _ & c as there be star in the firmament of heaven so be there splendor -- luminous intellect -- in the firmament of time the star though at time eclipse be not extinguish nor yet the mental luminary this asseveration may be consider in connexion with the passage in st 5 : ` other more sublime strike by the envious wrath of man or god have sink extinct in they refulgent prime ' 11 5 6 _ when lofty thought lift a young heart _ & c the sense of this passage may be paraphrase thus : -- when lofty thought lift a young heart above its mundane environment and when its earthly doom have to be determine by the conflict influence of love which would elevate it and the meaner care and interest of life which would drag it downward then the illustrious dead live again in that heart -- for its higher emotion be nurture by they noble thought and aspiration -- and they move like exhalation of light along dark and stormy air this illustrate the previous proposition that the splendor of the firmament of time be not extinguish and in the most immediate application of the proposition keat be not extinguish -- he will continue a ennobling influence upon mind struggle towards the light + stanza 45 + 1 2 _ the inheritor of unfulfilled renown rise from they throne _ there be a grand abruptness in this phrase which make it -- as a point of poetical or literary structure -- one of the finest thing in the elegy we be to understand -lrb- but shelley be too great a master to formulate it in word -rrb- that keat as a ` inheritor of unfulfilled renown ' -- ie a great intellect cut off by death before its maturest fruit could be produce -- have now arrive among he compeer : they rise from they throne to welcome he in this connexion shelley choose to regard keat as still a living spiritual personality -- not simply as ` make one with nature ' he be one of those ` splendor of the firmament of time ' who ` may be eclipse but be extinguish not ' 11 3-5 _ chatterton rise pale he solemn agony have not yet fade from he _ for precocity and exceptional turn of genius chatterton be certainly one of the most extraordinary of ` the inheritor of unfulfilled renown ' indeed the most extraordinary : he commit suicide by poison in 1770 before complete the eighteenth year of he age he supposititious modern-antique _ poem of rowley _ may as actual achievement have be sometimes overpraise : but at the lowest estimate they have beauty and excellence of the most startling kind he write besides a quantity of verse and prose of a totally different order keat admire chatterton profoundly and dedicate _ endymion _ to he memory i can not find that shelley except in _ adonai _ have leave any remark upon chatterton : but he be say by captain medwin to have be in early youth very much impress by he writings 1 5 _ sidney as he fight _ & c sir philip sidney author of _ the countess of pembroke 's arcadium _ the _ apology for poetry _ and the sonnet name _ astrophel and stellum _ die in he thirty-second year of a wound receive in the battle of zutphen 1586 shelley intimate that sidney maintain the character of be ` sublimely mild ' in fight fall -lrb- die -rrb- and loving as well as generally in live the special reference appear to be these -lrb- 1 -rrb- sidney observe that the lord marshal the earl of leicester have enter the field of zutphen without greave throw off he own and thus expose himself to the cannon-shot which slew he -lrb- 2 -rrb- be mortally wound and receive a cup of water he hand it -lrb- accord to a tradition which be not unquestionable -rrb- to a die soldier -lrb- 3 -rrb- he series of sonnet record he love for penelope devereux sister to the earl of essex who marry lord rich she have at one time be promise to sidney he write the sonnet towards 1581 : in 1583 he marry another lady daughter of sir franci walsingham it have be say that shelley be wont to make some self-parade in connexion with sir philip sidney give it to be understand that he be himself a descendant of the hero -- which be not true although the sidney blood come into a different line of the family of this story i have not find any tangible confirmation 1 8 _ lucan by he death approve _ lucan the author of the _ pharsalium _ be condemn under nero as be a accomplice in the conspiracy of piso : he cause he vein to be open and die magnanimously aged about twenty-six ad 65 shelley in one instance go so far as to pronounce lucan superior to vergil + stanza 46 + 11 1 2 _ and many more whose name on earth be dark but whose transmitted effluence can not die _ & c this glorious company would include no doubt not only the recorder of great thought or performer of great deed which be still bear in memory although the name of the author be forget but also many whose work be as totally unknown as they name but who exert nevertheless a bright and elevate ascendant over other mind and who thus conduce to the greatness of human-kind 1 6 _ it be for thee _ & c the synod of the inheritor of unfulfilled renown here invite keat to assume possession of a sphere or constellation which have hitherto be ` kingless ' or unappropriated it have ` swing blind in unascended majesty ' : have not be assign to any radiant spirit whose brightness would impart brilliancy to the sphere itself 1 8 _ silent alone amid a heaven of song _ this phrase point primarily to ` the music of the sphere ' : the sphere now assign to keat have hitherto fail to take part in the music of its fellow but henceforward will chime in probably there be also a subsidiary but in its context not less prominent meaning -- namely that while the several poet -lrb- such as chatterton sidney and lucan -rrb- have each a vocal sphere of he own apposite to he particular poetic quality the sphere which keat be now to control have hitherto remain unoccupied because no poet of that special type of genius which it demand have as yet appear its affinity be for keat and for no one else this be a implied attestation of keat 's poetic originality 1 9 _ assume thy wingd throne thou vesper of we throng _ the wingd throne be i think a synonym of the ` sphere ' itself -- not a throne within the sphere : ` wingd ' because the sphere revolve in space yet the statement in stanza 45 that ` the inheritor of unfulfilled renown rise from they throne ' -lrb- which can not be take to represent distinct sphere or constellation -rrb- suggest the opposite interpretation keat be term ` thou vesper of we throng ' because he be the latest member of this glorified band -- or reckon the lapse of age as if they be but a day its ` evening star ' the exceptional brilliancy of the vesper star be not i think imply -- though it may be remotely suggest + stanza 47 + 1 3 _ clasp with thy panting soul _ & c the significance of this stanza -- perhaps a rather obscure one -- require to be estimate as a whole shelley summons any person who persist in mourn for adonai to realize to he own mind what be the true term of comparison between adonai and himself after this he say in this stanza no more about adonai but only about the mourner he call upon the mourner to consider -lrb- 1 -rrb- the magnitude of the planet earth then use the earth as he center to consider -lrb- 2 -rrb- the whole universe of world and the illimitable void of space beyond all world next he be to consider -lrb- 3 -rrb- what he himself be -- he be confine within the day and night of we planet and even within those restricted limit he be but a infinitesimal point after he shall have realize this to himself and after the tension of he soul in range through the universe and through space shall have kindle hope after hope wonderment and aspiration after aspiration and wonderment then indeed will he need to keep he heart light lest it make he sink at the contemplation of he own nullity 1 9 _ and lure thee to the brink _ this phrase be not definitely account for in the precede exposition i think shelley mean that the successive hope kindle in the mourner by the idea of a boundless universe of space and of spirit will have lure he to the very brink of mundane life -- to the borderland between life and death : he will almost have be tempt to have do with life and to explore the possibility of death + stanza 48 + 1 1 _ or go to rome _ this be still address to the mourner the ` fond wretch ' of the precede stanza he be here invite to adopt a different test for ` know himself and adonais aright ' namely he be to visit rome and muse over the grave of the youthful poet 11 1 2 _ which be the sepulchre oh not of he but of we joy _ keat be not entomb in rome : he poor mortal remains be there entomb and along with they the joy which we feel in he as a living and breathing presence 11 2 3 _ ` tis nought that age empire and religion & c _ keat and other such as he derive no adventitious honor from be bury in rome amid the wreck of age empire and religion : rather they confer honor he be among he peer the king of thought who so far from be drag down in the ruin of institution contend against that ruin and be alone immortal while all the rest of the past have come to nought this consideration may be say to qualify but not to reverse that which be present in stanza 7 that keat ` buy with price of purest breath a grave among the eternal ' those eternal one bury in rome include many of the ` king of thought ' + stanza 46 + 11 3 4 _ and where its wreck like shatter mountain rise and flowering weed _ & c these expression point more especially but not exclusively to the coliseum and the bath of caracallum in shelley 's time -lrb- and something alike be the case in 1862 the year when the present writer see they first -rrb- both these vast monument be in a state wholly different from that which they now under the hand of learn archaeologist and skilled restorer present to the eye shelley begin probably in 1819 a romantic or ideal tale name _ the coliseum _ and ensconce amid the ruin of the bath of caracallum he compose in the same year a large part of _ promethen unbound _ a few extract from he letter may here be give appropriately -lrb- to tl peacock 22 December 18i8 -rrb- ` the coliseum be unlike any work of human hand i ever see before it be of enormous height and circuit and the arch build of massy stone be pile on one another and jut into the blue air shatter into the form of overhang rock it have be change by time into the image of a amphitheatre of rocky hill overgrow by the wild olive the myrtle and the figtree and thread by little path which wind among its ruin stair and immeasurable gallery : the copsewood overshadow you as you wander through its labyrinth ' -- -lrb- to the same 23 march 1819 -rrb- ` the next most considerable relic of antiquity consider as a ruin be the therma of caracallum these consist of six enormous chamber above 200 foot in height and each enclose a vast space like that of a field there be in addition a number of tower and labyrinthine recess hide and weave over by the wild growth of weed and ivy never be any desolation so sublime and lovely at every step the arial pinnacle of shatter stone group into new combination of effect and tower above the lofty yet level wall as the distant mountain change they aspect to one travel rapidly along the plain around rise other crag and other peak -- all array and the deformity of they vast desolation soften down by the undecaying investiture of nature ' 1 7 _ a slope of green access _ the old protestant cemetery shelley describe it thus in he letter to mr peacock of 22 December 1818 ` the english burying-place be a green slope near the wall under the pyramidal tomb of cestius and be i think the most beautiful and solemn cemetery i ever behold to see the sun shine on its bright grass fresh when we visit it with the autumnal dew and hear the whispering of the wind among the leaf of the tree which have overgrow the tomb of cestius and the soil which be stir in the sun-warm earth and to mark the tomb mostly of woman and young people who be bury there one might if one be to die desire the sleep they seem to sleep such be the human mind and so it people with its wish vacancy and oblivion ' -- see also pp 69 70 + stanza 50 + 1 3 _ one keen pyramid _ the tomb -lrb- see last note -rrb- of caius cestius a tribune of the people 11 4 5 _ the dust of he who plan this refuge for he memory _ shelley probably mean that this sepulchral pyramid alone preserve to remembrance the name of cestius : which be true enough as next to nothing be otherwise know about he 1 8 _ have pitch in heaven 's smile they camp of death _ the practice which shelley follow in this line of make ` heaven ' a dissyllable be very frequent with he so also with ` even higher ' and other such word + stanza 51 + 11 3 4 _ if the seal be set here on one fountain of a mourning mind _ shelley certainly allude to himself in this line he beloved son william who die in June 1819 in the fourth year of he age be bury in this cemetery : the precise spot be not now know 11 5-7 _ too surely shalt thou find thine own well full if thou returnest home of tear and gall from the world 's bitter wind _ & c the apposition between the word ` well ' and the precede word ` fountain ' will be observe the person whom shelley address would on return home from the cemetery find more than ample cause of one sort or another for distress and discomposure hence follow the conclusion that he would do well to ` seek shelter in the shadow of the tomb ' : he should prefer the condition of death to that of life and so we reach in stanza 51 the same result which in stanza 47 be deduce from a different range of consideration + stanza 52 + 1 1 _ the one remain the many change and pass _ see the note on stanza 42 and 43 ` the one ' be the same as ` the one spirit ' in stanza 43 -- the universal mind the universal mind have already be speak of -lrb- stanza 38 -rrb- as ` the eternal ' on the other hand ` the many ' be the individuated mind which we call ` human being ' : they ` change and pass ' -- the body perish the mind which inform it be -lrb- in whatever sense -rrb- reabsorb into ` the eternal ' 1 2 _ heaven 's light for ever shine earth 's shadow fly _ this be in strictness a physical descriptive image : in application it mean the same as the precede line 11 3-5 _ life like a dome of many-coloured glass stain the white radiance of eternity until death trample it to fragment _ perhaps a more daring metaphorical symbol than this have never be employ by any poet nor one that have a deeper or a more spacious meaning eternity be figure as white light -- light in its quintessence life mundane life be as a dome of glass which become many-coloured by its prismatic diffraction of the white light : its various prism reflect eternity at different angle death ultimately trample the glass dome into fragment each individual life be shatter and the whole integer of life constitute of the many individual life be shatter if everything else write by shelley be to perish and only this consummate image to remain -- so vast in purport so terse in form -- he would still rank as a poet of lofty imagination _ ex pede herculem _ 11 5 6 _ die if thou wouldst be with that which thou dost seek _ this phrase be address by the poet to anybody and more especially to himself as in stanza 38 -- ` the pure spirit shall flow back to the burning fountain whence it come a portion of the eternal ' 11 7-9 _ rome 's azure sky flower ruin statue music word be weak the glory thy transfuse with fitting truth to speak _ i follow here the punctuation of the pisan edition -- with a comma after ` word ' as well as after ` sky flower ' & c accord to this punctuation the word of rome as well as she sky and other beautiful endowment be too weak to declare at full the glory which they impart and the inference from this rather abruptly introduce recurrence to rome be -lrb- i suppose -rrb- that the spiritual glory faintly adumbrate by rome can only be realize in that realm of eternity to which death give access take in this sense the ` word ' of rome appear to mean ` the beautiful language speak in rome ' -- the roman or latin language as modify into modern italian the pronunciation of italian in rome be count peculiarly pure and rich : hence the italian axiom ` lingua toscana in bocca romana ' -- tuscan tongue in roman mouth at first sight it would seem far more natural to punctuate thus : rome 's azure sky flower ruin statue music -- word be weak the glory & c the sense would then be -- word be too weak to declare at full the glory inherent in the sky flower & c of rome yet although this seem a more straightforward arrangement for the word of the sentence as such it be not clear that such a comment on the beauty of rome would have any great relevancy in its immediate context + stanza 53 + 1 2 _ thy hope be go before _ & c this stanza contain some very pointed reference to the state of shelley 's feeling at the time when he be write _ adonai _ point but not so clearly define as to make he actual meaning transparent we be tell that he hope be go before -lrb- ie have vanish before the close of he life have come -rrb- and have depart from all thing here this may partly refer to the death of william shelley and of keat but i think the purport of the phrase extend further and imply that shelley 's hope generally -- those animate conception which have inspire he in early youth and have buoy he up through many adversity -- be now wane in disappointment this be confirm by the ensue statement -- that ' a light be past from the revolving year -lrb- a phrase repeat from stanza 18 -rrb- and man and woman ' next we be tell that ` what still be dear attract to crush repel to make thee -lrb- I -rrb- wither ' the _ person _ who be more particularly dear to shelley at this time must have be -lrb- not to mention the two child percy florence shelley and allegra clairmont -rrb- he wife miss clairmont emilium vivianus and lieutenant and mr william : byron leigh hunt and godwin can hardly be in question no doubt shelley 's acute feeling and mobile sympathy involve he in some considerable agitation from time to time with all the four lady here name : but the strong expression which he use as to attract and repel crush and wither seem hardly likely to have be employ by he in this personal sense in a publish book perhaps therefore we shall be safest in suppose that he allude not to _ person _ who be dear but to circumstance and condition of a more general kind -- such as be involve in he self-portraiture stanza 31-34 1 8 _ ` tis adonais call oh hasten thither _ ` thither ' must mean ` to adonai ' : a laxity of expression + stanza 64 + 1 1 _ that light whose smile kindle the universe _ & c this be again the ` one spirit ' of stanza 43 and see in stanza 42 the cognate expression ` kindle it above ' 11 3 4 _ that benediction which the eclipse curse of birth can quench not _ the curse of birth be i think simply the calamitous condition of mundane life -- so often refer to in this elegy as a condition of abjection and unhappiness the curse of birth can eclipse the benediction of universal mind but can not quench it : in other word the human mind in its passage from the birth to the death of the body be still a integral portion of the universal mind 1 7 _ each be mirror _ this be of course a grammatical irregularity -- the verb should be ` be ' it be not the only instance of the same kind in shelley 's poetry 1 9 _ consume the last cloud of cold mortality _ this do not imply that shelley be shortly about to die ` cold mortality ' be that condition in which the human mind a portion of the universal mind be unite to a mortal body : and the general sense be that the universal mind at this moment beam with such effulgence upon shelley that he mind respond to it as if the mortal body no longer interpose any impediment + stanza 55 + 1 1 _ the breath whose might i have invoke in song _ the breath or afflatus of the universal mind it have be ` invoke in song ' throughout the whole later section of this elegy from stanza 38 onward 1 2 _ my spirit bark be drive _ & c as be observe with reference to the precede stanza line 9 this phrase do not forecast the author 's death : it only re-emphasise the abnormal illumination of he mind by the universal mind -- as if he spirit -lrb- like that of keat -rrb- ` have flow back to the burning fountain whence it come a portion of the eternal ' -lrb- stanza 38 -rrb- nevertheless it be very remarkable that this image of ` the spirit 's _ bark _ ' beacon by ` the soul of adonai ' should have be write so soon before shelley 's death by drown which occur on 8 July 1822 -- but little more than a year after he have complete this elegy besides this passage there be in shelley 's writings both verse and prose several other passage noticeable on the same account -- relate to drown and sometimes with a strong personal application and in various instance he be in imminent danger of this mode of death before the end come 11 3 4 _ far from the shore far from the tremble throng whose sail be never to the tempest give _ in say that he spirit 's bark be drive far from the shore shelley apparently mean that he mind in speculation and aspiration range far beyond those mundane and material interest with which the mass of man be ordinarily concerned ` the tremble throng ' be i think a throng of man : though it might be a throng of bark contrast with ` my spirit 's bark ' they sail ` be never to the tempest give ' in the sense that they never set forth on a bold ideal or spiritual adventure abandon themselves to the stress and sway of a spiritual storm 1 5 _ the massy earth _ & c as the poet launch forth on he voyage upon the ocean of mind the earth behind he seem to gape and the sky above he to open : he course however be still hold on in darkness -- the arcanum be hardly or not at all reveal 1 7 _ whilst burn through the inmost veil _ & c a star pilot he course : it be the soul of adonai which be still ' a portion of the eternal ' -lrb- st 38 -rrb- be in ` the abode where the eternal be ' and testify to the eternity of mind in this passage and in other towards the conclusion of the poem we find the nearest approach which shelley can furnish to a answer to that question which he ask in stanza 20 -- ` shall that alone which know be as a sword consume before the sheath by sightless lightning ' + stanza 4 to 6 + -- -lrb- i add here a note out of its due place which would be on p 101 : at the time when it occur to I to raise this point the printing have go too far to allow of my insert the remark there -rrb- -- on consider these three stanza collectively it may perhaps be feel that the reference to milton and to keat be more advisedly interdependent than my note on the detail of the stanza suggest shelley may have wish to indicate a certain affinity between the inspiration of milton as the poet of _ paradise lose _ and that of keat as the poet of _ hyperion _ uranium have have to bewail the death of milton who die old when ` the priest the slave and the liberticide ' outraged england now she have to bewail the death of she latest-born keat who have die young and -lrb- as shelley thought -rrb- in a similarly disastrous condition of the national affair have he not be ` strike by the envious wrath of man ' he might even have ` dare to climb ' to the ` bright station ' occupy by milton -- the phrase in st 4 ` most musical of mourner weep again ' with what follow regard grief for the loss of milton and again of keat be model upon the passage in moschus -lrb- p 65 -rrb- -- ` this o most musical of river be thy second sorrow -- this mele thy new woe of old didst thou love homer : now again another son thou weepest ' my remark upon st 13 that there shelley first have direct recourse to the elegy of moschus should be modify accordingly _ cancel passage of adonai preface _ these be take from dr garnett 's _ relic of shelley _ publish in 1862 he say : ` among shelley 's mss be a fair copy of the _ defense of poetry _ apparently damage by sea-water and illegible in many place be prepare for the printer it be write on one side of the paper only : on the blank page but frequently undecipherable for the reason just indicate be many passage intend for but eventually omit from the preface to _ adonais _ ' _ i have employ my poetical composition and publication simply as the instrument of that sympathy between myself and other which the ardent and unbounded love i cherish for my kind incite I to acquire _ this be a important indication of the spirit in which shelley write and consequently of that in which he reader should construe he writings he pour out he full heart craving for ` sympathy ' loving mankind he wish to find some love in response _ domestic conspiracy and legal oppression _ & c the direct reference here be to the action take by shelley 's father-in-law and sister-in-law mr and miss westbrook which result in the decree of lord chancellor eldon whereby shelley be deprive of the custody of the two child of he first marriage see p 12 _ as a bankrupt thief turn thief-taker in despair so a unsuccessful author turn critic _ various writer have say something of this kind i be not sure how far back the sentiment can be trace but i presume that shelley be not the first some reader will remember a passage in the dedication to he _ peter bell the third _ -lrb- 1819 -rrb- which forestall macaulay 's famous phrase about the ` new zealander on the ruin of london bridge ' shelley write : ` in the firm expectation that when london shall be a habitation of bittern when the pier of waterloo bridge shall become the nucleus of islet of reed and osier and cast the jagged shadow of they broken arch on the solitary stream some transatlantic commentator will be weigh in the scale of some new and unimagined system of criticism the respective merit of the bell and the fudge and they historian i remain ' & c _ the offence of this poor victim seem to have consist solely in he intimacy with leigh hunt _ & c see the remark on p 45 there can be no doubt that shelley be substantially correct in this opinion not only the _ quarterly review _ of which he know but also _ blackwood 's magazine _ which do not come under he notice abuse keat because he be personally acquaint with hunt and be in one degree or another a member of the literary coterie in which hunt hold a foremost place and hunt be in bad odour with these review because he be a hostile politician still more than because of any actual or assumed defect in he performance as a ordinary man of letter _ mr hazlitt _ william hazlitt be -lrb- it need scarcely be say -rrb- a miscellaneous writer of much influence in these year in politics a advanced liberal a selection of he writings be issue by mr william ireland in 1889 keat admire hazlitt much more than hunt _ i write to he suggest the propriety _ & c see pp 14 15 _ cancel passage of adonais _ -lrb- the poem -rrb- these passage also be in the first instance publish in the _ shelley relic _ of dr garnett they come not from the same m which contain the prefatory fragment but from some of shelley 's notebook + stanza 1 + 1 1 _ and the green paradise _ & c the green paradise be the 'em erald isle ' -- ireland this stanza refer to thoma moore and would have follow on after st 30 in the body of the poem + stanza 2 + 1 1 _ and ever as he go he sweep a lyre of unaccustomed shape _ ` he ' have always hitherto i think be understand as the ` one frail form ' of st 31 -- ie shelley himself the lyre might be of unaccustomed shape for the purpose of indicate that shelley 's poetry differ very essentially in tone and treatment from that of other writer but i incline to think that shelley in this stanza refer not to himself but to moore moore be term a ` lyrist ' and here we be tell about he lyre the latter would naturally be the irish harp and therefore ` of unaccustomed shape ' : the conclude reference to ` ever-during green ' might again glance at the 'em erald isle ' as to shelley he be state in st 33 to be carry ' a light spear ' : if he be constantly sweep a lyre as well he must have have he hand rather full 1 3 _ now like the of impetuous fire _ & c shelley compare the strain of the lyre -- the spirit of the poetry -- to two thing : -lrb- 1 -rrb- to a conflagration in a forest and -lrb- 2 -rrb- to the rustling of wind among the tree the former image may be understand to apply principally to the revolutionary audacity and fervor of the idea express the latter to those quality of imagination fantasy beauty and melody which characterise the verse of course all this would be more genuinely appropriate to shelley himself than to moore : still it would admit of _ some _ application to moore of whom we poet speak highly more than once elsewhere the image of a forest on fire be more fully express in a passage from the _ line write among the euganean hill _ compose by he in 1818 : -- ` now new fire from antique light spring beneath the wide world 's might -- but they spark lie dead in thee -lrb- ie in padua -rrb- trample out by tyranny as the norway woodman quell in the depths of piny dell one light flame among the brake while the boundless forest shake and its mighty trunk be tear by the fire thus lowly bear -- the spark beneath he foot be dead he start to see the flame it feed howl through the darkened sky with a myriad tongue victoriously and sink down in fear-so thou o tyranny beholdest now light around thee and thou hearest the loud flame ascend and fearest grovel on the earth ay hide in the dust thy purple pride ' + stanza 3 + 1 1 _ and then come one of sweet and earnest look _ it be sufficiently clear that this stanza and also the fragmentary beginning of stanza 4 refer to leigh hunt -- who in the body of the elegy be introduce in st 35 the reader will observe on look back to that stanza that the present one could not be add on to the description of hunt : it be a alternative form ultimately reject its tone be ultra-sentimental and perhaps on that account it be condemn the simile at the close of the present stanza be ambitious but by no means felicitous + stanza 4 + 11 1 2 _ he song though very sweet be low and faint a simple strain _ it may be doubt whether this description of hunt 's poetry have it be publish in _ adonai _ would have be wholly please to hunt neither do it define with any exceptional aptness the particular calibre of that poetry + stanza 5 + 11 1 2 _ a mighty phantasm half conceal in darkness of he own exceed light _ it seem to have be generally assume that shelley in this stanza describe one more of the ` mountain shepherd ' -lrb- see st 30 -rrb- -- viz coleridge no doubt if any poet or person be here indicate it must be coleridge : and the affirmative assumption be so far confirm by the fact that in another poem -- the _ letter to marium gisborne _ 1820 -- shelley speak of coleridge in term partly similar to these : -- ` you will see coleridge he who sit obscure in the exceed lustre and the pure intense irradiation of a mind which with its own internal lightning blind flag wearily through darkness and despair -- a cloud-encircled meteor of the air a hooded eagle among blinking owl ' but the first question be -- do this cancel stanza relate to a mountain shepherd at all to speak of a mountain shepherd as a ` mighty phantasm ' have a ` awful presence unreveal ' seem to be take a considerable liberty with language to I it appear more likely that the stanza relate to some abstract impersonation -- perhaps death or else eternity it be true that death figure elsewhere in _ adonai _ -lrb- stanza 7 8 25 -rrb- under a aspect with which the present phrase be hardly consistent : but in the case of a cancel stanza that count for very little in _ prometheus unbound _ -lrb- act ii sc 4 -rrb- eternity symbolise in demo-gorgon be describe in term not wholly unlike those which we be now debate : -- ' i see a mighty darkness fill the seat of power and ray of gloom dart round as light from the meridian sun ungazed upon and shapeless neither limb nor form nor outline yet we feel it be a living spirit ' as to the phrase in the cancel stanza ` in darkness of he own exceed light ' it need hardly be observe that this be modify from the expression in paradise lose -lrb- book 3 -rrb- : -- ` dark with excessive bright thy skirt appear ' 1 5 _ thunder-smoke whose skirt be chrysolite _ technically chrysolite be synonymous with the precious stone peridot or olivine -- its tint be a yellowish green but probably shelley think only of the primary meaning of the word chrysolite ` golden-stone ' and he phrase as a whole come to much the same thing as ' a cloud with a golden lining ' + stanza 6 + 1 1 _ and like a sudden meteor _ we here have a fragmentary simile which may -- or equally well may not -- follow on as connect with st 5 see on p 147 for whatever it may be worth in illustration the line relate to coleridge : -- ' a cloud-encircled meteor of the air ' 1 5 _ pavilion in its tent of light _ shelley be fond of the word pavilion whether as substantive or as verb see st 50 : ` pavilion the dust of he ' & c footnote : -lrb- 1 -rrb- see the _ life of mr shelley _ by lucy madox rossettus -lrb- _ eminent woman series _ -rrb- publish in 1890

-lrb- 3 -rrb- this line -lrb- should be ' _ beneath _ the good ' & c -rrb- be the final line of gray 's _ progress of poesy _ the sense in which shelley intend to apply it to _ the cencus _ may admit of some doubt he seem to mean that _ the cencus _ be not equal to really good tragedy but still be superior to some tragedy which have recently appear and which bad critic have dub great -lrb- 4 -rrb- this phrase be not very clear to I from the context ensue it might seem that the ` circumstance ' which prevent keat from stay with shelley in pisa be that he nerve be in so irritable a state as to prompt he to move from place to place in italy rather than fix in any particular city or house -lrb- 5 -rrb- though shelley give this advice which be anything but unsound he be say to have take good-naturedly some step with a view to get the volume print mr john dix writing in 1846 say : ` he -lrb- shelley -rrb- go to charle richard the printer in st martin 's lane when quite young about the print a little volume of keat 's first poem ' -lrb- 6 -rrb- this statement be not correct -- so far at least as the longer poem in the volume be concerned _ isabellum _ indeed be finish by April 1818 but _ hyperion _ be not relinquish till late in 1819 and the _ eve of st agne _ and _ lamium _ be probably not even begin till 1819 -lrb- 7 -rrb- see p 96 as to shelley 's under-rating of keat 's age he must have suppose that keat be only about twenty year old at the date when _ endymion _ be complete the correct age be twenty-two -lrb- 8 -rrb- the passage to which shelley refer begin thus : ` and then the forest tell it in a dream ' ` the rosy veil mantle the east ' ` upon a weed rock this old man sit ' -lrb- 9 -rrb- i do not find in shelley 's writings anything which distinctly modify this opinion however he biographer captain medwin aver that shelley value all the poem in keat 's final volume he cite especially _ isabellum _ and _ the eve of st agne _ -lrb- 10 -rrb- in book relate to keat and shelley the name of this gentleman appear repeat without any explanation of who he be in a m diary of dr john polidori byron 's travel physician -lrb- my maternal uncle -rrb- i find the follow account of colonel finch whom polidori meet in milan in 1816 : ` colonel finch a extremely pleasant good-natured well-informed clever gentleman speak italian extremely well and be very well read in italian literature a ward of he give a masquerade in london upon she come of age she give to each a character in the reign of queen elizabeth to support without the knowledge of each other and receive they in a saloon in proper style as queen elizabeth he mention to I that nellus have write a life of galileo extremely fair which if he have money by he he would buy that it might be publish finch be a great admirer of architecture in italy mr werthern a gentleman most peaceable and quiet i ever see accompany finch whose only occupation -lrb- i understand this to mean the occupation of wethern but possibly it mean of finch -rrb- be when he arrive at a town or other place to set about sketch and then color so that he have perhaps the most complete collection of sketch of he tour possible he invite I -lrb- take I for a italian -rrb- in case i go to england to see he and hearing i be english he press I much more ' the name ` werthern ' be not distinctly write : should it be ` wertheim ' -lrb- 11 -rrb- ` envy ' refer no doubt to hostile reviewer ` ingratitude ' refer to a statement of colonel finch that keat have ` be infamously treat by the very person whom he generosity have rescue from want and woe ' it be not quite clear who be the person allude to by finch keat 's brother george -lrb- then in america -rrb- be presumably one : he be however regard as have eventually clear himself from the distressing imputation i know of no one else unless possibly the painter haydon may be glance at : as to he also the charge appear to be too severe and sweeping -lrb- 12 -rrb- shelley write another letter on 16 June -- to miss clairmont then in florence it contain expression to nearly the same purport ' i have receive a most melancholy account of the last illness of poor keat which i will neither tell you nor send you for it would make you too low-spirited my elegy on he be finish i have dip my pen in consuming fire to chastise he destroyer otherwise the tone of the poem be solemn and exalted i send it to the press here and you will soon have a copy ' -lrb- 13 -rrb- as byron be introduce into _ adonai _ as mourning for keat and as in fact he care for keat hardly at all it seem possible that he silence be dictate by antagonism rather than by modesty -lrb- 14 -rrb- _ blackwood _ seem to imply that the _ quarterly _ accuse _ endymion _ of indecency this be not correct -lrb- 15 -rrb- the reader of keat 's preface will find that this be a misrepresentation keat do not speak of any fierce hell of criticism nor do he ask to remain uncriticised in order that he might write more what he say be that a feeling critic would not fall foul of he for hope to write good poetry in the long run and would be aware that keat 's own sense of failure in _ endymion _ be as fierce a hell as he could be chastise by -lrb- 16 -rrb- this passage of the letter have remain unpublished up to 1890 it then appear in mr buxton forman 's volume _ poetry and prose by john keat _ some authentic information as to keat 's change of feeling have however be publish before -lrb- 17 -rrb- this phrase be lumber and not grammatical the word ' i confess that i be unable to refuse ' would be all that the meaning require -lrb- 18 -rrb- this seem to contradict the phrase in _ adonai _ -lrb- stanza 20 -rrb- ` nought we know die ' probably shelley in the prose passage do not intend ` perish ' to be accept in the absolute sense of ` die ' or ` cease to have any existence ' he mean that all thing undergo a process of deterioration and decay lead on to some essential change or transmutation the french have the word would prir ' as well as ` prir ' : shelley 's ` perish ' would correspond to would prit ' end of the project gutenberg ebook of adonai by shelley
