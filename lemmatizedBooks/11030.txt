childhood when i be six year old my mother die and then for the first time i learn by the talk around I that i be a slave my mother 's mistress be the daughter of my grandmother 's mistress she be the foster sister of my mother they be both nourish at my grandmother 's breast in fact my mother have be wean at three month old that the babe of the mistress might obtain sufficient food they play

brief period of suspense the will of my mistress be read and we learn that she have bequeath I to she sister 's daughter a child of five year old so vanish we hope my mistress have teach I the precept of god 's word : thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself whatsoever ye would that man should do unto you do ye even so unto they but i be she slave and i suppose she do not recognize I as she neighbor i would give much to blot out from my memory that one great wrong as a child i love my mistress and look back on the happy day i spend with she i try to think with less bitterness of this act of

house might be decorate for a evening party i spend the day gathering flower and weave they into festoon while the dead body of my father be lie within a mile of I what care my owner for that he be merely a piece of property moreover they think he have spoil he child by teach they to feel that they be human being this be blasphemous doctrine for a slave to teach presumptuous in he and dangerous to the master the next day i follow he remains to a humble grave beside that of my dear mother there be those who know my father 's worth and respected he memory my home now seem more dreary than ever the laugh of the little slave-children sound harsh and cruel it be selfish to feel so about the joy of other my brother move about with a very grave face i try to comfort he by say take courage willie brighter day will come by and by you do not know any thing about it linda he reply we shall have to stay here all we day we shall never be free i argue that we be grow older and stronger and that perhaps we might before long be allow to hire we own time and then we could earn money to buy we freedom william declare this be much easier to say than to do moreover he do not intend to _ buy _ he freedom we hold daily controversy upon this subject little attention be pay to the slave ' meal in dr flint 's house if they could catch a bit of food while it be go well and good i give myself no trouble on that score for on my various errand i pass my grandmother 's house where there be always something to spare for I i be frequently threaten with punishment if i stop there and my grandmother to avoid detain I often stand at the gate with something for my breakfast or dinner i be indebted to _ she _ for all my comfort spiritual or temporal it be _ she _ labor that supply my scanty wardrobe i have a vivid recollection of the linsey-woolsey dress give I every winter by mr flint how i hate it it be one of the badge of slavery while my grandmother be thus help to support I from she hard earnings the three hundred dollar she have lend she mistress be never repay when she mistress die she son-in-law dr flint be appoint executor when grandmother apply to he for payment he say the estate be insolvent and the law prohibit payment it do not however prohibit he from retain the silver candelabrum which have be purchase with that money i presume they will be hand down in the family from generation to generation my grandmother 's mistress have always promise she that at she death she should be free and it be say that in she will she make good the promise but when the estate be settle dr flint tell the faithful old servant that under exist circumstance it be necessary she should be sell on the appoint day the customary advertisement be post up proclaim that there would be a public sale of negro horse & c dr flint call to tell my grandmother that he be unwilling to wind she feeling by put she up at auction and that he would prefer to dispose of she at private sale my grandmother see through he hypocrisy she understand very well that he be ashamed of the job she be a very spirited woman and if he be base enough to sell she when she mistress intend she should be free she be determine the public should know it she have for a long time supply many family with cracker and preserve consequently aunt marthy as she be call be generally know and every body who know she respect she intelligence and good character she long and faithful service in the family be also well know and the intention of she mistress to leave she free when the day of sale come she take she place among the chattel and at the first call she spring upon the auction-block many voice call out shame shame who be go to sell _ you _ aunt marthy do not stand there that be no place for _ you _ without say a word she quietly await she fate no one bid for she at last a feeble voice say fifty dollar it come from a maiden lady seventy year old the sister of my grandmother 's deceased mistress she have live forty year under the same roof with my grandmother she know how faithfully she have serve she owner and how cruelly she have be defraud of she rights and she resolve to protect she the auctioneer wait for a higher bid but she wish be respect no one bid above she she could neither read nor write and when the bill of sale be make out she sign it with a cross but what consequence be that when she have

place of both housekeeper and wait maid to she mistress she be in fact at the beginning and end of every thing mr flint like many southern woman be totally deficient in energy she have not strength to superintend she household affair but she nerve be so strong that she could sit in she easy chair and see a woman whip till the blood trickle from every stroke of the lash she be a member of the church but partaking of the lord 's supper do not seem to put she in a christian frame of mind if dinner be not serve at the exact time on that particular Sunday she would station herself in the kitchen and wait till it be dish and then spit in all the kettle and pan that have be use for cooking she do this to prevent the cook and she child from eke out they meager fare with the remains of the gravy and other scrapings the slave could get nothing to eat except what she choose to give they provision be weigh out by the pound and ounce three time a day i can assure you she give they no chance to eat wheat bread from she flour barrel she know how many biscuit a quart of flour would make and exactly what size they ought to be dr flint be a epicure the cook never send a dinner to he table without fear and tremble for if there happen to be a dish not to he liking he would either order she to be whip or compel she to eat every mouthful of it in he presence the poor hungry creature might not have object to eat it but she do not object to have she master cram it down she throat till she choke they have a pet dog that be a nuisance in the house the cook be order to make some indian mush for he he refuse to eat and when he head be hold over it the froth flow from he mouth into the basin he die a few minute after when dr flint come in he say the mush have not be well cook and that be the reason the animal would not eat it he send for the cook and compel she to eat it he think that the woman 's stomach be stronger than the dog 's but she suffering afterwards prove that he be mistaken this poor woman endure many cruelty from she master and mistress sometimes she be lock up away from she nursing baby for a whole day and night when i have be in the family a few week one of the plantation slave be bring to town by order of he master it be near night when he arrive and dr flint order he to be take to the work house and tie up to the joist so that he foot would just escape the ground in that situation he be to wait till the doctor have take he tea i shall never forget that night never before in my life have i hear hundred of blow fall in succession on a human be he piteous groan and he o pray do not massa ring in my ear for month afterwards there be many conjecture as to the cause of this terrible punishment some say master accuse he of steal corn other say the slave have quarrel with he wife in presence of the overseer and have accuse he master of be the father of she child they be both black and the child be very fair i go into the work house next morning and see the cowhide still wet with blood and the board all cover with gore the poor man live and continue to quarrel with he wife a few month afterwards dr flint hand they both over to a slave-trader the guilty man put they value into he pocket and have the satisfaction of know that they be out of sight and hearing when the mother be deliver into the trader 's hand she say you _ promise _ to treat I well to which he reply you have let you tongue run too far damn you she have forget that it be a crime for a slave to tell who be the father of she child from other than the master persecution also

creature degrade by the system that have brutalize she from childhood but she have a mother 's instinct and be capable of feel a mother 's agony on one of these sale day i see a mother lead seven child to the auction-block she know that _ some _ of they would be take from she but they take _ all _ the child be sell to a slave-trader and they mother be bring by a man in she own town before night she child be all far away she beg the trader to tell she where he intend to take they this he refuse to do how _ could _ he when he know he would sell they one by one wherever he could command the highest price i meet that mother in the street and she wild haggard face live to-day in my mind she wring she hand in anguish and exclaim go all go why _ do not _ god kill I i have no word wherewith to comfort she instance of this kind be of daily yea of hourly occurrence slaveholder have a method peculiar to they institution of get rid of _ old _ slave whose life have be wear out in they service i know a old woman who for seventy year faithfully serve she master she have become almost helpless from hard labor and disease she owner move to alabama and the old black woman be leave to be sell to any body who would give twenty dollar for she iv the slave who dare to feel like a man two year have pass since i enter dr flint 's family and those year have bring much of the knowledge that come from experience though they have afford little opportunity for any other kind of knowledge my grandmother have as much as possible be a mother to she orphan grandchild by perseverance and unwearied industry she be now mistress of a snug little home surround with the necessaries of life she would have be happy could she child have share they with she there remain but three child and two grandchild all slave most earnestly do she strive to make we feel that it be the will of god : that he have see fit to place we under such circumstance and though it seem hard we ought to pray for contentment it be a beautiful faith come from a mother who could not call she child she own but i and benjamin she youngest boy condemn it we reason that it be much more the will of god that we should be situate as she be we long for a home like hers there we always find sweet balsam for we trouble she be so loving so sympathize she always meet we with a smile and listen with patience to all we sorrow she speak so hopefully that unconsciously the cloud give place to sunshine there be a grand big oven there too that baked bread and nice thing for the town and we know there be always a choice bit in store for we but alas even the charm of the old oven fail to reconcile we to we hard lot benjamin be now a tall handsome lad strongly and gracefully make and with a spirit too bold and daring for a slave my brother william now twelve year old have the same aversion to the word master that he have when he be a urchin of seven year i be he confidant he come to I with all he trouble i remember one instance in particular it be on a lovely spring morning and when i mark the sunlight dance here and there its beauty seem to mock my sadness for my master whose restless craving vicious nature rove about day and night seek whom to devour have just leave I with sting scorching word word that scathe ear and brain like fire o how i despise he i think how glad i should be if some day when he walk the earth it would open and swallow he up and disencumber the world of a plague when he tell I that i be make for he use make to obey he command in _ every _ thing that i be nothing but a slave whose will must and should surrender to he never before have my puny arm feel half so strong so deeply be i absorb in painful reflection afterwards that i neither see nor hear the entrance of any one till the voice of william sound close beside I linda say he what make you look so sad i love you o linda be not this a bad world every body seem so cross and unhappy i wish i have die when poor father do i tell he that every body be _ not _ cross or unhappy that those who have pleasant home and kind friend and who be not afraid to love they be happy but we who be slave-child without father or mother could not expect to be happy we must be good perhaps that would bring we contentment yes he say i try to be good but what be the use they be all the time troubling I then he proceed to relate he afternoon 's difficulty with young master nichola it seem that the brother of master nichola have pleased himself with make up story about william master nichola say he should be flog and he would do it whereupon he go to work but william fight bravely and the young master finding he be get the better of he undertake to tie he hand behind he he fail in that likewise by dint of kick and fist william come out of the skirmish none the worse for a few scratch he continue to discourse on he young master 's _ meanness _ how he whip the _ little _ boy but be a perfect coward when a tussle ensue between he and white boy of he own size on such occasion he always take to he leg william have other charge to make against he one be he rub up penny with quicksilver and pass they off for quarter of a dollar on a old man who keep a fruit stall william be often send to buy fruit and he earnestly inquire of I what he ought to do under such circumstance i tell he it be certainly wrong to deceive the old man and that it be he duty to tell he of the imposition practice by he young master i assure he the old man would not be slow to comprehend the whole and there the matter would end william think it might with the old man but not with _ he _ he say he do not mind the smart of the whip but he do not like the _ idea _ of be whip while i advise he to be good and forgiving i be not unconscious of the beam in my own eye it be the very knowledge of my own shortcoming that urge I to retain if possible some spark of my brother 's god-given nature i have not live fourteen year in slavery for nothing i have feel see and hear enough to read the character and question the motive of those around I the war of my life have begin and though one of god 's most powerless creature i resolve never to be conquer alas for I if there be one pure sunny spot for I i believe it to be in benjamin 's heart and in another 's whom i love with all the ardor of a girl 's first love my owner know of it and seek in every way to render I miserable he do not resort to corporal punishment but to all the petty tyrannical way that human ingenuity could devise i remember the first time i be punish it be in the month of February my grandmother have take my old shoe and replace they with a new pair i need they for several inch of snow have fall and it still continue to fall when i walk through mr flint 's room they creaking grate harshly on she refined nerve she call I to she and ask what i have about I that make such a horrid noise i tell she it be my new shoe take they off say she and if you put they on again i 'll throw they into the fire i take they off and my stocking also she then send I a long distance on a errand as i go through the snow my bare foot tingle that night i be very hoarse and i go to bed think the next day would find I sick perhaps dead what be my grief on wake to find myself quite well i have imagine if i die or be lay up for some time that my mistress would feel a twinge of remorse that she have so hate the little imp as she style I it be my ignorance of that mistress that give rise to such extravagant imagining dr flint occasionally have high price offer for I but he always say she do not belong to I she be my daughter 's property and i have no right to sell she good honest man my young mistress be still a child and i could look for no protection from she i love she and she return my affection i once hear she father allude to she attachment to I and he wife promptly reply that it proceed from fear this put unpleasant doubt into my mind do the child feign what she do not feel or be she mother jealous of the mite of love she bestow on I i conclude it must be the latter i say to myself surely little child be true one afternoon i sit at my sewing feeling unusual depression of spirit my mistress have be accuse I of a offence of which i assure she i be perfectly innocent but i see by the contemptuous curl of she lip that she believe i be tell a lie i wonder for what wise purpose god be lead I through such thorny path and whether still darker day be in store for I as i sit muse thus the door open softly and william come in well brother say i what be the matter this time o linda ben and he master have have a dreadful time say he my first thought be that benjamin be kill do not be frightened linda say william i will tell you all about it it appear that benjamin 's master have send for he and he do not immediately obey the summons when he do he master be angry and begin to whip he he resist master and slave fight and finally the master be throw benjamin have cause to tremble for he have throw to the ground he master -- one of the richest man in town i anxiously await the result that night i steal to my grandmother

value it once he be tempt to destroy it but something he do not know what have prevent he perhaps it be fear he have hear those who profess to be religious declare there be no heaven for self-murderer and as he life have be pretty hot here he do not desire a continuation of the same in another world if i die now he exclaim thank god i shall die a freeman he beg my uncle phillip not to return south but stay and work with he till they earn enough to buy those at home he brother tell he it would kill they mother if he desert she in she trouble she have pledge she house and with difficulty have raise money to buy he would he be buy no never he reply do you suppose phil when i have get so far out of they clutch i will give they one red cent no and do you suppose i would turn mother out of she home in she old age that i would let she pay all those hard-earned dollar for I and never to see I for you know she will stay south as long as she other child be slave what a good mother tell she to buy _ you _ phil you have be a comfort to she and i have be a trouble and linda poor linda what 'll become of she phil you do not know what a life they lead she she have tell I something about it and i wish old flint be dead or a better man when i be in jail he ask she if she do not want _ he _ to ask my master to forgive I and take I home again she tell he no that i do not want to go back he get

he have part with nearly all he clothes to pay necessary expense but he do not part with a little pin i fasten in he bosom when we part it be the most valuable thing i own and i think none more worthy to wear it he have it still he brother furnish he with clothes and give he what money he have they part with moistened eye and as benjamin turn away he say phil i part with all my kindred and so it prove we never hear from he again uncle phillip come home and the first word he utter when he enter the house be mother ben be free i have see he in new york she stand look at he with a bewildered air

phillip must sit down and repeat to she every word benjamin have say he tell she all only he forbear to mention how sick and pale she darling look why should he distress she when she could do he no good the brave old woman still toil on hope to rescue some of she other child after a while she succeed in buy phillip she pay eight hundred dollar and come home with the precious document that secure he freedom the happy mother and son sit together by the old hearthstone that night tell how proud they be of each other and how they would prove to the world that they could take care of themselves as they have long take care of other we all conclude by say he that be _ willing _ to be a slave let he be a slave v the trial of girlhood during the first year of my service in dr flint 's family i be accustom to share some indulgence with the child of my mistress though this seem to I no more than right i be grateful for it and try to merit the kindness by the faithful discharge of my duty but i now enter on my fifteenth year -- a sad epoch in the life of a slave girl my master begin to whisper foul word in my ear young as i be i could not remain ignorant of they import i try to treat they with indifference or contempt the master 's age my extreme youth and the fear that he conduct would be report to my grandmother make he bear this treatment for many month he be a crafty man and resort to many means to accomplish he purpose sometimes he have stormy terrific way that make he victim tremble sometimes he assume a gentleness that he think must surely subdue of the two i prefer he stormy mood although they leave I tremble he try he utmost to corrupt the pure principle my grandmother have instil he people my young mind with unclean image such as only a vile monster could think of i turn from he with disgust and hatred but he be my master i be compel to live under the same roof with he -- where i see a man forty year my senior daily violate the most sacred commandment of nature he tell I i be he property that i must be subject to he will in all thing my soul revolt against the mean tyranny but where could i turn for protection no matter whether the slave girl be as black as ebony or as fair as she mistress in either case there be no shadow of law to protect she from insult from violence or even from death all these be inflict by fiend who bear the shape of man the mistress who ought to protect the helpless victim have no other feeling towards she but those of jealousy and rage the degradation the wrong the vice that grow out of slavery be more than i can describe they be greater than you would willingly believe surely if you credit one half the truth that be tell you concern the helpless million suffer in this cruel bondage you at the north would not help to tighten the yoke you surely would refuse to do for the master on you own soil the mean and cruel work which train bloodhound and the lowest class of whites do for he at the south every where the year bring to all enough of sin and sorrow but in slavery the very dawn of life be darken by these shadow even the little child who be accustom to wait on she mistress and she child will learn before she be twelve year old why it be that she mistress hate such and such a one among the slave perhaps the child 's own mother be among those hate one she listen to violent outbreak of jealous passion and can not help understand what be the cause she will become prematurely know in evil thing soon she will learn to tremble when she hear she master 's footfall she will be compel to realize that she be no longer a child if god have bestow beauty upon she it will prove she greatest curse that which command admiration in the white woman only hasten the degradation of the female slave i know that some be too much brutalize by slavery to feel the humiliation of they position but many slave feel it most acutely and shrink from the memory of it i can not tell how much i suffer in the presence of these wrong nor how i be still pained by the retrospect my master meet I at every turn remind I that i belong to he and swearing by heaven and earth that he would compel I to submit to he if i go out for a breath of fresh air after a day of unwearied toil he footstep dog I if i knelt by my mother 's grave he dark shadow fall on I even there the light heart which nature have give I become heavy with sad foreboding the other slave in my master 's house notice the change many of they pity I but none dare to ask the cause they have no need to inquire they know too well the guilty practice under that roof and they be aware that to speak of they be a offence that never go unpunished i long for some one to confide in i would have give the world to have lay my head on my grandmother 's faithful bosom and tell she all my trouble but dr flint swear he would kill I if i be not as silent as the grave then although my grandmother be all in all to I i fear she as well as loved she i have be accustom to look up to she with a respect border upon awe i be very young and feel shamefaced about tell she such impure thing especially as i know she to be very strict on such subject moreover she be a woman of a high spirit she be usually very quiet in she demeanor but if she indignation be once rouse it be not very easily quell i have be tell that she once chase a white gentleman with a loaded pistol because he insult one of she daughter i dread the consequence of a violent outbreak and both pride and fear keep I silent but though i do not confide in my grandmother and even evade she vigilant watchfulness and inquiry she presence in the neighborhood be some protection to I though she have be a slave dr flint be afraid of she he dread she scorching rebuke moreover she be know and patronize by many people and he do not wish to have he villany make public it be lucky for I that i do not live on a distant plantation but in a town not so large that the inhabitant be ignorant of each other 's affair bad as be the law and custom in a slaveholding community the doctor as a professional man deem it prudent to keep up some outward show of decency o what day and night of fear and sorrow that man cause I reader it be not to awaken sympathy for myself that i be tell you truthfully what i suffer in slavery i do it to kindle a flame of compassion in you heart for my sister who be still in bondage suffering as i once suffer i once see two beautiful child play together one be a fair white child the other be she slave and also she sister when i see they embrace each other and hear they joyous laughter i turn sadly away from the lovely sight i foresee the inevitable blight that would fall on the little slave 's heart i know how soon she laughter would be change to sigh the fair child grow up to be a still fairer woman from childhood to womanhood she pathway be bloom with flower and overarch by a sunny sky scarcely one day of she life have be cloud when the sun rise on she happy bridal morning how have those year deal with she slave sister the little playmate of she childhood she also be very beautiful but the flower and sunshine of love be not for she she drink the cup of sin and shame and misery whereof she persecute race be compel to drink in view of these thing why be ye silent ye free man and woman of the north why do you tongue falter in maintenance of the right would that i have more ability but my heart be so full and my pen be so weak there be noble man and woman who plead for we strive to help those who can not help themselves god bless they god give they strength and courage to go on god bless those every where who be labor to advance the cause of humanity vi the jealous mistress i would ten thousand time rather that my child should be the half-starved pauper of ireland than to be the most pampered among the slave of america i would rather drudge out my life on a cotton plantation till the grave open to give I rest than to live with a unprincipled master and a jealous mistress the felon 's home in a penitentiary be preferable he may repent and turn from the error of he way and so find peace but it be not so with a favorite slave she be not allow to have any pride of character it be deem a crime in she to wish to be virtuous mr flint possess the key to she husband 's character before i be bear she might have use this knowledge to counsel and to screen the young and the innocent among she slave but for they she have no sympathy they be the object of she constant suspicion and malevolence she watch she husband with unceasing vigilance but he be well practice in means to evade it what he could not find opportunity to say in word he manifest in sign he invent more than be ever think of in a deaf and dumb asylum i let they pass as if i do not understand what he mean and many be the curse and threat bestow on I for my stupidity one day he catch I teach myself to write he frown as if he be not well pleased but i suppose he come to the conclusion that such a accomplishment might help to advance he favorite scheme before long note be often slip into my hand i would return they say i can not read they sir can not you he reply then i must read they to you he always finish the reading by ask do you understand sometimes he would complain of the heat of the tea room and order he supper to be place on a small table in the piazza he would seat himself there with a well-satisfied smile and tell I to stand by and brush away the fly he would eat very slowly pause between the mouthful these interval be employ in describe the happiness i be so foolishly throw away and in threaten I with the penalty that finally await my stubborn disobedience he boast much of the forbearance he have exercise towards I and remind I that there be a limit to he patience when i succeed in avoid opportunity for he to talk to I at home i be order to come to he office to do some errand when there i be oblige to stand and listen to such language as he see fit to address to I sometimes i so openly express my contempt for he that he would become violently enraged and i wonder why he do not strike I circumstance as he be he probably think it be better policy to be forebearing but the state of thing grow worse and worse daily in desperation i tell he that i must and would apply to my grandmother for protection he threaten I with death and worse than death if i make any complaint to she strange to say i do not despair i be naturally of a buoyant disposition and always i have a hope of somehow get out of he clutch like many a poor simple slave before I i trust that some thread of joy would yet be weave into my dark destiny i have enter my sixteenth year and every day it become more apparent that my presence be intolerable to mr flint angry word frequently pass between she and she husband he have never punish I himself and he would not allow any body else to punish I in that respect she be never satisfied but in she angry mood no term be too vile for she to bestow upon I yet i whom she detest so bitterly have far more pity for she than he have whose duty it be to make she life happy i never wrong she or wish to wrong she and one word of kindness from she would have bring I to she foot after repeat quarrel between the doctor and he wife he announce he intention to take he youngest daughter then four year old to sleep in he apartment it be necessary that a servant should sleep in the same room to be on hand if the child stir i be select for that office and inform for what purpose that arrangement have be make by manage to keep within sight of people as much as possible during the day time i have hitherto succeed in elude my master though a razor be often hold to my throat to force I to change this line of policy at night i sleep by the side of my great aunt where i feel safe he be too prudent to come into she room she be a old woman and have be in the family many year moreover as a married man and a professional man he deem it necessary to save appearance in some degree but he resolve to remove the obstacle in the way of he scheme and he think he have plan it so that he should evade suspicion he be well aware how much i prize my refuge by the side of my old aunt and he determine to dispossess I of it the first night the doctor have the little child in he room alone the next morning i be order to take my station as nurse the follow night a kind providence interpose in my favor during the day mr flint hear of this new arrangement and a storm follow i rejoice to hear it rage after a while my mistress send for I to come to she room she first question be do you know you be to sleep in the doctor 's room yes ma'am who tell you my master will you answer truly all the question i ask yes ma'am tell I then as you hope to be forgive be you innocent of what i have accuse you i be she hand I a bible and say lay you hand on you heart kiss this holy book and swear before god that you tell I the truth i take the oath she require and i do it with a clear conscience you have take god 's holy word to testify you innocence say she if you have deceive I beware now take this stool sit down look I directly in the face and tell I all that have pass between you master and you i do as she order as i go on with my account she color change frequently she weep and sometimes groan she speak in tone so sad that i be touch by she grief the tear come to my eye but i be soon convince that she emotion arise from anger and wound pride she feel that she marriage vow be desecrate she dignity insult but she have no compassion for the poor victim of she husband 's perfidy she pity herself as a martyr but she be incapable of feel for the condition of shame and misery in which she unfortunate helpless slave be place yet perhaps she have some touch of feeling for I for when the conference be end she speak kindly and promise to protect I i should have be much comfort by this assurance if i could have have confidence in it but my experience in slavery have fill I with distrust she be not a very refined woman and have not much control over she passion i be a object of she jealousy and consequently of she hatred and i know i could not expect kindness or confidence from she under the circumstance in which i be place i could not blame she slaveholder ' wife feel as other woman would under similar circumstance the fire of she temper kindle from small-spark and now the flame become so intense that the doctor be oblige to give up he intended arrangement i know i have ignite the torch and i expect to suffer for it afterwards but i feel too thankful to my mistress for the timely aid she render I to care much about that she now take I to sleep in a room adjoining she own there i be a object of she especial care though not to she especial comfort for she spend many a sleepless night to watch over I sometimes i wake up and find she bend over I at other time she whisper in my ear as though it be she husband who be speak to I and listen to hear what i would answer if she startle I on such occasion she would glide stealthily away and the next morning she would tell I i have be talk in my sleep and ask who i be talk to at last i begin to be fearful for my life it have be often threaten and you can imagine better than i can describe what a unpleasant sensation it must produce to wake up in the dead of night and find a jealous woman bend over you terrible as this experience be i have fear that it would give place to one more terrible my mistress grow weary of she vigil they do not prove satisfactory she change she tactic she now try the trick of accuse my master of crime in my presence and give my name as the author of the accusation to my utter astonishment he reply i do not believe it but if she do acknowledge it you tortured she into expose I tortured into expose he truly satan have no difficulty in distinguish the color of he soul i understand he object in make this false representation it be to show I that i gain nothing by seek the protection of my mistress that the power be still all in he own hand i pitied mrs flint she be a second wife many year the junior of she husband and the hoary-headed miscreant be enough to try the patience of a wiser and better woman she be completely foiled and know not how to proceed she would gladly have have I flog for my suppose false oath but as i have already state the doctor never allow any one to whip I the old sinner be politic the application of the lash might have lead to remark that would have expose he in the eye of he child and grandchild how often do i rejoice that i live in a town where all the inhabitant know each other if i have be on a remote plantation or lose among the multitude of a crowded city i should not be a living woman at this day the secret of slavery be conceal like those of the inquisition my master be to my knowledge the father of eleven slave but do the mother dare to tell who be the father of they child do the other slave dare to allude to it except in whisper among themselves no indeed they know too well the terrible consequence my grandmother could not avoid see thing which excite she suspicion she be uneasy about I and try various way to buy I but the never-changing answer be always repeat : linda do not belong to _ I _ she be my daughter 's property and i have no legal right to sell she the conscientious man he be too scrupulous to _ sell _ I but he have no scruple whatever about commit a much greater wrong against the helpless young girl place under he guardianship as he daughter 's property sometimes my persecutor would ask I whether i would like to be sell i tell he i would rather be sell to any body than to lead such a life as i do on such occasion he would assume the air of a very injured individual and reproach I for my ingratitude do i not take you into the house and make you the companion of my own child he would say have _ i _ ever treat you like a negro i have never allow you to be punish not even to please you mistress and this be the recompense i get you ungrateful girl i answer that he have reason of he own for screen I from punishment and that the course he pursue make my mistress hate I and persecute I if i weep he would say poor child do not cry do not cry i will make peace for you with you mistress only let I arrange matter in my own way poor foolish girl you do not know what be for you own good i would cherish you i would make a lady of you now go and think of all i have promise you i do think of it reader i draw no imaginary picture of southern home i be tell you the plain truth yet when victim make they escape from the wild beast of slavery northerner consent to act the part of bloodhound and hunt the poor fugitive back into he den full of dead man 's bone and all uncleanness nay more they be not only willing but proud to give they daughter in marriage to slaveholder the poor girl have romantic notion of a sunny clime and of the flowering vine that all the year round shade a happy home to what disappointment be they destine the young wife soon learn that the husband in whose hand she have place she happiness pay no regard to he marriage vow child of every shade of complexion play with she own fair baby and too well she know that they be bear unto he of he own household jealousy and hatred enter the flowery home and it be ravage of its loveliness southern woman often marry a man know that he be the father of many little slave they do not trouble themselves about it they regard such child as property as marketable as the pig on the plantation and it be seldom that they do not make they aware of this by pass they into the slave-trader 's hand as soon as possible and thus get they out of they sight i be glad to say there be some honorable exception i have myself know two southern wife who exhort they husband to free those slave towards whom they stand in a parental relation and they request be grant these husband blush before the superior nobleness of they wife ' nature though they have only counsel they to do that which it be they duty to do it command they respect and render they conduct more exemplary concealment be at a end and confidence take the place of distrust though this bad institution deaden the moral sense even in white woman to a fearful extent it be not altogether extinct i have hear southern lady say of mr such a one he not only think it no disgrace to be the father of those little nigger but he be not ashamed to call himself they master i declare such thing ought not to be tolerate in any decent society vii the lover why do the slave ever love why allow the tendril of the heart to twine around object which may at any moment be wrench away by the hand of violence when separation come by the hand of death the pious soul can bow in resignation and say not my will but thine be do o lord but when the ruthless hand of man strike the blow regardless of the misery he cause it be hard to be submissive i do not reason thus when i be a young girl youth will be youth i loved and i indulge the hope that the dark cloud around I would turn out a bright lining i forget that in the land of my birth the shadow be too dense for light to penetrate a land where laughter be not mirth nor think the mind nor word a language nor e ` en man mankind where cry reply to curse shriek to blow and each be tortured in he separate hell there be in the neighborhood a young color carpenter a free bear man we have be well acquaint in childhood and frequently meet together afterwards we become mutually attach and he propose to marry I i love he with all the ardor of a young girl 's first love but when i reflect that i be a slave and that the law give no sanction to the marriage of such my heart sink within I my lover want to buy I but i know that dr flint be too willful and arbitrary a man to consent to that arrangement from he i be sure of experience all sort of opposition and i have nothing to hope from my mistress she would have be delighted to have get rid of I but not in that way it would have relieve she mind of a burden if she could have see I sell to some distant state but if i be marry near home i should be just as much in she husband 's power as i have previously be -- for the husband of a slave have no power to protect she moreover my mistress like many other seem to think that slave have no right to any family tie of they own that they be create merely to wait upon the family of the mistress i once hear she abuse a young slave girl who tell she that a color man want to make she he wife i will have you peel and pickle my lady say she if i ever hear you mention that subject again do you suppose that i will have you tend _ my _ child with the child of that nigger the girl to whom she say this have a mulatto child of course not acknowledge by its father the poor black man who love she would have be proud to acknowledge he helpless offspring many and anxious be the thought i revolve in my mind i be at a loss what to do above all thing i be desirous to spare my lover the insult that have cut so deeply into my own soul i talk with my grandmother about it and partly tell she my fear i do not dare to tell she the worst she have long suspect all be not right and if i confirm she suspicion i know a storm would rise that would prove the overthrow of all my hope this love-dream have be my support through many trial and i could not bear to run the risk of have it suddenly dissipate there be a lady in the neighborhood a particular friend of dr flint 's who often visit the house i have a great respect for she and she have always manifest a friendly interest in I grandmother think she would have great influence with the doctor i go to this lady and tell she my story i tell she i be aware that my lover 's be a free-born man would prove a great objection but he want to buy I and if dr flint would consent to that arrangement i feel sure he would be willing to pay any reasonable price she know that mr flint dislike I therefore i venture to suggest that perhaps my mistress would approve of my be sell as that would rid she of I the lady listen with kindly sympathy and promise to do she utmost to promote my

the last time i have occasion to speak to you on this subject reader do you ever hate i hope not i never do but once and i trust i never shall again somebody have call it the atmosphere of hell and i believe it be so for a fortnight the doctor do not speak to I he think to mortify I to make I feel that i have disgrace myself by receive the honorable address of a respectable color man in preference to the base proposal of a white man but though he lip disdain to address I he eye be very loquacious no animal ever watch its prey more narrowly than he watch I he know that i could write though he have fail to make I read he letter and he be now trouble lest i should exchange letter with another man after a while he become weary of silence and i be sorry for it one morning as he pass through the hall to leave the house he contrived to thrust a note into my hand i think i have better read it and spare myself the vexation of have he read it to I it express regret for the blow he have give I and remind I that i myself be wholly to blame for it he hope i have become convinced of the injury i be do myself by incur he displeasure he write that he have make up he mind to go to louisiana that he should take several slave with he and intended i should be one of the number my mistress would remain where she be therefore i should have nothing to fear from that quarter if i merited kindness from he he assure I that it would be lavishly bestow he beg I to think over the matter and answer the follow day the next morning i be call to carry a pair of scissors to he room i lay they on the table with the letter beside they he think it be my answer and do not call I back i go as usual to attend my young mistress to and from school he meet I in the street and order I to stop at he office on my way back when i enter he show I he letter and ask I why i have not answer it i reply i be you daughter 's property and it be in you power to send I or take I wherever you please he say he be very glad to find I so willing to go and that we should start early in the autumn he have a large practice in the town and i rather think he have make up the story merely to frighten I however that might be i be determine that i would never go to louisiana with he summer pass away and early in the autumn dr flint 's eldest son be send to louisiana to examine the country with a view to emigrate that news do not disturb I i know very well that i should not be send with _ he _ that i have not be take to the plantation before this time be owe to the fact that he son be there he be jealous of he son and jealousy of the overseer have keep he from punish I by send I into the field to work be it strange that i be not proud of these protector as for the overseer he be a man for whom i have less respect than i have for a bloodhound young mr flint do not bring back a favorable report of louisiana and i hear no more of that scheme soon after this my lover meet I at the corner of the street and i stop to speak to he look up i see my master watch we from he window i hurry home tremble with fear i be send for immediately to go to he room he meet I with a blow when be mistress to be marry say he in a sneering tone a shower of oath and imprecation follow how thankful i be that my lover be a free man that my tyrant have no power to flog he for speak to I in the street again and again i revolve in my mind how all this would end there be no hope that the doctor would consent to sell I on any term he have a iron will and be determine to keep I and to conquer I my lover be a intelligent and religious man even if he could have obtain permission to marry I while i be a slave the marriage would give he no power to protect I from my master it would have make he miserable to witness the insult i should have be subject to and then if we have child i know they must follow the condition of the mother what a terrible blight that would be on the heart of a free intelligent father for _ he _ sake i feel that i ought not to link he fate with my own unhappy destiny he be go to savannah to see about a little property leave he by a uncle and hard as it be to bring my feeling to it i earnestly entreat he not to come back i advise he to go to the free state where he tongue would not be tie and where he intelligence would be of more avail to he he leave I still hope the day would come when i could be buy with I the lamp of hope have go out the dream of my girlhood be over i feel lonely and desolate still i be not strip of all i still have my good grandmother and my affectionate brother when he put he arm round my neck and look into my eye as if to read there the trouble i dare not tell i feel that i still have something to love but even that pleasant emotion be chill by the reflection that he might be tear from I at any moment by some sudden freak of my master if he have know how we love each other i think he would have exult in separate we we often plan together how we could get to the north but as william remark such thing be easier say than do my movement be very closely watch and we have no means of get any money to defray we expense as for grandmother she be strongly oppose to she child 's undertake any such project she have not forget poor benjamin 's suffering and she be afraid that if another child try to escape he would have a similar or a worse fate to I nothing seem more dreadful than my present life i say to myself william _ must _ be free he shall go to the north and i will follow he many a slave sister have form the same plan viii what slave be teach to think of the north slaveholder pride themselves upon be honorable man but if you be to hear the enormous lie they tell they slave you would have small respect for they veracity i have speak plain english pardon I i can not use a milder term when they visit the north and return home they tell they slave of the runaway they have see and describe they to be in the most deplorable condition a slaveholder once tell I that he have see a runaway friend of mine in new york and that she beseech he to take she back to she master for she be literally die of starvation that many day she have only one cold potato to eat and at other time could get nothing at all he say he refuse to take she because he know she master would not thank he for bring such a miserable wretch to he house he end by say to I this be the punishment she bring on herself for run away from a kind master this whole story be false i afterwards staid with that friend in new york and find she in comfortable circumstance she have never think of such a thing as wish to go back to slavery many of the slave believe such story and think it be not worth while to exchange slavery for such a hard kind of freedom it be difficult to persuade such that freedom could make they useful man and enable they to protect they wife and child if those heathen in we christian land have as much teaching as some hindoo they would think otherwise they would know that liberty be more valuable than life they would begin to understand they own capability and exert themselves to become man and woman but while the free state sustain a law which hurl fugitive back into slavery how can the slave resolve to become man there be some who strive to protect wife and daughter from the insult of they master but those who have such sentiment have have advantage above the general mass of slave they have be partially civilized and christianize by favorable circumstance some be bold enough to _ utter _ such sentiment to they master o that there be more of they some poor creature have be so brutalize by the lash that they will sneak out of the way to give they master free access to they wife and daughter do you think this prove the black man to belong to a inferior order of being what would _ you _ be if you have be bear and bring up a slave with generation of slave for ancestor i admit that the black man _ be _ inferior but what be it that make he so it be the ignorance in which white man compel he to live it be the torture whip that lash manhood out of he it be the fierce bloodhound of the south and the scarcely less cruel human bloodhound of the north who enforce the fugitive slave law _ they _ do the work southern gentleman indulge in the most contemptuous expression about the yankee while they on they part consent to do the vilest work for they such as the ferocious bloodhound and the despise negro-hunter be employ to do at home when southerner go to the north they be proud to do they honor but the northern man be not welcome south of mason and dixon 's line unless he suppress every thought and feeling at variance with they peculiar institution nor be it enough to be silent the master be not pleased unless they obtain a greater degree of subservience than that and they be generally accommodate do they respect the northerner for this i trow not even the slave despise a northern man with southern principle and that be the class they generally see when northerner go to the south to reside they prove very apt scholar they soon imbibe the sentiment and disposition of they neighbor and generally go beyond they teacher of the two they be proverbially the hardest master they seem to satisfy they conscience with the doctrine that god create the african to be slave what a libel upon the heavenly father who make of one blood all nation of man and then who _ be _ african who can measure the amount of anglo-saxon blood coursing in the vein of american slave i have speak of the pain slaveholder take to give they slave a bad opinion of the north but notwithstanding this intelligent slave be aware that they have many friend in the free state even the most ignorant have some confused notion about it they know that i could read and i be often ask if i have see any thing in the newspaper about white folk over in the big north who be try to get they freedom for they some believe that the abolitionist have already make they free and that it be establish by law but that they master prevent the law from go into effect one woman beg I to get a newspaper and read it over she say she husband tell she that the black people have send word to the queen of ` merica that they be all slave that she do not believe it and go to washington city to see the president about it they quarrel she draw she sword upon he and swear that he should help she to make they all free that poor ignorant woman think that america be govern by a queen to whom the president be subordinate i wish the president be subordinate to queen justice ix sketch of neighbor slaveholder there be a planter in the country not far from we whom i will call mr litch he be a ill-bred uneducated man but very wealthy he have six hundred slave many of whom he do not know by sight he extensive plantation be manage by well-paid overseer there be a jail and a whipping post on he grounds

to evade detection or suspicion if a neighbor bring a charge of theft against any of he slave he be browbeat by the master who assure he that he slave have enough of every thing at home and have no inducement to steal no sooner be the neighbor 's back turn than the accuse be seek out and whip for he lack of discretion if a slave steal from he even a pound of meat or a peck of corn if detection

cruelty with this man he grow up to manhood receive the treatment of a dog after a severe whipping to save himself from further infliction of the lash with which he be threaten he take to the wood he

's plantation this man consider punishment in he jail on bread and water after receive hundred of lash too mild for the poor slave 's offence therefore he decide after the overseer should have whip he to he satisfaction to have he place between the screw of the cotton gin to stay as long as he have be in the wood this wretched creature be cut with the whip from he head to he foot then wash with strong brine to prevent the flesh from mortifying and make it heal sooner than it otherwise would he be then put into the cotton gin which be screw down only allow he room to turn on he side when he

the slave inform he master that the water have not be use for four morning and that horrible stench come from the gin house the overseer be send to examine into it when the press be unscrewed the dead body be find partly eat by rat and vermin perhaps the rat that devour he bread have gnaw he before life be extinct poor charity grandmother and i often ask each other how she affectionate heart would bear the news if she should ever hear of the murder of she son we have know she husband and know that jame be like he in manliness and intelligence these be the quality that make it so hard for he to be a plantation slave they put he into a rough box and bury he with less feeling than would have be manifest for a old house dog nobody ask any question he be a slave and the feeling be that the master have a right to do what he please with he own property and what do _ he _ care for the value of a slave he have hundred of they when they have finish they daily toil they must hurry to eat they little morsel and be ready to extinguish they pine knot before nine o'clock when the overseer go he patrol round he enter every cabin to see that man and they wife have go to bed together lest the man from over-fatigue should fall asleep in the chimney corner and remain there till the morning horn call they to they daily task woman be consider of no value unless they continually increase they owner 's stock they be put on a par with animal this same master shoot a woman through the head who have run away and be bring back to he no one call he to account for it if a slave resist be whip the bloodhound be unpacked and set upon he to tear he flesh from he bone the master who do these thing be highly educate and style a perfect gentleman he also boast the name and standing of a christian though satan never have a truer follower i could tell of more slaveholder as cruel as those i have describe they be not exception to the general rule i do not say there be no humane slaveholder such character do exist notwithstanding the harden influence around they but they be like angel ' visit -- few and far between i know a young lady who be one of these rare specimen she be a orphan and inherit as slave a woman and she six child they father be a free man they have a comfortable home of they own parent and child live together the mother and eldest daughter serve they mistress during the day and at night return to they dwelling which be on the premise the young lady be very pious and there be some reality in she religion she teach she slave to lead pure life and wish they to enjoy the fruit of they own industry _ she _ religion be not a garb put on for Sunday and lay aside till Sunday return again the eldest daughter of the slave mother be promise in marriage to a free man and the day before the wedding this good mistress emancipate she in order that she marriage might have the sanction of _ law _ report say that this young lady cherish a unrequited affection for a man who have resolve to marry for wealth in the course of time a rich uncle of hers die he leave six thousand dollar to he two son by a color woman and the remainder of he property to this orphan niece the metal soon attract the magnet the lady and she weighty purse become he she offer to manumit she slave -- tell they that she marriage might make unexpected change in they destiny and she wish to insure they happiness they refuse to take they freedom say that she have always be they best friend and they could not be so happy any where as with she i be not surprised i have often see they in they comfortable home and think that the whole town do not contain a happier family they have never feel slavery and when it be too late they be convince of its reality when the new master claim this family as he property the father become furious and go to he mistress for protection i can do nothing for you now harry say she i no longer have the power i have a week ago i have succeed in obtain the freedom of you wife but i can not obtain it for you child the unhappy father swear that nobody should take he child from he he conceal they in the wood for some day but they be discover and take the father be put in jail and the two oldest boy sell to georgia one little girl too young to be of service to she master be leave with the wretched mother the other three be carry to they master 's plantation the eldest soon become a mother and when the slaveholder 's wife look at the babe she weep bitterly she know that she own husband have violate the purity she have so carefully inculcate she have a second child by she master and then he sell she and he offspring to he brother she bear two child to the brother and be sell again the next sister go crazy the life she be compel to lead drive she mad the third one become the mother of five daughter before the birth of the fourth the pious mistress die to the last she render every kindness to the slave that she unfortunate circumstance permit she pass away peacefully glad to close she eye on a life which have be make so wretched by the man she love this man squander the fortune he have receive and seek to retrieve he affair by a second marriage but have retire after a night of drunken debauch he be find dead in the morning he be call a good master for he feed and clothe he slave better than most master and the lash be not hear on he plantation so frequently as on many other have it not be for slavery he would have be a better man and he wife a happier woman no pen can give a adequate description of the all-pervading corruption produce by slavery the slave girl be rear in a atmosphere of licentiousness and fear the lash and the foul talk of she master and he son be she teacher when she be fourteen or fifteen she owner or he son or the overseer or perhaps all of they begin to bribe she with present if these fail to accomplish they purpose she be whip or starve into submission to they will she may have have religious principle inculcate by some pious mother or grandmother or some good mistress she may have a lover whose good opinion and peace of mind be dear to she heart or the profligate man who have power over she may be exceedingly odious to she but resistance be hopeless the poor worm shall prove she contest vain life 's little day shall pass and she be go the slaveholder 's son be of course vitiate even while boy by the unclean influence every where around they nor do the master 's daughter always escape severe retribution sometimes come upon he for the wrong he do to the daughter of the slave the white daughter early hear they parent quarrel about some female slave they curiosity be excite and they soon learn the cause they be attend by the young slave girl whom they father have corrupt and they hear such talk as should never meet youthful ear or any other ear they know that the woman slave be subject to they father 's authority in all thing and in some case they exercise the same authority over the man slave i have myself see the master of such a household whose head be bow down in shame for it be know in the neighborhood that he daughter have select one of the meanest slave on he plantation to be the father of he first grandchild she do not make she advance to she equal nor even to she father 's more intelligent servant she select the most brutalize over whom she authority could be exercise with less fear of exposure she father half frantic with rage seek to revenge himself on the offend black man but he daughter foresee the storm that would arise have give he free papers and send he out of the state in such case the infant be smother or send where it be never see by any who know its history but if the white parent be the _ father _ instead of the mother the offspring be unblushingly rear for the market if they be girl i have indicate plainly enough what will be they inevitable destiny you may believe what i say for i write only that whereof i know i be twenty-one year in that cage of obscene bird i can testify from my own experience and observation that slavery be a curse to the whites as well as to the black it make white father cruel and sensual the son violent and licentious it contaminate the daughter and make the wife wretched and as for the color race it need a abler pen than mine to describe the extremity of they suffering the depth of they degradation yet few slaveholder seem to be aware of the widespread moral ruin occasion by this wicked system they talk be of blighted cotton crop -- not of the blight on they child 's soul if you want to be fully convince of the abomination of slavery go on a southern plantation and call yourself a negro trader then there will be no concealment and you will see and hear thing that will seem to you impossible among human being with immortal soul x a perilous passage in the slave girl 's life after my lover go away dr flint contrived a new plan he seem to have a idea that my fear of my mistress be he greatest obstacle in the blandest tone he tell I that he be go to build a small house for I in a secluded place four mile away from the town i shudder but i be constrain to listen while he talk of he intention to give I a home of my own and to make a lady of I hitherto i have escape my dreaded fate by be in the midst of people my grandmother have already have high word with my master about I she have tell he pretty plainly what she think of he character and there be considerable gossip in the neighborhood about we affair to which the open-mouthed jealousy of mr flint contribute not a little when my master say he be go to build a house for I and that he could do it with little trouble and expense i be in hope something would happen to frustrate he scheme but i soon hear that the house be actually begin i vow before my maker that i would never enter it : i have rather toil on the plantation from dawn till dark i have rather live and die in jail than drag on from day to day through such a living death i be determine that the master whom i so hate and loathe who have blighted the prospects of my youth and make my life a desert should not after my long struggle with he succeed at last in trample he victim under he foot i would do any thing every thing for the sake of defeat he what _ could _ i do i think and think till i become desperate and make a plunge into the abyss and now reader i come to a period in my unhappy life which i would gladly forget if i could the remembrance fill I with sorrow and shame it pain I to tell you of it but i have promise to tell you the truth and i will do it honestly let it cost I what it may i will not try to screen myself behind the plea of compulsion from a master for it be not so neither can i plead ignorance or thoughtlessness for year my master have do he utmost to pollute my mind with foul image and to destroy the pure principle inculcate by my grandmother and the good mistress of my childhood the influence of slavery have have the same effect on I that they have on other young girl they have make I prematurely know concern the evil way of the world i know what i do and i do it with deliberate calculation but o ye happy woman whose purity have be sheltered from childhood who have be free to choose the object of you affection whose home be protect by law do not judge the poor desolate slave girl too severely if slavery have be abolish i also could have marry the man of my choice i could have have a home shield by the law and i should have be spare the painful task of confess what i be now about to relate but all my prospects have be blighted by slavery i want to keep myself pure and under the most adverse circumstance i try hard to preserve my self-respect but i be struggle alone in the powerful grasp of the demon slavery and the monster prove too strong for I i feel as if i be forsake by god and man as if all my effort must be frustrated and i become reckless in my despair i have tell you that dr flint 's persecution and he wife 's jealousy have give rise to some gossip in the neighborhood among other it chance that a white unmarried gentleman have obtain some knowledge of the circumstance in which i be place he know my grandmother and often speak to I in the street he become interested for I and ask question about my master which i answer in part he express a great deal of sympathy and a wish to aid I he constantly seek opportunity to see I and write to I frequently i be a poor slave girl only fifteen year old so much attention from a superior person be of course flattering for human nature be the same in all i also feel grateful for he sympathy and encourage by he kind word it seem to I a great thing to have such a friend by degree a more tender feeling creep into my heart he be a educate and eloquent gentleman too eloquent alas for the poor slave girl who trust in he of course i see whither all this be tend i know the impassable gulf between we but to be a object of interest to a man who be not marry and who be not she master be agreeable to the pride and feeling of a slave if she miserable situation have leave she any pride or sentiment it seem less degrading to give one 's self than to submit to compulsion there be something akin to freedom in have a lover who have no control over you except that which he gain by kindness and attachment a master may treat you as rudely as he please and you dare not speak moreover the wrong do not seem so great with a unmarried man as with one who have a wife to be make unhappy there may be sophistry in all this but the condition of a slave confuse all principle of morality and in fact render the practice of they impossible when i find that my master have actually begin to build the lonely cottage other feeling mix with those i have describe revenge and calculation of interest be add to flattered vanity and sincere gratitude for kindness i know nothing would enrage dr flint so much as to know that i favor another and it be something to triumph over my tyrant even in that small way i think he would revenge himself by sell I and i be sure my friend mr sand would buy I he be a man of more generosity and feeling than my master and i think my freedom could be easily obtain from he the crisis of my fate now come so near that i be desperate i shudder to think of be the mother of child that should be own by my old tyrant i know that as soon as a new fancy take he he victim be sell far off to get rid of they especially if they have child i have see several woman sell with baby at the breast he never allow he offspring by slave to remain long in sight of himself and he wife of a man who be not my master i could ask to have my child well support and in this case i feel confident i should obtain the boon i also feel quite sure that they would be make free with all these thought revolve in my mind and see no other way of escape the doom i so much dreaded i make a headlong plunge pity I and pardon I o virtuous reader you never know what it be to be a slave to be entirely unprotect by law or custom to have the law reduce you to the condition of a chattel entirely subject to the will of another you never exhaust you ingenuity in avoid the snare and elude the power of a hate tyrant you never shudder at the sound of he footstep and tremble within hearing of he voice i know i do wrong no one can feel it more sensibly than i do the painful and humiliating memory will haunt I to my die day still in look back calmly on the event of my life i feel that the

now praise god that it be so but why think i do my relative ever cherish hope for I what be there to save I from the usual fate of slave girl many more beautiful and more intelligent than i have experience a similar fate or a far worse one how could they hope that i should escape my uncle 's stay be short and i be not sorry for it i be too ill in mind and body to enjoy my friend as i have do for some week i be unable to leave my bed i could not have any doctor but my master and i would not have he send for at last alarm by my increase illness they send for he i be very weak and nervous and as soon as he enter the room i begin to scream they tell he my state be very critical he have no wish to hasten I out of the world and he withdraw when my babe be bear they say it be premature it weigh only four pound but god let it live i hear the doctor say i could not survive till morning i have often pray for death but now i do not want to die unless my child could die too many week pass before i be able to leave my bed i be a mere wreck of my former self for a year there be scarcely a day when i be free from chill and fever my babe also be sickly he little limb be often rack with pain dr flint continue he visit to look after my health and he do not fail to remind I that my child be a addition to he stock of slave i feel too feeble to dispute with he and listen to he remark in silence he visit be less frequent but he busy spirit could not remain quiet he employ my brother in he office and he be make the medium of frequent note and message to I william be a bright lad and of much use to the doctor he have learn to put up medicine to leech cup and bleed he have teach himself to read and spell i be proud of my brother and the old doctor suspect as much one day when i have not see he for several week i hear he step approach the door i dread the encounter and hide myself he inquire for I of course but i be nowhere to be find he go to he office and despatch william with a note the color mount to my brother 's face when he give it to I and he say do not you hate I linda for bring you these thing i tell he i could not blame he he be a slave and oblige to obey he master 's will the note order I to come to he office i go he demand to know where i be when he call i tell he i be at home he fly into a passion and say he know better then he launch out upon he usual theme -- my crime against he and my ingratitude for he forbearance the law be lay down to I anew and i be dismiss i feel humiliate that my brother should stand by and listen to such language as would be address only to a slave poor boy he be powerless to defend I but i see the tear which he vainly strive to keep back the manifestation of feeling irritated the doctor william could do nothing to please he one morning he do not arrive at the office so early as usual and that circumstance afford he master a opportunity to vent he spleen he be put in jail the next day my brother send a trader to the doctor with a request to be sell he master be greatly incense at what he call he insolence he say he have put he there to reflect upon he bad conduct and he certainly be not give any evidence of

careful about he future behavior as the month pass on my boy improve in health when he be a year old they call he beautiful the little vine be take deep root in my existence though its clinging fondness excite a mixture of love and pain when i be most sorely oppressed i find a solace in he smile i love to watch he infant slumber but always there be a dark cloud over my enjoyment i could never forget that he be a slave sometimes i wish that he might die in infancy god try I my darling become very ill the bright eye grow dull and the little foot and hand be so icy cold that i think death have already touch they i have pray for he death but never so earnestly as i now pray for he life and my prayer be hear alas what mockery it be for a slave mother to try to pray back she die child to life death be better than slavery it be a sad thought that i have no name to give my child he father caress he and treat he kindly whenever he have a chance to see he he be not unwilling that he should bear he name but he have no legal claim to it and if i have bestow it upon he my master would have regard it as a new crime a new piece of insolence and would perhaps revenge it on the boy o the serpent of slavery have many and poisonous fang xii fear of insurrection not far from this time nat turner 's insurrection break out and the news throw we town into great commotion strange that they should be alarm when they slave be so contented and happy but so it be it be always the custom to have a muster every year on that occasion every white man shoulder he musket the citizen and the so-called country gentleman wear military uniform the poor whites take they place in the rank in every-day dress some without shoe some without hat this grand occasion have already pass and when the slave be tell there be to be another muster they be surprised and rejoice poor creature they think it be go to be a holiday i be inform of the true state of affair and impart it to the few i could trust most gladly would i have proclaim it to every slave but i dare not all could not be rely on mighty be the power of the torture lash by sunrise people be pour in from every quarter within twenty mile of the town i know the house be to be search and i expect it would be do by country bully and the poor whites i know nothing annoy they so much as to see colored people live in comfort and respectability so i make arrangement for they with especial care i arrange every thing in my grandmother 's house as neatly as possible i put white quilt on the bed and decorate some of the room with flower when all be arrange i sit down at the window to watch far as my eye could reach it rest on a motley crowd of soldier drum and fife be discourse martial music the man be divide into company of sixteen each head by a captain order be give and the wild scout rush in every direction wherever a color face be to be find it be a grand opportunity for the low whites who have no negro of they own to scourge they exult in such a chance to exercise a little brief authority and show they subserviency to the slaveholder not reflect that the power which trample on the color people also keep themselves in poverty ignorance and moral degradation those who never witness such scene can hardly believe what i know be inflict at this time on innocent man woman and child against whom there be not the slightest ground for suspicion color people and slave who live in remote part of the town suffer in a especial manner in some case the searcher scatter powder and shot among they clothes and then send other party to find they and bring they forward as proof that they be plot insurrection every where man woman and child be whip till the blood stand in puddle at they foot some receive five hundred lash other be tie hand and foot and tortured with a buck paddle which blister the skin terribly the dwelling of the color people unless they happen to be protect by some influential white

receive thirty-nine lash we come out of this affair very fortunately not lose any thing except some wear apparel towards evening the turbulence increase the soldier stimulate by drink commit still greater cruelty shriek and shout continually rent the air not daring to go to the door i peeped under the window curtain i see a mob drag along a number of color people each white man with he musket upraised threatening instant death if they do not stop they shriek among the prisoner be a respectable old color minister they have find a few parcel of shot in he house which he wife have for year use to balance she scale for this they be go to shoot he on court house green what a spectacle be that for a civilized country a rabble stagger under intoxication assume to be the administrator of justice the better class of the community exert they influence to save the innocent persecute people and in several instance they succeed by keep they shut up in jail till the excitement abate at last the white citizen find that they own property be not safe from the lawless rabble they have summon to protect they they rally the drunken swarm drive they back into the country and set a guard over the town the next day the town patrol be commission to search colored people that live out of the city and the most shocking outrage be commit with perfect impunity every day for a fortnight if i look out i see horseman with some poor panting negro tie to they saddle and compel by the lash to keep up with they speed till they arrive at the jail yard those who have be whip too unmercifully to walk be wash with brine toss into a cart and carry to jail one black man who have not fortitude to endure scourge promise to give information about the conspiracy but it turn out that he know nothing at

communion and the benediction have be pronounce the minister say come down now my color friend they obey the summons and partook of the bread and wine in commemoration of the meek and lowly jesus who say god be you father and all ye be brethren xiii the church and slavery after the alarm cause by nat turner 's insurrection have subside the slaveholder come to the conclusion that it would be well to give the slave enough of religious instruction to keep they from murder they master the episcopal clergyman offer to hold a separate service on sunday for they benefit he color member be very few and also very respectable -- a fact which i presume have some weight with he the difficulty be to decide on a suitable place for they to worship the methodist and baptist church admit they in the afternoon but they carpet and cushion be not so costly as those at the episcopal church it be at last decide that they should meet at the house of a free color man who be a member i be invite to attend because i could read Sunday evening come and trust to the cover of night i venture out i rarely venture out by daylight for i always go with fear expect at every turn to encounter dr flint who be sure to turn I back or order I to he office to inquire where i get my bonnet or some other article of dress when the rev mr pike come there be some twenty person present the reverend gentleman kneel in prayer then seat himself and request all present who could read to open they book while he give out the portion he wish they to repeat or respond to he text be servant be obedient to they that be you master accord to the flesh with fear and tremble in singleness of you heart as unto christ pious mr pike brush up he hair till it stand upright and in deep solemn tone begin : hearken ye

pronounced we go home highly amuse at brother pike 's gospel teaching and we determine to hear he again i go the next sabbath evening and hear pretty much a repetition of the last discourse at the close of the meeting mr pike inform we that he find it very inconvenient to meet at the friend 's house and he should be glad to see we every Sunday evening at he own kitchen i go home with the feeling that i have hear the reverend mr pike for the last time some of he member repair to he house and find that the kitchen sport two tallow candle the first time i be sure since its present occupant own it for the servant never have any thing but pine knot it be so long before the reverend gentleman descend from he comfortable parlor that the slave leave and go to enjoy a methodist shout they never seem so happy as when shout and singing at religious meeting many of they be sincere and nearer to the gate of heaven than sanctimonious mr pike and other long-faced christian who see wound samaritan and pass by on the other side the slave generally compose they own song and hymn and they do not trouble they head much about the measure they often sing the follow verse : old satan be one busy ole man he roll dem block all in my way but jesus be my bosom friend he roll dem block away if i have die when i be young den how my stam ` ring tongue would have sing but i be ole and now i stand a narrow chance for to tread dat heavenly land i well remember one occasion when i attend a methodist class meeting i go with a burden spirit and happen to sit next a poor bereaved mother whose heart be still heavier than mine the class leader be the town constable -- a man who buy and sell slave who whip he brethren and sister of the church at the public whipping post in jail or out of jail he be ready to perform that christian office any where for fifty cent this white-faced black-hearted brother come near we and say to the stricken woman sister can not you tell we how the lord deal

the bereaved mother sister pray to the lord that every dispensation of he divine will may be sanctify to the good of you poor needy soul the congregation strike up a hymn and sing as though they be as free as the bird that warble round we -- ole satan think he have a mighty aim he miss my soul and catch my sin cry amen cry amen cry aman to god he take my sin upon he back go mutter and grumble down to hell cry amen cry amen cry aman to god ole satan 's church be here below up to god 's free church i hope to go cry amen cry amen cry aman to god precious be such moment to the poor slave if you be to hear they at such time you might think they be happy but can that hour of singing and shout sustain they through the dreary week toiling without wages under constant dread of the lash the episcopal clergyman who ever since my earliest recollection have be a sort of god among the slaveholder conclude as he family be large that he must go where money be more abundant a very different clergyman take he place the change be very agreeable to the color people who say god have send we a good man this time they love he and they child follow he for a smile or a kind word even the slaveholder feel he influence he bring to the rectory five slave he wife teach they to read and write and to be useful to she and themselves as soon as he be settle he turn he attention to the needy slave around he he urge upon he parishioner the duty of have a meeting expressly for they every Sunday with a sermon adapt to they comprehension after much argument and importunity it be finally agree that they might occupy the gallery of the church on Sunday evening many color people hitherto unaccustomed to attend church now gladly go to hear the gospel preach the sermon be simple and they understand they moreover it be the first time they have ever be address as human being it be not long before he white parishioner begin to be dissatisfy he be accuse of preach better sermon to the negro than he do to they he honestly confess that he bestow more pain upon those sermon than upon any other for the slave be rear in such ignorance that it be a difficult task to adapt himself to they comprehension

they be hate by the south and would be drive from its soil or drag to prison to die as other have be before they the field be ripe for the harvest and await the reaper perhaps the great grandchild of uncle fred may have freely impart to they the divine treasure which he seek by stealth at the risk of the prison and the scourge be doctor of divinity blind or be they hypocrite i suppose some be the one and some the other but i think if they feel the interest in the poor and the lowly that they ought to feel they would not be so _ easily _ blind a clergyman who go to the south for the first time have usually some feeling however vague that slavery be wrong the slaveholder suspect this and play he game accordingly he make himself as agreeable as possible talk on theology and other kindred topic the reverend gentleman be ask to invoke a blessing on a table load with luxury after dinner he walk round the premise and see the beautiful grove and flowering vine and the comfortable hut of favored household slave the southerner invite he to talk with those slave he ask they if they want to be free and they say o no massa this be sufficient to satisfy he he come home to publish a south side view of slavery and to complain of the exaggeration of abolitionist he assure people that he have be to the south and see slavery for himself that it be a beautiful patriarchal institution that the slave do not want they freedom that they have hallelujah meeting and other religious privilege what do _ he _ know of the half-starved wretch toiling from dawn till dark on the plantation of mother shriek for they child tear from they arm by slave trader of young girl drag down into moral filth of pool of blood around the whipping post of hound train to tear human flesh of man screw into

man go to the communion table and pay money into the treasury of the church no matter if it be the price of blood he be call religious if a pastor have offspring by a woman not he wife the church dismiss he if she be a white woman but if she be color it do not hinder he continue to be they good shepherd when i be tell that dr flint have join the episcopal church i be much surprised i suppose that religion have a purifying effect on the character of man but the worst persecution i endure from he be after he be a communicant the conversation of the doctor the day after he have be confirm certainly give _ I _ no indication that he have renounce the devil and all he work in answer to some of he usual talk i remind he that he have just join the church yes linda say he it be proper for I to do so i be get in year and my position in society require it and it put a end to all the damned slang you would do well to join the church too linda there be sinner enough in it already rejoin i if i could be allow to live like a christian i should be glad you can do what i require and if you be faithful to I you will be as virtuous as my wife he reply i answer that the bible do not say so he voice become hoarse with rage how dare you preach to I about you infernal bible he exclaim what right have you who be my negro to talk to I about what you would like and what you would not like i be you master and you shall obey I no wonder the slave sing -- ole satan 's church be here below up to god 's free church i hope to go xiv another link to life i have not return to my master 's house since the birth of my child the old man rave to have I thus remove from he immediate power but he wife vow by all that be good and great she would kill I if i come back and he do not doubt she word sometimes he would stay away for a season then he would come and renew the old threadbare discourse about he forbearance and my ingratitude he labor most unnecessarily to convince I that i have lower myself the venomous old reprobate have no need of descant on that theme i feel humiliate enough my unconscious babe be the ever-present witness of my shame i listen with silent contempt when he talk about my have forfeit _ he _ good opinion but i shed bitter tear that i be no longer worthy of be respect by the good and pure alas slavery still hold I in its poisonous grasp there be no chance for I to be respectable there be no prospect of be able to lead a better life sometimes when my master find that i still refuse to accept what he call he kind offer he would threaten to sell my child perhaps that will humble you say he humble _ I _ be i not already in the dust but he threat lacerate my heart i know the law give he power to fulfil it for slaveholder have be cunning enough to enact that the child shall follow the condition of the _ mother _ not of the _ father _ thus take care that licentiousness shall not interfere with avarice this reflection make I clasp my innocent babe all the more firmly to my heart horrid vision pass through my mind when i thought of he liability to fall into the slave trader 's hand i weep over he and say o my child perhaps they will leave you in some cold cabin to die and then throw you into a hole as if you be a dog when dr flint learn that i be again to be a mother he be exasperate beyond measure he rush from the house and return with a pair of shears i have a fine head of hair and he often rail about my pride of arrange it nicely he cut every hair close to my head storm and swearing all the time i reply to some of he abuse and he strike I some month before he have pitch I down stair in a fit of passion and the injury i receive be so serious that i be unable to turn myself in bed for many day he then say linda i swear by god i will never raise my hand against you again but i know that he would forget he promise after he discover my situation he be like a restless spirit from the pit he come every day and i be subject to such insult as no pen can describe i would not describe they if i could they be too low too revolting i try to keep they from my grandmother 's knowledge as much as i could i know she have enough to sadden she life without have my trouble to bear when she see the doctor treat I with violence and hear he utter oath terrible enough to palsy a man 's tongue she could not always hold she peace it be natural and motherlike that she should try to defend I but it only make matter worse when they tell I my new-born babe be a girl my heart be heavier than it have ever be before slavery be terrible for man but it be far more terrible for woman superad to the burden common to all _ they _ have wrong and suffering and mortification peculiarly they own dr flint have swear that he would make I suffer to my last day for this new crime against _ he _ as he call it and as long as he have I in he power he keep he word on the fourth day after the birth of my babe he enter my room suddenly and command I to rise and bring my baby to he the nurse who take care of I have go out of the room to prepare some nourishment and i be alone there be no alternative i rise take up my babe and cross the room to where he sit now stand there say he till i tell you to go back my child bear a strong resemblance to she father and to the deceased mr sand she grandmother he notice this and while i stand before he tremble with weakness he heap upon I and my little one every vile epithet he could think of even the grandmother in she grave do not escape he curse in the midst of he vituperation i faint at he foot this recall he to he sens he take the baby from my arm lay it on the bed dash cold water in my face take I up and shake I violently to restore my consciousness before any one enter the room just then my grandmother come in and he hurry out of the house i suffer in consequence of this treatment but i begged my friend to let I die rather than send for the doctor there be nothing i dread so much as he presence my life be spare and i be glad for the sake of my little one have it not be for these tie to life i should have be glad to be release by death though i have live only nineteen year always it give I a pang that my child have no lawful claim to a name they father offer he but if i have wish to accept the offer i dare not while my master live moreover i know it would not be accept at they baptism a christian name they be at least entitle to and we resolve to call my boy for we dear good benjamin who have go far away from we my grandmother belong to the church and she be very desirous of have the child christen i know dr flint would forbid it and i do not venture to attempt it but chance favor I he be call to visit a patient out of town and be oblige to be absent during Sunday now be the time say my grandmother we will take the child to church and have they christen when i enter the church recollection of my mother come over I and i feel subdue in spirit there she have present I for baptism without any reason to feel ashamed she have be marry and have such legal rights as slavery allow to a slave the vow have at least be sacred to _ she _ and she have never violate they i be glad she be not alive to know under what different circumstance she grandchild be present for baptism why have my lot be so different from my mother 's _ she _ master have die when she be a child and she remain with she mistress till she marry she be never in the power of any master and thus she escape one class of the evil that generally fall upon slave when my baby be about to be christen the former mistress of my father step up to I and propose to give it she christian name to this i add the surname of my father who have himself no legal right to it for my grandfather on the paternal side be a white gentleman what tangle skein be the genealogy of slavery i love my father but it mortify I to be oblige to bestow he name on my child when we leave the church my father 's old mistress invite I to go home with she she clasp a gold chain round my baby 's neck i thank she for this kindness but i do not like the emblem i want no chain to be fasten on my daughter not even if its link be of gold how earnestly i pray that she might never feel the weight of slavery 's chain whose iron entereth into the soul xv continue persecution my child grow finely and dr flint would often say to I with a exult smile these brat will bring I a handsome sum of money one of these day i think to myself that god be my helper they should never pass into he hand it seem to I i would rather see they kill than have they give up to he power the money for the freedom of myself and my child could be obtain but i derive no advantage from that circumstance dr flint love money but he love power more after much discussion my friend resolve on make another trial there be a slaveholder about to leave for texa and he be commission to buy I he be to begin with nine hundred dollar and go up to twelve my master refuse he offer sir say he she do not belong to I she be my daughter 's property and i have no right to sell she i mistrust that you come from she paramour if so you may tell he that he can not buy she for any money neither can he buy she child the doctor come to see I the next day and my heart beat quicker as he enter i never have see the old man tread with so majestic a step he seat himself and look at I with wither scorn my child have learn to be afraid of he the little one would shut she eye and hide she face on my shoulder whenever she see he and benny who be now nearly five year old often inquire what make that bad man come here so many time do he want to hurt we i would clasp the dear boy in my arm trust that he would be free before he be old enough to solve the problem and now as the doctor sit there so grim and silent the child leave he play and come and nestle up by I at last my tormentor speak so you be leave in disgust be you say he it be no more than i expect you remember i tell you year ago that you would be treat so so he be tire of you ha ha ha the virtuous madam do not like to hear about it do she ha ha ha there be a sting in he call I virtuous madam i no longer have the power of answer he as i have formerly do he continue : so it seem you be try to get up another intrigue you new paramour come to I and offer to buy you but you may be assure you will not succeed you be mine and you shall be mine for life there live no human be that can take you out of slavery i would have do it but you reject my kind offer i tell he i do not wish to get up any intrigue that i have never see the man who offer to buy I do you tell I i lie exclaim he drag I from my chair will you say again that you never see that man i answer i do say so he clinch my arm with a volley of oath ben begin to scream and i tell he to go to he grandmother do not you stir a step you little wretch say he the child draw nearer to I and put he arm round I as if he want to protect I this be too much for my enraged master he catch he up and hurl he across the room i think he be dead and rush towards he to take he up not yet exclaim the doctor let he lie there till he come to let I go let I go i scream or i will raise the whole house i struggle and get away but he clinch I again somebody open the door and he release I i pick up my insensible child and when i turn my tormentor be go anxiously i bent over the little form so pale and still and when the brown eye at last open i do not know whether i be very happy all the doctor 's former persecution be renew he come morning noon and night no jealous lover ever watch a rival more closely than he watch I and the unknown slaveholder with whom he accuse I of wish to get up a intrigue when my grandmother be out of the way he search every room to find he in one of he visit he happen to find a young girl whom he have sell to a trader a few day previous he statement be that he sell she because she have be too familiar with the overseer she have have a bitter life with he and be glad to be sell she have no mother and no near tie she have be tear from all she family year before a few friend have enter into bond for she safety if the trader would allow she to spend with they the time that intervene between she sale and the gathering up of he human stock such a favor be rarely grant it save the trader the expense of board and jail fee and though the amount be small it be a weighty consideration in a slavetrader 's mind dr flint always have a aversion to meeting slave after he have sell they he order rise out of the house but he be no longer she master and she take no notice of he for once the crushed rose be the conqueror he gray eye flash angrily upon she but that be the extent of he power how come this girl here he exclaim what right have you to allow it when you know i have sell she i answer this be my grandmother 's house and rise come to see she i have no right to turn any body out of door that come here for honest purpose he give I the blow that would have fall upon rose if she have still be he slave my grandmother 's attention have be attract by loud voice and she enter in time to see a second blow deal she be not a woman to let such a outrage in she own house go unrebuked the doctor undertake to explain that i have be insolent she indignant feeling rise higher and higher and finally boil over in word get out of my house she exclaim go home and take care of you wife and child and you will have enough to do without watch my family he throw the birth of my child in she face and accuse she of sanction the life i be lead she tell he i be live with she by compulsion of he wife that he need not accuse she for he be the one to blame he be the one who have cause all the trouble she grow more and more excited as she go on i tell you what dr flint say she you be not get many more year to live and you would better be say you prayer it will take 'em all and more too to wash the dirt off you soul do you know whom you be talk to he exclaim she reply yes i know very well who i be talk to he leave the house in a great rage i look at my grandmother we eye meet they angry expression have pass away but she look sorrowful and weary -- weary of incessant strife i wonder that it do not lessen she love for I but if it do she never show it she be always kind always ready to sympathize with my trouble there might have be peace and contentment in that humble home if it have not be for the demon slavery the winter pass undisturbed by the doctor the beautiful spring come and when nature resume she loveliness the human soul be apt to revive also my drooping hope come to life again with the flower i be dream of freedom again more for my child 's sake than my own i plan and i plan obstacle hit against plan there seem no way of overcome they and yet i hope back come the wily doctor i be not at home when he call a friend have invite I to a small party and to gratify she i go to my great consternation a messenger come in haste to say that dr flint be at my grandmother 's and insist on see I they do not tell he where i be or he would have come and raise a disturbance in my friend 's house they send I a dark wrapper i throw it on and hurry home my speed do not save I the doctor have go away in anger i dread the morning but i could not delay it it come warm and bright at a early hour the doctor come and ask I where i have be last night i tell he he do not believe I and send to my friend 's house to ascertain the fact he come in the afternoon to assure I he be satisfy that i have speak the truth he seem to be in a facetious mood and i expect some jeer be come i suppose you need some recreation say he but i be surprise at you be there among those negro it be not the place for _ you _ be you _ allow _ to visit such people i understand this covert fling at the white gentleman who be my friend but i merely reply i go to visit my friend and any company they keep be good enough for I he go on to say i have see very little of you of late but my interest in you be unchanged when i say i would have no more mercy on you i be rash i recall my word linda you desire freedom for yourself and you child and you can obtain it only through I if you agree to what i be about to propose you and they shall be free there must be no communication of any kind between you and they father i will procure a cottage where you and the child can live together you labor shall be light such as sew for my family think what be offer you linda -- a home and freedom let the past be forget if i have be harsh with you at time you willfulness drive I to it you know i exact obedience from my own child and i consider you as yet a child he pause for a answer but i remain silent why do not you speak say he what more do you wait for nothing sir then you accept my offer no sir he anger be ready to break loose but he succeed in curb it and reply you have answer without

know he be not to be trust i tell he i be ready to give my answer now i will not receive it now he reply you act too much from impulse remember that you and you child can be free a week from to-day if you choose on what a monstrous chance hang the destiny of my child i know that my master 's offer be a snare and that if i enter it escape would be impossible as for he promise i know he so well that i be sure if he give I free papers they would be so manage as to have no legal value the alternative be inevitable i resolve to go to the plantation but then i think how completely i should be in he power and the prospect be appalling even if i should kneel before he and implore he to spare I for the sake of my child i know he would spurn I with he foot and my weakness would be he triumph before the week expire i hear that young mr flint be about to be marry to a lady of he own stamp i foresee the position i should occupy in he establishment i have once be send to the plantation for punishment and fear of the son have induce the father to recall I very soon my mind be make up i be resolve that i would foil my master and save my child or i would perish in the attempt i keep my plan to myself i know that friend would try to dissuade I from they and i would not wind they feeling by reject they advice on the decisive day the doctor come and say he hope i have make a wise choice i be ready to go to the plantation sir i reply have you think how important you decision be to you child say he i tell he i have very well go to the plantation and my curse go with you he reply you boy shall be put to work and he shall soon be sell and you girl shall be raise for the purpose of sell well go you own way he leave the room with curse not to be repeat as i stand root to the spot my grandmother come and say linda child what do you tell he i answer that i be go to the plantation _ must _ you go say she can not something be do to stop it i tell she it be useless to try but she beg I not to give up she say she would go to the doctor and remind he how long and how faithfully she have serve in the family and how she have take she own baby from she breast to nourish he wife she would tell he i have be out of the family so long they would not miss I that she would pay they for my time and the money would procure a woman who have more strength for the situation than i have i begged she not to go but she persist in say he will listen to _ I _ linda she go and be treat as i expect he coolly listen to what she say but deny she request he tell she that what he do be for my good that my feeling be entirely above my situation and that on the plantation i would receive treatment that be suitable to my behavior my grandmother be much cast down i have my secret hope but i must fight my battle alone i have a woman 's pride and a mother 's love for my child and i resolve that out of the darkness of this hour a brighter dawn should rise for they my master have power and law on he side i have a determine will there be might in each xvi scene at the plantation early the next morning i leave my grandmother 's with my youngest child my boy be ill and i leave he behind i have many sad thought as the old wagon jolt on hitherto i have suffer alone now my little one be to be treat as a slave as we draw near the great house i thought of the time when i be formerly send there out of revenge i wonder for what purpose i be now send i could not tell i resolve to obey order so far as duty require but within myself i determine to make my stay as short as possible mr flint be wait to receive we and tell I to follow he up stair to receive order for the day my little ellen be leave below in the kitchen it be a change for she who have always be so carefully tend my young master say she might amuse herself in the yard this be kind of he since the child be hateful to he sight my task be to fit up the house for the reception of the bride in the midst of sheet tablecloth towel drapery and carpeting my head be as busy planning as be my finger with the needle at noon i be allow to go to ellen she have sob herself to sleep i hear mr flint say to a neighbor i have get she down here and i 'll soon take the town notion out of she head my father be partly to blame for she nonsense he ought to have break she in long ago the remark be make within my hearing and it would have be quite as manly to have make it to my face he _ have _ say thing to my face which might or might not have surprise he neighbor if he have know of they he be a chip of the old block i resolve to give he no cause to accuse I of be too much of a lady so far as work be concerned i work day and night with wretchedness before I when i lay down beside my child i feel how much easier it would be to see she die than to see she master beat she about as i daily see he beat other little one the spirit of the mother be so crush by the lash that they stand by without courage to remonstrate how much more must i suffer before i should be break in to that degree i wish to appear as contented as possible sometimes i have a opportunity to send a few line home and this bring up recollection that make it difficult for a time to seem calm and indifferent to my lot notwithstanding my effort i see that mr flint regard I with a suspicious eye ellen break down under the trial of she new life separate from I with no one to look after she she wander about and in a few day cry herself sick one day she sit under the window where i be at work cry that weary cry which make a mother 's heart bleed i be oblige to steel myself to bear it after a while it cease i look out and she be go as it be near noon i venture to go down in search of she the great house be raise two foot above the ground i look under it and see she about midway fast asleep i creep under and draw she out as i hold she in my arm i think how well it would be for she if she never wake up and i utter my thought aloud i be startle to hear some one say do you speak to I i look up and see mr flint standing beside I he say nothing further but turn frown away that night he send ellen a biscuit and a cup of sweeten milk this generosity surprise I i learn afterwards that in the afternoon he have kill a large snake which creep from under the house and i suppose that incident have prompt he unusual kindness the next morning the old cart be load with shingle for town i put ellen into it and send she to she grandmother mr flint say i ought to have ask he permission i tell he the child be sick and required attention which i have no time to give he let it pass for he be aware that i have accomplish much work in a little time i have be three week on the plantation when i plan a visit home it must be at night after every body be in bed i be six mile from town and the road be very dreary i be to go with a young man who i know often steal to town to see he mother one night when all be quiet we start fear give speed to we step and we be not long in perform the journey i arrive at my grandmother 's she bed room be on the first floor and the window be open the weather be warm i speak to she and she awake she let I in and close the window lest some late passer-by should see I a light be bring and the whole household gather round I some smile and some cry i go to look at my child and thank god for they happy sleep the tear fall as i lean over they as i move to leave benny stir i turn back and whisper mother be here after digging at he eye with he little fist they open and he sit up in bed look at I curiously have satisfy himself that it be i he exclaim o mother you be not dad be you they do not cut off you head at the plantation do they my time be up too soon and my guide be wait for I i lay benny back in he bed and dry he tear by a promise to come again soon rapidly we retrace we step back to the plantation about half way we be meet by a company of four patrol luckily we hear they horse 's hoof before they come in sight and we have time to hide behind a large tree they pass hallooing and shout in a manner that indicate a recent carousal how thankful we be that they have not they dog with they we hasten we footstep and when we arrive on the plantation we hear the sound of the hand-mill the slave be grind they corn we be safely in the house before the horn summon they to they labor i divide my little parcel of food with my guide know that he have lose the chance of grind he corn and must toil all day in the field mr flint often take a inspection of the house to see that no one be idle the entire management of the work be trust to I because he know nothing about it and rather than hire a superintendent he contented himself with my arrangement he have often urge upon he father the necessity of have I at the plantation to take charge of he affair and make clothes for the slave but the old man know he too well to consent to that arrangement when i have be work a month at the plantation the great aunt of mr flint come to make he a visit this be the good old lady who pay fifty dollar for my grandmother for the purpose of make she free when she stand on the auction block my grandmother love this old lady whom we all call miss fanny she often come to take tea with we on such occasion the table be spread with a snow-white cloth and the china cup and silver spoon be take from the old-fashioned buffet there be hot muffin tea rusk and delicious sweetmeat my grandmother keep two cow and the fresh cream be miss fanny 's delight she invariably declare that it be the best in town the old lady have cosey time together they would work and chat and sometimes while talk over old time they spectacles would get dim with tear and would have to be take off and wipe when miss fanny bid we good by she bag be fill with grandmother 's best cake and she be urge to come again soon there have be a time when dr flint 's wife come to take tea with we and when she child be also send to have a feast of aunt marthy 's nice cooking but after i become a object of she jealousy and spite she be angry with grandmother for give a shelter to I and my child she would not even speak to she in the street this wound my grandmother 's feeling for she could not retain ill will against the woman whom she have nourish with she milk when a babe the doctor 's wife would gladly have prevent we intercourse with miss fanny if she could have do it but fortunately she be not dependent on the bounty of the flint she have enough to be independent and that be more than can ever be gain from charity however lavish it may be miss fanny be endear to I by many recollection and i be rejoice to see she at the plantation the warmth of she large loyal heart make the house seem pleasanter while she be in it she staid a week and i have many talk with she she say she principal object in come be to see how i be treat and whether any thing could be do for I she inquire whether she could help I in any way i tell she i believe not she condole with I in she own peculiar way say she wish that i and all my grandmother 's family be at rest in we grave for not until then should she feel any peace about we the good old soul do not dream that i be plan to bestow peace upon she with regard to myself and my child not by death but by secure we freedom again and again i have traverse those dreary twelve mile to and from the town and all the way i be meditate upon some means of escape for myself and my child my friend have make every effort that ingenuity could devise to effect we purchase but all they plan have prove abortive dr flint be suspicious and determine not to loosen he grasp upon we i could have make my escape alone but it be more for my helpless child than for myself that i long for freedom though the boon would have be precious to I above all price i would not have take it at the expense of leave they in slavery every trial i endure every sacrifice i make for they sake draw they closer to my heart and give I fresh courage to beat back the dark wave that roll and roll over I in a seemingly endless night of storm the six week be nearly complete when mr flint 's bride be expect to take possession of she new home the arrangement be all complete and mr flint say i have do well he expect to leave home on Saturday and return with he bride the follow Wednesday after receive various order from he i venture to ask permission to spend Sunday in town it be grant for which favor i be thankful it be the first i have ever ask of he and i intend it should be the last i need more than one night to accomplish the project i have in view but the whole of Sunday would give I a opportunity i spend the sabbath with my grandmother a calmer more beautiful day never come down out of heaven to I it be a day of conflict emotion perhaps it be the last day i should ever spend under that dear old shelter roof perhaps these be the last talk i should ever have with the faithful old friend of my whole life perhaps it be the last time i and my child should be together well better so i think than that they should be slave i know the doom that await my fair baby in slavery and i determine to save she from it or perish in the attempt i go to make this vow at the grave of my poor parent in the burying-ground of the slave there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest there the prisoner rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor the servant be free from he master i knelt by the grave of my parent and thank god as i have often do before that they have not live to witness my trial or to mourn over my sin i have receive my mother 's blessing when she die and in many a hour of tribulation i have seem to hear she voice sometimes chide I sometimes whisper loving word into my wounded heart i have shed many and bitter tear to think that when i be go from my child they can not remember I with such entire satisfaction as i remember my mother the graveyard be in the wood and twilight be come on nothing break the death-like stillness except the occasional twitter of a bird my spirit be overawe by the solemnity of the scene for more than ten year i have frequent this spot but never have it seem to I so sacred as now a black stump at the head of my mother 's grave be all that remain of a tree my father have plant he grave be mark by a small wooden board bear he name the letter of which be nearly obliterate i knelt down and kiss they and pour forth a prayer to god for guidance and support in the perilous step i be about to take as i pass the wreck of the old meeting house where before nat turner 's time the slave have be allow to meet for worship i seem to hear my father 's voice come from it bid I not to tarry till i reach freedom or the grave i rush on with renovate hope my trust in god have be strengthen by that prayer among the grave my plan be to conceal myself at the house of a friend and remain there a few week till the search be over my hope be that the doctor would get discourage and for fear of lose my value and also of subsequently find my child among the miss he would consent to sell we and i know somebody would buy we i have do all in my power to make my child comfortable during the time i expect to be separate from they i be pack my thing when grandmother come into the room and ask what i be do i be put my thing in order i reply i try to look and speak cheerfully but she watchful eye detect something beneath the surface she draw I towards she and ask I to sit down she look earnestly at I and say linda do you want to kill you old grandmother do you mean to leave you little helpless child i be old now and can not do for you baby as i once do for you i reply that if i go away perhaps they father would be able to secure they freedom ah my child say she do not trust too much to he stand by you own child and suffer with they till death nobody respect a mother who forsake she child and if you leave they you will never have a happy moment if you go you will make I miserable the short time i have to live you would be take and bring back and you suffering would be dreadful remember poor benjamin do give it up linda try to bear a little longer thing may turn out better than we expect my courage fail I in view of the sorrow i should bring on that faithful loving old heart i promise that i would try longer and that i would take nothing out of she house without she knowledge whenever the child climb on my knee or lay they head on my lap she would say poor little soul what would you do without a mother she do not love you as i do and she would hug they to she own bosom as if to reproach I for my want of affection but she know all the while that i love they better than my life i sleep with she that night and it be the last time the memory of it haunt I for many a year on Monday i return to the plantation and busy myself with preparation for the important day Wednesday come it be a beautiful day and the face of the slave be as bright as the sunshine the poor creature be merry they be expect little present from the bride and hope for better time under she administration i have no such hope for they i know that the young wife of slaveholder often think they authority and importance would be best establish and maintain by cruelty and what i have hear of young mr flint give I no reason to expect that she rule over they would be less severe than that of the master and overseer truly the color race be the most cheerful and forgiving people on the face of the earth that they master sleep in safety be owe to they superabundance of heart and yet they look upon they suffering with less pity than they would bestow on those of a horse or a dog i stand at the door with other to receive the bridegroom and bride she be a handsome delicate-looking girl and she face flush with emotion at sight of she new home i think it likely that vision of a happy future be rise before she it make I sad for i know how soon cloud would come over she sunshine she examine every part of the house and tell I she be delighted with the arrangement i have make i be afraid old mr flint have try to prejudice she against I and i do my best to please she all pass off smoothly for I until dinner time arrive i do not mind the embarrassment of wait on a dinner party for the first time in my life half so much as i do the meeting with dr flint and he wife who would be among the guest it be a mystery to I why mr flint have not make she appearance at the plantation during all the time i be put the house in order i have not meet she face to face for five year and i have no wish to see she now she be a pray woman and doubtless consider my present position a special answer to she prayer nothing could please she better than to see I humble and trample upon i be just where she would have I -- in the power of a hard unprincipled master she do not speak to I when she take she seat at table but she satisfied triumphant smile when i hand she plate be more eloquent than word the old doctor be not so quiet in he demonstration he order I here and there and speak with peculiar emphasis when he say you _ mistress _ i be drill like a disgraced soldier when all be over and the last key turn i seek my pillow thankful that god have appoint a season of rest for the weary the next day my new mistress begin she housekeeping i be not exactly appoint maid of all work but i be to do whatever i be tell Monday evening come it be always a busy time on that night the slave receive they weekly allowance of food three pound of meat a peck of corn and perhaps a dozen herring be allow to each man woman receive a pound and a half of meat a peck of corn and the same number of herr child over twelve year old have half the allowance of the woman the meat be cut and weigh by the foreman of the field hand and pile on plank before the meat house then the second foreman go behind the building and when the first foreman call out who take this piece of meat he answer by call somebody 's name this method be resort to as a means of prevent partiality in distribute the meat the young mistress come out to see how thing be do on she plantation and she soon give a specimen of she character among those in wait for they allowance be a very old slave who have faithfully serve the flint family through three generation when he hobble up to get he bit of meat the mistress say he be too old to have any allowance that when nigger be too old to work they ought to be feed on grass poor old man he suffer much before he find rest in the grave my mistress and i get along very well together at the end of a week old mr flint make we another visit and be closet a long time with she daughter-in-law i have my suspicion what be the subject of the conference the old doctor 's wife have be inform that i could leave the plantation on one condition and she be very desirous to keep I there if she have trust I as i deserve to be trust by she she would have have no fear of my accept that condition when she enter she carriage to return home she say to young mr flint do not neglect to send for they as quick as possible my heart be on the watch all the time and i at once conclude that she speak of my child the doctor come the next day and as i enter the room to spread the tea table i hear he say do not wait any longer send for they to-morrow i see through the plan they think my child 's be there would fetter I to the spot and that it be a good place to break we all in to abject submission to we lot as slave after the doctor leave a gentleman call who have always manifest friendly feeling towards my grandmother and she family mr flint carry he over the plantation to show he the result of labor perform by man and woman who be unpaid miserably clothe and half famish the cotton crop be all they think of it be duly admire and the gentleman return with specimen to show he

they would never think of such a thing as furnish a bed of any kind for I and my little one i therefore carry my own bed and now i be forbid to use it i do as i be order but now that i be certain my child be to be put in they power in order to give they a stronger hold on I i resolve to leave they that night i remember the grief this step would bring upon my dear old grandmother and nothing less than the freedom of my child would have induce I to disregard she advice i go about my evening work with tremble step mr flint twice call from he chamber door to inquire why the house be not lock up i reply that i have not do my work you have have time enough to do it say he take care how you answer I i shut all the window lock all the door and go up to the third story to wait till midnight how

go to sleep that night with the feeling that i be for the present the most fortunate slave in town morning come and fill my little cell with light i thank the heavenly father for this safe retreat opposite my window be a pile of feather bed on the top of these i could lie perfectly conceal and command a view of the street through which dr flint pass to he office anxious as i be i feel a gleam of satisfaction when i see he thus far i have outwit he and i triumph over it who can blame slave for be cunning they be constantly compel to resort to it it be the only weapon of the weak and oppress against the strength of they tyrant i be daily hope to hear that my master have sell my child for i know who be on the watch to buy they but dr flint care even more for revenge than he do for money my brother william and the good aunt who have serve in he family twenty year and my little benny and ellen who be a little over two year old be thrust into jail as a means of compelling my relative to give some information about I he swear my grandmother should never see one of they again till i be bring back they keep these fact from I for several day when i hear that my little one be in a loathsome jail my first impulse be to go to they i be encounter danger for the sake of free they and must i be the cause of they death the thought be agonizing my benefactress try to soothe I by tell I that my aunt would take good care of the child while they remain in jail but it add to my pain to think that the good old aunt who have always be so kind to she sister 's orphan child should be shut up in prison for no other crime than love they i suppose my friend fear a reckless movement on my part know as they do that my life be bind up in my child i receive a note from my brother william it be scarcely legible and run thus : wherever you be dear sister i beg of you not to come here we be all much better off than you be if you come you will ruin we all they would force you to tell where you have be or they would kill you take the advice of you friend if not for the sake of I and you child at least for the sake of those you would ruin poor william he also must suffer for be my brother i take he advice and keep quiet my aunt be take out of jail at the end of a month because mr flint could not spare she any longer she be tire of be she own housekeeper it be quite too fatiguing to order she dinner and eat it too my child remain in jail where brother william do all he could for they comfort betty go to see they sometimes and bring I tiding she be not permit to enter the jail but william would hold they up to the grate window while she chat with they when she repeat they prattle and tell I how they want to see they ma my tear would flow old betty would exclaim lor chile what be you cry ` bout dem young uns vil kill you dead do not be so chick 'n heart if you do you vil nebber git thro ' dis world good old soul she have go through the world childless she have never have little one to clasp they arm round she neck she have never see they soft eye look into hers no sweet little voice have call she mother she have never press she own infant to she heart with the feeling that even in fetter there be something to live for how could she realize my feeling betty 's husband love child dearly and wonder why god have deny they to he he express great sorrow when he come to betty with the tiding that ellen have be take out of jail and carry to dr flint 's she have the measles a short time before they carry she to jail and the disease have leave she eye affect the doctor have take she home to attend to they my child have always be afraid of the doctor and he wife they have never be inside of they house poor little ellen cry all day to be carry back to prison the instinct of childhood be true she know she be love in the jail she scream and sob annoy mr flint before night she call one of the slave and say here bill carry this brat back to the jail i can not stand she noise if she would be quiet i should like to keep the little minx she would make a handy waiting-maid for my daughter by and by but if she staid here with she white face i suppose i should either kill she or spoil she i hope the doctor will sell they as far as wind and water can carry they as for they mother she ladyship will find out yet what she get by run away she have not so much feeling for she child as a cow have for its calf if she have she would have come back long ago to get they out of jail and save all this expense and trouble the good-for-nothing hussy when she be catch she shall stay in jail in iron for one six month and then be sell to a sugar plantation i shall see she break in yet what do you stand there for bill why do not you go off with the brat mind now that you do not let any of the nigger speak to she in the street when these remark be report to I i smile at mr flint 's say that she should either kill my child or spoil she i think to myself there be very little danger of the latter i have always consider it as one of god 's special providence that ellen scream till she be carry back to jail that same night dr flint be call to a patient and do not return till near morning pass my grandmother 's he see a light in the house and think to himself perhaps this have something to do with linda he knock and the door be open what call you up so early say he i see you light and i think i would just stop and tell you that i have find out where linda be i know where to put my hand on she and i shall have she before twelve o'clock when he have turn away my grandmother and my uncle look anxiously at each other they do not know whether or not it be merely one of the doctor 's trick to frighten they in they uncertainty they think it be best to have a message convey to my friend betty unwilling to alarm she mistress betty resolve to dispose of I herself she come to I and tell I to rise and dress quickly we hurry down stair and across the yard into the kitchen she lock the door and lift up a plank in the floor a buffalo skin and a bit of carpet be spread for I to lie on and a quilt throw over I stay dar say she till i see if dey know ` bout you dey say dey vil put thar han on you afore twelve o'clock if dey _ do _ know whar you be dey will not know _ now _ dey 'll be disapint dis time dat 's all i get to say if dey come rummagin ` mong _ my _ ting de 'll get one bressed sarssin from dis ` ere nigger in my shallow bed i have but just room enough to bring my hand to my face to keep the dust out of my eye for betty walk over I twenty time in a hour pass from the dresser to the fireplace when she be alone i could hear she pronounce anathema over dr flint and all he tribe every now and then say with a chuckle laugh di nigger 's too cute for 'em dis time when the housemaid be about she have sly way of draw they out that i might hear what they would say she would repeat story she have hear about my be in this or that or the other place to which they would answer that i be not fool enough to be stay round there that i be in philadelphium or new york before this time when all be abed and asleep betty raise the plank and say come out chile come out dey do not know nottin ` bout you twa only white folk ' lie to skeer de niggers some day after this adventure i have a much worse fright as i sit very still in my retreat above stair cheerful vision float through my mind i think dr flint would soon get discourage and would be willing to sell my child when he lose all hope of make they the means of my discovery i know who be ready to buy they suddenly i hear a voice that chill my blood the sound be too familiar to I it have be too dreadful for I not to recognize at once my old master he be in the house and i at once conclude he have come to seize I i look round in terror there be no way of escape the voice recede i suppose the constable be with he and they be search the house in my alarm i do not forget the trouble i be bring on my generous benefactress it seem as if i be bear to bring sorrow on all who befriend I and that be the bitterest drop in the bitter cup of my life after a while i hear approach footstep the key be turn in my door i brace myself against the wall to keep from fall i venture to look up and there stand my kind benefactress alone i be too much overcome to speak and sink down upon the floor i think you would hear you master 's voice she say and know you would be terrify i come to tell you there be nothing to fear you may even indulge in a laugh at the old gentleman 's expense he be so sure you be in new york that he come to borrow five hundred dollar to go in pursuit of you my sister have some money to loan on interest he have obtain it and propose to start for new york to-night so for the present you see you be safe the doctor will merely lighten he pocket hunting after the bird he have leave behind xix the child sell the doctor come back from new york of course without accomplish he purpose he have expend considerable money and be rather dishearten my brother and the child have now be in jail two month and that also be some expense my friend think it be a favorable time to work on he discourage feeling mr sand send a speculator to offer he nine hundred dollar for my brother william and eight hundred for the two child these be high price as slave be then sell but the offer be reject if it have be merely a question of money the doctor would have sell any boy of benny 's age for two hundred dollar but he could not bear to give up the power of revenge but he be hard press for money and he revolve the matter in he mind he know that if he could keep ellen till she be fifteen he could sell she for a high price but i presume he reflect that she might die or might be steal away at all event he come to the conclusion that he have better accept the slave-trader 's offer meeting he in the street he inquire when he would leave town to-day at ten o'clock he reply ah do you go so soon say the doctor i have be reflect upon you proposition and i have conclude to let you have the three negro if you will say nineteen hundred dollar after some parley the trader agree to he term he want the bill of sale draw up and sign immediately as he have a great deal to attend to during the short time he remain in town the doctor go to the jail and tell william he would take he back into he service if he would promise to behave himself but he reply that he would rather be sell and you _ shall _ be sell you ungrateful rascal exclaim the doctor in less than a hour the money be pay the papers be sign seal and deliver and my brother and child be in the hand of the trader it be a hurry transaction and after it be over the doctor 's characteristic caution return he go back to the speculator and say sir i have come to lay you under obligation of a thousand dollar not to sell any of those negro in this state you come too late reply the trader we bargain be close he have in fact already sell they to mr sand but he do not mention it the doctor require he to put iron on that rascal bill and to pass through the back street when he take he gang out of town the trader be privately instruct to concede to he wish my good old aunt go to the jail to bid the child good by suppose they to be the speculator 's property and that she should never see they again as she hold benny in she lap he say aunt nancy i want to show you something he lead she to the door and show she a long row of mark say uncle will teach I to count i have make a mark for every day i have be here and it be sixty day it be a long time and the speculator be go to take I and ellen away he be a bad man it be wrong for he to take grandmother 's child i want to go to my mother my grandmother be tell that the child would be restore to she but she be request to act as if they be really to be send away accordingly she make up a bundle of clothes and go to the jail when she arrive she find william handcuffed among the gang and the child in the trader 's cart the scene seem too much like reality she be afraid there might have be some deception or mistake she faint and be carry home when the wagon stop at the hotel several gentleman come out and propose to purchase william but the trader refuse they offer without state that he be already sell and now come the try hour for that drive of human being drive away like cattle to be sell they know not where husband be tear from wife parent from child never to look upon each other again this side the grave there be wringing of hand and cry of despair dr flint have the supreme satisfaction of see the wagon leave town and mr flint have the gratification of suppose that my child be go as far as wind and water would carry they accord to agreement my uncle follow the wagon some mile until they come to a old farm house there the trader take the iron from william and as he do so he say you be a damned clever fellow i should like to own you myself they gentleman that want to buy you say you be a bright honest chap and i must git you a good home i guess you old master will swear to-morrow and call himself a old fool for sell the child i reckon he 'll never git they mammy back again i expect she be make track for the north good by old boy remember i have do you a good turn you must thank I by coax all the pretty gal to go with I next fall that be go to be my last trip this trading in nigger be a bad business for a fellow that be get any heart move on you fellow and the gang go on god alone know where much as i despise and detest the class of slave-trader whom i regard as the vilest wretch on earth i must do this man the justice to say that he seem to have some feeling he take a fancy to william in the jail and want to buy he when he hear the story of my child he be willing to aid they in get out of dr flint 's power even without charge the customary fee my uncle procure a wagon and carry william and the child back to town great be the joy in my grandmother 's house the curtain be close and the candle light the happy grandmother cuddle the little one to she bosom they hug she and kiss she and clap they hand and shout she kneel down and pour forth one of she heartfelt prayer of thanksgive to god the father be present for a while and though such a parental relation as exist between he and my child take slight hold on the heart or conscience of slaveholder it must be that he experience some moment of pure joy in witness the happiness he have impart i have no share in the rejoicing of that evening the event of the day have not come to my knowledge and now i will tell you something that happen to I though you will perhaps think it illustrate the superstition of slave i sit in my usual place on the floor near the window where i could hear much that be say in the street without be see the family have retire for the night and all be still i sit there think of my child when i hear a low strain of music a band of serenader be under the window play home sweet home i listen till the sound do not seem like music but like the moaning of child it seem as if my heart would burst i rise from my sit posture and kneel a streak of moonlight be on the floor before I and in the midst of it appear the form of my two child they vanish but i have see they distinctly some will

trust to he betty bid I a hurry good by and we walk off take courage linda say my friend peter i have get a dagger and no man shall take you from I unless he pass over my dead body it be a long time since i have take a walk out of door and the fresh air revive I it be also pleasant to hear a human voice speak to I above a whisper i pass several people whom i know but they do not recognize I in my disguise i prayed internally that for peter 's sake as well as my own nothing might occur to bring out he dagger we walk on till we come to the wharf my aunt nancy 's husband be a seafaring man and it have be deem necessary to let he into we secret he take I into he boat row out to a vessel not far distant and hoist I on board we three be the only occupant of the vessel i now venture to ask what they propose to do with I they say i be to remain on board till near dawn and then they would hide I in snaky swamp till my uncle phillip have prepare a place of concealment for I if the vessel have be bind north it would have be of no avail to I for it would certainly have be search about four o'clock we be again seat in the boat and row three mile to the swamp my fear of snake have be increase by the venomous bite i have receive and i dread to enter this hiding place but i be in no situation to choose and i gratefully accept the best that my poor persecute friend could do for I peter land first and with a large knife cut a path through bamboo and brier of all description he come back take I in he arm and carry I to a seat make among the bamboo before we reach it we be cover with hundred of mosquito in a hour 's time they have so poison my flesh that i be a pitiful sight to behold as the light increase i see snake after snake crawl round we i have be accustom to the sight of snake all my life but these be larger than any i have ever see to this day i shudder when i remember that morning as evening approach the number of snake increase so much that we be continually oblige to thrash they with stick to keep they from crawl over we the bamboo be so high and so thick that it be impossible to see beyond a very short distance just before it become dark we procure a seat nearer to the entrance of the swamp be fearful of lose we way back to the boat it be not long before we hear the paddle of oar and the low whistle which have be agree upon as a signal we make haste to enter the boat and be row back to the vessel i pass a wretched night for the heat of the swamp the mosquito and the constant terror of snake have bring on a burning fever i have just drop asleep when they come and tell I it be time to go back to that horrid swamp i could scarcely summon courage to rise but even those large venomous snake be less dreadful to my imagination than the white man in that community call civilized this time peter take a quantity of tobacco to burn to keep off the mosquito it produce the desire effect on they but give I nausea and severe headache at dark we return to the vessel i have be so sick during the day that peter declare i should go home that night if the devil himself be on patrol they tell I a place of concealment have be provide for I at my grandmother 's i could not imagine how it be possible to hide I in she house every nook and corner of which be know to the flint family they tell I to wait and see we be row ashore and go boldly through the street to my grandmother 's i wear my sailor 's clothes and have blacken my face with charcoal i pass several people whom i know the father of my child come so near that i brush against he arm but he have no idea who it be you must make the most of this walk say my friend peter for you may not have another very soon i think he voice sound sad it be kind of he to conceal from I what a dismal hole be to be my home for a long long time xxi the loophole of retreat a small shed have be add to my grandmother 's house year ago some board be lay across the joist at the top and between these board and the roof be a very small garret never occupy by any thing but rat and mouse it be a pent roof cover with nothing but shingle accord to the southern custom for such building the garret be only nine foot long and seven wide the highest part be three foot high and slope down abruptly to the loose board floor there be no admission for either light or air my uncle phillip who be a carpenter have very skilfully make a conceal trap-door which communicate with the storeroom he have be do this while i be wait in the swamp the storeroom open upon a piazza to this hole i be convey as soon as i enter the house the air be stifle the darkness total a bed have be spread on the floor i could sleep quite comfortably on one side but the slope be so sudden that i could not turn on my other without hit the roof the rat and mouse run over my bed but i be weary and i sleep such sleep as the wretched may when a tempest have pass over they morning come i know it only by the noise i hear for in my small den day and night be all the same i suffer for air even more than for light but i be not comfortless i hear the voice of my child there be joy and there be sadness in the sound it make my tear flow how i long to speak to they i be eager to look on they face but there be no hole no crack through which i could peep this continue darkness be oppressive it seem horrible to sit or lie in a cramped position day after day without one gleam of light yet i would have choose this rather than my lot as a slave though white people consider it a easy one and it be so compare with the fate of other i be never cruelly overworked i be never lacerate with the whip from head to foot i be never so beaten and bruise that i could not turn from one side to the other i never have my heel-strings cut to prevent my run away i be never chained to a log and force to drag it about while i toiled in the field from morning till night i be never brand with hot iron or tear by bloodhound on the contrary i have always be kindly treat and tenderly care for until i come into the hand of dr flint i have never wish for freedom till then but though my life in slavery be comparatively devoid of hardship god pity the woman who be compel to lead such a life my food be pass up to I through the trap-door my uncle have contrived and my grandmother my uncle phillip and aunt nancy would seize such opportunity as they could to mount up there and chat with I at the opening but of course this be not safe in the daytime it must all be do in darkness it be impossible for I to move in a erect position but i crawl about my den for exercise one day i hit my head against something and find it be a gimlet my uncle have leave it stick there when he make the trap-door i be as rejoice as robinson crusoe could have be at find such a treasure it put a lucky thought into my head i say to myself now i will have some light now i will see my child i do not dare to begin my work during the daytime for fear of attract attention but i groped round and have find the side next the street where i could frequently see my child i stick the gimlet in and wait for evening i bore three row of hole one above another then i bore out the interstice between i thus succeed in make one hole about a inch long and a inch broad i sit by it till late into the night to enjoy the little whiff of air that float in in the morning i watch for my child the first person i saw in the street be dr flint i have a shudder superstitious feeling that it be a bad omen several familiar face pass by at last i hear the merry laugh of child and presently two sweet little face be look up at I as though they know i be there and be conscious of the joy they impart how i long to _ tell _ they i be there my condition be now a little improved but for week i be torment by hundred of little red insect fine as a needle 's point that pierce through my skin and produce a intolerable burn the good grandmother give I herb tea and cool medicine and finally i get rid of they the heat of my den be intense for nothing but thin shingle protect I from the scorching summer 's sun but i have my consolation through my peeping-hole i could watch the child and when they be near enough i could hear they talk aunt nancy bring I all the news she could hear at dr flint 's from she i learn that the doctor have write to new york to a color woman who have be bear and raise in we neighborhood and have breathe he contaminate atmosphere he offer she a reward if she could find out any thing about I i know not what be the nature of she reply but he soon after start for new york in haste say to he family that he have business of importance to transact i peeped at he as he pass on he way to the steamboat it be a satisfaction to have mile of land and water between we even for a little while and it be a still greater satisfaction to know that he believe I to be in the free state my little den seem less dreary than it have do he return as he do from he former journey to new york without obtain any satisfactory information when he pass we house next morning benny be stand at the gate he have hear they say that he have go to find I and he call out dr flint do you bring my mother home i want to see she the doctor stamp he foot at he in a rage and exclaim get out of the way you little damned rascal if you do not i 'll cut off you head benny run terrify into the house say you can not put I in jail again i do not belong to you now it be well that the wind carry the word away from the doctor 's ear i tell my grandmother of it when we have we next conference at the trap-door and begged of she not to allow the child to be impertinent to the irascible old man autumn come with a pleasant abatement of heat my eye have become accustomed to the dim light and by hold my book or work in a certain position near the aperture i contrived to read and sew that be a great relief to the tedious monotony of my life but when winter come the cold penetrate through the thin shingle roof and i be dreadfully chill the winter there be not so long or so severe as in northern latitudes but the house be not build to shelter from cold and my little den be peculiarly comfortless the kind grandmother bring I bedclothes and warm drink often i be oblige to lie in bed all day to keep comfortable but with all my precaution my shoulder and foot be frostbitten o those long gloomy day with no object for my eye to rest upon and no thought to occupy my mind except the dreary past and the uncertain future i be thankful when there come a day sufficiently mild for I to wrap myself up and sit at the loophole to watch the passer by southerner have the habit of stop and talk in the street and i hear many conversation not intend to meet my ear i hear slave-hunter plan how to catch some poor fugitive several time i hear allusion to dr flint myself and the history of my child who perhaps be play near the gate one would say i would not move my little finger to catch she as old flint 's property another would say i 'll catch _ any _ nigger for the reward a man ought to have what belong to he if he _ be _ a damned brute the opinion be often express that i be in the free state very rarely do any one suggest that i might be in the vicinity have the least suspicion rest on my grandmother 's house it would have be burn to the ground but it be the last place they think of yet there be no place where slavery exist that could have afford I so good a place of concealment dr flint and he family repeatedly try to coax and bribe my child to tell something they have hear say about I one day the doctor take they into a shop and offer they some bright little silver piece and gay handkerchief if they would tell where they mother be ellen shrink away from he and would not speak but benny speak up and say dr flint i do not know where my mother be i guess she be in new york and when you go there again i wish you would ask she to come home for i want to see she but if you put she in jail or tell she you 'll cut she head off i 'll tell she to go right back xxii christmas festivity christmas be approach grandmother bring I material and i busied myself make some new garment and little plaything for my child be it not that hire day be near at hand and many family be fearfully look forward to the probability of separation in a few day christmas might be a happy season for the poor slave even slave mother try to gladden the heart of they little one on that occasion benny and ellen have they christmas stocking fill they imprison mother could not have the privilege of witness they surprise and joy but i have the pleasure of peeping at they as they go into the street with they new suit on i hear benny ask a little playmate whether santa claus bring he any thing yes reply the boy but santa claus be not a real man it be the child 's mother that put thing into the stocking no that can not be reply benny for santa claus bring ellen and I these new clothes and my mother have be go this long time how i long to tell he that he mother make those garment and that many a tear fall on they while she work every child rise early on christmas morning to see the johnkannaus without they christmas would be shear of its greatest attraction they consist of company of slave from the plantation generally of the lower class two athletic man in calico wrapper have a net throw over they cover with all manner of bright-colored stripe cow ' tail be fasten to they back and they head be decorate with horn a box cover with sheepskin be call the gumbo box a dozen beat on this while other strike triangle and jawbone to which band of dancer keep time for a month previous they be compose song which be sing on this occasion these company of a hundred each turn out early in the morning and be allow to go round till twelve o'clock beg for contribution not a door be leave unvisited where there be the least chance of obtain a penny or a glass of rum they do not drink while they be out but carry the rum home in jug to have a carousal these christmas donation frequently amount to twenty or thirty dollar it be seldom that any white man or child refuse to give they a trifle if he do they regale he ear with the follow song : -- poor massa so dey say down in de heel so dey say get no money so dey say not one shillin so dey say god a ` mighty bress you so dey say christmas be a day of feast both with white and colored people slave who be lucky enough to have a few shilling be sure to spend they for good eating and many a turkey and pig be capture without say by you leave sir those who can not obtain these cook a ` possum or a raccoon from which savory dish can be make my grandmother raise poultry and pig for sale and it be she established custom to have both a turkey and a pig roasted for christmas dinner on this occasion i be warn to keep extremely quiet because two guest have be invite one be the town constable and the other be a free color man who try to pass himself off for white and who be always ready to do any mean work for the sake of currying favor with white people my grandmother have a motive for invite they she manage to take they all over the house all the room on the lower floor be throw open for they to pass in and out and after dinner they be invite up stair to look at a fine mocking bird my uncle have just bring home there too the room be all throw open that they might look in when i hear they talk on the piazza my heart almost stand still i know this color man have spend many night hunting for I every body know he have the blood of a slave father in he vein but for the sake of pass himself off for white he be ready to kiss the slaveholder ' foot how i despise he as for the constable he wear no false color the duty of he office be despicable but he be superior to he companion inasmuch as he do not pretend to be what he be not any white man who could raise money enough to buy a slave would have consider himself degrade by be a constable but the office enable its possessor to exercise authority if he find any slave out after nine o'clock he could whip he as much as he like and that be a privilege to be covet when the guest be ready to depart my grandmother give each of they some of she nice pudding as a present for they wife through my peep-hole i see they go out of the gate and i be glad when it close after they so pass the first christmas in my den xxiii still in prison when spring return and i take in the little patch of green the aperture command i ask myself how many more summer and winter i must be condemn to spend thus i long to draw in a plentiful draught of fresh air to stretch my cramped limb to have room to stand erect to feel the earth under my foot again my relative be constantly on the lookout for a chance of escape but none offer that seem practicable and even tolerably safe the hot summer come again and make the turpentine drop from the thin roof over my head during the long night i be restless for want of air and i have no room to toss and turn there be but one compensation the atmosphere be so stifled that even mosquito would not condescend to buzz in it with all my detestation of dr flint i could hardly wish he a worse punishment either in this world or that which be to come than to suffer what i suffer in one single summer yet the law allow _ he _ to be out in the free air while i guiltless of crime be pent up here as the only means of avoid the cruelty the law allow he to inflict upon I i do not know what keep life within I again and again i think i should die before long but i see the leaf of another autumn whirl through the air and feel the touch of another winter in summer the most terrible thunder storm be acceptable for the rain come through the roof and i roll up my bed that it might cool the hot board under it later in the season storm sometimes wet my clothes through and through and that be not comfortable when the air grow chilly moderate storm i could keep out by fill the chink with oakum but uncomfortable as my situation be i have glimpse of thing out of door which make I thankful for my wretched hiding-place one day i see a slave pass we gate mutter it be he own and he can kill it if he will my grandmother tell I that woman 's history she mistress have that day see she baby for the first time and in the lineament of its fair face she see a likeness to she husband she turn the bondwoman and she child out of door and forbid she ever to return the slave go to she master and tell he what have happen he promise to talk with she mistress and make it all right the next day she and she baby be sell to a georgium trader another time i see a woman rush wildly by pursue by two man she be a slave the wet nurse of she mistress 's child for some trifling offence she mistress order she to be strip and whip to escape the degradation and the torture she rush to the river jump in and end she wrong in death senator brown of mississippus could not be ignorant of many such fact as these for they be of frequent occurrence in every southern state yet he stand up in the congress of the united state and declare that slavery be a great moral social and political blessing a blessing to the master and a blessing to the slave i suffer much more during the second winter than i do during the first my limb be benumb by inaction and the cold fill they with cramp i have a very painful sensation of coldness in my head even my face and tongue stiffen and i lose the power of speech of course it be impossible under the circumstance to summon any physician my brother william come and do all he could for I uncle phillip also watch tenderly over I and poor grandmother creep up and down to inquire whether there be any sign of return life i be restore to consciousness by the dashing of cold water in my face and find myself lean against my brother 's arm while he bent over I with streaming eye he afterwards tell I he think i be die for i have be in a unconscious state sixteen hour i next become delirious and be in great danger of betray myself and my friend to prevent this they stupefy I with drug i remain in bed six week weary in body and sick at heart how to get medical advice be the question william finally go to a thompsonian doctor and describe himself as have all my pain and ache he return with herb root and ointment he be especially charge to rub on the ointment by a fire but how could a fire be make in my little den charcoal in a furnace be try but there be no outlet for the gas and it nearly cost I my life afterwards coal already kindle be bring up in a iron pan and place on brick i be so weak and it be so long since i have enjoy the warmth of a fire that those few coal actually make I weep i think the medicine do I some good but my recovery be very slow dark thought pass through my mind as i lay there day after day i try to be thankful for my little cell dismal as it be and even to love it as part of the price i have pay for the redemption of my child sometimes i think god be a compassionate father who would forgive my sin for the sake of my suffering at other time it seem to I there be no justice or mercy in the divine government i ask why the curse of slavery be permit to exist and why i have be so persecute and wrong from youth upward these thing take the shape of mystery which be to this day not so clear to my soul as i trust it will be hereafter in the midst of my illness grandmother break down under the weight and anxiety and toil the idea of lose she who have always be my best friend and a mother to my child be the sorest trial i have yet have o how earnestly i pray that she might recover how hard it seem that i could not tend upon she who have so long and so tenderly watch over I one day the scream of a child nerve I with strength to crawl to my peeping-hole and i see my son cover with blood a fierce dog usually keep chained have seize and bite he a doctor be send for and i hear the groan and scream of my child while the wound be be sew up o what torture to a mother 's heart to listen to this and be unable to go to he but childhood be like a day in spring alternately shower and sunshine before night benny be bright and lively threaten the destruction of the dog and great be he delight when the doctor tell he the next day that the dog have bite another boy and be shoot benny recover from he wound but it be long before he could walk when my grandmother 's illness become know many lady who be she customer call to bring she some little comfort and to inquire whether she have every thing she want aunt nancy one night ask permission to watch with she sick mother and mr flint reply i do not see any need of you go i can not spare you but when she find other lady in the neighborhood be so attentive not wish to be outdo in christian charity she also sally forth in magnificent condescension and stand by the bedside of she who have love she in she infancy and who have be repay by such grievous wrong she seem surprised to find she so ill and scold uncle phillip for not send for dr flint she herself send for he immediately and he come secure as i be in my retreat i should have be terrify if i have know he be so near I he pronounce my grandmother in a very critical situation and say if she attend physician wish it he would visit she nobody wish to have he come to the house at all hour and we be not dispose to give he a chance to make out a long bill as mr flint go out sally tell she the reason benny be lame be that a dog have bite he i be glad of it reply she i wish he have kill he it would be good news to send to he mother _ she _ day will come the dog will grab _ she _ yet with these christian word she and she husband depart and to my great satisfaction return no more i learn from uncle phillip with feeling of unspeakable joy and gratitude that the crisis be pass and grandmother would live i could now say from my heart god be merciful he have spare I the anguish of feeling that i cause she death xxiv the candidate for congress the summer have nearly end when dr flint make a third visit to new york in search of I two candidate be run for congress and he return in season to vote the father of my child be the whig candidate the doctor have hitherto be a stanch whig but now he exert all he energy for the defeat of mr sand he invite large party of man to dine in the shade of he tree and supply they with plenty of rum and brandy if any poor fellow drown he wit in the bowl and in the openness of he convivial heart proclaim that he do not mean to vote the democratic ticket he be shove into the street without ceremony the doctor expend he liquor in vain mr sand be elect a event which occasion I some anxious thought he have not emancipate my child and if he should die they would be at the mercy of he heir two little voice that frequently meet my ear seem to plead with I not to let they father depart without strive to make they freedom secure year have pass since i have speak to he i have not even see he since the night i pass he unrecognized in my disguise of a sailor i suppose he would call before he leave to say something to my grandmother concern the child and i resolve what course to take the day before he departure for washington i make arrangement toward evening to get from my hiding-place into the storeroom below i find myself so stiff and clumsy that it be with great difficulty i could hitch from one rest place to another when i reach the storeroom my ankle give way under I and i sink exhaust on the floor it seem as if i could never use my limb again but the purpose i have in view rouse all the strength i have i crawl on my hand and knee to the window and screen behind a barrel i wait for he come the clock strike nine and i know the steamboat would leave between ten and eleven my hope be fail but presently i hear he voice say to some one wait for I a moment i wish to see aunt martha when he come out as he pass the window i say stop one moment and let I speak for my child he start hesitated and then pass on and go out of the gate i close the shutter i have partially open and sink down behind the barrel i have suffer much but seldom have i experience a keener pang than i then feel have my child then become of so little consequence to he and have he so little feeling for they wretched mother that he would not listen a moment while she plead for they painful memory be so busy within I that i forget i have not hook the shutter till i hear some one open it i look up he have come back who call I say he in a low tone i do i reply oh linda say he i know you voice but i be afraid to answer lest my friend should hear I why do you come here be it possible you risk yourself in this house they be mad to allow it i shall expect to hear that you be all ruin i do not wish to implicate he by let he know my place of concealment so i merely say i think you would come to bid grandmother good by and so i come here to speak a few word to you about emancipate my child many change may take place during the six month you be go to washington and it do not seem right for you to expose they to the risk of such change i want nothing for myself all i ask be that you will free my child or authorize some friend to do it before you go he promise he would do it and also express a readiness to make any arrangement whereby i could be purchase i hear footstep approach and close the shutter hastily i want to crawl back to my den without let the family know what i have do for i know they would deem it very imprudent but he step back into the house to tell my grandmother that he have speak with I at the storeroom window and to beg of she not to allow I to remain in the house over night he say it be the height of madness for I to be there that we should certainly all be ruin luckily he be in too much of a hurry to wait for a reply or the dear old woman would surely have tell he all i try to go back to my den but find it more difficult to go up than i have to come down now that my mission be fulfil the little strength that have support I through it be go and i sink helpless on the floor my grandmother alarm at the risk i have run come into the storeroom in the dark and lock the door behind she linda she whisper where be you i be here by the window i reply i _ could not _ have he go away without emancipate the child who know what may happen come come child say she it will not do for you to stay here another minute you have do wrong but i can not blame you poor thing i tell she i could not return without assistance and she must call my uncle uncle phillip come and pity prevent he from scold I he carry I back to my dungeon lay I tenderly on the bed give I some medicine and ask I if there be any thing more he could do then he go away and i be leave with my own thought -- starless as the midnight darkness around I my friend fear i should become a cripple for life and i be so weary of my long imprisonment that have it not be for the hope of serve my child i should have be thankful to die but for they sake i be willing to bear on xxv competition in cunning dr flint have not give I up every now and then he would say to my grandmother that i would yet come back and voluntarily surrender myself and that when i do i could be purchase by my relative or any one who wish to buy I i know he cunning nature too well not to perceive that this be a trap lay for I and so all my friend understand it i resolve to match my cunning against he cunning in order to make he believe that i be in new york i resolve to write he a letter date from that

dr flint would be sure to come and ask she to have he sit near a certain door and leave it open that i might hear what he say the next morning i take my station within sound of that door and remain motionless as a statue it be not long before i hear the gate slam and the well-known footstep enter the house he seat himself in the chair that be place for he and say well martha i have bring you a letter from linda she have send I a letter also i know exactly where to find she but i do not choose to go to boston for she i have rather she would come back of she own accord in a respectable manner she uncle phillip be the best person to go for she with _ he _ she would feel perfectly free to act i be willing to pay he expense go and return she shall be sell to she friend she child be free at least i suppose they be and when you obtain she freedom you 'll make a happy family i suppose martha you have no objection to my read to you the letter linda have write to you he break the seal and i hear he read it the old villain he have suppress the letter i write to grandmother and prepare a substitute of he own the purport of which be as follow : -- dear grandmother : i have long want to write to you but the disgraceful manner in which i leave you and my child make I ashamed to do it if you know how much i have suffer since i run away you would pity and forgive I i have purchase freedom at a dear rate if any arrangement could be make for I to return to the south without be a slave i would gladly come if not i beg of you to send my child to the north i can not live any longer without they let I know in time and i will meet they in new york or philadelphium whichever place best suit my uncle 's convenience write as soon as possible to you unhappy daughter linda it be very much as i expect it would be say the old hypocrite rise to go you see the foolish girl have repent of she rashness and want to return we must help she to do it martha talk with phillip about it if he will go for she she will trust to he and come back i should like a answer to-morrow good morning martha as he step out on the piazza he stumble over my little girl ah ellen be that you he say in he most gracious manner i do not see you how do you do pretty well sir she reply i hear you tell grandmother that my mother be come home i want to see she yes ellen i be go to bring she home very soon rejoin he and you shall see she as much as you like you little curly-headed nigger this be as good as a comedy to I who have hear it all but grandmother be frightened and distressed because the doctor want my uncle to go for I the next evening dr flint call to talk the matter over my uncle tell he that from what he have hear of massachusett he judge he should be mob if he go there after a runaway slave all stuff and nonsense phillip reply the doctor do you suppose i want you to kick up a row in boston the business can all be do quietly linda write that she want to come back you be she relative and she would trust _ you _ the case would be different if i go she might object to come with _ I _ and the damned abolitionist if they know i be she master would not believe I if i tell they she have beg to go back they would get up a row and i should not like to see linda drag through the street like a common negro she have be very ungrateful to I for all my kindness but i forgive she and want to act the part of a friend towards she i have no wish to hold she as my slave she friend can buy she as soon as she arrive here find that he argument fail to convince my uncle the doctor let the cat out of the bag by say that he have write to the mayor of boston to ascertain whether there be a person of my description at the street and number from which my letter be date he have omit this date in the letter he have make up to read to my grandmother if i have date from new york the old man would probably have make another journey to that city but even in that dark region where knowledge be so carefully exclude from the slave i have hear enough about massachusett to come to the conclusion that slaveholder do not consider it a comfortable place to go in search of a runaway that be before the fugitive slave law be pass before massachusett have consent to become a nigger hunter for the south my grandmother who have become skittish by see she family always in danger come to I with a very distressed countenance and say what will you do if the mayor of boston send he word that you have not be there then he will suspect the letter be a trick and maybe he 'll find out something about it and we shall all get into trouble o linda i wish you have never send the letter do not worry yourself grandmother say i the mayor of boston will not trouble himself to hunt nigger for dr flint the letter will do good in the end i shall get out of this dark hole some time or other i hope you will child reply the good patient old friend you have be here a long time almost five year but whenever you do go it will break you old grandmother 's heart i should be expect every day to hear that you be bring back in iron and put in jail god help you poor child let we be thankful that some time or other we shall go ` where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary be at rest ' my heart respond amen the fact that dr flint have write to the mayor of boston convinced I that he believe my letter to be genuine and of course that he have no suspicion of my be any where in the vicinity it be a great object to keep up this delusion for it make I and my friend feel less anxious and it would be very convenient whenever there be a chance to escape i resolve therefore to continue to write letter from the north from time to time two or three week pass and as no news come from the mayor of boston grandmother begin to listen to my entreaty to be allow to leave my cell sometimes and exercise my limb to prevent my become a cripple i be allow to slip down into the small storeroom early in the morning and remain there a little while the room be all fill up with barrel except a small open space under my trap-door this face the door the upper part of which be of glass and purposely leave uncurtained that the curious might look in the air of this place be close but it be so much better than the atmosphere of my cell that i dread to return i come down as soon as it be light and remain till eight o'clock when people begin to be about and there be danger that some one might come on the piazza i have try various application to bring warmth and feeling into my limb but without avail they be so numb and stiff that it be a painful effort to move and have my enemy come upon I during the first morning i try to exercise they a little in the small unoccupied space of the storeroom it would have be impossible for I to have escape xxvi important era in my brother 's life i miss the company and kind attention of my brother william who have go to washington with he master mr sand we receive several letter from he write without any allusion to I but express in such a manner that i know he do not forget I i disguise my hand and write to he in the same manner it be a long session and when it close william write to inform we that mr sand be go to the north to be go some time and that he be to accompany he i know that he master have promise to give he he freedom but no time have be specify would william trust to a slave 's chance i remember how we use to talk together in we young day about obtain we freedom and i think it very doubtful whether he would come back to we grandmother receive a letter from mr sand say that william have prove a most faithful servant and he would also say a value friend that no mother have ever train a better boy he say he have travel through the northern state and canada and though the abolitionist have try to decoy he away they have never succeed he end by say they should be at home shortly we expect letter from william describe the novelty of he journey but none come in time it be report that mr sand would return late in the autumn accompany by a bride still no letter from william i feel almost sure i should never see he again on southern soil but have he no word of comfort to send to he friend at home to the poor captive in she dungeon my thought wander through the dark past and over the uncertain future alone in my cell where no eye but god 's could see I i weep bitter tear how earnestly i pray to he to restore I to my child and enable I to be a useful woman and a good mother at last the day arrive for the return of the traveller grandmother have make loving preparation to welcome she absent boy back to the old hearthstone when the dinner table be lay william 's place occupy its old place the stage coach go by empty my grandmother wait dinner she think perhaps he be necessarily detain by he master in my prison i listen anxiously expect every moment to hear my dear brother 's voice and step in the course of the afternoon a lad be send by mr sand to tell grandmother that william do not return with he that the abolitionist have decoy he away but he beg she not to feel troubled about it for he feel confident she would see william in a few day as soon as he have time to reflect he would come back for he could never expect to be so well off at the north as he have be with he if you have see the tear and hear the sob you would have think the messenger have bring tiding of death instead of freedom poor old grandmother feel that she should never see she darling boy again and i be selfish i think more of what i have lose than of what my brother have gain a new anxiety begin to trouble I mr sand have expend a good deal of money and would naturally feel irritated by the loss he have incur i greatly fear this might injure the prospects of my child who be now become valuable property i long to have they emancipation make certain the more so because they master and father be now marry i be too familiar with slavery not to know that promise make to slave though with kind intention and sincere at the time depend upon many contingency for they fulfillment much as i wish william to be free the step he have take make I sad and anxious the follow sabbath be calm and clear so beautiful that it seem like a sabbath in the eternal world my grandmother bring the child out on the piazza that i might hear they voice she think it would comfort I in my despondency and it do they chat merrily as only child can benny say grandmother do you think uncle will have go for good will not he ever come back again may be he 'll find mother if he do _ will not _ she be glad to see he why do not you and uncle phillip and all of we go and live where mother be i should like it would not you ellen yes i should like it reply ellen but how could we find she do you know the place grandmother i do not remember how mother look -- do you benny benny be just begin to describe I when they be interrupt by a old slave woman a near neighbor name aggie this poor creature have witness the sale of she child and see they carry off to part unknown without any hope of ever hear from they again she see that my grandmother have be weep and she say in a sympathizing tone what be the matter aunt marthy o aggie she reply it seem as if i should not have any of my child or grandchild leave to hand I a drink when i be die and lay my old body in the ground my boy do not come back with mr sand he staid at the north poor old aggie clap she hand for joy be _ dat _ what you 's cry fur she exclaim git down on you knee and bress de lord i do not know whar my poor chillern be and i nebber ` spect to know you do not know whar poor linda 's go to but you _ do _ know whar she brudder be he be in free part and dat 's de right place do not murmur at de lord 's doings but git down on you knee and tank he for he goodness my selfishness be rebuke by what poor aggie say she rejoice over the escape of one who be merely she fellow-bondman while he own sister be only think what he good fortune might cost she child i knelt and pray god to forgive I and i thank he from my heart that one of my family be save from the grasp of slavery it be not long before we receive a letter from william he write that mr sand have always treat he kindly and that he have try to do he duty to he faithfully but ever since he be a boy he have long to be free and he have already go through enough to convince he he have better not lose the chance that offer he conclude by say do not worry about I dear grandmother i shall think of you always and it will spur I on to work hard and try to do right when i have earn money enough to give you a home perhaps you will come to the north and we can all live happy together mr sand tell my uncle phillip the particulars about william 's leave he he say i trust he as if he be my own brother and treat he as kindly the abolitionist talk to he in several place but i have no idea they could tempt he however i do not blame william he be young and inconsiderate and those northern rascal decoy he i must confess the scamp be very bold about it i meet he come down the step of the astor house with he trunk on he shoulder and i ask he where he be go he say he be go to change he old trunk i tell he it be rather shabby and ask if he do not need some money he say no thank I and go off he do not return so soon as i expect but i wait patiently at last i go to see if we trunk be packed ready for we journey i find they lock and a sealed note on the table inform I where i could find the key the fellow even try to be religious he write that he hope god would always bless I and reward I for my kindness that he be not unwilling to serve I but he want to be a free man and that if i think he do wrong he hope i would forgive he i intend to give he he freedom in five year he might have trust I he have show himself ungrateful but i shall not go for he or send for he i feel confident that he will soon return to I i afterwards hear a account of the affair from william himself he have not be urge away by abolitionist he need no information they could give he about slavery to stimulate he desire for freedom he look at he hand and remember that they be once in iron what security have he that they would not be so again mr sand be kind to he but he might indefinitely postpone the promise he have make to give he he freedom he might come under pecuniary embarrassment and he property be seize by creditor or he might die without make any arrangement in he favor he have too often known such accident to happen to slave who have kind master and he wisely resolve to make sure of the present opportunity to own himself he be scrupulous about take any money from he master on false pretence so he sell he best clothes to pay for he passage to boston the slaveholder pronounce he a base ungrateful wretch for thus requite he master 's indulgence what would _ they _ have do under similar circumstance when dr flint 's family hear that william have desert mr sand they chuckle greatly over the news mr flint make she usual manifestation of christian feeling by say i be glad of it i hope he 'll never get he again i like to see people pay back in they own coin i reckon linda 's child will have to pay for it i should be glad to see they in the speculator 's hand again for i be tired of see those little nigger march about the street xxvii new destination for the child mr flint proclaim she intention of inform mr sand who be the father of my child she likewise propose to tell she what a artful devil i be that i have make a great deal of trouble in she family that when mr sand be at the north she do not doubt i have follow he in disguise and persuade william to run away she have some reason to entertain such a idea for i have write from the north from time to time and i date my letter from various place many of they fall into dr flint 's hand as i expect they would and he must have come to the conclusion that i travel about a good deal he keep a close watch over my child think they would eventually lead to my detection a new and unexpected trial be in store for I one day when mr sand and he wife be walk in the street they meet benny the lady take a fancy to he and exclaim what a pretty little negro whom do he belong to benny do not hear the answer but he come home very indignant with the stranger lady because she have call he a negro a few day afterwards mr sand call on my grandmother and tell she he want she to take the child to he house he say he have inform he wife of he relation to they and tell she they be motherless and she want to see they when he have go my grandmother come and ask what i would do the question seem a mockery what _ could _ i do they be mr sand 's slave and they mother be a slave whom he have represent to be dead perhaps he think i be i be too much pained and puzzle to come to any decision and the child be carry without my knowledge mr sand have a sister from illinoi staying with she this lady who have no child of she own be so much pleased with ellen that she offer to adopt she and bring she up as she would a daughter mr sand want to take benjamin when grandmother report this to I i be try almost beyond endurance be this all i be to gain by what i have suffer for the sake of have my child free true the prospect _ seem _ fair but i know too well how lightly slaveholder hold such parental relation if pecuniary trouble should come or if the new wife require more money than could conveniently be spare my child might be think of as a convenient means of raise fund i have no trust in thee o slavery never should i know peace till my child be emancipate with all due formality of law i be too proud to ask mr sand to do any thing for my own benefit but i could bring myself to become a supplicant for my child i resolve to remind he of the promise he have make I and to throw myself upon he honor for the performance of it i persuade my grandmother to go to he and tell he i be not dead and that i earnestly entreat he to keep the promise he have make I that i have hear of the recent proposal concern my child and do not feel easy to accept they that he have promise to emancipate they and it be time for he to redeem he pledge i know there be some risk in thus betray that i be in the vicinity but what will not a mother do for she child he receive the message with surprise and say the child be free i have never intend to claim they as slave linda may decide they fate in my opinion they have better be send to the north i do not think they be quite safe here dr flint boast that they be still in he power he say they be he daughter 's property and as she be not of age when they be sell the contract be not legally bind so then after all i have endure for they sake my poor child be between two fire between my old master and they new master and i be powerless there be no protect arm of the law for I to invoke mr sand propose that ellen should go for the present to some of he relative who have remove to brooklyn long island it be promise that she should be well take care of and send to school i consent to it as the best arrangement i could make for she my grandmother of course negotiate it all and mr sand know of no other person in the transaction she propose that they should take ellen with they to washington and keep she till they have a good chance of send she with friend to brooklyn she have a infant daughter i have have a glimpse of it as the nurse pass with it in she arm it be not a pleasant thought to I that the bondwoman 's child should tend she free-born sister but there be no alternative ellen be make ready for the journey o how it try my heart to send she away so young alone among stranger without a mother 's love to shelter she from the storm of life almost without memory of a mother i doubt whether she and benny would have for I the natural affection that child feel for a parent i think to myself that i might perhaps never see my daughter again and i have a great desire that she should look upon I before she go that she might take my image with she in she memory it seem to I cruel to have she bring to my dungeon it be sorrow enough for she young heart to know that she mother be a victim of slavery without see the wretched hiding-place to which it have drive she i begged permission to pass the last night in one of the open chamber with my little girl they think i be crazy to think of trust such a young child with my perilous secret i tell they i have watch she character and i feel sure she would not betray I that i be determine to have a interview and if they would not facilitate it i would take my own way to obtain it they remonstrate against the rashness of such a proceeding but find they could not change my purpose they yield i slip through the trap-door into the storeroom and my uncle keep watch at the gate while i pass into the piazza and go up stair to the room i use to occupy it be more than five year since i have see it and how the memory crowd on I there i have take shelter when my mistress drive I from she house there come my old tyrant to mock insult and curse I there my child be first lay in my arm there i have watch over they each day with a deeper and sadder love there i have kneel to god in anguish of heart to forgive the wrong i have do how vividly it all come back and after this long gloomy interval i stand there such a wreck in the midst of these meditation i hear footstep on the stair the door open and my uncle phillip come in lead ellen by the hand i put my arm round she and say ellen my dear child i be you mother she draw back a little and look at I then with sweet confidence she lay she cheek against mine and i fold she to the heart that have be so long desolate she be the first to speak raise she head she say inquiringly you really _ be _ my mother i tell she i really be that during all the long time she have not see I i have love she most tenderly and that now she be go away i want to see she and talk with she that she might remember I with a sob in she voice she say i be glad you have come to see I but why do not you ever come before benny and i have want so much to see you he remember you and sometimes he tell I about you why do not you come home when dr flint go to bring you i answer i could not come before dear but now that i be with you tell I whether you like to go away i do not know say she cry grandmother say i ought not to cry that i be go to a good place where i can learn to read and write and that by and by i can write she a letter but i sha not have benny or grandmother or uncle phillip or any body to love I can not you go with I o _ do _ go dear mother i tell she i could not go now but sometime i would come to she and then she and benny and i would live together and have happy time she want to run and bring benny to see I now i tell she he be go to the north before long with uncle phillip and then i would come to see he before he go away i ask if she would like to have I stay all night and sleep with she o yes she reply then turn to she uncle she say pleadingly _ may _ i stay please uncle she be my own mother he lay he hand on she head and say solemnly ellen this be the secret you have promise grandmother never to tell if you ever speak of it to any body they will never let you see you grandmother again and you mother can never come to brooklyn uncle she reply i will never tell he tell she she might stay with I and when he have go i take she in my arm and tell she i be a slave and that be the reason she must never say she have see I i exhorted she to be a good child to try to please the people where she be go and that god would raise she up friend i tell she to say she prayer and remember always to pray for she poor mother and that god would permit we to meet again she weep and i do not check she tear perhaps she would never again have a chance to pour she tear into a mother 's bosom all night she nestle in my arm and i have no inclination to slumber the moment be too precious to lose any of they once when i think she be asleep i kiss she forehead softly and she say i be not asleep dear mother before dawn they come to take I back to my den i draw aside the window curtain to take a last look of my child the moonlight shone on she face and i bent over she as i have do year before that wretched night when i run away i hug she close to my throbbing heart and tear too sad for such young eye to shed flow down she cheek as she give she last kiss and whisper in my ear mother i will never tell and she never do when i get back to my den i throw myself on the bed and weep there alone in the darkness it seem as if my heart would burst when the time for ellen 's departure draw nigh i could hear neighbor and friend say to she good by ellen i hope you poor mother will find you out _ will not _ you be glad to see she she reply yes ma'am and they little dream of the weighty secret that weigh down she young heart she be a affectionate child but naturally very reserve except with those she love and i feel secure that my secret would be safe with she i hear the gate close after she with such feeling as only a slave mother can experience during the day my meditation be very sad sometimes i fear i have be very selfish not to give up all claim to she and let she go to illinoi to be adopt by mr sand 's sister it be my experience of slavery that decide I against it i fear that circumstance might arise that would cause she to be send back i feel confident that i should go to new york myself and then i should be able to watch over she and in some degree protect she dr flint 's family know nothing of the propose arrangement till after ellen be go and the news displeased they greatly mr flint call on mr sand 's sister to inquire into the matter she express she opinion very freely as to the respect mr sand show for he wife and for he own character in acknowledge those young nigger and as for send ellen away she pronounce it to be just as much stealing as it would be for he to come and take a piece of furniture out of she parlor she say she daughter be not of age to sign the bill of sale and the child be she property and when she become of age or be marry she could take they wherever she could lay hand on they miss emily flint the little girl to whom i have be bequeath be now in she sixteenth year she mother consider it all right and honorable for she or she future husband to steal my child but she do not understand how any body could hold up they head in respectable society after they have purchase they own child as mr sand have do dr flint say very little perhaps he think that benny would be less likely to be send away if he keep quiet one of my letter that fall into he hand be date from canada and he seldom speak of I now this state of thing enable I to slip down into the storeroom more frequently where i could stand upright and move my limb more freely day week and month pass and there come no news of ellen i send a letter to brooklyn write in my grandmother 's name to inquire whether she have arrive there answer be return that she have not i write to she in washington but no notice be take of it there be one person there who ought to have have some sympathy with the anxiety of the child 's friend at home but the link of such relation as he have form with I be easily break and cast away as rubbish yet how protectingly and persuasively he once talk to the poor helpless slave girl and how entirely i trust he but now suspicion darken my mind be my child dead or have they deceive I and sell she if the secret memoirs of many member of congress should be publish curious detail would be unfold i once see a letter from a member of congress to a slave who be the mother of six of he child he write to request that she would send she child away from the great house before he return as he expect to be accompany by friend the woman could not read and be oblige to employ another to read the letter the existence of the colored child do not trouble this gentleman it be only the fear that friend might recognize in they feature a resemblance to he at the end of six month a letter come to my grandmother from brooklyn it be write by a young lady in the family and announce that ellen have just arrive it contain the follow message from she : i do try to do just as you tell I to and i pray for you every night and morning i understand that these word be mean for I and they be a balsam to my heart the writer close she letter by say ellen be a nice little girl and we shall like to have she with we my cousin mr sand have give she to I to be my little wait maid i shall send she to school and i hope some day she will write to you herself this letter perplexed and troubled I have my child 's father merely place she there till she be old enough to support herself or have he give she to he cousin as a piece of property if the last idea be correct he cousin might return to the south at any time and hold ellen as a slave i try to put away from I the painful thought that such a foul wrong could have be do to we i say to myself surely there must be _ some _ justice in man then i remember with a sigh how slavery pervert all the natural feeling of the human heart it give I a pang to look on my light-hearted boy he believe himself free and to have he bring under the yoke of slavery would be more than i could bear how i long to have he safely out of the reach of its power xxviii aunt nancy i have mention my great-aunt who be a slave in dr flint 's family and who have be my refuge during the shameful persecution i suffer from he this aunt have be marry at twenty year of age that be as far as slave _ can _ marry she have the consent of she master and mistress and a clergyman perform the ceremony but it be a mere form without any legal value she master or mistress could annul it any day they please she have always sleep on the floor in the entry near mr flint 's chamber door that she might be within call when she be marry she be tell she might have the use of a small room in a outhouse she mother and she husband furnish it he be a seafaring man and be allow to sleep there when he be at home but on the wedding evening the bride be order to she old post on the entry floor mr flint at that time have no child but she be expect to be a mother and if she should want a drink of water in the night what could she do without she slave to bring it so my aunt be compel to lie at she door until one midnight she be force to leave to give premature birth to a child in a fortnight she be require to resume she place on the entry floor because mr flint 's babe need she attention she keep she station there through summer and winter until she have give premature birth to six child and all the while she be employ as night-nurse to mr flint 's child finally toiling all day and be deprive of rest at night completely break down she constitution and dr flint declare it be impossible she could ever become the mother of a living child the fear of lose so valuable a servant by death now induce they to allow she to sleep in she little room in the out-house except when there be sickness in the family she afterwards have two feeble babe one of whom die in a few day and the other in four week i well remember she patient sorrow as she hold the last dead baby in she arm i wish it could have live she say

the _ factotum _ of the household nothing go on well without she she be my mother 's twin sister and as far as be in she power she supply a mother 's place to we orphan i sleep with she all the time i live in my old master 's house and the bond between we be very strong when my friend try to discourage I from run away she always encourage I when they think i have better return and ask my master 's pardon because there be no possibility of escape she send I word never to yield she say if i persevered i might perhaps gain the freedom of my child and even if i perished in do it that be better than to leave they to groan under the same persecution that have blighted my own life after i be shut up in my dark cell she steal away whenever she could to bring I the news and say something cheer how often do i kneel down to listen to she word of consolation whisper through a crack i be old and have not long to live she use to say and i could die happy if i could only see you and the child free you must pray to god linda as i do for you that he will lead you out of this darkness i would beg she not to worry herself on my account that there be a end of all suffer sooner or later and that whether i live in chain or in freedom i should always remember she as the good friend who have be the comfort of my life a word from she always strengthen I and not I only the whole family rely upon she judgement and be guide by she advice i have be in my cell six year when my grandmother be summon to the bedside of this she last remain daughter she be very ill and they say she would die

have always be devote to each other and now they sit look into each other 's eye longing to speak of the secret that have weigh so much on the heart of both my aunt have be stricken with paralysis she live but two day and the last day she be speechless before she lose the power of utterance she tell she mother not to grieve if she could not speak to she that she would try to hold up she hand to let

he say she have always be a faithful servant and they should never be able to supply she place mr flint take to she bed quite overcome by the shock while my grandmother sit alone with the dead the

that drive linda away my grandchild be go and of my nine child only one be leave god help I to I the death of this kind relative be a inexpressible sorrow i know that she have be slowly murder and i feel that my trouble have help to finish the work after i hear of she illness i listen constantly to hear what news be bring from the great house and the thought that i could not go to she make I utterly miserable at last as uncle phillip come into the house i hear some one inquire how be she and he answer she be dead my little cell seem whirling round and i know nothing more till i open my eye and find uncle phillip bend over I i have no need to ask any question he whisper linda she die happy i could not weep my fix gaze troubled he do not look _ so _ he say do not add to my poor mother 's trouble remember how much she have to bear and that we ought to do all we can to comfort she ah yes that bless old grandmother who for seventy-three year have bear the pelt storm of a slave-mother 's life she do indeed need consolation mr flint have render she poor foster-sister childless apparently without any compunction and with cruel selfishness have ruin she health by year of incessant unrequited toil and broken rest but now she become very sentimental i suppose she think it would be a beautiful illustration of the attachment exist between slaveholder and slave if the body of she old worn-out servant be bury at she foot she send for the clergyman and ask if he have any objection to bury aunt nancy in the doctor 's family burial-place no color person have ever be allow interment in the white people 's burying-ground and the minister know that all the decease of you family repose together in the old graveyard of the slave he therefore reply i have no objection to comply with you wish but perhaps aunt nancy 's _ mother _ may have some choice as to where she remains shall be deposit it have never occur to mr flint that slave could have any feeling when my grandmother be consult she at once say she want nancy to lie with all the rest of she family and where she own old body would be bury mr flint graciously comply with she wish though she say it be painful to she to have nancy bury away from _ she _ she might have add with touching pathos i be so long _ use _ to sleep with she lie near I on the entry floor my uncle phillip ask permission to bury he sister at he own expense and slaveholder be always ready to grant _ such _ favor to slave and they relative the arrangement be very plain but perfectly respectable she be bury on the sabbath and mr flint 's minister read the funeral service there be a large concourse of color people bond and free and a few white person who have always be friendly to we family dr flint 's carriage be in the procession and when the body be deposit in its humble rest place the mistress drop a tear and return to she carriage probably think she have perform she duty nobly it be talk of by the slave as a mighty grand funeral northern traveller pass through the place might have describe this tribute of respect to the humble dead as a beautiful feature in the patriarchal institution a touch proof of the attachment between slaveholder and they servant and tender-hearted mr flint would have confirm this impression with handkerchief at she eye _ we _ could have tell they a different story we could have give they a chapter of wrong and suffering that would have touch they heart if they _ have _ any heart to feel for the color people we could have tell they how the poor old slave-mother have toil year after year to earn eight hundred dollar to buy she son phillip 's right to he own earnings and how that same phillip pay the expense of the funeral which they regard as do so much credit to the master we could also have tell they of a poor blighted young creature shut up in a living grave for year to avoid the torture that would be inflict on she if she venture to come out and look on the face of she depart friend all this and much more i thought of as i sit at my loophole wait for the family to return from the grave sometimes weep sometimes fall asleep dream strange dream of the dead and the live it be sad to witness the grief of my bereaved grandmother she have always be strong to bear and now as ever religious faith support she but she dark life have become still darker and age and trouble be leave deep trace on she withered face she have four place to knock for I to come to the trapdoor and each place have a different meaning she now come oftener than she have do and talk to I of she dead daughter while tear trickle slowly down she furrowed cheek i say all i could to comfort she but it be a sad reflection that instead of be able to help she i be a constant source of anxiety and trouble the poor old back be fit to its burden it bent under it but do not break xxix preparation for escape i hardly expect that the reader will credit I when i affirm that i live in that little dismal hole almost deprive of light and air and with no space to move my limb for nearly seven year but it be a fact and to I a sad one even now for my body still suffer from the effect of that long imprisonment to say nothing of my soul member of my family now live in new york and boston can testify to the truth of what i say countless be the night that i sit late at the little loophole scarcely large enough to give I a glimpse of one twinkling star there hear the patrol and slave-hunter confer together about the capture of runaway well know how rejoice they would be to catch I season after season year after year i peeped at my child 's face and hear they sweet voice with a heart yearning all the while to say you mother be here sometimes it appear to I as if age have roll away since i enter upon that gloomy monotonous existence at time i be stupefy and listless at other time i become very impatient to know when these dark year would end and i should again be allow to feel the sunshine and breathe the pure air after ellen leave we this feeling increase mr sand have agree that benny might go to the north whenever he uncle phillip could go with he and i be anxious to be there also to watch over my child and protect they so far as i be able moreover i be likely to be drown out of my den if i remain much longer for the slight roof be get badly out of repair and uncle phillip be afraid to remove the shingle lest some one should get a glimpse of I when storm occur in the night they spread mat and bit of carpet which in the morning appear to have be lay out to dry but to cover the roof in the daytime might have attract attention consequently my clothes and bedding be often drench a process by which the pain and ache in my cramped and stiffened limb be greatly increase i revolve various plan of escape in my mind which i sometimes impart to my grandmother when she come to whisper with I at the trap-door the kind-hearted old woman have a intense sympathy for runaway she have know too much of the cruelty inflict on those who be capture she memory always fly back at once to the suffering of she bright and handsome son benjamin the youngest and dearest of she flock so whenever i allude to the subject she would groan out o do not think of it child you 'll break my heart i have no good old aunt nancy now to encourage I but my brother william and my child be continually beckon I to the north and now i must go back a few month in my story i have state that the first of January be the time for sell slave or lease they out to new master if time be count by heart-throb the poor slave might reckon year of suffer during that festival so joyous to the free on the new year 's day precede my aunt 's death one of my friend name fanny be to be sell at auction to pay she master 's debt my thought be with she during all the day and at night i anxiously inquire what have be she fate i be tell that she have be sell to one master and she four little girl to another master far distant that she have escape from she purchaser and be not to be find she mother be the old aggie i have speak of she live in a small tenement belong to my grandmother and build on the same lot with she own house she dwelling be search and watch and that bring the patrol so near I that i be oblige to keep very close in my den the hunter be somehow elude and not long afterwards benny accidentally catch sight of fanny in she mother 's hut he tell he grandmother who charge he never to speak of it explain to he the frightful consequence and he never betray the trust aggie little dream that my grandmother know where she daughter be conceal and that the stoop form of she old neighbor be bend under a similar burden of anxiety and fear but these dangerous secret deepen the sympathy between the two old persecute mother my friend fanny and i remain many week hide within call of each other but she be unconscious of the fact i long to have she share my den which seem a more secure retreat than she own but i have bring so much trouble on my grandmother that it seem wrong to ask she to incur greater risk my restlessness increase i have live too long in bodily pain and anguish of spirit always i be in dread that by some accident or some contrivance slavery would succeed in snatch my child from I this think drive I nearly frantic and i determine to steer for the north star at all hazard at this crisis providence open a unexpected way for I to escape my friend peter come one evening and ask to speak with I you day have come linda say he i have find a chance for you to go to the free state you have a fortnight to decide the news seem too good to be true but peter explain he arrangement and tell I all that be necessary be for I to say i would go i be go to answer he with a joyful yes when the thought of benny come to my mind i tell he the temptation be exceedingly strong but i be terribly afraid of dr flint 's alleged power over my child and that i could not go and leave he behind peter remonstrate earnestly he say such a good chance might never occur again that benny be free and could be send to I and that for the sake of my child 's welfare i ought not to hesitate a moment i tell he i would consult with uncle phillip my uncle rejoice in the plan and bid I go by all means he promise if he life be spare that he would either bring or send my son to I as soon as i reach a place of safety i resolve to go but think nothing have better be say to my grandmother till very near the time of departure but my uncle think she would feel it more keenly if i leave here so suddenly i will reason with she say he and convince she how necessary it be not only for you sake but for hers also you can not be blind to the fact that she be sink under she burden i be not blind to it i know that my concealment be a ever-present source of anxiety and that the older she grow the more nervously fearful she be of discovery my uncle talk with she and finally succeed in persuade she that it be absolutely necessary for I to seize the chance so unexpectedly offer the anticipation of be a free woman prove almost too much for my weak frame the excitement stimulate I and at the same time bewilder I i make busy preparation for my journey and for my son to follow I i resolve to have a interview with he before i go that i might give he caution and advice and tell he how anxiously i should be wait for he at the north grandmother steal up to I as often as possible to whisper word of counsel she insist upon write to dr flint as soon as i arrive in the free state and ask he to sell I to she she say she would sacrifice she house and all she have in the world for the sake of have I safe with my child in any part of the world if she could only live to know _ that _ she could die in peace i promise the dear old faithful friend that i would write to she as soon as i arrive and put the letter in a safe way to reach she but in my own mind i resolve that not another cent of she hard earnings should be spend to pay rapacious slaveholder for what they call they property and even if i have not be unwilling to buy what i have already a right to possess common humanity would have prevent I from accept the generous offer at the expense of turn my aged relative out of house and home when she be tremble on the brink of the grave i be to escape in a vessel but i forbear to mention any further particulars i be in readiness but the vessel be unexpectedly detain several day meantime news come to town of a most horrible murder commit on a fugitive slave name jame charity the mother of this unfortunate young man have be a old acquaintance of ours i have tell the shocking particulars of he death in my description of some of the neighbor slaveholder my grandmother always nervously sensitive about runaway be terribly frightened she feel sure that a similar fate await I if i do not desist from my enterprise she sob and groan and entreat I not to go she excessive fear be somewhat contagious and my heart be not proof against she extreme agony i be grievously disappointed but i promise to relinquish my project when my friend peter be apprise of this he be both disappointed and vex he say that judge from we past experience it would be a long time before i have such another chance to throw away i tell he it need not be throw away that i have a friend conceal near by who would be glad enough to take the place that have be provide for I i tell he about poor fanny and the kind-hearted noble fellow who never turn he back upon any body in distress white or black express he readiness to help she aggie be much surprise when she find that we know she secret she be rejoice to hear of such a chance for fanny and arrangement be make for she to go on board the vessel the next night they both suppose that i have long be at the north therefore my name be not mention in the transaction fanny be carry on board at the appoint time and stow away in a very small cabin this accommodation have be purchase at a price that would pay for a voyage to england but when one propose to go to fine old england they stop to calculate whether they can afford the cost of the pleasure while in make a bargain to escape from slavery the tremble victim be ready to say take all i have only do not betray I the next morning i peeped through my loophole and see that it be dark and cloudy at night i receive news that the wind be ahead and the vessel have not sail i be exceedingly anxious about fanny and peter too who be run a tremendous risk at my instigation next day the wind and weather remain the same poor fanny have be half dead with fright when they carry she on board and i could readily imagine how she must be suffer now grandmother come often to my den to say how thankful she be i do not go on the third morning she rap for I to come down to the storeroom the poor old sufferer be break down under she weight of trouble she be easily flurry now i find she in a nervous excited state but i be not aware that she have forget to lock the door behind she as usual she be exceedingly worry about the detention of the vessel she be afraid all would be discover and then fanny and peter and i would all be tortured to death and phillip would be utterly ruin and she house would be tear down poor peter if he should die such a horrible death as the poor slave jame have lately do and all for he kindness in try to help I how dreadful it would be for we all alas the thought be familiar to I and have send many a sharp pang through my heart i try to suppress my own anxiety and speak soothingly to she she bring in some allusion to aunt nancy the dear daughter she have recently bury and then she lose all control of herself as she stand there tremble and sob a voice from the piazza call out whar be you aunt marthy grandmother be startle and in she agitation open the door without thinking of I in step jenny the mischievous housemaid who have try to enter my room when i be conceal in the house of my white benefactress i 's bin huntin ebery whar for you aunt marthy say she my missis want you to send she some cracker i have slink down behind a barrel which entirely screen I but i imagine that jenny be look directly at the spot and my heart beat violently my grandmother immediately think what she have do and go out quickly with jenny to count the cracker lock the door after she she return to I in a few minute the perfect picture of despair poor child she exclaim my carelessness have ruin you the boat be not go yet get ready immediately and go with fanny i be not get another word to say against it now for there be no tell what may happen this day uncle phillip be send for and he agree with he mother in think that jenny would inform dr flint in less than twenty-four hour he advise get I on board the boat if possible if not i have better keep very still in my den where they could not find I without tear the house down he say it would not do for he to move in the matter because suspicion would be immediately excite but he promise to communicate with peter i feel reluctant to apply to he again have implicate he too much already but there seem to be no alternative vex as peter have be by my indecision he be true to he generous nature and say at once that he would do he best to help I trust i should show myself a stronger woman this time he immediately proceed to the wharf and find that the wind have shift and the vessel be slowly beat down stream on some pretext of urgent necessity he offer two boatman a dollar apiece to catch up with she he be of lighter complexion than the boatman he hire and when the captain see they come so rapidly he think officer be pursue he vessel in search of the runaway slave he have on board they hoist sail but the boat gain upon they and the indefatigable peter spring on board the captain at once recognize he peter ask he to go below to speak about a bad bill he have give he when he tell he errand the captain reply why the woman 's here already and i have put she where you or the devil would have a tough job to find she but it be another woman i want to bring say peter _ she _ be in great distress too and you shall be pay any thing within reason if you 'll stop and take she what be she name inquire the captain linda he reply that be the name of the woman already here rejoin the captain by george i believe you mean to betray I o exclaim peter god know i would not harm a hair of you head i be too grateful to you but there really _ be _ another woman in great danger do have the humanity to stop and take she after a while they come to a understanding fanny not dream i be any where about in that region have assume my name though she call herself johnson linda be a common name say peter and the woman i want to bring be linda brent the captain agree to wait at a certain place till evening be handsomely pay for he detention of course the day be a anxious one for we all but we conclude that if jenny have see I she would be too wise to let she mistress know of it and that she probably would not get a chance to see dr flint 's family till evening for i know very well what be the rule in that household i afterwards believe that she do not see I for nothing ever come of it and she be one of those base character that would have jump to betray a suffering fellow be for the sake of thirty piece of silver i make all my arrangement to go on board as soon as it be dusk the intervene time i resolve to spend with my son i have not speak to he for seven year though i have be under the same roof and see he every day when i be well enough to sit at the loophole i do not dare to venture beyond the storeroom so they bring he there and lock we up together in a place conceal from the piazza door it be a agitating interview for both of we after we have talk and weep together for a little while he say mother i be glad you be go away i wish i could go with you i know you be here and i have be _ so _ afraid they would come and catch you i be greatly surprised and ask he how he have find it out he reply i be stand under the eaves one day before ellen go away and i hear somebody cough up over the wood shed i do not know what make I think it be you but i do think so i miss ellen the night before she go away and grandmother bring she back into the room in the night and i think maybe she would be to see _ you _ before she go for i hear grandmother whisper to she ` now go to sleep and remember never to tell ' i ask he if he ever mention he suspicion to he sister he say he never do but after he hear the cough if he see she playing with other child on that side of the house he always try to coax she round to the other side for fear they would hear I cough too he say he have keep a close lookout for dr flint and if he see he speak to a constable or a patrol he always tell grandmother i now recollect that i have see he manifest uneasiness when people be on that side of the house and i have at the time be puzzle to conjecture a motive for he action such prudence may seem extraordinary in a boy of twelve year but slave be surround by mystery deception and danger early learn to be suspicious and watchful and prematurely cautious and cunning he have never ask a question of grandmother or uncle phillip and i have often hear he chime in with other child when they speak of my be at the north i tell he i be now really go to the free state and if he be a good honest boy and a loving child to he dear old grandmother the lord would bless he and bring he to I and we and ellen would live together he begin to tell I that grandmother have not eat any thing all day while he be speak the door be unlock and she come in with a small bag of money which she want I to take i begged she to keep a part of it at least to pay for benny 's be send to the north but she insist while she tear be fall fast that i should take the whole you may be sick among stranger she say and they would send you to the poorhouse to die ah that good grandmother for the last time i go up to my nook its desolate appearance no longer chill I for the light of hope have rise in my soul yet even with the bless prospect of freedom before I i feel very sad at leave forever that old homestead where i have be sheltered so long by the dear old grandmother where i have dream my first young dream of love and where after that have fade away my child come to twine themselves so closely round my desolate heart as the hour approach for I to leave i again descend to the storeroom my grandmother and benny be there she take I by the hand and say linda let we pray we kneel down together with my child press to my heart and my other arm round the faithful loving old friend i be about to leave forever on no other occasion have it ever be my lot to listen to so fervent a supplication for mercy and protection it thrill through my heart and inspire I with trust in god peter be wait for I in the street i be soon by he side faint in body but strong of purpose i do not look back upon the old place though i feel that i should never see it again xxx northward bind i never could tell how we reach the wharf my brain be all of a whirl and my limb totter under I at a appoint place we meet my uncle phillip who have start before we on a different route that he might reach the wharf first and give we timely warning if there be any danger a row-boat be in readiness as i be about to step in i feel something pull I gently and turn round i see benny look pale and anxious he whisper in my ear i have be peep into the doctor 's window and he be at home good by mother do not cry i 'll come he hasten away i clasp the hand of my good uncle to whom i owe so much and of peter the brave generous friend who have volunteer to run such terrible risk to secure my safety to this day i remember how he bright face beam with joy when he tell I he have discover a safe method for I to escape yet that intelligent enterprising noble-hearted man be a chattel liable by the law of a country that call itself civilized to be sell with horse and pig we part in silence we heart be all too full for word swiftly the boat glide over the water after a while one of the sailor say do not be down-heart madam we will take you safely to you husband in -- at first i could not imagine what he mean but i have presence of mind to think that it probably refer to something the captain have tell he so i thank he and say i hope we should have pleasant weather when i enter the vessel the captain come forward to meet I he be a elderly man with a pleasant countenance he show I to a little box of a cabin where sit my friend fanny she start as if she have see a spectre she gaze on I in utter astonishment and exclaim linda can this be _ you _ or be it you ghost when we be lock in each other 's arm my overwrought feeling could no longer be restrain my sob reach the ear of the captain who come and very kindly remind we that for he safety as well as we own it would be prudent for we not to attract any attention he say that when there be a sail in sight he wish we to keep below but at other time he have no objection to we be on deck he assure we that he would keep a good lookout and if we act prudently he think we should be in no danger he have represent we as woman go to meet we husband in -- we thank he and promise to observe carefully all the direction he give we fanny and i now talk by ourselves low and quietly in we little cabin she tell I of the suffering she have go through in make she escape and of she terror while she be conceal in she mother 's house above all she dwell on the agony of separation from all she child on that dreadful auction day she could scarcely credit I when i tell she of the place where i have pass nearly seven year we have the same sorrow say i no reply she you be go to see you child soon and there be no hope that i shall ever even hear from mine the vessel be soon under way but we make slow progress the wind be against we i should not have care for this if we have be out of sight of the town but until there be mile of water between we and we enemy we be fill with constant apprehension that the constable would come on board neither could i feel quite at ease with the captain and he man i be a entire stranger to that class of people and i have hear that sailor be rough and sometimes cruel we be so completely in they power that if they be bad man we situation would be dreadful now that the captain be pay for we passage might he not be tempt to make more money by give we up to those who claim we as property i be naturally of a confide disposition but slavery have make I suspicious of every body fanny do not share my distrust of the captain or he man she say she be afraid at first but she have be on board three day while the vessel lay in the dock and nobody have betray she or treat she otherwise than kindly the captain soon come to advise we to go on deck for fresh air he friendly and respectful manner combine with fanny 's testimony reassure I and we go with he he place we in a comfortable seat and occasionally enter into conversation he tell we he be a southerner by birth and have spend the greater part of he life in the slave state and that he have recently lose a brother who trade in slave but say he it be a pitiable and degrading business and i always feel ashamed to acknowledge my brother in connection with it as we pass snaky swamp he point to it and say there be a slave territory that defy all the law i thought of the terrible day i have spend there and though it be not call dismal swamp it make I feel very dismal as i look at it i shall never forget that night the balmy air of spring be so refreshing and how shall i describe my sensation when we be fairly sailing on chesapeake bay o the beautiful sunshine the exhilarating breeze and i could enjoy they without fear or restraint i have never realize what grand thing air and sunlight be till i have be deprive of they ten day after we leave land we be approach philadelphium the captain say we should arrive there in the night but he think we have better wait till morning and go on shore in broad daylight as the best way to avoid suspicion i reply you know best but will you stay on board and protect we he see that i be suspicious and he say he be sorry now that he have bring we to the end of we voyage to find i have so little confidence in he ah if he have ever be a slave he would have know how difficult it be to trust a white man he assure we that we might sleep through the night without fear that he would take care we be not leave unprotected be it say to the honor of this captain southerner as he be that if fanny and i have be white lady and we passage lawfully engage he could not have treat we more respectfully my intelligent friend peter have rightly estimate the character of the man to whose honor he have intrust we the next morning i be on deck as soon as the day dawn i call fanny to see the sun rise for the first time in we life on free soil for such i _ then _ believe it to be we watch the reddening sky and see the great orb come up slowly out of the water as it seem soon the wave begin to sparkle and every thing catch the beautiful glow before we lay the city of stranger we look at each other and the eye of both be moisten with tear we have escape from slavery and we suppose ourselves to be safe from the hunter but we be alone in the world and we have leave dear tie behind we tie cruelly sunder by the demon slavery xxxi incident in philadelphium i have hear that the poor slave have many friend at the north i trust we should find some of they meantime we would take it for grant that all be friend till they prove to the contrary i seek out the kind captain thank he for he attention and tell he i should never cease to be grateful for the service he have render we i give he a message to the friend i have leave at home and he promise to deliver it we be place in a row-boat and in about fifteen minute be land on a wood wharf in philadelphium as i stand look round the friendly captain touch I on the shoulder and say there be a respectable-looking color man behind you i will speak to he about the new york train and tell he you wish to go directly on i thank he and ask he to direct I to some shop where i could buy glove and veil he do so and say he would talk with the color man till i return i make what haste i could constant exercise on board the vessel and frequent rub with salt water have nearly restore the use of my limb the noise of the great city confuse I but i find the shop and buy some double veil and glove for fanny and myself the shopman tell I they be so many levy i have never hear the word before but i do not tell he so i think if he know i be a stranger he might ask I where i come from i give he a gold piece and when he return the change i count it and find out how much a levy be i make my way back to the wharf where the captain introduce I to the color man as the rev jeremiah durham minister of bethel church he take I by the hand as if i have be a old friend he tell we we be too late for the morning car to new york and must wait until the evening or the next morning he invite I to go home with he assure I that he wife would give I a cordial welcome and for my friend he would provide a home with one of he neighbor i thank he for so much kindness to stranger and tell he if i must be detain i should like to hunt up some people who formerly go from we part of the country mr durham insist that i should dine with he and then he would assist I in find my friend the sailor come to bid we good by i shake they hardy hand with tear in my eye they have all be kind to we and they have render we a greater service than they could possibly conceive of i have never see so large a city or be in contact with so many people in the street it seem as if those who pass look at we with a expression of curiosity my face be so blistered and peel by sit on deck in wind and sunshine that i think they could not easily decide to what nation i belong mr durham meet I with a kindly welcome without ask any question i be tired and she friendly manner be a sweet refreshment god bless she i be sure that she have comfort other weary heart before i receive she sympathy she be surround by she husband and child in a home make sacred by protect law i thought of my own child and sigh after dinner mr durham go with I in quest of the friend i have speak of they go from my native town and i anticipate much pleasure in look on familiar face they be not at home and we retract we step through street delightfully clean on the way mr durham observe that i have speak to he of a daughter i expect to meet that he be surprise for i look so young he have take I for a single woman he be approach a subject on which i be extremely sensitive he would ask about my husband next i think and if i answer he truly what would he think of I i tell he i have two child one in new york the other at the south he ask some further question and i frankly tell he some of the most important event of my life it be painful for I to do it but i would not deceive he if he be desirous of be my friend i think he ought to know how far i be worthy of it excuse I if i have try you feeling say he i do not question you from idle curiosity i want to understand you situation in order to know whether i could be of any service to you or you little girl you straight-forward answer do you credit but do not answer every body so openly it might give some heartless people a pretext for treat you with contempt that word _ contempt _ burn I like coal of fire i reply god alone know how i have suffer and he i trust will forgive I if i be permit to have my child i intend to be a good mother and to live in such a manner that people can not treat I with contempt i respect you sentiment say he place you trust in god and be govern by good principle and you will not fail to find friend when we reach home i go to my room glad to shut out the world for a while the word he have speak make a indelible impression upon I they bring up great shadow from the mournful past in the midst of my meditation i be startle by a knock at the door mr durham enter she face all beam with kindness to say that there be a anti-slavery friend down stair who would like to see I i overcome my dread of encounter stranger and go with she many question be ask concern my experience and my escape from slavery but i observe how careful they all be not to say any thing that might wind my feeling how gratifying this be can be fully understand only by those who have be accustom to be treat as if they be not include within the pale of human being the anti-slavery friend have come to inquire into my plan and to offer assistance if need fanny be comfortably establish for the present with a friend of mr durham the anti-slavery society agree to pay she expense to new york the same be offer to I but i decline to accept it tell they that my grandmother have give I sufficient to pay my expense to the end of my journey we be urge to remain in philadelphium a few day until some suitable escort could be find for we i gladly accept the proposition for i have a dread of meeting slaveholder and some dread also of railroad i have never enter a railroad car in my life and it seem to I quite a important event that night i seek my pillow with feeling i have never carry to it before i verily believe myself to be a free woman i be wakeful for a long time and i have no sooner fall asleep than i be rouse by fire-bell i jump up and hurry on my clothes where i come from every body hasten to dress themselves on such occasion the white people think a great fire might be use as a good opportunity for insurrection and that it be best to be in readiness and the color people be order out to labor in extinguish the flame there be but one engine in we town and color woman and child be often require to drag it to the river 's edge and fill it mr durham 's daughter sleep in the same room with I and see that she sleep through all the din i think it be my duty to wake she what be the matter say she rub she eye they be scream fire in the street and the bell be ring i reply what of that say she drowsily we be use to it we never get up without the fire be very near what good would it do i be quite surprised that it be not necessary for we to go and help fill the engine i be a ignorant child just begin to learn how thing go on in great city at daylight i hear woman cry fresh fish berry radish and various other thing all this be new to I i dress myself at a early hour and sit at the window to watch that unknown tide of life philadelphium seem to I a wonderfully great place at the breakfast table my idea of go out to drag the engine be laugh over and i join in the mirth i go to see fanny and find she so well contented among she new friend that she be in no haste to leave i be also very happy with my kind hostess she have have advantage for education and be vastly my superior every day almost every hour i be add to my little stock of knowledge she take I out to see the city as much as she deem prudent one day she take

offer to accompany we to new york the follow morning as i hold the hand of my good hostess in a parting clasp i long to know whether she husband have repeat to she what i have tell he i suppose he

not procure ticket for the first-class car suppose i have not give he money enough i offer more o no say he they could not be have for any money they do not allow color people to go in the first-class car this be the first chill to my enthusiasm about the free state color people be allow to ride in a filthy box behind white people at the south but there they be not require to pay for the privilege it make I sad to find how the north ape the custom of slavery we be stow away in a large rough car with window on each side too high for we to look out without stand up it be crowd with people apparently of all nation there be plenty of bed and cradle contain scream and kick baby every other man have a cigar or pipe in he mouth and jug of whiskey be hand round freely the fume of the whiskey and the dense tobacco smoke be sicken to my sens and my mind be equally nauseated by the coarse joke and ribald song around I it be a very disagreeable ride since that time there have be some improvement in these matter xxxii the meeting of mother and daughter when we arrive in new york i be half craze by the crowd of coachman call out carriage ma'am we bargain with one to take we to

sullivan street and thither we drive there fanny and i separate the anti-slavery society provide a home for she and i afterwards hear of she in prosperous circumstance i send for a old friend from my part of the country who have for some time be do business in new york he come immediately i tell he i want to go to my daughter and ask he to aid I in procure a interview i caution he not to let it be know to the family that i have just arrive from the south because they suppose i have be at the north seven year he tell I there be a color woman in brooklyn who come from the same town i do and i have better go to she house and have my daughter meet I there i accept the proposition thankfully and he agree to escort I to brooklyn we cross fulton ferry go up myrtle avenue and stop at the house he designate i be just about to enter when two girl pass my friend call my attention to they i turn and recognize in the eldest sarah the daughter of a woman who use to live with my grandmother but who have leave the south year ago surprised and rejoice at this unexpected meeting i throw my arm round she and inquire concern she mother you take no notice of the other girl say my friend i turn and there stand my ellen i press she to my heart then hold she away from I to take a look at she she have change a good deal in the two year since i parted from she sign of neglect could be discern by eye less observe than a mother 's my friend invite we all to go into the house but ellen say she have be send of a errand which she would do as quickly as possible and go home and ask mr hobb to let she come and see I it be agree that i should send for she the next day she companion sarah hasten to tell she mother of my arrival when i enter the house i find the mistress of it absent and i wait for she return before i see she i hear she say where be linda brent i use to know she father and mother soon sarah come with she mother so there be quite a company of we all from my grandmother 's neighborhood these friend gather round I and question I eagerly they laugh they cry and they shout they thank god that i have get away from my persecutor and be safe on long island it be a day of great excitement how different from the silent day i have pass in my dreary den the next morning be Sunday my first waking thought be occupy with the note i be to send to mr hobb the lady with whom ellen live that i have recently come into that vicinity be evident otherwise i should have sooner inquire for my daughter it would not do to let they know i have just arrive from the south for that would involve the suspicion of my have be harbor there and might bring trouble if not ruin on several people i like a straightforward course and be always reluctant to resort to subterfuge so far as my way have be crooked i charge they all upon slavery it be that system of violence and wrong which now leave I no alternative but to enact a falsehood i begin my note by state that i have recently arrive from canada and be very desirous to have my daughter come to see I she come and bring a message from mr hobb invite I to she house and assure I that i need not have any fear the conversation i have with my child do not leave my mind at ease when i ask if she be well treat she answer yes but there be no heartiness in the tone and it seem to I that she say it from a unwillingness to have I trouble on she account before she leave I she ask very earnestly mother will you take I to live with you it make I sad to think that i could not give she a home till i go to work and earn the means and that might take I a long time when she be place with mr hobb the agreement be that she should be send to school she have be there two year and be now nine year old and she scarcely know she letter there be no excuse for this for there be good public school in brooklyn to which she could have be send without expense she staid with I till dark and i go home with she i be receive in a friendly manner by the family and all agree in say that ellen be a useful good girl mr hobb look I coolly in the face and say i suppose you know that my cousin mr sand have _ give _ she to my eldest daughter she will make a nice waiting-maid for she when she grow up i do not answer a word how _ could _ she who know by experience the strength of a mother 's love and who be perfectly aware of the relation mr sand bear to my child -- how _ could _ she look I in the face while she thrust such a dagger into my heart i be no longer surprise that they have keep she in such a state of ignorance mr hobb have formerly be wealthy but he have fail and afterwards obtain a subordinate situation in the custom house perhaps they expect to return to the south some day and ellen 's knowledge be quite sufficient for a slave 's condition i be impatient to go to work and earn money that i might change the uncertain position of my child mr sand have not keep he promise to emancipate they i have also be deceive about ellen what security have i with regard to benjamin i feel that i have none i return to my friend 's house in a uneasy state of mind in order to protect my child it be necessary that i should own myself i call myself free and sometimes feel so but i know i be insecure i sit down that night and write a civil letter to dr flint ask he to state the lowest term on which he would sell I and as i belong by law to he daughter i write to she also make a similar request since my arrival at the north i have not be unmindful of my dear brother william i have make diligent inquiry for he and have hear of he in boston i go thither when i arrive there i find he have go to new bedford i write to that place and be inform he have go on a whaling voyage and would not return for some month i go back to new york to get employment near ellen i receive a answer from dr flint which give I no encouragement he advise I to return and submit myself to my rightful owner and then any request i might make would be grant i lend this letter to a friend who lose it otherwise i would present a copy to my reader xxxiii a home find my greatest anxiety now be to obtain employment my health be greatly improve though my limb continue to trouble I with swell whenever i walk much the greatest difficulty in my way be that those who employ stranger require a recommendation and in my peculiar position i could of course obtain no certificate from the family i have so faithfully serve one day a acquaintance tell I of a lady who want a nurse for she babe and i immediately apply for the situation the lady tell I she prefer to have one who have be a mother and accustom to the care of infant i tell she i have nurse two babe of my own she ask I many question but to my great relief do not require a recommendation from my former employer she tell I she be a english woman and that be a pleasant circumstance to I because i have hear they have less prejudice against color than american entertain it be agree that we should try each other for a week the trial prove satisfactory to both party and i be engage for a month the heavenly father have be most merciful to I in lead I to this place mr bruce be a kind and gentle lady and prove a true and sympathizing friend before the stipulate month expire the necessity of pass up and down stair frequently cause my limb to swell so painfully that i become unable to perform my duty many lady would have thoughtlessly discharge I but mr bruce make arrangement to save I step and employ a physician to attend upon I i have not yet tell she that i be a fugitive slave she notice that i be often sad and kindly inquire the cause i speak of be separate from my child and from relative who be dear to I but i do not mention the constant feeling of insecurity which oppress my spirit i long for some one to confide it but i have be so deceive by white people that i have lose all confidence in they if they speak kind word to I i think it be for some selfish purpose i have enter this family with the distrustful feeling i have bring with I out of slavery but ere six month have pass i find that the gentle deportment of mr bruce and the smile of she lovely babe be thaw my chill heart my narrow mind also begin to expand under the influence of she intelligent conversation and the opportunity for reading which be gladly allow I whenever i have leisure from my duty i gradually become more energetic and more cheerful the old feeling of insecurity especially with regard to my child often throw its dark shadow across my sunshine mr bruce offer I a home for ellen but pleasant as it would have be i do not dare to accept it for fear of offend the hobb family they knowledge of my precarious situation place I in they power and i feel that it be important for I to keep on the right side of they till by dint of labor and economy i could make a home for my child i be far from feel satisfied with ellen 's situation she be not well care for she sometimes come to new york to visit I but she generally bring a request from mr hobb that i would buy she a pair of shoe or some article of clothing this be accompany by a promise of payment when mr hobb 's salary at the custom house become due but some how or other the pay-day never come thus many dollar of my earnings be expend to keep my child comfortably clothe that however be a slight trouble compare with the fear that they pecuniary embarrassment might induce they to sell my precious young daughter i know they be in constant communication with southerner and have frequent opportunity to do it i have state that when dr flint put ellen in jail at two year old she have a inflammation of the eye occasion by measles this disease still trouble she and kind mr bruce propose that she should come to new york for a while to be under the care of dr elliott a well know oculist it do not occur to I that there be any thing improper in a mother 's make such a request but mr hobb be very angry and refuse to let she go situate as i be it be not politic to insist upon it i make no complaint but i long to be entirely free to act a mother 's part towards my child the next time i go over to brooklyn mr hobb as if to apologize for she anger tell I she have employ she own physician to attend to ellen 's eye and that she have refuse my request because she do not consider it safe to trust she in new york i accept the explanation in silence but she have tell I that my child _ belong _ to she daughter and i suspect that she real motive be a fear of my convey she property away from she perhaps i do she injustice but my knowledge of southerner make it difficult for I to feel otherwise sweet and bitter be mix in the cup of my life and i be thankful that it have cease to be entirely bitter i love mr bruce 's babe when it laugh and crow in my face and twine its little tender arm confidingly about my neck it make I think of the time when benny and ellen be baby and my wounded heart be soothe one bright morning as i stand at the window toss baby in my arm my attention be attract by a young man in sailor 's dress who be closely observe every house as he pass i look at he earnestly could it be my brother william it _ must _ be he -- and yet how changed i place the baby safely fly down stair open the front door beckon to the sailor and in less than a minute i be clasp in my brother 's arm how much we have to tell each other how we laugh and how we cry over each other 's adventure i take he to brooklyn and again see he with ellen the dear child whom he have love and tend so carefully while i be shut up in my miserable den he staid in new york a week he old feeling of affection for I and ellen be as lively as ever there be no bond so strong as those which be form by suffer together xxxiv the old enemy again my young mistress miss emily flint do not return any answer to my letter request she to consent to my be sell but after a while i receive a reply which purported to be write by she younger brother in order rightly to enjoy the contents of this letter the reader must bear in mind that the flint family suppose i have be at the north many year they have no idea that i know of the doctor 's three excursion to new york in search of I that i have hear he voice when he come to borrow five hundred dollar for that purpose and that i have see he pass on he way to the steamboat neither be they aware that all the particulars of aunt nancy 's death and burial be convey to I at the time they occur i have keep the letter of which i herewith subjoin a copy : -- you letter to sister be receive a few day ago i gather from it that you be desirous of return to you native place among you friend and relative we be all gratify with the contents of you letter and let I assure you that if any member of the family have have any feeling of resentment towards you they feel it no longer we all sympathize with you in you unfortunate condition and be ready to do all in we power to make you contented and happy it be difficult for you to return home as a free person if you be purchase by you grandmother it be doubtful whether you would be permit to remain although it would be lawful for you to do so if a servant should be allow to purchase herself after absent herself so long from she owner and return free it would have a injurious effect from you letter i think you situation must be hard and uncomfortable come home you have it in you power to be reinstate in we affection we would receive you with open arm and tear of joy you need not apprehend any unkind treatment as we have not put ourselves to any trouble or expense to get you have we do so perhaps we should feel otherwise you know my sister be always attach to you and that you be never treat as a slave you be never put to hard work nor expose to field labor on the contrary you be take into the house and treat as one of we and almost as free and we at least feel that you be above disgrace yourself by run away believe you may be induce to come home voluntarily have induce I to write for my sister the family will be rejoice to see you and you poor old grandmother express a great desire to have you come when she hear you letter read in she old age she need the consolation of have she child round she doubtless you have hear of the death of you aunt she be a faithful servant and a faithful member of the episcopal church in she christian life she teach we how to live -- and o too high the price of knowledge she teach we how to die could you have see we round she death bed with she mother all mingle we tear in one common stream you would have think the same heartfelt tie exist between a master and he servant as between a mother and she child but this subject be too painful to dwell upon i must bring my letter to a close if you be contented to stay away from you old grandmother you child and the friend who love you stay where you be we shall never trouble ourselves to apprehend you but should you prefer to come home we will do all that we can to make you happy if you do not wish to remain in the family i know that father by we persuasion will be induce to let you be purchase by any person you may choose in we community you will please answer this as soon as possible and let we know you decision sister send much love to you in the mean time believe I you sincere friend and well wisher this letter be sign by emily 's brother who be as yet a mere lad i know by the style that it be not write by a person of he age and though the writing be disguise i have be make too unhappy by it in former year not to recognize at once the hand of dr flint o the hypocrisy of slaveholder do the old fox suppose i be goose enough to go into such a trap verily he rely too much on the stupidity of the african race i do not return the family of flint any thanks for they cordial invitation -- a remissness for which i be no doubt charge with base ingratitude not long afterwards i receive a letter from one of my friend at the south inform I that dr flint be about to visit the north the letter have be delay and i suppose he might be already on the way mr bruce do not know i be a fugitive i tell she that important business call I to boston where my brother then be and ask permission to bring a friend to supply my place as nurse for a fortnight i start on my journey immediately and as soon as i arrive i write to my grandmother that if benny come he must be send to boston i know she be only wait for a good chance to send he north and fortunately she have the legal power to do so without ask leave of any body she be a free woman and when my child be purchase mr sand prefer to have the bill of sale draw up in she name it be conjecture that he advance the money but it be not know at the south a gentleman may have a shoal of colored child without any disgrace but if he be know to purchase they with the view of set they free the example be think to be dangerous to they peculiar institution and he become unpopular there be a good opportunity to send benny in a vessel come directly to new york he be put on board with a letter to a friend who be request to see he off to boston early one morning there be a loud rap at my door and in rush benjamin all out of breath o mother he exclaim here i be i run all the way and i come all alone how d'you do o reader can you imagine my joy no you can not unless you have be a slave mother benjamin rattle away as fast as he tongue could go mother why do not you bring ellen here i go over to brooklyn to see she and she feel very bad when i bid she good by she say ' o ben i wish i be go too ' i think she would know ever so much but she do not know so much as i do for i can read and she can not and mother i lose all my clothes come what can i do to get some more i ` spose free boy can get along here at the north as well as white boy i do not like to tell the sanguine happy little fellow how much he be mistaken i take he to a tailor and procure a change of clothes the rest of the day be spend in mutual asking and answering of question with the wish constantly repeat that the good old grandmother be with we and frequent injunction from benny to write to she immediately and be sure to tell she every thing about he voyage and he journey to boston dr flint make he visit to new york and make every exertion to call upon I and invite I to return with he but not be able to ascertain where i be he hospitable intention be frustrated and the affectionate family who be wait for I with open arm be doom to disappointment as soon as i know he be safely at home i place benjamin in the care of my brother william and return to mr bruce there i remain through the winter and spring endeavor to perform my duty faithfully and find a good degree of happiness in the attraction of baby mary the considerate kindness of she excellent mother and occasional interview with my darling daughter but when summer come the old feeling of insecurity haunt I it be necessary for I to take little mary out daily for exercise and fresh air and the city be swarm with southerner some of whom might recognize I hot weather bring out snake and slaveholder and i like one class of the venomous creature as little as i do the other what a comfort it be to be free to _ say _ so xxxv prejudice against color it be a relief to my mind to see preparation for leave the city we go to albany in the steamboat knickerbocker when the gong sound for tea mrs bruce say linda it be late and you and baby have better come to the table with I i reply i know it be time baby have she supper but i have rather not go with you if you please i be afraid of be insult o no not if you be with _ I _ she say i see several white nurse go with they lady and i venture to do the same we be at the extreme end of the table i be no sooner seat than a gruff voice say get up you know you be not allow to sit here i look up and to my astonishment and indignation see that the speaker be a color man if he office require he to enforce the by-law of the boat he might at least have do it politely i reply i shall not get up unless the captain come and take I up no cup of tea be offer I but mr bruce hand I hers and call for another i look to see whether the other nurse be treat in a similar manner they be all properly wait on next morning when we stop at troy for breakfast every body be make a rush for the table mr bruce say take my arm linda and we 'll go in together the landlord hear she and say madam will you allow you nurse and baby to take breakfast with my family i know this be to be attribute to my complexion but he speak courteously and therefore i do not mind it at saratoga we find the united state hotel crowd and mr bruce take one of the cottage belong to the hotel i have think with gladness of go to the quiet of the country where i should meet few people but here i find myself in the midst of a swarm of southerner i look round I with fear and tremble dread to see some one who would recognize I i be rejoice to find that we be to stay but a short time we soon return to new york to make arrangement for spend the remainder of the summer at rockaway while the laundress be put the clothes in order i take a opportunity to go over to brooklyn to see ellen i meet she go to a grocery store and the first word she say be o mother do not go to mr hobb 's she brother mr thorne have come from the south and may be he 'll tell where you be i accept the warning i tell she i be go away with mr bruce the next day and would try to see she when i come back be in servitude to the anglo-saxon race i be not put into a jim crow car on we way to rockaway neither be i invite to ride through the street on the top of trunk in a truck but every where i find the same manifestation of that cruel prejudice which so discourage the feeling and repress the energy of the color people we reach rockaway before dark and put up at the pavilion -- a large hotel beautifully situate by the sea-side -- a great resort of the fashionable world thirty or forty nurse be there of a great variety of nation some of the lady have color waiting-maid and coachman but i be the only nurse tinge with the blood of africa when the tea bell ring i take little mary and follow the other nurse supper be serve in a long hall a young man who have the order of thing take the circuit of the table two or three time and finally point I to a seat at the lower end of it as there be but one chair i sit down and take the child in my lap whereupon the young man come to I and say in the blandest manner possible will you please to seat the little girl in the chair and stand behind it and feed she after they have do you will be show to the kitchen where you will have a good supper this be the climax i find it hard to preserve my self-control when i look round and see woman who be nurse as i be and only one shade lighter in complexion eye I with a defiant look as if my presence be a contamination however i say nothing i quietly take the child in my arm go to we room and refuse to go to the table again mr bruce order meal to be send to the room for little mary and i this answer for a few day but the waiter of the establishment be white and they soon begin to complain say they be not hire to wait on negro the landlord request mr bruce to send I down to my meal because he servant rebel against bring they up and the color servant of other boarder be dissatisfy because all be not treat alike my answer be that the color servant ought to be dissatisfy with _ themselves _ for not have too much self-respect to submit to such treatment that there be no difference in the price of board for color and white servant and there be no justification for difference of treatment i staid a month after this and find i be resolve to stand up for my rights they conclude to treat I well let every color man and woman do this and eventually we shall cease to be trample under foot by we oppressor xxxvi the hairbreadth escape after we return to new york i take the earliest opportunity to go and see ellen i ask to have she call down stair for i suppose mr hobb 's southern brother might still be there and i be desirous to avoid see he if possible but mr hobb come to the kitchen and insist on my go up stair my brother want to see you say she and he be sorry you seem to shun he he know you be live in new york he tell I to say to you that he owe thanks to good old aunt martha for too many little act of kindness for he to be base enough to betray she grandchild this mr thorne have become poor and reckless long before he leave the south and such person have much rather go to one of the faithful old slave to borrow a dollar or get a good dinner than to go to one whom they consider a equal it be such act of kindness as these for which he profess to feel grateful to my grandmother i wish he have keep at a distance but as he be here and know where i be i conclude there be nothing to be gain by try to avoid he on the contrary it might be the means of exciting he ill will i follow he sister up stair he meet I in a very friendly manner congratulate I on my escape from slavery and hope i have a good place where i feel happy i continue to visit ellen as often as i could she good thoughtful child never forget my hazardous situation but always keep a vigilant lookout for my safety she never make any complaint about she own inconvenience and trouble but a mother 's observe eye easily perceive that she be not happy on the occasion of one of my visit i find she unusually serious when i ask she what be the matter she say nothing be the matter but i insist upon know what make she look so very grave finally i ascertain that she feel troubled about the dissipation that be continually go on in the house she be send to the store very often for rum and brandy and she feel ashamed to ask for it so often and mr hobb and mr thorne drink a great deal and they hand tremble so that they have to call she to pour out the liquor for they but for all that say she mr hobb be good to I and i can not help like he i feel sorry for he i try to comfort she by tell she that i have lay up a hundred dollar and that before long i hope to be able to give she and benjamin a home and send they to school she be always desirous not to add to my trouble more than she could help and i do not discover till year afterwards that mr thorne 's intemperance be not the only annoyance she suffer from he though he profess too much gratitude to my grandmother to injure any of she descendant he have pour vile language into the ear of she innocent great-grandchild i usually go to brooklyn to spend Sunday afternoon one Sunday i find ellen anxiously wait for I near the house o mother say she i have be wait for you this long time i be afraid mr thorne have write to tell dr flint where you be make haste and come in mr hobb will tell you all about it the story be soon tell while the child be play in the grape-vine arbor the day before mr thorne come out with a letter in he hand which he tear up and scatter about ellen be sweep the yard at the time and have she mind full of suspicion of he she pick up the piece and carry they to the child say i wonder who mr thorne have be write to i be sure i do not know and do not care reply the oldest of the child and i do not see how it concern you but it do concern I reply ellen for i be afraid he be be write to the south about my mother they laugh at she and call she a silly thing but good-naturedly put the fragment of write together in order to read they to she they be no sooner arrange than the little girl exclaim i declare ellen i believe you be right the contents of mr thorne 's letter as nearly as i can remember be as follow : i have see you slave linda and converse with she she can be take very easily if you manage prudently there be enough of we here to swear to she identity as you property i be a patriot a lover of my country and i do this as a act of justice to the law he conclude by inform the doctor of the street and number where i live the child carry the piece to mr hobb who immediately go to she brother 's room for a explanation he be not to be find the servant say they see he go out with a letter in he hand and they suppose he have go to the post office the natural inference be that he have send to dr flint a copy of those fragment when he return he sister accuse he of it and he do not deny the charge he go immediately to he room and the next morning he be miss he have go over to new york before any of the family be astir it be evident that i have no time to lose and i hasten back to the city with a heavy heart again i be to be tear from a comfortable home and all my plan for the welfare of my child be to be frustrate by that demon slavery i now regret that i never tell mr bruce my story i have not conceal it merely on account of be a fugitive that would have make she anxious but it would have excite sympathy in she kind heart i value she good opinion and i be afraid of lose it if i tell she all the particulars of my sad story but now i feel that it be necessary for she to know how i be situate i have once leave she abruptly without explain the reason and it would not be proper to do it again i go home resolve to tell she in the morning but the sadness of my face attract she attention and in answer to she kind inquiry i pour out my full heart to she before bed time she listen with true womanly sympathy and tell I she would do all she could to protect I how my heart bless she early the next morning judge vanderpool and lawyer hopper be consult they say i have better leave the city at once as the risk would be great if the case come to trial mr bruce take I in a carriage to the house of one of she friend where she assure I i should be safe until my brother could arrive which would be in a few day in the interval my thought be much occupy with ellen she be mine by birth and she be also mine by southern law since my grandmother hold the bill of sale that make she so i do not feel that she be safe unless i have she with I mr hobb who feel badly about she brother 's treachery yield to my entreaty on condition that she should return in ten day i avoid make any promise she come to I clothe in very thin garment all outgrow and with a school satchel on she arm contain a few article it be late in October and i know the child must suffer and not daring to go out in the street to purchase any thing i take off my own flannel skirt and convert it into one for she kind mr bruce come to bid I good by and when she see that i have take off my clothing for my child the tear come to she eye she say wait for I linda and go out she soon return with a nice warm shawl and hood for ellen truly of such soul as hers be the kingdom of heaven my brother reach new york on Wednesday

go from the city we reach the steamboat rhode island in safety that boat employ color hand but i know that color passenger be not admit to the cabin i be very desirous for the seclusion of the cabin

route which be much travel by the wealthy i ask she to show I to the captain 's office and she say she would after tea when the time come i take ellen by the hand and go to the captain politely request he to change we ticket as we should be very uncomfortable on deck he say it be contrary to they custom but he would see that we have berth below he would also try to obtain comfortable seat for we in the car of that he be not certain but he would speak to the conductor about it when the boat arrive i thank he and return to the lady ' cabin he come afterwards and tell I that the conductor of the car be on board that he have speak to he and he have promise to take care of we i be very much surprised at receive so much kindness i do not know whether the please face of my little girl have win he heart or whether the stewardess infer from lawyer hopper 's manner that i be a fugitive and have plead with he in my behalf when the boat arrive at stonington the conductor keep he promise and show we to seat in the first car nearest the engine he ask we to take seat next the door but as he pass through we venture to move on toward the other end of the car no incivility be offer we and we reach boston in safety the day after my arrival be one of the happiest of my life i feel as if i be beyond the reach of the bloodhound and for the first time during many year i have both my child together with I they greatly enjoy they reunion and laugh and chat merrily i watch they with a swell heart they every motion delight I i could not feel safe in new york and i accept the offer of a friend that we should share expense and keep house together i represent to mr hobb that ellen must have some schooling and must remain with I for that purpose she feel ashamed of be unable to read or spell at she age so instead of send she to school with benny i instruct she myself till she be fit to enter a intermediate school the winter pass pleasantly while i be busy with my needle and my child with they book xxxvii a visit to england in the spring sad news come to I mr bruce be dead never again in this world should i see she gentle face or hear she sympathizing voice i have lose a excellent friend and little mary have lose a tender mother mr bruce wish the child to visit some of she mother 's relative in england and he be desirous that i should take charge of she the little motherless one be accustom to I and attach to I and i think she would be happier in my care than in that of a stranger i could also earn more in this way than i could by my needle so i put benny to a trade and leave ellen to remain in the house with my friend and go to school we sail from new york and arrive in liverpool after a pleasant voyage of twelve day we proceed directly to london and take lodgings at the adelaide hotel the supper seem to I less luxurious than those i have see in american hotel but my situation be indescribably more pleasant for the first time in my life i be in a place where i be treat accord to my deportment without reference to my complexion i feel as if a great millstone have be lift from my breast ensconce in a pleasant room with my dear little charge i lay my head on my pillow for the first time with the delightful consciousness of pure unadulterated freedom as i have constant care of the child i have little opportunity to see the wonder of that great city but i watch the tide of life that flow through the street and find it a strange contrast to the stagnation in we southern town mr bruce take he little daughter to spend some day with friend in oxford crescent and of course it be necessary for I to accompany she i have hear much of the systematic method of english education and i be very desirous that my dear mary should steer straight in the midst of so much propriety i closely observe she little playmate and they nurse be ready to take any lesson in the science of good management the child be more rosy than american child but i do not see that they differ materially in other respects they be like all child -- sometimes docile and sometimes wayward we next go to steventon in berkshire it be a small town say to be the poorest in the county i see man work in the field for six shilling and seven shilling a week and woman for sixpence and sevenpence a day out of which they board themselves of course they live in the most primitive manner it could not be otherwise where a woman 's wages for a entire day be not sufficient to buy a pound of meat they pay very low rent and they clothes be make of the cheapest fabric though much better than could have be procure in the united state for the same money i have hear much about the oppression of the poor in europe the people i see around I be many of they among the poorest poor but when i visit they in they little thatched cottage i feel that the condition of even the meanest and most ignorant among they be vastly superior to the condition of the most favored slave in america they labor hard but they be not order out to toil while the star be in the sky and drive and slash by a overseer through heat and cold till the star shine out again they home be very humble but they be protect by law no insolent patrol could come in the dead of night and flog they at they pleasure the father when he close he cottage door feel safe with he family around he no master or overseer could come and take from he he wife or he daughter they must separate to earn they living but the parent know where they child be go and could communicate with they by letter the relation of husband and wife parent and child be too sacred for the richest noble in the land to violate with impunity much be be do to enlighten these poor people school be establish among they and benevolent society be active in effort to ameliorate they condition there be no law forbid they to learn to read and write and if they help each other in spell out the bible they be in no danger of thirty-nine lash as be the case with myself and poor pious old uncle fred i repeat that the most ignorant and the most destitute of these peasant be a thousand fold better off than the most pampered american slave i do not deny that the poor be oppress in europe i be not dispose to paint they condition so rose-colored as the hon miss murray paint the condition of the slave in the united state a small portion of _ my _ experience would enable she to read she own page with anointed eye if she be to lay aside she title and instead of visit among the fashionable become domesticate as a poor governess on some plantation in louisiana or alabama she would see and hear thing that would make she tell quite a different story my visit to england be a memorable event in my life from the fact of my have there receive strong religious impression the contemptuous manner in which the communion have be administer to color people in my native place the church membership of dr flint and other like he and the buying and selling of slave by profess minister of the gospel have give I a prejudice against the episcopal church the whole service seem to I a mockery and a sham but my home in steventon be in the family of a clergyman who be a true disciple of jesus the beauty of he daily life inspire I with faith in the genuineness of christian profession grace enter my heart and i knelt at the communion table i trust in true humility of soul i remain abroad ten month which be much longer than i have anticipate during all that time i never see the slightest symptom of prejudice against color indeed i entirely forget it till the time come for we to return to america xxxviii renew invitation to go south we have a tedious winter passage and from the distance spectre seem to rise up on the shore of the united state it be a sad feeling to be afraid of one 's native country we arrive in new york safely and i hasten to boston to look after my child i find ellen well and improve at she school but benny be not there to welcome I he have be leave at a good place to learn a trade and for several month every thing work well he be like by the master and be a favorite with he fellow-apprentice but one day they accidentally discover a fact they have never before suspect -- that he be color this at once transform he into a different be some of the apprentice be american other american-born irish and it be offensive to they dignity to have a nigger among they after they have be tell that he _ be _ a nigger they begin by treat he with silent scorn and find that he return the same they resort to insult and abuse he be too spirit a boy to stand that and he go off be desirous to do something to support himself and have no one to advise he he ship for a whaling voyage when i receive these tiding i shed many tear and bitterly reproach myself for have leave he so long but i have do it for the best and now all i could do be to pray to the heavenly father to guide and protect he not long after my return i receive the following letter from miss emily flint now mr dodge : -- in this you will recognize the hand of you friend and mistress have hear that you have go with a family to europe i have wait to hear of you return to write to you i should have answer the letter you write to I long since but as i could not then act independently of my father i know there could be nothing do satisfactory to you there be person here who be willing to buy you and run the risk of get you to this i would not consent i have always be attach to you and would not like to see you the slave of another or have unkind treatment i be marry now and can protect you my husband expect to move to virginia this spring where we think of settle i be very anxious that you should come and live with I if you be not willing to come you may purchase yourself but i should prefer have you live with I if you come you may if you like spend a month with you grandmother and friend then come to I in norfolk virginium think this over and write as soon as possible and let I know the conclusion hope that you child be well i remain you friend and mistress of course i do not write to return thanks for this cordial invitation i feel insult to be think stupid enough to be catch by such profession come up into my parlor say the spider to the fly ti the prettiest little parlor that ever you do spy it be plain that dr flint 's family be apprise of my movement since they know of my voyage to europe i expect to have further trouble from they but have elude they thus far i hope to be as successful in future the money i have earn i be desirous to devote to the education of my child and to secure a home for they it seem not only hard but unjust to pay for myself i could not possibly regard myself as a piece of property moreover i have work many year without wages and during that time have be oblige to depend on my grandmother for many comfort in food and clothing my child certainly belong to I but though dr flint have incur no expense for they support he have receive a large sum of money for they i know the law would decide that i be he property and would probably still give he daughter a claim to my child but i regard such law as the regulation of robber who have no rights that i be bind to respect the fugitive slave law have not then pass the judge of massachusett have not then stoop under chain to enter she court of justice so call i know my old master be rather skittish of massachusett i rely on she love of freedom and feel safe on she soil i be now aware that i honor the old commonwealth beyond she desert xxxix the confession for two year my daughter and i support ourselves comfortably in boston at the end of that time my brother william offer to send ellen to a board school it require a great effort for I to consent to part with she for i have few near tie and it be she presence that make my two little room seem home-like but my judgment prevail over my selfish feeling i make preparation for she departure during the two year we have live together i have often resolve to tell she something about she father but i have never be able to muster sufficient courage i have a shrink dread of diminish my child 's love i know she must have curiosity on the subject but she have never ask a question she be always very careful not to say any thing to remind I of my trouble now that she be go from I i think if i should die before she return she might hear my story from some one who do not understand the palliating circumstance and that if she be entirely ignorant on the subject she sensitive nature might receive a rude shock when we retire for the night she say mother it be very hard to leave you alone i be almost sorry i be go though i do want to improve myself but you will write to I often will not you mother i do not throw my arm round she i do not answer she but in a calm solemn way for it cost I great effort i say listen to I ellen i have something to tell you i recount my early suffering in slavery and tell she how nearly they have crush I i begin to tell she how they have drive I into a great sin when she clasp I in she arm and exclaim o do not mother please do not tell I any more i say but my child i want you to know about you father i know all about it mother she reply i be nothing to my father and he be nothing to I all my love be for you i be with he five month in washington and he never care for I he never speak to I as he do to he little fanny i know all the time he be my father for fanny 's nurse tell I so but she say i must never tell any body and i never do i use to wish he would take I in he arm and kiss I as he do fanny or that he would sometimes smile at I as he do at she i think if he be my own father he ought to love I i be a little girl then and do not know any better but now i never think any thing about my father all my love be for you she hug I closer as she speak and i thank god that the knowledge i have so much dread to impart have not diminish the affection of my child i have not the slightest idea she know that portion of my history if i have i should have speak to she long before for my pent-up feeling have often long to pour themselves out to some one i could trust but i love the dear girl better for the delicacy she have manifest towards she unfortunate mother the next morning she and she uncle start on they journey to the village in new york where she be to be place at school it seem as if all the sunshine have go away my little room be dreadfully lonely i be thankful when a message come from a lady accustom to employ I request I to come and sew in she family for several week on my return i find a letter from brother william he think of open a anti-slavery reading room in rochester and combine with it the sale of some book and stationery and he want I to unite with he we try it but it be not successful we find warm anti-slavery friend there but the feeling be not general enough to support such a establishment i pass nearly a year in the family of isaac and amy post practical believer in the christian doctrine of human brotherhood they measure a man 's worth by he character not by he complexion the memory of those beloved and honor friend will remain with I to my latest hour xl the fugitive slave law my brother be disappoint in he project conclude to go to californium and it be agree that benjamin should go with he ellen like she school and be a great favorite there they do not know she history and she do not tell it because she have no desire to make capital out of they sympathy but when it be accidentally discover that she mother be a fugitive slave every method be use to increase she advantage and diminish she expense i be alone again it be necessary for I to be earn money and i prefer that it should be among those who know I on my return from rochester i call at the house of mr bruce to see mary the darling little babe that have thaw my heart when it be freezing into a cheerless distrust of all my fellow-being she be grow a tall girl now but i love she always mr bruce have marry again and it be propose that i should become nurse to a new infant i have but one hesitation and that be feeling of insecurity in new york now greatly increase by the passage of the fugitive slave law however i resolve to try the experiment i be again fortunate in my employer the new mr bruce be a american bring up under aristocratic influence and still live in the midst of they but if she have any prejudice against color i be never make aware of it and as for the system of slavery she have a most hearty dislike of it no sophistry of southerner could blind she to its enormity she be a person of excellent principle and a noble heart to I from that hour to the present she have be a true and sympathizing friend blessing be with she and hers about the time that i reenter the bruce family a event occur of disastrous import to the color people the slave hamlin the first fugitive that come under the new law be give up by the bloodhound of the north to the bloodhound of the south it be the beginning of a reign of terror to the color population the great city rush on in its whirl of excitement take no note of the short and simple annals of the poor but while fashionable be listen to the thrilling voice of jenny lind in metropolitan hall the thrilling voice of poor hunt color people go up in a agony of supplication to the lord from zion 's church many family who have live in the city for twenty year flee from it now many a poor washerwoman who by hard labor have make herself a comfortable home be oblige to sacrifice she furniture bid a hurry farewell to friend and seek she fortune among stranger in canada many a wife discover a secret she have never know before -- that she husband be a fugitive and must leave she to insure he own safety worse still many a husband discover that he wife have flee from slavery year ago and as the child follow the condition of its mother the child of he love be liable to be seize and carry into slavery every where in those humble home there be consternation and anguish but what care the legislator of the dominant race for the blood they be crush out of trampled heart when my brother william spend he last evening with I before he go to californium we talk nearly all the time of the distress bring on we oppressed people by the passage of this iniquitous law and never have i see he manifest such bitterness of spirit such stern hostility to we oppressor he be himself free from the operation of the law for he do not run from any slaveholding state be bring into the free state by he master but i be subject to it and so be hundred of intelligent and industrious people all around we i seldom venture into the street and when it be necessary to do a errand for mr bruce or any of the family i go as much as possible through back street and by-way what a disgrace to a city call itself free that inhabitant guiltless of offence and seek to perform they duty conscientiously should be condemn to live in such incessant fear and have nowhere to turn for protection this state of thing of course give rise to many impromptu vigilance committee every color person and every friend of they persecute race keep they eye wide open every evening i examine the newspaper carefully to see what southerner have put up at the hotel i do this for my own sake think my young mistress and she husband might be among the list i wish also to give information to other if necessary for if many be run to and fro i resolve that knowledge should be increase this bring up one of my southern reminiscence which i will here briefly relate i be somewhat acquaint with a slave name luke who belong to a wealthy man in we vicinity he master die leave a son and daughter heir to he large fortune in the division of the slave luke be include in the son 's portion this young man become a prey to the vice he go to the north to complete he education he carry he vice with he he be bring home deprive of the use of he limb by excessive dissipation luke be appoint to wait upon he bed-ridden master whose despotic habit be greatly increase by exasperation at he own helplessness he keep a cowhide beside he and for the most trivial occurrence he would order he attendant to bare he back and kneel beside the couch while he whip he till he strength be exhaust some day he be not allow to wear any thing but he shirt in order to be in readiness to be flog a day seldom pass without he receive more or less blow if the slightest resistance be offer the town constable be send for to execute the punishment and luke learn from experience how much more the constable 's strong arm be to be dread than the comparatively feeble one of he master the arm of he tyrant grow weaker and be finally palsied and then the constable 's service be in constant requisition the fact that he be entirely dependent on luke 's care and be oblige to be tend like a infant instead of inspiring any gratitude or compassion towards he poor slave seem only to increase he irritability and cruelty as he lay there on he bed a mere degraded wreck of manhood he take into he head the strangest freak of despotism and if luke hesitate to submit to he order the constable be immediately send for some of these freak be of a nature too filthy to be repeat when i flee from the house of bondage i leave poor luke still chained to the bedside of this cruel and disgusting wretch one day when i have be request to do a errand for mr bruce i be hurry through back street as usual when i see a young man approach whose face be familiar to I as he come nearer i recognize luke i always rejoice to see or hear of any one who have escape from the black pit i be peculiarly glad to see he on northern soil though i no longer call it _ free _ soil i well remember what a desolate feeling it be to be alone among stranger and i go up to he and greet he cordially at first he do not know I but when i mention my name he remember all about I i tell he of the fugitive slave law and ask he if he do not know that new york be a city of kidnapper he reply de risk be not so bad for I as ` tis fur you 'cause i runned away from de speculator and you run away from de massa dem speculator vont spen dar money to come here fur a runaway if dey be not sartin sure to put dar hans right on he a i tell you i 's tuk good car ` bout dat i have too hard time down dar to let 'em ketch dis nigger he then tell I of the advice he have receive and the plan he have lay i ask if he have money enough to take he to canada ` pend upon it i hab he reply i tuk car fur dat i would bin workin all my day fur dem cuss whites a get no pay but kick and cuff so i tought dis nigger have a right to money nuff to bring he to de free state massa henry he lib till ebery body vish he dead a ven he do die i knowed de debbil would hab he a vould not vant he to bring he money ` long too so i tuk some of he bill and put 'em in de pocket of he ole trousers a ven he be bury dis nigger ask fur dem ole trousers a dey gub 'em to I with a low chuckle laugh he add you see i do not _ steal _ it dey _ gub _ it to I i tell you i have mighty hard time to keep de speculator from findin it but he do not git it this be a fair specimen of how the moral sense be educate by slavery when a man have he wages steal from he year after year and the law sanction and enforce the theft how can he be expect to have more regard to honesty than have the man who rob he i have become somewhat enlighten but i confess that i agree with poor ignorant much-abused luke in think he have a _ right _ to that money as a portion of he unpaid wages he go to canada forthwith and i have not since hear from he all that winter i live in a state of anxiety when i take the child out to breathe the air i closely observe the countenance of all i meet i dread the approach of summer when snake and slaveholder make they appearance i be in fact a slave in new york as subject to slave law as i have be in a slave state strange incongruity in a state call free spring return and i receive warn from the south that dr flint know of my return to my old place and be make preparation to have I catch i learn afterwards that my dress and that of mr bruce 's child have be describe to he by some of the northern tool which slaveholder employ for they base purpose and then indulge in sneer at they cupidity and mean servility i immediately inform mr bruce of my danger and she take prompt measure for my safety my place as nurse could not be supply immediately and this generous sympathize lady propose that i should carry she baby away it be a comfort to I to have the child with I for the heart be reluctant to be tear away from every object it love but how few mother would have consent to have one of they own babe become a fugitive for the sake of a poor hunt nurse on whom the legislator of the country have let loose the bloodhound when i speak of the sacrifice she be make in deprive herself of she dear baby she reply it be better for you to have baby with you linda for if they get on you track they will be oblige to bring the child to I and then if there be a possibility of save you you shall be save this lady have a very wealthy relative a benevolent gentleman in many respects but aristocratic and pro-slavery he remonstrate with she for harbor a fugitive slave tell she she be violate the law of she country and ask she if she be aware of the penalty she reply i be very well aware of it it be imprisonment and one thousand dollar fine shame on my country that it _ be _ so i be ready to incur the penalty i will go to the state 's prison rather than have any poor victim tear from _ my _ house to be carry back to slavery the noble heart the brave heart the tear be in my eye while i write of she may the god of the helpless reward she for she sympathy with my persecute people i be send into new england where i be sheltered by the wife of a senator whom i shall always hold in grateful remembrance this honorable gentleman would not have vote for the fugitive slave law as do the senator in uncle tom 's cabin on the contrary he be strongly oppose to it but he be enough under its influence to be afraid of have I remain in he house many hour so i be send into the country where i remain a month with the baby when it be suppose that dr flint 's emissary have lose track of I and give up the pursuit for the present i return to new york xli free at last mr bruce and every member of she family be exceedingly kind to I i be thankful for the blessing of my lot yet i could not always wear a cheerful countenance i be do harm to no one on the contrary i be do all the good i could in my small way yet i could never go out to breathe god 's free air without trepidation at my heart this seem hard and i could not think it be a right state of thing in any civilized country from time to time i receive news from my good old grandmother she could not write but she employ other to write for she the follow be a extract from one of she last letter : -- dear daughter : i can not hope to see you again on earth but i pray to god to unite we above where pain will no more rack this feeble body of mine where sorrow and parting from my child will be no more god have promise these thing if we be faithful unto the end my age and feeble health deprive I of go to church now but god be with I here at home thank you brother for he kindness give much love to he and tell he to remember the creator in the day of he youth and strive to meet I in the father 's kingdom love to ellen and benjamin do not neglect he tell he for I to be a good boy strive my child to train they for god 's child may he protect and provide for you be the prayer of you loving old mother these letter both cheer and sadden I i be always glad to have tiding from the kind faithful old friend of my unhappy youth but she message of love make my heart yearn to see she before she die and i mourn over the fact that it be impossible some month after i return from my flight to new england i receive a letter from she in which she write dr flint be dead he have leave a distressed family poor old man i hope he make he peace with god i remember how he have defraud my grandmother of the hard earnings she have loan how he have try to cheat she out of the freedom she mistress have promise she and how he have persecute she child and i think to myself that she be a better christian than i be if she could entirely forgive he i can not say with truth that the news of my old master 's death soften my feeling towards he there be wrong which even the grave do not bury the man be odious to I while he live and he memory be odious now he departure from this world do not diminish my danger he have threaten my grandmother that he heir should hold I in slavery after he be go that i never should be free so long as a child of he survive as for mr flint i have see she in deeper affliction than i suppose the loss of she husband would be for she have bury several child yet i never see any sign of soften in she heart the doctor have die in embarrassed circumstance and have little to will to he heir except such property as he be unable to grasp i be well aware what i have to expect from the family of flint and my fear be confirm by a letter from the south warning I to be on my guard because mr flint openly declare that she daughter could not afford to lose so valuable a slave as i be i keep close watch of the newspaper for arrival but one Saturday night be much occupied i forget to examine the evening express as usual i go down into the parlor for it early in the morning and find the boy about to kindle a fire with it i take it from he and examine the list of arrival reader if you have never be a slave you can not imagine the acute sensation of suffer at my heart when i read the name of mr and mr dodge at a hotel in courtland street it be a third-rate hotel and that circumstance convinced I of the truth of what i have hear that they be short of fund and have need of my value as _ they _ value I and that be by dollar and cent i hasten with the paper to mr bruce she heart and hand be always open to every one in distress and she always warmly sympathize with mine it be impossible to tell how near the enemy be he might have pass and repass the house while we be sleep he might at that moment be wait to pounce upon I if i venture out of door i have never see the husband of my young mistress and therefore i could not distinguish he from any other stranger a carriage be hastily order and closely veil i follow mr bruce take the baby again with I into exile after various turning and crossing and returning the carriage stop at the house of one of mr bruce 's friend where i be kindly receive mr bruce return immediately to instruct the domestic what to say if any one come to inquire for I it be lucky for I that the evening paper be not burn up before i have a chance to examine the list of arrival it be not long after mr bruce 's return to she house before several people come to inquire for I one inquire for I another ask for my daughter ellen and another say he have a letter from my grandmother which he be request to deliver in person they be tell she _ have _ live here but she have leave how long ago i do not know sir do you know where she go i do not sir and the door be close this mr dodge who claim I as he property be originally a yankee pedler in the south then he become a merchant and finally a slaveholder he manage to get introduce into what be call the first society and married miss emily flint a quarrel arise between he and she brother and the brother cowhide he this lead to a family feud and he propose to remove to virginia dr flint leave he no property and he own means have become circumscribe while a wife and child depend upon he for support under these circumstance it be very natural that he should make a effort to put I into he pocket i have a color friend a man from my native place in whom i have the most implicit confidence i send for he and tell he that mr and mr dodge have arrive in new york i propose that he should call upon they to make inquiry about he friend at the south with whom dr flint 's family be well acquaint he think there be no impropriety in he do so and he consent he go to the hotel and knock at the door of mr dodge 's room which be open by the gentleman himself who gruffly inquire what bring you here how come you to know i be in the city you arrival be publish in the evening papers sir and i call to ask mr dodge about my friend at home i do not suppose it would give any offence where 's that negro girl that belong to my wife what girl sir you know well enough i mean linda that run away from dr flint 's plantation some year ago i dare say you have see she and know where she be yes sir i have see she and know where she be she be out of you reach sir tell I where she be or bring she to I and i will give she a chance to buy she freedom i do not think it would be of any use sir i have hear she say she would go to the end of the earth rather than pay any man or woman for she freedom because she think she have a right to it besides she could not do it if she would for she have spend she earnings to educate she child this make mr dodge very angry and some high word pass between they my friend be afraid to come where i be but in the course of the day i receive a note from he i suppose they have not come from the south in the winter for a pleasure excursion and now the nature of they business be very plain mr bruce come to I and entreat I to leave the city the next morning she say she house be watch and it be possible that some clew to I might be obtain i refuse to take she advice she plead with a earnest tenderness that ought to have move I but i be in a bitter disheartened mood i be weary of fly from pillar to post i have be chase during half my life and it seem as if the chase be never to end there i sit in that great city guiltless of crime yet not daring to worship god in any of the church i hear the bell ring for afternoon service and with contemptuous sarcasm i say will the preacher take for they text ` proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of prison door to they that be bind ' or will they preach from the text ` do unto other as ye would they should do unto you ' oppressed pole and hungarian could find a safe refuge in that city john mitchell be free to proclaim in the city hall he desire for a plantation well stock with slave but there i sit a oppressed american not daring to show my face god forgive the black and bitter thought i indulge on that sabbath day the scripture say oppression make even a wise man mad and i be not wise i have be tell that mr dodge say he wife have never sign away she right to my child and if he could not get I he would take they this it be more than any thing else that rouse such a tempest in my soul benjamin be with he uncle william in californium but my innocent young daughter have come to spend a vacation with I i thought of what i have suffer in slavery at she age and my heart be like a tiger 's when a hunter try to seize she young dear mrs bruce i seem to see the expression of she face as she turn away discourage by my obstinate mood find she expostulation unavailing she send ellen to entreat I when ten o'clock in the evening arrive and ellen have not return this watchful and unwearied friend become anxious she come to we in a carriage bring a well-filled trunk for my journey -- trust that by this time i would listen to reason i yield to she as i ought to have do before the next day baby and i set out in a heavy snow storm bind for new england again i receive letter from the city of iniquity address to I under a assumed name in a few day one come from mr bruce inform
