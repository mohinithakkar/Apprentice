foreigner you know he explain over he shoulder to the boy he no understand you have to talk pigeon english to he see how he catch on to what i say the old face have grow less dull and weary a slow light seem to illumine it as the little stream of penny drip into the tremulous wrinkled old hand it suddenly flash into a smile then a stream of strange word issue from the old man 's lip they trip over each other and make weird indistinguishable combination of sound but the boy translate they by the light of that smile how pleased the old fellow be how he finger over the penny exultantly tell the whole story old man old tilly say quietly as they mount they wheel and glide off it look like a reg ` lar novel yes hurry up can not you impatiently jot urge begin at the beginning and go clear

one to go to anywhere old tilly rejoin quietly i tell mother i would see that you fellow go to church quiet and nice if possible she put in the extra collar and necktie on purpose a long rest with a hearty lunch and then they be off again in the clear moonlight it be splendid the tree the road the pale ghostly house -- everything have a weird charmed aspect they might have be ride through fairyland it be grow late they know and at last they stop out of sheer weariness a great square bulk loom faintly before they in the wane moonlight it might be a house -- might be a mountain jot spurt on ahead to reconnoiter house he shout back door open -- all quiet -- guess it be on a picnic ground i feel a stair that seem to lead up to a balcony or something well we be sleepy enough we 'll take anything we can get yawn kent come on then and ride into what seem a yard they find a good place for they wheel under some bush the moon be too low to give they any light but the boy find the doorway to the big building and go up the stair guide by they hand along the narrow passageway they could only discern a queer little enclosure top by a little rail they be too thoroughly tire out to be curious and feel some narrow seat they lay down and make themselves comfortable be soon asleep jot be dream that old tilly have make he go to church and the people be singing when suddenly he open he eye be he dream over he float a sweet hymn one he mother love to join in singing at church Sunday morning the boy 's eye open wider still at sight of fleck of sunshine dancing on the wall near and raise he head he see through the clear little pane of a long window where the green leaf be dance against the glass the singing go on and the boy raise himself in a wonder fashion upon he elbow where be they jot lift he head still higher and glance over the railing he look down upon a goodly company the amazement on he face grow greater instead of less they be in church -- that be sure jot look back to he sleep companion and hold he breath as one of they stir uneasily what if he should roll off the bench the hymn grow louder and sweeter and jot smooth out he hair and straighten he necktie and sit up straight the branch outside tap the narrow small paned window near he and from the open window below the sweet beauty of the summer morning steal in but as the minister rise to give out he text a sound from one of the boy back of he cause jot to turn chapter iv jot turn in he narrow seat there in the church gallery as he hear a sound that make he think he brother be wake but old tilly have only stir in he sleep and strike out a little jarringly against the back of the narrow gallery pew jot turn back and scan the place they have so innocently take for they quarter the night before the gallery pew they be in be like a tiny half-walled room with seat run around three side and up to the queer door on the fourth side the wall of the pew be almost as high as jot 's head if he have dare to stand up kent stir uneasily and throw out he arm with a smart rap against the side jot creep across to he in terror sh sh keep quiet do not breathe you be in meeting he whisper the minister 's down there preach now oh sh lemme -- but jot 's hand cut off the rest the other hand gently shake kent 's arm i tell you we be in meeting do not make a sound who be make a sound whisper kent now thoroughly awake be jot take suddenly crazy hark who be that talk if you do not believe I raise you eye over that wall and sec what whisper jot eagerly he draw kent up beside he and they peep carefully over kent drop back as jot have do in sheer surprise the two boy gaze at each other silently it be too much for kent though and to suppress a laugh he stuff he handkerchief in he mouth kent point to old tilly and smile broadly he promise mother he would take we to meeting he whisper and he be do it yes but she would not like to see he asleep in church jot whisper hack below they the minister 's deep voice toll on solemnly they could not catch all the word come on i be go to sit up like folk i want to hear what he be say jot whisper after awhile they smooth they hair and try to straighten collar and tie and then suddenly some of the people down below in the body of the church glance up and see two boyish face side by side in the gallery the puzzle be beyond unravel the woman prod each other gently with they parasol tip and raise they eyebrow the man look blank when have those youngster get up there in that pew one of the deacon scowl a little but the two quiet brown face allay he suspicion it be not mischief -- it be mystery the sight that have meet jot 's astonished eye in the beginning be a quaint one this be a new kind of a church at home there be row upon row of red-cushioned seat with the hymn book and fan in the rack make the only break to the monotony here the pew be all little square room with high partition and door the hard board seat run ` way round they all so that in some of they people be sit directly back to the minister row on row of the little room like cell jut against each other and fill up the entire space below save the aisle and the pulpit -lrb- illustration : this be a new kind of church -rrb- and the pulpit jot 's eye return to it constantly in wonder admiration there be a steep flight of stair lead up to it on each side and a enormous umbrella-like sounding-board be poise heavily above it the pulpit itself be round and tail and hang above the head of the congregation make the practice of look up at the good old minister a neck-aching process directly beneath the pulpit be a seat face the people it be empty now but a hundred year ago have the lad but know it the deacon have sit there and the tithing-man whose duty it be to go about wake up the dozer with he long wand it be call the deacon 's seat and if sometimes the deacon themselves have drop off into peaceful nap -- what then do the tithing-man nudge they sharply with he stick or be he doze too there be still a few of these old landmark leave in the country now and then we run across they and get a distinct flavor of old time and it be worth go a good many mile to see the inside of one of they by just shut one 's eye and make believe a little how easy it would be to conjure up we dear old grandmother in they great scoop bonnet and grandfather with they high coat collar come nearly to they bald crown and the deacon 's seat under the pulpit -- how easy to make believe the deacon in claw-hammer coat and queer frill shirt bosom the people jot and kent saw be ordinary modern people and they modern clothes look oddly out of date against the quaint old setting jot think with a twinge of sympathy how hard the seat must feel and how shoulder must ache against the perfectly straight-up-and-down back he feel a sudden pity for he great-grandmother and great-uncle and aunt this especial old church box-like and unchurchly without and ancient within be rarely use for worship except in the summer month then there be service in it as often as a minister could be find to conduct they the three young adventurer have stumble upon it in the dark and oversleep out of sheer physical weariness it be up in one of the old choir pew in the high gallery they have waken -- or jot have waken -- to the strain of the beautiful hymn he mother love the whole explanation be simple enough when it be explain kent and jot work it out slowly in they own mind meanwhile old tilly sleep on and the sermon come to a end there be another hymn and then the benediction the people disperse slowly and once more the big house be desert then jot wake old tilly i say he cry i say old fellow wake up yes i be come in a minute mutter old tilly you 'll be late for church remark kent dryly with a wink at jot old tilly stir and rise on he elbow then he give a bewildered look around he you be in church do not you promise mother you would take we to church yes but you sleep all through the service say kent and i shall tell mother so kent eddy what be you try to get at how do we get here anyhow say old tilly rise cautiously and then as he look down on the empty room below stand to he full height he say well if i ever a laugh break through he white tooth i should say we have be in church he add why do not you fellow wake I up what do the folk think oh they only see the two good boy sit on the seat face they we do not say we have another one smuggle in under beside we but my you do rap the seat awfully once with you elbow well i know one thing : my shoulder ache from lie on that narrow seat so long say old tilly i say let 's go down to the wheel and the grub i be half starve all right say kent in rather a subdue way the morning service have steal pleasingly through he and somehow it seem to the little lad as though they ship have be guide into a wonderfully quiet harbor and now he follow he brother down the narrow stair that they have so innocently grope they way up in darkness the night before the three have agree to leave the church and partake of the lunch that be in the basket on the wheel but now they find do so not as easy of accomplishment as they have at first think when they try the outer door they find to they dismay that it be lock old tilly would not believe kent and he push the latter 's hand off the door knob rather impatiently let I get hold of it but rattle the door as he might he could not stir the rusty lock well we be lock in that be sure say kent look almost dismayed chapter v i guess you be right jotham old tilly say but what in the world do they go and lock up for when we get in just as easy as pie last night exclaim kent disgustedly oh ask something easy jot cry what i want to know be how we be go to get on the other side o ' that door the care-taker if one could call he that of the old meeting-house have take it into he head to take care of it -- or it may have be that the key chance to be in he pocket convenient at all event the door be securely fasten the three boy reluctantly give up the attempt to force it window kent suddenly exclaim and they all laugh foolishly they have not think of the window that be a good joke on the eddy boy old tilly say we sha 'n' t hear the last of it if anybody let on to father better wait till we be on the other side of the window advise kent maybe it be not a joke there be window enough they be range in monotonous row on all side of the church above and below they all have tiny old-fashioned pane of glass and be fasten with wooden button it be the work of a minute to unbutton one of they and jump out there breathe jot in relief as he toe touch sod again i feel as if i would be in prison and just get out break out -- that be the way i feel i wish we could fasten the window again old tilly say thoughtfully kent be rub he ankle ruefully it be a joke on we we moon round that door all that time and think we be trap oh well come on it do not matter now we be free again come along -- here be we wheel all right old tilly say briskly let 's go down to that little bunch of white house there under the hill and pick out the one we want to stay over night in the one that want we to stay in it you mean come on then it be already mid-afternoon the beautiful Sunday peace that brood over new england 's country place rest softly on new-mown field and bit of pasture and wood the boy ' heart be make tender by the service they have so unexpectedly attend and as the beauty of the scene recall again the home field they fall into

patiently till just a blacken corner tell that they have be there in the trig little barn it have be a short sharp battle a moment 's indecision a very little less determine effort and presence of mind and nothing but a miracle could have save the barn and then the house it stand so near -- what could have save it it be a hour or more before old tilly would allow the live stock bring back into the barn they hover anxiously over the blacken ember for fear they might spring into life again but at last there seem no danger and presently the building settle back to quiet again and the tired rescuer try to snatch a little sleep in the hay jot wake the other in the first dim daylight fire fire he scream where where be it cry kent spring to he foot put -- it -- o-ut mumble old tilly it be only a nightmare but the boy could not doze again after it it be just as the sun be rise clear and beautiful that the boy come out from the barn and as they catch sight of each other 's blacken face in the dazzling light they each give way to a roar of laughter well we all seem to be in the same boat say kent make for the pump and fill the pail one after the other here be a pail apiece that ought
