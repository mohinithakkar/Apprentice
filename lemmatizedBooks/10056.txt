_ = khung introduction the strangest figure that meet we in the annals of oriental thought be that of confucius to the popular mind he be the founder of a religion and yet he have nothing in common with the great religious teacher of the east we think of siddartha the founder of buddhism as the very impersonation of romantic asceticism enthusiastic self-sacrifice and faith in the thing that be invisible zoroaster be the friend of god talk face to face with the almighty and drinking wisdom and knowledge from the lip of omniscience mohammed be represent as snatch up into heaven where he receive the divine communication which he be bid to propagate with fire and sword throughout the world these great teacher live in a atmosphere of the supernatural they speak with the authority of inspired prophet they bring the unseen world close to the mind of they disciple they speak positively of immortality of reward or punishment beyond the grave the present life they despise the future be to they everything in its promise satisfaction the teaching of confucius be of a very different sort throughout he whole writings he have not even mention the name of god he decline to discuss the question of immortality when he be ask about spiritual being he remark if we can not even know man how can we know spirit yet this be the man the impress of whose teaching have form the national character of five hundred million of people a temple to confucius stand to this day in every town and village of china he precept be commit to memory by every child from the tenderest age and each year at the royal university at pekin the emperor hold a festival in honor of the illustrious teacher the influence of confucius spring first of all from the narrowness and definiteness of he doctrine he be no transcendentalist and never meddle with supramundane thing he teaching be of the earth earthy it deal entirely with the common relation of life and the golden rule he must necessarily have stumble upon as the most obvious canon of he system he strike we as be the great stoic of the east for he believe that virtue be base on knowledge knowledge of a man 's own heart and knowledge of human-kind there be a pathetic resemblance between the account give of the death of confucius and the death of zeno both die almost without warn in dreary hopelessness without the ministration of either love or religion this may be a mere coincidence but the life and teaching of both man must have lead they to look with indifference upon such a end for confucius in he teaching treat only of man 's life on earth and seem to have have no idea with regard to the human lot after death if he have any idea he preserve a inscrutable silence about they as a moralist he prescribe the duty of the king and of the father and advocate the cultivation by the individual man of that rest or apathy of mind which resemble so much the disposition aim at by the greek and roman stoic even as a moralist he seem to have sacrifice the ideal to the practical and he loose notion about marriage he tolerance of concubinage the slight emphasis which he lay on the virtue of veracity -- of which indeed he do not seem himself to have be particularly studious in he historic writings -- place he low down in the rank of moralist yet he teach what he feel the people could receive and the flat mediocrity of he character and he teaching have be stamp forever upon a people who while they be kindly gentle forbearing and full of family piety be palpably lack not only in the exaltation of mysticism but in any religious feeling generally so-called the second reason that make the teaching of confucius so influential be base on the circumstance of the time when this thoughtful earnest youth awake to the consciousness of life about he he see that the abuse under which the people groan spring from the feudal system which cut up the country into separate territory over which the power of the king have no control china be in the position of france in the year precede philippe-auguste excepting that there be no place of sanctuary and no truce of god the great doctrine of confucius be the unlimited despotism of the emperor and he moral precept be intend to teach the emperor how to use he power aright but the emperor be only typical of all those in authority -- the feudal duke the judge on the bench and the father of the family each could discharge he duty aright only by submit to the moral discipline which confucius prescribe a vital element in this system be its conservatism its adherence to the imperial idea as jame i say no bishop no king so the imperialist of china have find in confucianism the strongest basis for the throne and have support its dissemination accordingly the analect of confucius contain the gist of he teaching and be worthy of study we find in this work most of the precept which he disciple have preserve and record they form a code remarkable for simplicity even crudity and we be compel to admire the force of character the practical sagacity the insight into the need of the hour which enable confucius without claim any divine sanction to impose this system upon he countryman the name confucius be only the latinized form of two word which mean master k ` ung he be bear 551 bc he father be governor of shantung he be marry at nineteen and seem to have occupy some minor position under the government in he twenty-fourth year he enter upon the three year ' mourning for the death of he mother he seclusion give he time for deep thought and the study of history and he resolve upon the regeneration of he unhappy country by the time he be thirty he become know as a great teacher and disciple flock to he but he be yet occupy in public duty and rise through successive stage to the office of chief judge in he own country of lu he tenure of office be say to have put a end to crime and he become the idol of the people in he district the jealousy of the feudal lord be rouse by he fame as a moral teacher and a blameless judge confucius be drive from he home and wander about with a few disciple until he sixty-ninth year when he return to lu after accomplish a work which have bear fruit such as it be to the present day he spend the remain five year of he life in editing the ode and historic monument in which the glory of the ancient chinese dynasty be set forth he die in he seventy-third year 478 bc there can be no doubt that the success of confucius have be singularly great owing especially to the narrow scope of he scheme which have become crystallize in the habit usage and custom of the people especially have it be instrumental in consolidate the empire and in strengthen the power of the monarch who as he every year burn incense in the red-walled temple at pekin utter sincerely the invocation : great art thou o perfect sage thy virtue be full thy doctrine complete among mortal man there have not be thine equal all king honor thee thy statute and law have come gloriously down thou art the pattern in this imperial school reverently have the sacrificial vessel be set out full of awe we sound we drum and bell e w the analect book i on learning -- miscellaneous saying : -- to learn say the master and then to practice opportunely what one have learn -- do not this bring with it a sense of satisfaction to have associate in study come to one from distant part -- do not this also mean pleasure in store and be not those who while not comprehend all that be say still remain not unpleased to hear man of the superior order a say of the scholar yu : -- it be rarely the case that those who act the part of true man in regard to they duty to parent and elder brother be at the same time willing to turn currishly upon they superior : it have never yet be the case that such as desire not to commit that offence have be man willing to promote anarchy or disorder man of superior mind busy themselves first in get at the root of thing and when they have succeed in this the right course be open to they well be not filial piety and friendly subordination among brother a root of that right feeling which be owe generally from man to man the master observe rarely do we meet with the right feeling due from one man to another where there be fine speech and study mien the scholar tsang once say of himself : on three point i examine myself daily viz whether in look after other people 's interest i have not be act whole-heartedly whether in my intercourse with friend i have not be true and whether after teach i have not myself be practise what i have teach the master once observe that to rule well one of the larger state mean strict attention to its affair and conscientiousness on the part of the ruler careful husbanding of its resource with at the same time a tender care for the interest of all class and the employ of the mass in the public service at suitable season let young people say he show filial piety at home respectfulness towards they elder when away from home let they be circumspect be truthful they love go out freely towards all cultivate good-will to man and if in such a walk there be time or energy leave for other thing let they employ it in the acquisition of literary or artistic accomplishment the disciple tsz-hiá say the appreciation of worth in man of worth thus divert the mind from lascivious desire -- minister to parent while one be the most capable of so do -- serve one 's ruler when one be able to devote himself entirely to that object -- be sincere in one 's language in intercourse with friend : this i certainly must call evidence of learn though other may say there have be ` no learning ' saying of the master : -- if the great man be not grave he will not be revere neither can he learning be solid give prominent place to loyalty and sincerity have no associate in study who be not advance somewhat like yourself when you have err be not afraid to correct yourself a say of the scholar tsang : -- the virtue of the people be renew and enrich when attention be see to be pay to the depart and the remembrance of distant ancestor keep and cherish tsz-k ` in put this query to he fellow disciple tsz-kung : say he when we master come to this or that state he learn without fail how it be be govern do he investigate matter or be the fact give he tsz-kung answer we master be a man of pleasant manners and of probity courteous moderate and unassuming : it be by he be such that he arrive at the fact be not he way of arrive at thing different from that of other a saying of the master : -- he who after three year ' observation of the will of he father when alive or of he past conduct if dead do not deviate from that father 's way be entitle to be call ' a dutiful son ' saying of the scholar yu : -- for the practice of the rule of propriety -lrb- 1 -rrb- one excellent way be to be natural this naturalness become a great grace in the practice of king of former time let everyone small or great follow they example it be not however always practicable and it be not so in the case of a person who do thing naturally know that he should act so and yet who neglect to regulate he act accord to the rule when truth and right be hand in hand a statement will bear repetition when respectfulness and propriety go hand in hand disgrace and shame be keep afar-off remove all occasion for alienate those to whom you be bind by close tie and you have they still to resort to a say of the master : -- the man of greater mind who when he be eat crave not to eat to the full who have a home but crave not for comfort in it who be active and earnest in he work and careful in he word who make towards man of high principle and so maintain he own rectitude -- that man may be style a devoted student tsz-kung ask what say you sir of the poor who do not cringe and fawn and what of the rich who be without pride and haughtiness they be passable the master reply yet they be scarcely in the same category as the poor who be happy and the rich who love propriety in the ` book of the ode ' tsz-kung go on to say we read of one polish as by the knife and file the graving-tool the smoothing-stone do that coincide with you remark ah such as you reply the master may well commence a discussion on the ode if one tell you how a thing go you know what ought to come it do not greatly concern I say the master that man do not know I my great concern be my not know they -lrb- footnote 1 : a important part of a chinaman 's education still the text-book the li kus contain rule for behavior and propriety for the whole life from the cradle to the grave -rrb- book ii good government -- filial piety -- the superior man saying of the master : -- let a ruler base he government upon virtuous principle and he will be like the pole-star which remain steadfast in its place while all the host of star turn towards it the ` book of ode ' contain three hundred piece but one expression in it may be take as cover the purport of all viz unswerving mindfulness to govern simply by statute and to reduce all to order by means of pain and penalty be to render the people evasive and devoid of any sense of shame to govern upon principle of virtue and to reduce they to order by the rule of propriety would not only create in they the sense of shame but would moreover reach they in all they error when i attain the age of fifteen i become bent upon study at thirty i be a confirm student at forty nought could move I from my course at fifty i comprehend the will and decree of heaven at sixty my ear be attuned to they at seventy i could follow my heart 's desire without overstep the line of rectitude to a question of mang-i as to what filial piety consist in the master reply in not be perverse afterwards when fan ch ' i be drive he the master inform he of this question and answer and fan ch ' i ask what be you mean the master reply i mean that the rule of propriety should always be adhere to in regard to those who bring we into the world : in minister to they while live in bury they when dead and afterwards in the offering to they of sacrificial gift to a query of mang wu respect filial piety the master reply parent ought to bear but one trouble -- that of they own sickness to a like question put by tsz-yu he reply be this : the filial piety of the present day simply mean the be able to support one 's parent -- which extend even to the case of dog and horse all of which may have something to give in the way of support if there be no reverential feeling in the matter what be there to distinguish between the case to a like question of tsz-hium he reply : the manner be the difficulty if in the case of work to be do the younger folk simply take upon themselves the toil of it or if in the matter of meat and drink they simply set these before they elder -- be this to be take as filial piety once the master remark i have converse with hwúi the whole day long and he have controvert nothing that i have say as if he be without wit but when he back be turn and i look attentively at he conduct apart from I i find it satisfactory in all its issue no indeed hwúi be not without he wit other observation of the master : -- if you observe what thing people -lrb- usually -rrb- take in hand watch they motive and note particularly what it be that give they satisfaction shall they be able to conceal from you what they be conceal themselves indeed be verse in ancient lore and familiarize yourself with the modern then may you become teacher the great man be not a mere receptacle in reply to tsz-kung respect the great man : -- what he first say as a result of he experience he afterwards follow up the great man be catholic-minded and not one-sided the common man be the reverse learning without thought be a snare thought without learning be a danger where the mind be set much upon heterodox principle -- there truly and indeed be harm to the disciple tsz-lu the master say shall i give you a lesson about knowledge when you know a thing maintain that you know it and when you do not acknowledge you ignorance this be characteristic of knowledge tsz-chang be study with a eye to official income the master address he thus : of the many thing you hear hold aloof from those that be doubtful and speak guardedly with reference to the rest you mistake will then be few also of the many course you see adopt hold aloof from those that be risky and carefully follow the other you will then seldom have occasion for regret thus be seldom mistaken in you utterance and have few occasion for regret in the line you take you be on the high road to you preferment to a question put to he by duke ngaus -lrb- 2 -rrb- as to what should be do in order to render the people submissive to authority confucius reply promote the straightforward and reject those whose course be crooked and the thing will be effect promote the crooked and reject the straightforward and the effect will be the reverse when kus k ` ang -lrb- 3 -rrb- ask of he how the people could be induce to show respect loyalty and willingness to be lead the master answer let there be grave dignity in he who have the oversight of they and they will show he respect let he be see to be good to he own parent and kindly in disposition and they will be loyal to he let he promote those who have ability and see to the instruction of those who have it not and they will be willing to be lead some one speak to confucius inquire why sir be you not a administrator of government the master rejoin what say the ` book of the annals ' with reference to filial duty -- ` make it a point to be dutiful to you parent and amicable with you brethren the same duty extend to a administrator ' if these then also make a administrator how be i to take you word about be a administrator on one occasion the master remark i know not what man be good for on whose word no reliance can be place how should you carriage large or little get along without you whipple-tree or swing-tree tsz-chang ask if it be possible to forecast the state of the country ten generation hence the master reply in this manner : the yin dynasty adopt the rule and manners of the hiá line of king and it be possible to tell whether it retrograde or advance the chow line have follow the yin adopt its way and whether there have be deterioration or improvement may also be determine some other line may take up in turn those of chow and suppose even this process to go on for a hundred generation the result may be know other saying of the master : -- it be but flattery to make sacrificial offering to depart spirit not belong to one 's own family it be moral cowardice to leave undo what one perceive to be right to do -lrb- footnote 2 : of lu -lrb- confucius 's native state -rrb- -rrb- -lrb- footnote 3 : head of one of the three family of lu -rrb- book iii abuse of

harmony on a question be put to he by lin fang a disciple as to what be the radical idea upon which the rule of propriety be base the master exclaim ah that be a large question as to some rule where there be likelihood of extravagance they would rather demand economy in those which relate to mourning and where there be likelihood of be easily satisfied what be want be real sorrow speaking of the disorder of the time he remark that while the barbarian on the north and east have they chieftain we here in this great country have nothing to compare with they in that respect : -- we have lose these distinction allude to the matter of the chief of the kus family worship on tai-shan -lrb- 7 -rrb- the master say to yen yu can not you save he from this he reply it be beyond my power alas alas exclaim the master be we to say that the spirit of t ` ai-shan have not as much discernment as lin fang of the superior man the master observe in he there be no contentiousness say even that he do

if on the other hand he habituate himself to impetuosity of mind and show it also in he way of do thing be he not then over-impetuous you be right say the master when the duke ngaus inquire which of the disciple be devote to learn confucius answer he there be one yen hwúi who love it -- a man whose angry feeling towards any particular person he do not suffer to visit upon another a man who would never fall into the same error twice unfortunately he allotted time be short and he die and now he like be not to be find i have never hear of one so devoted to learn while tsz-hwa a disciple be away

doctrine it be that i be not strong enough the master rejoin it be when those who be not strong enough have make some moderate amount of progress that they fail and give up but you be now draw you own line for yourself address tsz-hiá the master say let you scholarship be that of gentleman and not like that of common man when tsz-yu become governor of wu-shing the master say to he do you find good

obiter dictum _ of the master : -- whoever have not the glib utterance of the priest t ' o as well as the handsomeness of prince cháu of sing will find it hard to keep out of harm 's way in the present age who can go out but by that door why walk no one by these guide principle where plain naturalness be more in evidence than polish we have -- the man from the country where polish be more in

you have the good fortune to avoid they who know it be not as those who love it nor they who love it as those who rejoice in it -- that be have the fruition of they love for it to the average man and those above the average it be possible to discourse on higher subject to those from the average downward it be not possible fan ch ' i put a query about wisdom the master reply to labor for the promote of righteous conduct among the people of the land to be serious in regard to spiritual being and to hold aloof from they -- this may be call wisdom to a further query about philanthropy he reply those who possess that virtue find difficulty with it at first success later man of practical knowledge he say find they gratification among the river of the lowland man of sympathetic social feeling find theirs among the hill the former be active and bustling the latter calm and quiet the former take they day of pleasure the latter look to length of day allude to the state of t ' i and lu he observe that t ' i by one change might attain to the condition of lu and that lu by one change might attain to good government a exclamation of the master -lrb- satirize the time when old term relate to government be still use while bereft of they old meaning -rrb- : -- a quart and not a quart _ quart _ indeed _ quart _ indeed tsai will a disciple put a query say he suppose a philanthropic person be tell ` there be a fellow-creature down in the well ' would he go down after he why should he really do so answer the master the good man or a superior man might be induce to go but not to go down he may be mislead but not befool the superior man say he with he wide study of book and hedge himself round by the rule of propriety be not surely after all that capable of overstep he bound once when the master have have a interview with nan-tsz which have scandalize he disciple tsz-lu he utter the solemn adjuration if i have do aught amiss may heaven reject I may heaven reject I how far-reaching say he be the moral excellence that flow from the constant mean -lrb- 15 -rrb- it have for a long time be rare among the people tsz-kung say suppose the case of one who confer benefit far and wide upon the people and who can in so do make he bounty universally feel -- how would you speak of he might he be call philanthropic the master exclaim what a work for philanthropy he would require indeed to be a sage he would put into shade even yau and shun -- well a philanthropic person desire for himself a firm footing be lead on to give one to other desire for himself a enlighten perception of thing he be lead on to help other to be similarly enlighten if one could take a illustration come closer home to we than yours that might be make the starting-point for speak about philanthropy -lrb- footnote 14 : at this time confucius be criminal judge in he native state of lu yuen sz have be a disciple the commentator add that this be the officer 's proper salary and that he do wrong to refuse it -rrb- -lrb- footnote 15 : the doctrine afterwards know by that name and which give its title to a confucian treatise -rrb- book vii characteristic of confucius -- a incident say the master : -- i as a transmitter -lrb- 16 -rrb- and not a originator and as one who believe in and love the ancient venture to compare myself with we old p ` ang what find you indeed in I -- a quiet brooder and memorizer a student never satiate with learn a unwearied monitor of other the thing which weigh heavily upon my mind be these -- failure to improve in the virtue failure in discussion of what be learn inability to walk accord to knowledge receive as to what be right and just inability also to reform what have be amiss in he hour of recreation and refreshment the master 's manner be easy and unconstrained affable and win once he exclaim alas i must be get very feeble ` tis long since i have have a repetition of the dream in which i use to see the duke of chow -lrb- 17 -rrb- concentrate the mind say he upon the good way maintain firm hold upon virtue rely upon philanthropy find recreation in the art -lrb- 18 -rrb- i have never withhold instruction from any even from those who have come for it with the smallest offering no subject do i broach however to those who have no eager desire to learn no encouraging hint do i give to those who show no anxiety to speak out they idea nor have i anything more to say to those who after i have make clear one corner of the subject can not from that give I the other three if the master be take a meal and there be any in mourning beside he he would not eat to the full on one day on which he have weep on that day he would not sing address he favorite disciple he say to you only and myself it have be give to do this -- to go when call to serve and to go back into quiet retirement when release from office tsz-lu hear the remark say but if sir you have the handling of the army of one of the greater state -lrb- 19 -rrb- whom would you have associate with you in that case the master answer : -- not the one ` who 'll rouse the tiger ' not the one ` who 'll wade the ho ' not the man who can die with no regret he must be one who should watch over affair with apprehensive caution a man fond of strategy and of perfect skill and effectiveness in it as to wealth he remark if wealth be a object that i could go in quest of i should do so even if i have to take a whip and do groom ' work but see that it be not i go after those object for which i have a liking among matter over which he exercise great caution be time of fast war and sickness when he be in the state of t ' i and have hear the ancient shau music he lose all perception of the taste of he meat i have no idea say he that music could have be bring to this pitch in the course of conversation yen yu say do the master take the part of the prince of wei ah yes say tsz-kung i will go and ask he that on go in to he that disciple begin what sort of man be peh-i and shuh t ' i worthy of the olden time the master reply have they any feeling of resentment be the next question they aim and object he answer be that of do the duty which every man owe to he fellow and they succeed in do it -- what room further for feeling of resentment the questioner on come out say the master do not take he part with a meal of coarse rice say the master and with water to drink and my bent arm for my pillow -- even thus i can find happiness riches and honor without righteousness be to I as fleeting cloud give I several year more to live say he and after fifty year ' study of the ` book of change ' i might come to be free from serious error the master 's regular subject of discourse be the book of the ode and history and the up-keeping of the rule of propriety on all of these he regularly discourse the duke of shih question tsz-lu about confucius and the latter do not answer hearing of this the master say why do you not say he be a man with a mind so intent on he pursuit that he forget he food and find such pleasure in they that he forget he trouble and do not know that old age be come upon he as i come not into life with any knowledge of it he say and as my liking be for what be old i busy myself in seek knowledge there strange occurrence exploit of strength deed of lawlessness reference to spiritual being -- such-like matter the master avoid in conversation let there he say be three man walk together : from that number i should be sure to find my instructor for what be good in they i should choose out and follow and what be not good i should modify on one occasion he exclaim heaven begat virtue in I what can man do unto I to he disciple he once say do you look upon I my son as keep anything secret from you i hide nothing from you i do nothing that be not manifest to you eye my disciple that be so with I four thing there be which he keep in view in he teaching -- scholarliness conduct of life honesty faithfulness it be not give to I he say to meet with a sage let I but behold a man of superior mind and that will suffice neither be it give to I to meet with a good man let I but see a man of constancy and it will suffice it be difficult for person to have constancy when they pretend to have that which they be destitute of to be full when they be empty to do thing on a grand scale when they means be contract when the master fish with hook and line he do not also use a net when out with he bow he would never shoot at game in cover some there may be say he who do thing in ignorance of what they do i be not of these there be a alternative way of know thing viz -- to sift out the good from the many thing one hear and follow it and to keep in memory the many thing one see pupil from hu-hiang be difficult to speak with one youth come to interview the master and the disciple be in doubt whether he ought to have be see why so much ado say the master at my merely permit he approach and not rather at my allow he to draw back if a man have cleanse himself in order to come and see I i receive he as such but i do not undertake for what he will do when he go away be the philanthropic spirit far to seek indeed the master exclaim i wish for it and it be with I the minister of crime in the state of ch ` in ask confucius whether duke ch ` a of lu be acquaint with the propriety and he answer yes he know they when confucius have withdraw the minister bow to wu-ma k ' i a disciple and motion to he to come forward he say i have hear that superior man show no partiality be they too then partial that prince take for he wife a lady of the wu family have the same surname as himself and have she name ` lady tsz of wu the elder ' if he know the propriety then who do not the disciple report this to the master who thereupon remark well for I if i err in any way other be sure to know of it when the master be in company with any one who sing and who sing well he must need have the song over again and after that would join in it although in letter he say i may have none to compare with I yet in my personification of the ` superior man ' i have not as yet be successful ' a sage and a philanthropist ' how should i have the ambition say he all that i can well be call be this -- a insatiable student a unwearied teacher -- this and no more -- exactly what we you disciple can not by any learn manage to be say kung-si hwa once when the master be seriously ill tsz-lu request to be allow to say prayer for he be such available ask the master yes say he and the manual of prayer say ` pray to the spirit above and to those here below ' my pray have be go on a long while say the master lavish living he say render man disorderly miserliness make they hard better however the hard than the disorderly again the man of superior mind be placidly compose the small-minded man be in a constant state of perturbation the master be gentle yet could be severe have a over-awing presence yet be not violent be

excellence for he allow the empire to pass by he onward to a third heir while the people in they ignorance of he motive be unable to admire he for so do without the propriety say the master we have these result : for deferential demeanor a worried one for calm attentiveness awkward bashfulness for manly conduct disorderliness for straightforwardness perversity when man of rank show genuine care for those nearest to they in blood the people rise to the duty of neighborliness and sociability and when old friendship among they be not allow to fall off there will be a cessation of underhand practice among the people the scholar tsang be once unwell and call he pupil to he he say to they disclose to view my foot and my hand what say the ode -- ` act as from a sense of danger with precaution and with care as a yawning gulf o'erlook as on ice that scarce will bear ' at all time my child i know how to keep myself free from bodily harm again during a illness of he mang king a official go to ask after he the scholar have some conversation with he in the course of which he say -- ` doleful the cry of a die bird good the last word of a die man ' there be three point which a man of rank in the management of he duty should set store upon : -- a lively manner and deportment banish both severity and laxity a frank and open expression of countenance ally closely with sincerity and a tone in he utterance utterly free from any approach to vulgarity and impropriety as to matter of bowl and dish leave such thing to those who be charge with the care of they another say of the scholar tsang : i once have a friend who though he possess ability would go question man of none and though surround by number would go with he question to isolate individual who also whatever he might have appear as if he be without it and with all he substantial acquirement make as though he mind be a mere blank and when insult would not retaliate -- this be ever he way again he say : the man that be capable of be intrust with the charge of a minor on the throne and give authority over a large territory and who during the important term of he superintendence can not be force out of he position be not such a ` superior man ' that he be indeed again : -- the learn official must not be without breadth and power of endurance : the burden be heavy and the way be long suppose that he take he duty to he fellow-men as he peculiar burden be that not indeed a heavy one and since only with death it be do with be not the way long sentence of the master : -- from the ` book of ode ' we receive impulse from the ` book of the rule ' stability from the ` book on music ' refinement -lrb- 20 -rrb- the people may be put into the way they should go though they may not be put into the way of understand it the man who like bravery and yet groan under poverty have mischief in he so too have the misanthrope groan at any severity show towards he even if a person be adorn with the gift of the duke of chow yet if he be proud and avaricious all the rest of he quality would not indeed be worth look at not easily find be the man who after three year ' study have fail to come upon some fruit of he toil the really faithful lover of learn hold fast to the good way till death he will not go into a state in which a downfall be imminent nor take up he abode in one where disorder reign when the empire be well order he will show himself when not he will hide himself away under a good government it will be a disgrace to he if he remain in poverty and low estate under a bad one it would be equally disgraceful to he to hold riches and honor if not occupy the office devise not the policy when the professor chus begin he duty how grand the finale of the first of the ode use to be

suppose i be to put to death the disorderly for the better encouragement of the orderly -- what say you to that sir reply confucius in the administration of government why resort to capital punishment covet what be good and the people will be good the virtue of the noble-minded man be as the wind and that of inferior man as grass the grass must bend when the wind blow upon it tsz-chang ask how otherwise he would describe the learn official who might be term influential what i wonder do you mean by one who be influential say the master i mean reply the disciple one who be sure to have a reputation throughout the country as well as at home that say the master be reputation not influence the influential man then if he be one who be genuinely straightforward and love what be just and right a discriminator of man 's word and a observer of they look and in honor careful to prefer other to himself -- will certainly have influence both throughout the country and at home the man of mere reputation on the other hand who speciously affect philanthropy though in he way of procedure he act contrary to it while yet quite evidently engross with that virtue -- will certainly have reputation both in the country and at home fan ch ' i stroll with he over the ground below the place of the rain-dance say to he i venture to ask how to raise the standard of virtue how to reform dissolute habit and how to discern what be illusory ah a good question indeed he exclaim well be not put duty first and success second a way of raise the standard of virtue and be not attack the evil in one 's self and not the evil which be in other a way of reform dissolute habit and as to illusion be not one morning 's fit of anger cause a man to forget himself and even involve in the consequence those who be near and dear to he -- be not that a illusion the same disciple ask he what be mean by a right regard for one 's fellow-creature he reply it be love to man ask by he again what be mean by wisdom he reply it be knowledge of man fan ch ' i do not quite grasp he mean the master go on to say lift up the straight set aside the crooked so can you make the crooked straight fan ch ' i leave he and meeting with tsz-hiá he say i have a interview just now with the master and i ask he what wisdom be in he answer he say ` lift up the straight set aside the crooked and so can you

tsz-lu be ask about government lead the way in it say the master and work hard at it request to say more he add and do not tire of it chung-kung on be make first minister to the chief of the kus family consult the master about government and to he he say let the head of office be head excuse small fault promote man of sagacity and talent but he ask how be i to know the sagacious and talented before promote they promote those whom you do know say the master as to those of whom you be uncertain will other omit to notice they tsz-lu say to the master as the prince of wei sir have be wait for you to act for he in he government what be it you intention to take in hand first one thing of necessity he answer -- the rectification of term that exclaim tsz-lu how far away you be sir why such rectification what a rustic you be tsz-lu rejoin the master a gentleman would be a little reserved and reticent in matter which he do not understand if term be incorrect language will be incongruous and if language be incongruous deed will be imperfect so again when deed be imperfect propriety and harmony can not prevail and when this be the case law relate to crime will fail in they aim and if these last so fail the people will not know where to set hand or foot hence a man of superior mind certain first of he term be fit to speak and be certain of what he say can proceed upon it in the language of such a person there be nothing heedlessly irregular -- and that be the sum of the matter fan ch ' i request that he might learn something of husbandry for that say the master i be not equal to a old husbandman might he then learn something of gardening he ask i be not equal to a old gardener be the reply a man of little mind that say the master when fan ch ' i have go out let a man who be set over the people love propriety and they will not presume to be disrespectful let he be a lover of righteousness and they will not presume to be aught but submissive let he love faithfulness and truth and they will not presume not to lend he they hearty assistance ah if all this only be so the people from all side would come to such a one carry they child on they back what need to turn he hand to husbandry though a man say he could hum through the ode -- the three hundred -- yet should show himself unskilled when give some administrative work to do for he country though he might know much of that other lore yet if when send on a mission to any quarter he could answer no question personally and unaided what after all be he good for let a leader say he show rectitude in he own personal character and even without direction from he thing will go well if he be not personally upright he direction will not be comply with once he make the remark the government of lu and of weus

sentence which if act upon might have the effect of make a country prosperous confucius answer a sentence could hardly be suppose to do so much as that but there be a proverb people use which say ` to play the prince be hard to play the minister not easy ' assume that it be understand that ` to play the prince be hard ' would it not be probable that with that one sentence the country should be make to prosper be there then he ask one sentence which if act upon would have the effect of ruin a country confucius again reply a sentence could hardly be suppose to do so much as that but there be a proverb man have which say ` not gladly would i play the prince unless my word be ne'er withstand ' assume that the word be good and that none withstand they would not that also be good but assume

without scepticism brave without fear sir say tsz-kung that be what you say of yourself whenever tsz-kung draw comparison from other the master would say ah how wise and great you must have become now i have no time to do that again my great concern be not that man do not know I but that they can not again if a man refrain from make preparation against he be impose upon and from count upon other ' want of good faith towards he while he be foremost to perceive what be pass -- surely that be a wise and good man wi-shang mau accost confucius say kiu how come it that you manage to go perch and

the marketplace or the court if right principle be to have they course it be so destine say the master if they be not to have they course it be so destine what can liáu do against destiny there be worthy man say the master flee from the world some from they district some from the sight of man 's look some from the language they hear the man who have rise from they post and withdraw in this manner be seven in number tsz-lu have lodge overnight in shih-mun be accost by the gate-keeper in the morning where from he ask from confucius tsz-lu respond that be the man say he who know thing be not up to the mark and be make some ado about they be it not when the master be in wei he be once pound on the musical stone when a man with a basket of straw cross he threshold and exclaim ah there be a heart that feel aye drub the stone after which he add how vulgar how he hammer away on one note -- and no one know he and he give up and all be over be it deep we skirt we 'll raise to the waist -- or shallow then up to the knee ' what determination say the master yet it be not hard to do tsz-chang once say to he in the ` book of the annals ' it be state that while káu-tsung be in the mourning shed he spend the three year without speak what be mean by that why must you name káu-tsung say the master it be so with all other ancient sovereign : when one of they die the head of every department agree between themselves that they should give ear for three year to the prime minister when they betters love the rule then the folk be easy tool be a say of the master tsz-lu have ask what make a superior man he answer self-culture with a view to become seriously-minded nothing more than that say he self-culture with a view to the greater satisfaction of other add the master that and yet no more self-culture with a view to the greater satisfaction of all the clan and class he again add self-culture for the sake of all -- a result that that would almost put yau and shun into the shade to yuen jang -lrb- 31 -rrb- who be sit wait for he in a squatting -lrb- disrespectful -rrb- posture the master deliver himself as follow : the man who in he youth could show no humility or subordination who in he prime miss he opportunity and who when old age come upon he will not die -- that man be a miscreant and he tap he on the shin with he staff some one ask about he attendant -- a youth from the village of kiueh -- whether he be one who improve he reply i note that he seat himself in the place reserve for he betters and that when he be walk he keep abreast with he senior he be not one of those who care for improvement : he want to be a man all at once -lrb- footnote 30 : confucius have now retire from office and this incident occur only two year before he death -rrb- -lrb-

of food supply become so weak and ill that not one of they could stand tsz-lu with indignation picture on he countenance exclaim and be a gentleman to suffer starvation a gentleman reply the master will endure it unmoved but a common person break out into excess under it address tsz-kung the master say you regard I as one who study and store up in he mind a multiplicity of thing -- do you not -- i do he reply be it not so -- not at all i have one idea -- one cord on which to string all to tsz-lu he remark they who know virtue be rare if you would know one who without effort rule well be not shun such a one what do he indeed do he bear himself with reverent dignity and undeviatingly ` face the south ' and that be all tsz-chang be consult he about make way in life he answer be true and honest in all you say and seriously earnest in all you do and then even if you country be one inhabit by barbarian south or north you will make you way if you do not show yourself thus in word and deed how should you succeed even in you own district or neighborhood -- when you be afoot let these two counsel be two companion precede you yourself view they from behind when you drive have they in view as on the yoke of you carriage then may you make you way tsz-chang write they on the two end of he cincture straight be the course of the annalist yu say the master -- aye straight as a arrow fly be the country well govern or ill govern he be a arrow-like course a man of masterly mind too be kü pih-yuh when the land be be rightly govern he will serve when it be under bad government he be apt to recoil and brood not to speak to a man say he to whom you ought to speak be to lose you man to speak to one to whom you ought not to speak be to lose you word those who be wise will not lose they man nor yet they word again the scholar whose heart be in he work and who be philanthropic seek not to gain a livelihood by any means that will do harm to he philanthropy there have be man who have destroy they own life in the endeavor to bring that virtue in they to perfection tsz-kung ask how to become philanthropic the master answer he thus : a workman who want to do he work well must first sharpen he tool in whatever land you live serve under some wise and good man among those in high office and make friend with the more humane of its man of education yen yuen consult he on the management of a country he answer : -- go by the hiá calendar have the state carriage like those of the yin prince wear the chow cap for you music let that of shun be use for the posturer put away the song of ch ` ing and remove far from you man of artful speech : the ch ` ing song be immodest and artful talker be dangerous other saying of the master : -- they who care not for the morrow will the sooner have they sorrow ah ` tis hopeless i have not yet meet with the man who love virtue as he love beauty be not tsang wan like one who surreptitiously come by the post he hold he know the worth of hwúi of liu-hiá and could not stand in he presence be generous yourself and exact little from other then you banish complaint with one who do not come to I inquire ` what of this ' and ` what of that ' i never can ask ` what of this ' and give he up if a number of student be all day together and in they conversation never approach the subject of righteousness but be fond merely of give currency to smart little saying they be difficult indeed to manage when the ` superior man ' regard righteousness as the thing material give operation to it accord to the rule of propriety let it issue in humility and become complete in sincerity -- there indeed be you superior man the trouble of the superior man will be he own want of ability : it will be no trouble to he that other do not know he such a man think it hard to end he day and leave a name to be no longer name the superior man be exact of himself the common man be exact of other a superior man have self-respect and do not strive be sociable yet no party man he do not promote a man because of he word or pass over the word because of the man tsz-kung put to he the question be there one word upon which the whole life may proceed the master reply be not reciprocity such a word -- what you do not yourself desire do not put before other so far as i have to do with other whom do i over-censure whom do i over-praise if there be something in they that look very praiseworthy that something i put to the test i would have the man of the present day to walk in the straight path whereby those of the three dynasty have walk i have arrive as it be at the annalist 's blank page -- once he who have a horse would lend it to another to mount now alas it be not so artful speech be the confusion of virtue impatience over little thing introduce confusion into great scheme what be dislike by the mass need inquire into so also do that which they have a preference for a man may give breadth to he principle : it be not principle -lrb- in themselves -rrb- that give breadth to the man not to retract after commit a error may itself be call error if i have pass the whole day without food and the whole night without sleep occupy with my thought it profit I nothing : i be better engage in learn the superior man deliberate upon how he may walk in truth not upon what he may eat the farmer may plough and be on the way to want : the student learn and be on he way to emolument to live a right life be the concern of man of nobler mind : poverty give they none whatsoever the intellect may attain to unless the humanity within be powerful enough to keep guard over it be assuredly lose even though it be gain if there be intellectual attainment and the humanity within be powerful enough to keep guard over they yet unless -lrb- in a ruler -rrb- there be dignity in he rule the people will fail to show he respect again give the intellectual attainment and humanity sufficient to keep watch over they and also dignity in ruling yet if he movement be not in accordance with the rule of propriety he be not yet fully qualify the superior man may not be conversant with petty detail and yet may have important matter put into he hand the inferior man may not be charge with important matter yet may be conversant with the petty detail good-fellowship be more to man than fire and water i have see man step into fire and into water and meeting with death thereby i have not yet see a man die from plant he step in the path of good-fellowship rely upon good nature ` twill not allow precedence even to a teacher the superior man be inflexibly upright and take not thing upon trust in serve you prince make you service the serious concern and let salary be a secondary matter where instruction be to be give there must be no distinction of person where man 's method be not identical there can be no planning by one on behalf of another in speak perspicuity be all that be need when the blind music-master mien pay he a visit on he approach the step the master call out step and on he come to the mat say mat when all in the room be seat the master tell he so-and-so be here so-and-so be here when the music-master have leave tsz-chang say to he be that the way to speak to the music-master well he reply it be certainly the way to assist he book xvi against intestine strife -- good and bad friendship the chief of the kus family be about to make a onslaught upon the chuen-yu domain yen yu and tsz-lu in a interview with confucius tell he the kus be about to have a affair with chuen-yu yen say confucius do not the fault lie with you the chief of chuen-yu in time past be appoint lord of the east mung -lrb- mountain -rrb- besides he dwell within the confines of you own state and be a official of the state-worship how can you think of make a onslaught upon he it be the wish of we chief say yen yu not the wish of either of we minister confucius say yen there be a sentence of cháu jin which run thus : ` have make manifest they power and take they place in the official list when they find themselves incompetent they resign if they can not be firm when danger threaten the government nor lend support when it be reel of what use then shall they be as assistant ' -- besides you be wrong in what you say when a rhinoceros or tiger break out of its cage -- when a jewel or tortoise-shell ornament be damage in its casket -- whose fault be it but say yen yu so far as chuen-yu be concern it be now fortify and it be close to pi and if he do not now take it in another generation it will certainly be a trouble to he descendant yen exclaim confucius it be a painful thing to a superior man to have to desist from say ` my wish be so-and-so ' and to be oblige to make apology for my part i have learn this -- that ruler of state and head of house be not greatly concern about they small follow but about the want of equilibrium in it -- that they do not concern themselves about they become poor but about the best means of live quietly and contentedly for where equilibrium be preserve there will be no poverty where there be harmony they follow will not be small and where there be quiet contentment there will be no decline nor fall now if that be the case it follow that if man in outlying district be not submissive then a reform in education and moral will bring they to and when they have be so win then will you render they quiet and contented at the present time you two be assistant of you chief the people in the outlying district be not submissive and can not be bring round you dominion be divide prostrate disperse cleft in piece and you as its guardian be powerless and plan be be make for take up arm against those who dwell within you own state i be apprehensive that the sorrow of the kus family be not to lie in chuen-yu but in those within they own screen when the empire be well-ordered say confucius it be from the emperor that edict regard ceremonial music and expedition to quell rebellion go forth when it be be ill govern such edict emanate from the feudal lord and when the latter be the case it will be strange if in ten generation there be not a collapse if they emanate merely from the high official it will be strange if the collapse do not come in five generation when the state-edict be in the hand of the subsidiary minister it will be strange if in three generation there be no collapse when the empire be well-ordered government be not leave in the hand of high official when the empire be well-ordered the common people will cease to discuss public matter for five generation he say the revenue have depart from the ducal household four generation ago the government fall into the hand of the high official hence alas the straitened means of the descendant of the three hwan family there be say he three kind of friendship which be profitable and three which be detrimental to make friend with the upright with the trustworthy with the experienced be to gain benefit to make friend with the subtly perverse with the artfully pliant with the subtle in speech be detrimental again there be three kind of pleasure which be profitable and three which be detrimental to take pleasure in go regularly through the various branch of ceremonial and music in speaking of other ' goodness in have many worthy wise friend be profitable to take pleasure in wild bold pleasure in idle carelessly about in the too jovial accompaniment of feast be detrimental again three error there be into which they who wait upon they superior may fall : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- to speak before the opportunity come to they to speak which i call heedless haste -lrb- 2 -rrb- refrain from speak when the opportunity have come which i call concealment and -lrb- 3 -rrb- speak regardless of the mood he be in which i call blindness again three thing a superior should guard against : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- against the lust of the flesh in he earlier year while the vital power be not fully develop and fix -lrb- 2 -rrb- against the spirit of combativeness when he have come to the age of robust manhood and when the vital power be mature and strong and -lrb- 3 -rrb- against ambitiousness when old age have come on and the vital power have become weak and decayed three thing also such a man greatly revere : -- -lrb- 1 -rrb- the ordinance of heaven -lrb- 2 -rrb- great man -lrb- 3 -rrb- word of sage the inferior man know not the ordinance of heaven and therefore revere they not be unduly familiar in the presence of great man and scoff at the word of sage they whose knowledge come by birth be of all man the first in understand they to whom it come by study be next man of poor intellectual capacity who yet study may be add as a yet inferior class and lowest of all be they who be poor in intellect and never learn nine thing there be of which the superior man should be mindful : -- to be clear in vision quick in hear genial in expression respectful in demeanor true in word serious in duty inquire in doubt firmly self-controlled in anger just and fair when the way to success open out before he some have speak of ` look upon goodness as upon something beyond they reach ' and of ` look upon evil as like plunge one 's hand into scalding liquid ' -- i have see the man i have hear the saying some again have talk of ` living in seclusion to work out they design ' and of ` exercise themselves in righteous living in order to render they principle the more effective ' -- i have hear the saying i have not see the man duke king of t ' i have he thousand team of four yet on the day of he death the people have nothing to say of he goodness peh-i and shuh-t ' i starve at the foot of shau-yang and the people make mention of they to this day ` e ` en if not wealth thine object be ` tis all the same thou ` rt change to I ' be not this apropo in such case tsz-k ` in ask of pih-yu have you hear anything else peculiar from you father not yet say he once though he be stand alone when i be hurry past he over the vestibule and he say ` be you study the ode ' ` not yet ' i reply ` if you do not learn the ode ' say he ` you will not have the wherewithal for converse ' i turn away and study the ode another day when he be again stand alone and i be hurry past across the vestibule he say to I ` be you learn the rule of propriety ' ` not yet ' i reply ` if you have not study the rule you have nothing to stand upon ' say he i turn away and study the rule -- these two thing i have hear from he tsz-k ` in turn away and in great glee exclaim i ask one thing and have get three i have learn something about the ode and about the rule and moreover i have learn how the superior man will turn away he own son the wife of the ruler of a state be call by she husband my helpmeet she speak of herself as you little handmaiden the people of that state call she the prince 's helpmeet but address person of another state they speak of she as we little princess when person of another state name she they say also you prince 's helpmeet book xvii the master induce to take office -- nature and habit yang ho be desirous of have a interview with confucius but on the latter 's fail to go and see he he send a present of a pig to he house confucius go to return he acknowledgment for it at a time when he be not at home they meet however on the way he say to confucius come i want a word with you can that man be say to have good-will towards he fellow-man who hug and hide he own precious gift and allow he country to go on in blind error he

pass and the year do not wait for we true say confucius i will take office it be a remark of the master that while by nature we approximate towards each other by experience we go far asunder again only the supremely wise and the most deeply ignorant do not alter the master once on he arrival at wu-shing hear the sound of stringed instrument and sing he face beam with pleasure and he say laughingly to kill a cock -- why use a ox-knife tsz-yu the governor reply in former day sir i hear you say ` let the superior man learn right principle and he will be loving to other man let the

tsz-lu say the master you have hear of the six word with they six obfuscation no say he not so far sit down and i will tell you they they be these six virtue care for without care for any study about

nay be they not somewhat like thief that break through wall and steal again the plebeian kind of respect for piety be the very pest of virtue again listen on the road and repeat in the lane -- this be abandonment of virtue ah the low-minded creature he exclaim how be it possible indeed to serve one 's prince in they company before they have get what they want they be all anxiety to get it and after they have get it they be all anxiety lest they should lose it and while they be thus full of concern lest they should lose it there be no length to which they will not go again in olden time people

the new have spring up for we -- see also that all the change -lrb- 32 -rrb- in procure fire by friction have be go through in the four season -- surely a twelve-month might suffice the master ask he would it be a satisfaction to you -- that return to better food that put on of fine clothes it would say he then if you can be satisfy in so do do so but to a gentleman who be in mourn for a parent the choicest food will not be palatable nor will the listen to music be pleasant nor will comfort of home make he happy in mind hence he do not do as you suggest but if you be now happy in you mind then do so tsai will go out and the master go on to say it be want of human feeling in this man after a child have live three year it then break away from the tender nursing of its parent and this three year ' mourning be the customary mourning prevalent all over the empire can this man have enjoy the three year of loving care from he parent ah it be difficult say he to know what to make of those who be all day long cram themselves with food and be without anything to apply they mind to be there no dice and chess player better perhaps join in that pursuit than do nothing at all do a

a chance of success be mindful of what be just and proper who in he religious act be mindful of the duty of reverence and when in mourn think of he loss be indeed a fit and proper person for he place again he say if a person hold to virtue but never advance in it and if he have faith in right principle and do not build himself up in they how can he be regard either as have such or as be without they tsz-hiá 's disciple ask tsz-chang he view about intercourse with other what say you master he rejoin he say they reply ` associate with those who be qualify and repel from you such as be not ' tsz-chang then say that be different from what i have learn a superior man esteem the worthy and wise and bear with all he make much of the good and capable and pity the incapable be i eminently worthy and wise -- who be there then among man whom i will not bear with be i not worthy and wise -- other will be mind to repel I : i have nothing to do with repel they saying of tsz-hiá : -- even in inferior pursuit there must be something worthy of contemplation but if carry to a extreme there be danger of fanaticism hence the superior man do not engage in they the student who daily recognize how much he yet lack and as the month pass forget not what he have succeed in learning may undoubtedly be call a lover of learn wide research and steadfast purpose eager question and close reflection -- all this tend to humanize a man as workman spend they time in they workshop for the perfecting of they work so superior man apply they mind to study in order to make themselves thoroughly conversant with they subject when a inferior man do a wrong thing he be sure to gloss it over the superior man be see in three different aspect : -- look at he from a distance he be impose in appearance approach he he be gentle and warm-hearted hear he speak he be acute and strict let such a man have the people 's confidence and he will get much work out of they so long however as he do not possess they confidence they will regard he as grind they down when confidence be repose in he he may then with impunity administer reproof so long as it be not he will be regard as a detractor where there be no over-stepping of barrier in the practice of the higher virtue there may be freedom to pass in and out in the practice of the lower one tsz-yu have say the pupil in the school of tsz-hiá be good enough at such thing as sprinkling and scrub floor answer call and reply to question from superior and advance and retire to and from such but these thing be only offshoot -- as to the root of thing they be nowhere what be the use of all that when this come to the ear of tsz-hiá he say ah there he be mistaken what do a master in he method of teaching consider first in he precept and what do he account next as that about which he may be indifferent it be like as in the study of plant -- classification by _ differentia _ how may a master play fast and loose in he method of instruction would they not indeed be sage who could take in at once the first principle and the final development of thing further observation of tsz-hiá : -- in the public service devote what energy and time remain to study after study devote what energy and time remain to the public service as to the duty of mourn let they cease when the grief be past my friend tsz-chang although he have the ability to tackle hard thing have not yet the virtue of philanthropy the learn tsang observe how loftily tsz-chang bear himself difficult indeed along with he to practice philanthropy again he say i have hear this say by the master that ` though man may not exert themselves to the utmost in other duty yet surely in the duty of mourning for they parent they will do so ' again this also i have hear say by the master : ` the filial piety of mang chwang in other respects might be equal but as manifest in he make no change among he father 's minister nor in he father 's mode of government -- that aspect of it could not easily be equal ' yang fu have be make senior criminal judge by the chief of the mang clan consult with the learn tsang the latter advise he as follow : for a long time the chief have fail in they government and the people have become unsettled when you arrive at the fact of they case do not rejoice at you success in that but rather be sorry for they and have pity upon they tsz-kung once observe we speak of ` the iniquity of cháu ' -- but 'twa not so great as this and so it be that the superior man be averse from settle in this sink into which everything run that be foul in the empire again he say fault in a superior man be like eclipse of the sun or moon : when he be guilty of a trespass man all see it and when he be himself again all look up to he kung-sun ch ` a of wei inquire of tsz-kung how confucius acquire he learning tsz-kung reply the teaching of wan and wu have not yet fall to the ground they exist in man worthy and wise man have the more important of these store up in they mind and other who be not such store up the less important of they and as no one be thus without the teaching of wan and wu how should we master not have learn and moreover what permanent preceptor could he have shuh-sun wu-shuh address the high official at the court remark that tsz-kung be a greater worthy than confucius tsz-fuh king-pih go and inform tsz-kung of this remark tsz-kung say take by way of comparison the wall outside we house my wall be shoulder-high and you may look over it and see what the house and its contents be worth my master 's wall be ten of foot high and unless you should effect a entrance by the door you would fail to behold the beauty of the ancestral hall and the rich array of all its officer and they who effect a entrance by the door methink be few be it not however just like he -- that remark of the chief shuh-sun wu-shuh have be cast a slur on the character of confucius no use do that say tsz-kung he be irreproachable the wisdom and worth of other man be little hill and mound of earth : traversible he be the sun or the moon impossible to reach and pass and what harm i ask can a man do to the sun or the moon by wish to intercept himself from either it all show that he know not how to gauge capacity tsz-k ` in address tsz-kung say you depreciate yourself confucius be surely not a greater worthy than yourself tsz-kung reply in the use of word one ought never to be incautious because a gentleman for one single utterance of he be apt to be consider a wise man and for a single utterance may be account unwise no more might one think of attain to the master 's perfection than think of go upstairs to heaven be it ever he fortune to be at the head of the government of a country then that which be speak of as ` establish the country ' would be establishment indeed he would be its guide and it would follow he he would tranquillize it and it would render its willing homage : he would give forward impulse to it to which it would harmoniously respond in he life he would be its glory at he death there would be great lamentation how indeed could such as he be equal book xx extract from the book of history the

thus become a man of great achievement just in he rule and all be well content tsz-chang in a conversation with confucius ask what say you be essential for the proper conduct of government the master reply let the ruler hold in high estimation the five excellence and eschew the four evil then may he conduct he government properly and what call you the five excellence he be ask they be he say bounty without extravagance burden without exciting discontent desire without covetousness dignity without haughtiness show of majesty without fierceness what mean you ask tsz-chang by bounty without extravagance be it not this he reply -- to make that which be of benefit to the people still more beneficial when he select for they such labor as it be possible for they to do and exact they who will then complain so when he desire be the virtue of humaneness and he attain it how shall he then be covetous and if -- whether he have to do with few or with many with small or with great -- he do not venture ever to be careless be not this also to have dignity without haughtiness and if -- when properly vest in robe and cap and show dignity in he every look -- he appearance be so impose that the people look up to and stand in awe of he be not this moreover to show majesty without fierceness what then do you call the four evil say tsz-chang the answer here be omit to instruct the people and then inflict capital punishment on they -- which mean cruel tyranny omit to give they warn and yet look for perfection in they -- which mean oppression be slow and late in issue requisition and exact strict punctuality in the return -- which mean robbery and likewise in intercourse with man to expend and to receive in a stingy manner -- which be to act the part of a mere commissioner none can be a superior man say the master who do not recognize the decree of heaven none can have stability in he without a knowledge of the propriety none can know a man without know he utterance the saying of menicus -lrb- translate into english by jame legge _ -rrb- introduction a hundred year after the time of confucius the chinese nation seem to have fall back into they original condition of lawlessness and oppression the king 's power and authority be laugh to scorn the people be pillage by the feudal nobility and famine reign in many district the foundation of truth and social order seem to be overthrow there be teacher of immorality abroad who publish the old epicurean doctrine let we eat and drink for to-morrow we die this teaching be accompany by a spirit of cold-blooded egotism which extinguish every spark of confucian altruism even the pretended disciple of confucius confuse the precept of the master and by strip they of they narrow significance render they nugatory it be at this point that mang-tsze mang the philosopher arise he be sturdy in bodily frame vigorous in mind profound in political sagacity and utterly fearless in denounce the error of he countryman he have be bring up among the disciple of confucius in whose province he be bear bc 372 but he be much more active and aggressive less a mystic than a fanatic in comparison with he master he resolve on active measure in stem the tendency of he day he do indeed surround himself with a school of disciple but instead of make a series of desultory travels teach in remote place and along the high-road he go to the heart of the evil he present himself like a second john the baptist at the court of king and prince and there boldly denounce vice and misrule it be not difficult for a chinese scholar and teacher to find access to the highest of the land the chinese believe in the divine right of learn just as they believe in the divine right of king mang employ every weapon of persuasion in try to combat heresy and oppression alternately ridicule and reprove : now appeal in a burst of moral enthusiasm and now denounce in term of cut sarcasm the abuse which after all he fail to check the last prince

kingdom ' the great officer will say ` what be to be do to profit we family ' and the inferior officer and the common people will say ` what be to be do to profit we person ' superior and inferior will try to take the profit the one from the other and the kingdom will be endanger in the kingdom of ten thousand chariot the murderer of he ruler will be the chief of a family of a thousand chariot in the state of a thousand chariot the murderer of he ruler will be the chief of a family of a hundred chariot to have a thousand in ten thousand and a hundred in a thousand can not be regard as not a large allowance but if righteousness be put last and profit first they will not be satisfy without snatch all there never be a man train to benevolence who neglect he parent there never be a man train to righteousness who make he ruler a after consideration let you majesty likewise make benevolence and righteousness you only theme -- why must you speak of profit when mencius another day be see king

you majesty know the way of the grow grain during the seventh and eighth month when drought prevail the plant become dry then the cloud collect densely in the heaven and send down torrent of rain so that the grain erect itself as if by a shoot when it do so who can keep it back now among those who be shepherd of man throughout the kingdom there be not one who do not find pleasure in kill man if there be one who do not find pleasure in kill man all the people under the sky would be look towards he with outstretched neck such be indeed the case the people would go to he as water flow downward with a rush which no one can repress king seuen of t ' e ask say may i be inform by you of the transaction of hwan of t ' e and wan of t ` in mencius reply there be none of the disciple of chung-ne who speak about the affair of hwan and wan and therefore they have not be transmit to these after-age you servant have not hear of they if you will have I speak let it be about the principle of attain to the royal sway the king say of what kind must he virtue be who can attain to the royal sway mencius say if he love and protect the people it be impossible to prevent he from attain it the king say be such a one as poor i competent to love and protect the people yes be the reply from what do you know that i be competent to that i have hear say mencius from hoo heih the follow incident : -- ` the king ' say he ` be sit aloft in the hall when some people appear lead a bull past below it the king see it and ask where the bull be go and be answer that they be go to consecrate a bell with its blood he say let it go i can not bear its frightened appearance -- as if it be a innocent person go to the place of death they ask in reply whether if they do so they should omit the consecration of the bell but the king say how can that be omit change it for a sheep ' i do not know whether this incident occur it do say the king and mencius reply the heart see in this be sufficient to carry you to the royal sway the people all suppose that you majesty grudge the animal but you servant know surely that it be you majesty 's not be able to bear the sight of the creature 's distress which make you do as you do the king say you be right and yet there really be a appearance of what the people imagine but though t ' e be narrow and small how should i grudge a bull indeed it be because i could not bear its frightened appearance as if it be a innocent person go to the place of death that therefore i change it for a sheep mencius say let not you majesty deem it strange that the people should think you grudge the animal when you change a large one for a small how should they know the true reason if you feel pained by its be lead without any guilt to the place of death what be there to choose between a bull and a sheep the king laugh and say what really be my mind in the matter i do not grudge the value of the bull and yet i change it for a sheep there be reason in the people 's say that i grudged the creature mencius say there be no harm in they say so it be a artifice of benevolence you see the bull and have not see the sheep so be the superior man affect towards animal that have see they alive he can not bear to see they die and have hear they die cry he can not bear to eat they flesh on this account he keep away from he stall and kitchen the king be pleased and say the ode say ` what other man have in they mind i can measure by reflection ' this might be speak of you my master i indeed do the thing but when i turn my thought inward and seek for it i could not discover my own mind when you master speak those word the movement of compassion begin to work in my mind but how be it that this heart have in it what be equal to the attainment of the royal sway mencius say suppose a man be to make this statement to you majesty ` my strength be sufficient to lift three thousand catty but be not sufficient to lift one feather my eyesight be sharp enough to examine the point of a autumn hair but i do not see a wagon-load of fagot ' would you majesty allow what he say no be the king 's remark and mencius proceed now here be kindness sufficient to reach to animal and yet no benefit be extend from it to the people -- how be this be a exception to be make here the truth be the feather 's not be lift be because the strength be not use the wagon-load of firewood 's not be see be because the eyesight be not use and the people 's not be love and protect be because the kindness be not use therefore you majesty 's not attain to the royal sway be because you do not do it and not because you be not able to do it the king ask how may the difference between he who do not do a thing and he who be not able to do it be graphically set forth mencius reply in such a thing as take the t ` ae mountain under you arm and leap with it over the north sea if you say to people ' i be not able to do it ' that be a real case of not be able in such a matter as break off a branch from a tree at the order of a superior if you say to people ' i be not able to do it ' it be not a case of not be able to do it and so you majesty 's not attain to the royal sway be not such a case as that of take the t ` ae mountain under you arm and leap over the north sea with it but it be a case like that of break off a branch from a tree treat with reverence due to age the elder in you own family so that those in the family of other shall be similarly treat treat with the kindness due to youth the young in you own family so that those in the family of other shall be similarly treat -- do this and the kingdom may be make to go round in you palm it be say in the ` book of poetry ' ` he example act on he wife extend to he brethren and be feel by all the clan and state ' tell we how king wan simply take this kindly heart and exercise it towards those party therefore the carry out of the feeling of kindness by a ruler will suffice for the love and protection of all within the four sea and if he do not carry it out he will not be able to protect he wife and child the way in which the ancient come greatly to surpass other man be no other than this that they carry out well what they do so as to affect other now you kindness be sufficient to reach to animal and yet no benefit be extend from it to the people how be this be a exception to be make here by weigh we know what thing be light and what heavy by measure we know what thing be long and what short all thing be so deal with and the mind require specially to be so i beg you majesty to measure it -- you majesty collect you equipment of war endanger you soldier and officer and excite the resentment of the various prince -- do these thing cause you pleasure in you mind the king say no how should i derive pleasure from these thing my object in they be to seek for what i greatly desire mencius say may i hear from you what it be that you majesty greatly desire the king laugh and do not speak mencius resume be you lead to desire it because you have not enough of rich and sweet food for you mouth or because you have not enough of light and warm clothing for you body or because you have not enough of beautifully color object to satisfy you eye or because there be not voice and sound enough to fill you ear or because you have not enough of attendant and favorite to stand before you and receive you order you majesty 's various officer be sufficient to supply you with all these thing how can you majesty have such a desire on account of they no say the king my desire be not on account of they mencius observe then what you majesty greatly desire can be know you desire to enlarge you territory to have t ` in and t ` oo come to you court to rule the middle state and to attract to you the barbarous tribe that surround they but to do what you do in order to seek for what you desire be like climb a tree to seek for fish be it so bad as that say the king i apprehend it be worse be the reply if you climb a tree to seek for fish although you do not get the fish you have no subsequent calamity but if you do what you do in order to seek for what you desire do it even with all you heart you will assuredly afterwards meet with calamity the king say may i hear what they will be mencius reply if the people of tsow be fight with the people of t ` oo which of they do you majesty think would conquer the people of t ` oo would conquer be the answer and mencius pursue so then a small state can not contend with a great few can not contend with many nor can the weak contend with the strong the territory within the sea would embrace nine division each of a thousand li square all t ' e together be one of they if with one part you try to subdue the other eight what be the difference between that and tsow 's contend with t ` oo with the desire which you have you must turn back to the proper course for its attainment now if you majesty will institute a government whose action shall all be benevolent this will cause all the officer in the kingdom to wish to stand in you majesty 's court the farmer all to wish to plough in you majesty 's field the merchant both travel and stationary all to wish to store they goods in you majesty 's market-place traveller and visitor all to wish to travel on you majesty 's road and all under heaven who feel aggrieved by they ruler to wish to come and complain to you majesty when they be so bent who will be able to keep they back the king say i be stupid and can not advance to this but i wish you my master to assist my intention teach I clearly and although i be deficient in intelligence and vigor i should like to try at least to institute such a government mencius reply they be only man of education who without a certain livelihood be able to maintain a fixed heart as to the people if they have not a certain livelihood they will be find not to have a fixed heart and if they have not a fixed heart there be nothing which they will not do in the way of self-abandonment of moral deflection of depravity and of wild license when they have thus be involve in crime to follow they up and punish they be to entrap the people how can such a thing as entrap the people be do under the rule of a benevolent man therefore a intelligent ruler will regulate the livelihood of the people so as to make sure that above they shall have sufficient wherewith to serve they parent and below sufficient wherewith to support they wife and child that in good year they shall always be abundantly satisfied and that in bad year they shall not be in danger of perish after this he may urge they and they will proceed to what be good for in this case the people will follow after that with readiness but now the livelihood of the people be so regulate that above they have not sufficient wherewith to serve they parent and below they have not sufficient wherewith to support they wife and child even in good year they life be always embittered and in bad year they be in danger of perish in such circumstance they only object be to escape from death and they be afraid they will not succeed in do so -- what leisure have they to cultivate propriety and righteousness if you majesty wish to carry out a benevolent government why not turn back to what be the essential step to its attainment let mulberry tree be plant about the homestead with they five acre and person of fifty year will be able to wear silk in keep fowl pig dog and swine let not they time of breed be neglect and person of seventy year will be able to eat flesh let there not be take away the time that be proper for the cultivation of the field-allotment of a hundred acre and the family of eight mouth will not suffer from hunger let careful attention be pay to the teaching in the various school with repeat inculcation of the filial and fraternal duty and gray-haired man will not be see upon the road carry burden on they back or on they head it have never be that the ruler of a state where these result be see the old wear silk and eat flesh and the black-haired people suffer neither from hunger nor cold do not attain to the royal dignity -lrb-

introduction nothing of great importance be know about fâ-hien in addition to what may be gather from he own record of he travels i have read the account of he in the memoirs of eminent monk compile in ad 519 and a later work the memoirs of marvellous monk by the third emperor of the ming dynasty -lrb- ad 1403-1424 -rrb- which however be nearly all borrow from the other and all in they that have a appearance of verisimilitude can be bring within brief compass he surname they tell we be kung and he be a native of wu-yang in p ` ing-yang which be still the name of a large department in shan-hsî he have three brother older than himself but when they all die before shed they first tooth he father devote he to the service of the buddhist society and have he enter as a srâmanera still keep he at home in the family the little fellow fall dangerously ill and the father send he to the monastery where he soon get well and refuse to return to he parent when he be ten year old he father die and a uncle consider the widow solitariness and helplessness of the mother urge he to renounce the monastic life and return to she but the boy reply i do not quit the family in compliance with my father 's wish but because i wish to be far from the dust and vulgar way of life this be why i choose monkhood the uncle approve of he word and give over urge he when he mother also die it appear how great have be the affection for she of he fine nature but after she burial he return to the monastery on one occasion he be cut rice with a score or two of he fellow-disciple when some hungry thief come upon they to take away they grain by force the other srâmaneras all flee but we young hero stand he ground and say to the thief if you must have the grain take what you please but sir it be you former neglect of charity which bring you to you present state of destitution and now again you wish to rob other i be afraid that in the come age you will have still greater poverty and distress i be sorry for you beforehand with these word he follow he companion to the monastery while the thief leave the grain and go away all the monk of whom there be several hundred do homage to he conduct and courage when he have finish he novitiate and take on he the obligation of the full buddhist order he earnest courage clear intelligence and strict regulation of he demeanor be conspicuous and soon after he undertake he journey to indium in search of complete copy of the vinaya-pitaka what follow this be merely a account of he travels in indium and return to china by sea condensed from he own narrative with the addition of some marvellous incident that happen to he on he visit to the vulture peak near râjagriha it be say in the end that after he return to china he go to the capital -lrb- evidently nank -rrb- and there along with the indian sramana buddha-bhadra execute translation of some of the work which he have obtain in indium and that before he have do all that he wish to do in this way he remove to king-chow -lrb- in the present hoo-pih -rrb- and die in the monastery of sin at the age of eighty-eight to the great sorrow of all who know he it be add that there be another larger work give a account of he travels in various country such be all the information give about we author beyond what he have himself tell we fâ-hien be he clerical name and mean illustrious in the law or illustrious master of the law the shih which often precede it be a abbreviation of the name of buddha as sâkyamuni the sâkya mighty in love dwelling in seclusion and silence and may be take as equivalent to buddhist he be sometimes say to have belong to the eastern tsin dynasty -lrb- ad 317-419 -rrb- and sometimes to the sing that be the sing dynasty of the house of liû -lrb- ad 420-478 -rrb- if he become a full monk at the age of twenty and go to india when he be twenty-five he long life may have be divide pretty equally between the two dynasty if there be ever another and larger account of fâ-hien 's travels than the narrative of which a translation be now give it have long cease to be in existence in the catalogue of the imperial library of the suy dynasty -lrb- ad 589-618 -rrb- the name fâ-hien occur four time towards the end of the last section of it after a reference to he travels he labor in translation at kin-ling -lrb- another name for nanking -rrb- in conjunction with buddha-bhadra be describe in the second section we find a record of buddhistic kingdom -- with a note say that it be the work of the sramana fâ-hien and again we have narrative of fâ-hien in two book and narrative of fâ-hien 's travels in one book but all these three entry may possibly belong to different copy of the same work the first and the other two be in separate subdivision of the catalogue in the two chinese copy of the narrative in my possession the title be record of buddhistic kingdom in the japanese or corean recension the title be twofold first narrative of the distinguished monk fâ-hien and then more at large incident of travels in indium by the sramana of the eastern tsîn fâ-hien record by himself there be still earlier attestation of the existence of we little work than the suy catalogue the catalogue raisonné of the imperial library of the present dynasty mention two quotation from it by le tâo-yüen a geographical writer of the dynasty of the northern weus -lrb- ad 386-584 -rrb- one of they contain eighty-nine character and the other two hundred and seventy-six both of they give as from the narrative of fâ-hien in all catalogue subsequent to that of suy we work appear the evidence for its authenticity and genuineness be all that could be require it be clear to myself that the record of buddhistic kingdom and the narrative of he travels by fâ-hien be designation of one and the same work and that it be doubtful whether any larger work on the same subject be ever current with regard to the text subjoin to my translation it be publish in japan in 1779 the editor have before he four recension of the narrative those of the sing and ming dynasty with appendix on the name of certain character in they that of japan and that of corea he wisely adopt the corean text publish in accordance with a royal rescript in 1726 so far as i can make out but the different reading of the other text be all give in top-notes instead of foot-note as with we this be one of the point in which custom in the east and west go by contrary very occasionally the editor indicate by a single character equivalent to right or wrong which reading in he opinion be to be prefer the editor of the catalogue raisonné intimate they doubt of the good taste and reliability of all fâ-hien 's statement it offend they that he should call central indium the middle kingdom and china which to they be the true and only middle kingdom but a border-land -- it offend they as the vaunt language of a buddhist writer whereas the reader will see in the expression only a instance of what fâ-hien call he simple straightforwardness as a instance of he unreliability they refer to he account of the buddhism of khoten whereas it be well-known they say that the khotener from ancient time till now have be mohammedan -- as if they could have be so one hundred and seventy year before mohammed be bear and two hundred twenty-two year before the year of the hegira and this be criticism in china the catalogue be order by the k ` ien-lung emperor in 1722 between three and four hundred of the great scholar of the empire be engage on it in various department and thus egregiously ignorant do they show themselves of all beyond the limit of they own country and even of the literature of that country itself much of what fâ-hien tell he reader of buddhist miracle and legend be indeed unreliable and grotesque but we have from he the truth as to what he see and hear in conclude this introduction i wish to call attention to some estimate of the number of buddhist in the world which have become current believe as i do that the smallest of they be much above what be correct in a note on the first page of he work on the bhilsa tope -lrb- 1854 -rrb- general cunningham say : the christian number about two hundred and seventy million the buddhist about two hundred and twenty-two million who be distribute as follow : china one hundred and seventy million japan twenty-five million anam fourteen million siam three million ava eight million nepál one million and ceylon one million in he article on mj barthélemy saint-hilaire 's le bouddha et sa religion republish in he chip from a german workshop vol i -lrb- 1868 -rrb- professor max müller say the young prince become the founder of a religion which after more than two thousand year be still profess by four hundred and fifty-five million of human being and he append the follow note : though truth be not settle by majority it would be interesting to know which religion count at the present moment the largest number of believer berghaus in he ` physical atla ' give the follow division of the human race accord to religion : ` buddhist 312 per cent christian 307 mohammedan 157 brahmanist 134 heathen 87 and jew o3 ' as berghaus do not distinguish the buddhist in china from the follower of confucius and laotse the first place on the scale belong really to christianity it be difficult in china to say to what religion a man belong as the same person may profess two or three the emperor himself after sacrifice accord to the ritual of confucius visit a tao-tsé temple and afterwards bow before a image of fo in a buddhist chapel -lrb- mélanges asiatique de st pétersbourg vol ii p 374 -rrb- both these estimate be exceed by dr tw rhy david -lrb- intimate also the uncertainty of the statement and that number be no evidence of truth -rrb- in the introduction to he manual of buddhism the buddhist there appear as amounting in all to five hundred million : -- thirty million of southern buddhist in ceylon burma siam anam and indium -lrb- jain -rrb- and four hundred and seventy million of northern buddhist of whom nearly thirty-three million be assign to japan and 414686974 to the eighteen province of china proper accord to he christian amount to about 26 per cent of mankind hindu to about 13 mohammedan to about 12-1\/2 buddhist to about 40 and jew to about one-half of one per cent in regard to all these estimate it will be observe that the immense number assign to buddhism be make out by the multitude of chinese with which it be credit subtract cunningham 's one hundred and seventy million of chinese from he total of two hundred and twenty-two million and there remain only fifty-two million of buddhist subtract david 's four hundred fourteen and one-half million of chinese from he total of five hundred million and there remain only eighty-five and one-half million for buddhism of the number assign to other country as well as of they whole population i be in considerable doubt excepting in the case of ceylon and indium but the greatness of the estimate turn upon the immense multitude say to be in china i do not know what total population cunningham allow for that country nor on what principle he allot one hundred and seventy million of it to buddhism perhaps he halve he estimate of the whole whereas berghaus and david allot to it the highest estimate that have be give of the people but we have no certain information of the population of china at a interview with the former chinese ambassador kwo sung-tâo in paris in 1878 i begged he to write out for I the amount with the authority for it and he assure I that it could not be do i have read probably almost everything that have be publish on the subject and endeavor by method of my own to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion -- without reach a result which i can venture to lay before the public my impression have be that four hundred million be hardly a exaggeration but suppose that we have reliable return of the whole population how shall we proceed to apportion that among confucianist tâoists and buddhist confucianism be the orthodoxy of china the common name for it be jû chiâo the doctrine hold by the learn class entrance into the circle of which be with a few insignificant exception open to all the people the mass of they and the mass under they influence be preponderatingly confucian and in the observance of ancestral worship the most remarkable feature of the religion proper of china from the earliest time of which confucius be not the author but the prophet a overwhelming majority be regular and assiduous among the strange principle which the emperor of the k ` ang-hsî period in one of he famous sixteen precept exhort he people to discountenance and put away in order to exalt the correct doctrine buddhism and tâoism be both include if as state in the note quote from professor müller the emperor countenance both the tâoist worship and the buddhist he do so for reason of state to please especially he buddhistic subject in thibet and mongolium and not to offend the many whose superstitious fancy incline to tâoism when i go out and in as a missionary among the chinese people for about thirty year it sometimes occur to I that only the inmate of they monastery and the recluse of both system should be enumerate as buddhist and taoist but i be in the end constrain to widen that judgment and to admit a considerable following of both among the people who have neither receive the tonsure nor assume the yellow top dr eitel in conclude he discussion of this point in he lecture on buddhism a event in history say : it be not too much to say that most chinese be theoretically confucianist but emotionally buddhist or taoist but fairness require we to add that though the mass of the people be more or less influence by buddhist doctrine yet the people as a whole have no respect for the buddhist church and habitually sneer at buddhist priest for the most in the former of these two sentence i would substitute nearly all and between my friend 's but and emotionally i would introduce many be and would not care to contest he conclusion

those even of mohammedanism and that instead of be the most numerous of the religion -lrb- so-called -rrb- of the world it be only entitle to occupy the fifth place ranking below christianity confucianism brahmanism and mohammedanism and follow some distance off by tâoism to make a table of percentage of mankind and to assign to each system its proportion be to seem to be wise where we be deplorably ignorant and moreover if we means of information be much better than they be we figure would merely show the outward adherence a fractional percentage might tell more for one system than a

complete two story they remove the image back to its former place when fâ-hien and tâo-ching first arrive at the jetavana monastery and think how the world-honored one have formerly reside there for twenty-five year painful reflection arise in they mind bear in a border-land along with they like-minded friend they have travel through so many kingdom some of those friend have return to they own land and some have die prove the impermanence and uncertainty of life and today they see the place where buddha have live now unoccupied by he they be melancholy through they pain of heart and the crowd of monk come out and ask they from what kingdom they be come we be come they reply from the land of han strange say the monk with a sigh that man of a border country should be able to come here in search of we law then they say to one another during all the time that we preceptor and monk have succeed to one another we have never see man of han follower of we system arrive here four li to the northwest of the vihâra there be a grove call the get of eye formerly there be five hundred blind man who live here in order that they might be near the vihâra buddha preach he law to they and they all get they eyesight full of joy they stick they stave in the earth and with they head and face on the ground do reverence the stave immediately begin to grow and they grow to be great people make much of they and no one dare to cut they down so that they come to form a grove it be in this way that it get its name and most of the jetavana monk after they have take they mid-day meal go to

devâlaya -lrb- 6 -rrb- of one of the contrary system call the shadow cover right opposite the vihâra on the place of discussion with only the road between they and also rather more than sixty cubit high the reason why it be call the shadow cover be this : when the sun be in the west the shadow of the vihâra of the world-honored one fall on the devâlaya of a contrary system but when the sun be in the east the shadow of that devâlaya be divert to the north and never fall on the vihâra of buddha the malbeliever regularly employ man to watch they devâlaya to sweep and water all about it to burn

unfrequented way set up on the roadside house of charity where room couch bed and food and drink be supply to traveller and also to monk come and go as guest the only difference be in the time for

english by john francis davi -rrb- introduction the sorrow of han be consider by chinese scholar to be one of the largest tragedy in the whole range of the chinese drama which be very voluminous although properly speak there be no theater in china the chinese be passionately fond of dramatic representation chinese act be much admire and praise by traveller who be competent to follow the dialogue the stage be generally a temporary erection improvise in a market-place and the stage arrangement be of the most primitive character no scenery be employ and the actor introduce themselves in a sort of prologue in which they state the name and character they represent in the drama they also indicate the place where they be in the story or the house which they have enter yet the chinese stage have many point in common with that of ancient greece it be support and control by government and have something of a religious and national character be particularly employ for popular amusement in the celebration of religious festival only two actor be allow to occupy the stage at the same time and this be another point in common with the early greek drama the plot or story of the chinese play be simple and effective and voltaire be know to have take the plot of a chinese drama as molière take a comedy of plautus and apply it in write a drama for the modern french stage the sorrow of han belong to the famous collection entitle the hundred play of the yuen dynasty it be divide into act and be make up of alternate prose and verse the movement of the drama be good and the dénouement arrange with considerable skill ew translator 's preface the follow drama be select from the hundred play of yuen which have already supply to europe two specimen of the chinese stage -- the first call the orphan of chaou translate by père premare and the second entitle a heir in old age by the author of the present version the sorrow of han be historical and relate to one of the most interesting period of the chinese annals when the grow effeminacy of the court and consequent weakness of the government embolden the tartar in they aggression and first give rise to the temporizing and impolitic system of propitiate those barbarian by tribute which long after produce the downfall of the empire and the establishment of the mongol dominion the moral of the piece be evidently to expose the evil consequence of luxury effeminacy and supineness in the sovereign when love be all a easy monarch 's care seldom at council -- never in a war the hero or rather the chief personage of the drama come to the throne very near the beginning of the christian era about bc 42 the fate of the lady chaoukeun be a favorite incident in history of which painter poet and romancer frequently avail themselves she verdant lamb be say to exist at the present day and to remain green all the year round while the vegetation of the desert in which it stand be parch by the summer sun in select this single specimen from among so many the translator be influence by the consideration of its remarkable accordance with we own canon of criticism the chinese themselves make no regular classification of comedy and tragedy but we be quite at liberty to give the latter title to a play which so completely answer to the european definition the unity of action be complete and the unity of time and place much less violate than they frequently be on we own stage the grandeur and gravity of the subject the rank and dignity of the personage the tragical catastrophe and the strict award of poetical justice might satisfy the most rigid admirer of grecian rule the translator have think it necessary to adhere to the original by distinguish the first act -lrb- or proëm -rrb- from the four which follow it : but the distinction be purely nominal and the piece consist to all intent and purpose of five act it be remarkable that this peculiar division hold true with regard to a large number of the hundred play of yuen the reader will doubtless be strike by the apparent shortness of the drama which be here present to he but the original be eke out in common with all chinese play by a irregular operatic species of song which the principal character occasionally chant forth in unison with a louder or a softer accompaniment of music as may best suit the sentiment or action of the moment some passage have be embody in we version : but the translator do not give all for the same reason that prompt père premare to give none -- they be full of allusion to thing unfamiliar to we and figure of speech very difficult for we to observe they be frequently moreover mere repetition or amplification of the prose part and be intend more for the ear than the eye be rather adapt to the stage than to the closet he judgment may perhaps be sway by partiality towards the subject of he own labor but the translator can not help think the plot and incident of the sorrow of han superior to those of the orphan of chaou -- though the genius of voltaire contrived to make the last the ground-work of a excellent french tragedy far be he however from entertain the presumptuous expectation that a destiny of equal splendor await the present drama and he will be quite satisfied if the reader have patience to read it to the end and then pronounce it to be a somewhat curious sample of a
