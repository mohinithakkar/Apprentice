though it happen just that way every morning and it have happen so this morning this day be to be very different from any other in eric 's life but eric could not know that so he crawl farther down under the few bedclothes he have manage to keep to himself and shut he eye again just for a minute the night have be a cold one and the other two boy in the bed because they be older and stronger have

have manage to seize and divide between they little eric 's steam cup of coffee -- the only hot thing he have hope for that morning will i be a success too ask eric in a faint but hopeful voice you say the harsh woman you young man have better be thankful to work on at the canning instead of starve in the street that be the fate of most orphan success indeed now hurry along all of you it be quarter to seven but right here be where the day begin to differ from other day eric do not hurry along he throw down he spoon and cry i would just as soon starve in the street and wade in its icy puddle too as live here with you and you nasty boy and work in that old canning factory i just wonder how you would feel if i go out this morning and never never come back i would like to do that mr freg laugh and she laugh be not a nice mother-laugh at all for she be not eric 's mother and have never pretend that she be why little spitfire it would not matter a bit except to make one less mouth to feed but you will not be so silly as that you do not want to starve all right say little eric snatch he cap from its peg you say it would not matter to you you will not see I again any of you i hate you all and everything in the world i hate you you have make I hate you hard then he suddenly run out into the street in a minute he be in a flood of people man woman and child move towards the canning factory a big brick building on the outskirts of the city eric have work in that factory from the day he be seven there be no need to tell you what he do there for this be not the story of the canning factory eric -- the queer hating eric who have wake up that morning but how he do hate he eye be full of hate tear and they be run down he face make horrid white streak on he dirty cheek he be hate so hard that he do not even care if people see he tear he lift he face straight up and drop he arm straight down at he side and walk right along no matter how fast the tear come now he have often hate before but never quite like this before it have be a frightened hate a gnawing hurt thing deep down in he heart but to-day it be a flare hate a burning thing right up in he head it be big too because it include everything that he know mr freg she boy the street the people jostle he and hottest and wildest of all the canning factory how terrible to go in there in the morning when the sun be only just up and not to come out again until it be quite down eric know little about play but he do know that if he could only be let stay out in the sunshine he would find thing to do there if they would only let he try it once so he walk along in the direction the other be go the hate tear in he eye and on he face but no one laugh at he and no one ask he what be the matter even the other child for he be not cry in the usual way with little boy he be walk along with he head up so people do not bother he he have reach the outskirts of the town and be almost in the shadow of the big cruel factory when the magic begin to work for there be magic in this day that have start so badly it be only wait for eric to see it before it would take hold of he and carry he away into happiness it have wait for he at the door of the dull bare little house that have never be home to he but he tear would not let he see it so it have follow along beside he all the way to the factory wait for he to feel even if he could not see and he do feel -- just in time to let the magic work he feel that the day that have begin so freezingly be warm strangely warm he wipe the tear from he eye away to the side of he face with he sleeve and look about the sun be very bright but in a mild pleasant way and a tree on the other side of the street be shower softly softly softly yellow autumn leave until they cover the cobblestone all around eric do not think about be late the magic be pull he now he go across and stand under the tree and feel the leaf shower on he head and shoulder and catch a few in he hand all the people pass and soon the last one be hide behind the heavy factory door eric give the door a glance or two but do not go over the roof of the factory he see the top of tall tree wave he have never look so high above the factory before but he know there be a wood on the other side a wood he have always be too tired to think of explore even on holiday now he see the top of the tall tree beckon he in a golden mist the mist be the yellow leaf they be drop think eric with every beckon the golden mist of leaf grow brighter and brighter until he could not see the beckon any more but only the mist still he know the beckon be go on behind the mist if i be to live in the street at night he think to himself there be no need to live in the factory by day i 'll just go and see what those tree want of I very slowly with little firm step he go by the factory door and then around under its window to the wood at the back it be indian summer that be why the golden leaf be shower in a mist and why the sun be so warm eric drop he ragged coat and cap on the edge of the wood -- it be so warm -- and go in a little girl have be watch he from she place at one of the factory window where she be sort can she have see he before work at the factory day after day and they have play together sometimes in the noon half hour now she wonder what he be do out there have they send he perhaps to do a different kind of work that could only be do in the wood but as he walk away in under the tree farther and farther the golden mist that be over the wood draw in about he and although she lean far forward over the can at a great risk of knock over dozen and set they roll -- he be lose in it it have drop down behind he like a curtain chapter ii the bright house eric know nothing of the little girl and she thought he be walk in a golden mist but he could see quite perfectly and even far ahead down long tree aisle at first the tree do not grow very close together and there be little underbrush several narrow path start off in different direction -- straight little path make by people who know where they be go but eric do not know where he be go so he strike off in a place where there be no sign of a path soon the tree draw closer and closer together until they branch lock finger overhead and shake the yellow leave down for each other the leaf shower softly and steadily eric 's foot rustle loudly in they soon he stop and take off he worn shoe and stocking he leave they where he take they off and go on barefoot now that he be only in he shirt and trousers he begin to run and leap he leap for the drift leaf and he run farther and farther into the happy stillness the tree crowd and crowd and the mist of leaf grow brighter and brighter no bird sing for they have all fly away for the winter and there be no flower but the drift leave hide the bareness and magic cover everything after eric have run and leap and wade in the crackling pool of leaf for a long time he grow hungry but there be no food here he think and anyway it do not matter it be much better to be hungry here than in the dirty street he decide to go to sleep and forget about it so he lay down in the leaf they fall over he a steady gentle shower and he sleep long and without dream anything but when he wake he be cold and worse than that the golden mist have fade it be almost twilight the light be cold and still and gray while he sleep indian summer have vanish and its magic with it now no matter how fast eric run or how high he jump he be chilly through and through but he do not think of try to find the way out of the wood the street would be as cold as the forest and never never never if he starve and freeze be he go back to that house in the village where he have live but never belong so he go on until the gray light fade and the soft rustle of fall leaf change to the noise of wind scrape in bare branch when he be very cold and ready to lie down and sleep again to forget he come quite suddenly on a opening in the tree in the dim light he see a little garden close in with a hedge of baby evergreen the wind be rustling through the stalk of dead flower in the garden but in the middle of it be a little low house and the window and door be glowing like new warm flower yes it be a house and a garden away there in the wood but no path lead to it through the forest and there be a strangeness about it as about no house or garden eric have ever see although no path lead through the wood to the house a path do run through the garden to the low door stone eric go up it and stand look in at the door which be open the glow of the house come from a leap jolly fire in a big stone fire-place and from half a dozen squat candle set in bracket around the wall it be the one lovely room that eric have ever see it be so large that he know it must occupy the whole of the little house but in spite of all the brightness the comer be dim and far there be two strange people there or they be strange to eric because they be so different from any people he have ever know one be a young woman who sit sew cross-legged on a settle at the side of the fire-place about she the strangest thing be she hair it be not like most woman 's -- long and twist up on she head it be short and curl back above she ear and across she forehead like flower-petal it be the color of the candle-flame but she face be brown and she neck and long hand be brown as though she have live a long time in the sun she eye that be lift and scarcely watch the work in she hand be very quiet and gray she be watch and talk to a little girl who be skip back and forth between a rough tea-table set near the fire and a open cupboard-door in the wall she be carry dish to the table and now and then stop to stir something good-smelling which hang over the fire in a pewter pot with a strong bent twig for a handle the child be strange in a very different way from she mother the mother one could see be merry in spite of she quiet eye but the child be pale she face be pale and little and round she hair be pale too the color of ash and braid in two smooth little braid hang half way down she back she move with almost as much swiftness as the fire-shadow and as softly too both mother and daughter be dress in rough brown smock with narrow green belt fall loosely -- strange garment to eric and they foot be bare but stranger than the house stranger than the people in it be the fact that the mother be talk to the little girl just as people of the same age talk to each other and though eric be shake with cold and ache with hunger he could still wonder deeply at that it be a long way ` round by the big pine she be say but you see i be home in time for supper suppose i have not come until after dark what would you have do ivra the little girl stop in she busy-ness to stand on one foot and think a second why i would have put the supper over the fire light the candle and run out to meet you oh but you would not know which way to run i might come from any direction i would follow the wind cry ivra lift she serious face and rise to she tiptoe one arm outstretch as though she be go to follow the wind right then and there it be at that minute they notice the door have blow open and that a little boy be stand in it look at they but they neither stare nor exclaim ivra run to he she arm still outstretch in the fly gesture and draw he in he dirty face be streak with tear and he leg and foot be blue with the cold they know it be not question-time but comfort-time so the mother fold a arm about he and ivra skip more rapidly than ever between the cupboard and the table almost at once supper be ready and the table set for three as the last thing ivra bring all the candle and set they in the middle of the table they sit down -- eric with he back to the fire it warm he through and through but they friendly face warm he more very little be say but when the meal be nearly over ivra ask he how long he be go to stay with they immediately he stop eat and drop he spoon he eye fill with tear he have utterly forget about he plight until then -- how he be homeless workless and bind to starve and freeze sooner or later ivra 's mother see the misery in he face and quietly speak we hope for a long time as long as you want to anyway three in a wood will be merrier than two in a wood if you like I i will be you mother ivra clap she hand stay always she cry i will be you playmate there will be many playmate besides too and i will help you find they eric glow the hatred that have be flare in he head suddenly fade and the heavy thing that have be he heart for as long as he could remember become light as thistledown he look at the mother and the kindness in she eye make he tremble i will stay and be you child he say chapter iii firelight when supper be do the three put away the supper thing carry the table back to its place in the corner and set the candle in they bracket about the wall then almost at once the mother say it be bath-time and bed-time bath-time bath have be rare in eric 's life and when they do happen be unhappy adventure -- cold water in a hand basin in the kitchen sink a scratchy sponge and a towel too small so if mr freg have say bath-time and bed-time to he now he might have run away but if ivra 's mother say it it must be she be _ he _ mother too now and he love she and think she beautifully strange a surprise be wait for he the bath be a deep basin set in the wall there be a fountain in it that one have only to turn on to have the basin fill with clear water eric slip out of he ragged shirt and trousers and climb up into it the fountain come splash down on he dusty shaggy head fall in rivulet down he back and breast he be like a bird take a bath there be such happy splashing and dip but no bird have ever the gentle soft dry or be wrap in such a warm night gown as the mother find for eric it be one of ivra 's night gown but quite large enough then she tuck he into a narrow couch far from the fire it be the first time eric could ever remember have sleep alone ivra be already in a bed against the opposite wall before the mother get into hers which be open and ready for she she blow out all the candle and open the door and window good night my lamb she say and a very few minute afterwards eric could see by the firelight that he mother and playmate be asleep how cold the wind feel as it blow over he face but how warm and snug he body be there in the soft clean night gown between the light warm blanket how fine to be there so warm in bed while he cheek grow red in the cold air and burn deliciously how could he ever sleep he be too happy he look at the fire and then he look harder it be not a fire at all but a young girl all bright and golden sit with she head drowsily bent forward on she knee and she arm wrap close about she leg but as he watch she slowly lift she bright head and look quietly about the room then she gradually and beautilully rise and step out of the fireplace onto the floor slowly she move across to the mother 's couch and stand still as though look down at she slowly she bent and draw the bed-clothes higher about she shoulder and kiss the flower-petal hair curl back on the pillow she move then to ivra 's couch still slowly and very beautifully and eric could see she smile at the little one huddle there half on she face one arm throw up over she head gently the fire-girl roll she into a relax position on she side tuck in the flung arm and kiss the closed eyelid then she stand a minute look away eric do not know where but he heart begin to ache with wonder and longing would she come to he too -- or be he only a stranger he lay still watch she from he dark corner at last she stop look away and come across the floor to he she bring all the brightness of the room with she and she foot make no sound on the board when she stand above he he shut he eye though he want very much to look up into she face she bent down and she hand smooth he cover warm he pillow and lay still for a minute like sunlight on he cheek when he open he eye again she have go back to the fireplace all she brightness with she and be rest there a drowsy golden girl she head bent forward on she knee and she slim arm wrap close about she leg eric lay and watch she for many sleepy minute while she light fall dimmer and dimmer lower and lower when it be just a tiny flicker he drop to sleep chapter iv the gossip he sleep long and deeply for when he wake he feel rest but he do not open he eye it must be time for mr freg to shake I he be think until she do i 'll just stay as i be and pretend it be not a dream but real for although he remember very well all that have happen to he yesterday he could not believe it be true so he lay still in he snug bed wonder that mr freg 's boy have leave he so much of the bed-clothes how fine to have a little time to pretend a dream he say to himself but mr freg do not come and do not come until at last he open he eye just in wonderment it must be six o'clock when he see where he be and that the dream be true he heart almost stand still for joy he be indeed far away in the wood safe and snug and warm in this bright house and mr freg could never reach he here and he would not go to the canning factory that day nor the next nor the next nor ever again the new mother have say so he happiness bring he up in bed wide awake and then he get out he have not learn to bind out yet but that come the fire be burn merrily all be in order the bed make and push back against the wall the hearth sweep and some cluster of bright red berry arrange above the fireplace but where be ivra and helma -- ivra have call she mother helma last night and so it be that eric already call she and thought of she there be not the tiniest sign of they oh but yes there on the floor near the hearth lay a little brown sandal one of its string pull out and make a curlycue on the floor that must belong to ivra the fire the red berry and the little worn sandal seem to be wish eric a good morning and a happy day there be plenty of mush in the pot swing over the fire and on the table draw up to it a wooden spoon a bowl and a jug of rich cream so they have not forget he they have only let he sleep as long as he would they must have steal about like mouse get breakfast clearing up and tidy the room and then close the door very softly behind they when they go out and wonder of wonder after yesterday 's indian summer outside it be a wild winter day gust of snow be hurl against all the window of the house and blow a fine spray under the door eric with he face against a windowpane could see only as far as the evergreen hedge because the tree beyond be wreathe in whirling snowcloud the dead flower in the garden be hide under the blow snow the little straight walk up to the door be lose in it and the footprint ivra and helma must have make when they go away be hide too something red blow against the hedge for a minute eric think it be a big bird but it find the opening and come through and then he see it be a little old woman she come briskly up to the house a red cape blow about she sometimes right up over she head for because of the jug she be carry she could not hold it down she walk in without stop to knock and be as surprised to see eric there as he be to see she but she get over it at once good morning she say cheerfully go across the room whisk a pitcher out of the cupboard and empty she jug of milk into it this be the milk for they and it be as much as ever that i get here with it the wind be in a fine mood-pushed I here and there all the way through the wood and try to steal my cape from I say nothing of helma 's milk perhaps some of the wind creature want they or it might be old tree man himself look for a winter cape for he daughter but i say ` no no the milk be for helma and little ivra i take it to they every morning and i 'll take it this morning whether or no so pull all you like -- cape or milk you 'll not get the cape have a good clasp and i have a good hold of the jug pull away here the old woman -- the pitcher put away and the cupboard door close -- drop down on the settle and wait for eric to speak she be a jolly little old woman one could see at a glance she face be the color of a good red apple and just as round and shiny she eye be beady black bright and quick and surround by a hundred finest wrinkle that all the smile of she life have make she mouth be purse up like a button out of which she word come shooting quick and bright and merry eric stand look at she not think to say anything so after the briefest pause she go on peeping into the pot i see you have some mush here so as i have come all the way from the farm and be ready for a second breakfast after my tussle with the wind i 'll share it with you or perhaps you have have yours already no no cry eric suddenly remember how hungry he be and hope she would not take it all i have just wake up so then we 'll breakfast together and away she fly to the cupboard again and bring out a second bowl and spoon then she stir the mush round and round a few time and dish it up eric notice that she divide it exactly evenly she flood both bowl with cream and together they sit down to it what a good breakfast that be and how fast the little old woman talk but in spite of all she talking and fly around she have look eric up and down and through and through and make up she mind what kind of a person he be what she see be a pale little boy of nine in a ragged shirt and trousers and barefoot he hair be shaggy and unbrushed but toss back from a wide brow he mouth be sullen but she forget all about shabby clothes unbrushed hair and sullen mouth when she come to he eye they be wide and clear and return the old woman 's keen glance with a gaze of steady interest sullen and pale but clear-eyed -- she like the little stranger and so she go on talk i bring they milk every day it be a long way here from my farm but not too far when it be for they helma 's go into the village have not she when i come to little pine hill this morning the snow stop whirling for a minute and i catch a glimpse of she a-striding across the field it be a fine way of walk she have -- like the bravest of forest people when i reach the tree man 's the wind do not stop for I but i spy that child ivra just where i know she would be -- racing and chasing and dancing with the snow witch out at the edge of the wood ` it be a pity she can not go with she mother ' i say to myself when i see she ` and not be waste she time like that the snow witch be no good to any one but -- ' eric interrupted there have finish he mush and prick up he car at the mention of witch be they really witch he cry and have you see they yourself what else would they be ask the old woman they be the creature that come out in windy snowy weather to dance in the open field and run along country road ordinary people be afraid of they and stay indoors when they be about they streaming white hair have a way of lash you face as they rush by and then they never look where they be go they care nothing about run into you and knock the breath out of you then they be so cruel to child but ivra be not afraid of they wonder eric not she say the old woman she run _ with _ they instead of away from they when i see they back there they have all take hand and be leap in a circle around she she be jump and dance in the center as wild and lawless as they and just as high too but it be a pity she be not with she mother all the same go on decent errand in the village only of course it be not she fault poor child she dare not go into the village why _ dare not _ she ask eric _ how _ dare she cry the old woman she would be see for she be only part fairy of course but hush hush she clap she hand over she mouth what be i tell you -- one of the secret of the forest and you a stranger here you must forget it all ivra 's a good child now do not ask I any more question or i might tell you more but eric have begin to wonder what do it mean that ivra be part fairy and why be not it safe for she to be see in the village and be there really witch and be she play with they out there in the wild day the old woman be talk on but he hear no more then the door blow open in a snowy gust of wind and there stand helma the mother she arm full of bundle she cheek ruddy from the wind and she short hair crisp and blow chapter v world story now eric learn that the old woman 's name be nora for that be what helma call she and seem glad to find she there she stay on only long enough to see what helma have bring in she bundle and then start out for the farm draw she red cape closely about she this time and not blow much as she walk briskly to the gap in the hedge once through she disappear quickly in the high drift snow hardly have she go she way when ivra come from another jump the hedge and reach the door in three bound helma have buy a good deal of thick brown cloth in the village and a strip of brown leather it be all for eric she have notice he lack of shoe and stocking last night and that he worn clothes be much too poor and thin for winter in the forest to-day while she sew for he he would have to stay in that be a pity for it be such fun out in a storm by night though all would be finish and that be good exclaimed ivra for to-night the tree man have ask we to a party we be go to roast chestnut and play game and there be to be a surprise too the tree girl call it all out to I as i pass just now she put only she head through the door for the snow come so suddenly it catch she without a single white frock -- only a bonnet but that be pretty it have five point like a star mother the tree girl say eric what a queer name but how do she know about I to ask I too do she ask I i tell she about you and of course she ask you you be my playmate helma pull a table to the settle and sit down with all the brown cloth before she a work-basket and shears but first she measure eric for he new clothes you may make the leggin if you want to she say to ivra and when you come to a hard place tell I and i will help you may even measure they yourself we be the only forest people eric who wear anything but white in the winter most forest people like to be the color of they world they often laugh at we but i like brown ivra make I think of a brown blow leaf and now here will be two of they you can blow together all over the forest eric 's eye swim in sudden happy tear but he only say _ nora _ wear red oh she be not one of we laugh helma but she be live close to we so long she be able to see we we be not afraid of she she be a good neighbor but why might they be afraid of such a nice old woman eric wonder he be to learn sometime and much beside for this be the beginning of new thing for he and he mother helma and ivra be strange people but how he love they now that we be settle at we work and nothing to interrupt what shall it be ask helma she and ivra be sew briskly one in each corner of the settle eric be stretch on the floor look now into the blaze and now up at the window where the snow tap and swirl for to-day -- helma have say -- be to be a rest day for he it be the first rest day he could remember and how _ good _ it be to know he could lie there with no can to sort or label for hour and no mr freg to boss he about when work be over there be to be no more can for he forever and no more mrs freg helma have say that quite firmly he believe she and be so happy that he tremble and so it be true that never again should he go back to that unchildlike life that have frighten he so and tire he so all the breath he draw feel like sigh of relief and he turn he shaggy little head on he arm crooked under it and watch helma 's fly brown finger with glad eye what shall it be ask helma oh world story please say ivra draw she foot up under she as she bent over she sewing eric probably know very few of the world story say helma so sometime i shall have to go back to the beginning and tell they all over for he and i 'll stay and hear they over again too cry ivra drop she work to clasp she hand i love to hear story over why better than that you might tell they yourself would you like that oh yes -- if i can do you suppose i can mother helma i shall begin at the very begin way back before man be in the world at all or fairy even he would like to hear about the big animal and you will listen mother to see that i get it all right now these world story of helma 's be wonderful story but all true they begin way back when the earth be young there be story about the earth itself how it hang in space and turn make day and night when the strange great animal that by-and-by appear on the earth and have since go from it first come into the story and then later the flood and glacier and at last the first man -- any child might have listen with delight and wonder ivra have listen so ever since she be a tiny girl old enough to understand at all and with man and the wonderful happening that come along with he ivra have beg for the story day and night and never could have enough of they for then in a great procession come the story of city and nation of great man and woman of exploration and adventure they lead in turn to story of language and writing of painting and geometry of music and of life the name of these thing may not promise good story to you but that be only because you do not know they as story if you could listen to helma tell they by the fire or out in the starlight deep in the wood or swinging in a tree-top -- then no other story you might ever hear would satisfy you quite so perhaps it be as well you do not know now just where helma 's little house be stand deep in the wood under the snow ivra always say that the nicest thing about the story be the interruption helma never mind they and she answer all the question ivra ask she answer they by make thing that ivra could see with she own eye by draw picture on the ground or in the ash build with earth or snow playing with wind and water and in a hundred other way sometimes the answer to a question would take up the playtime of a whole day but now eric be to hear he first story world story or any other kind can you imagine how it would feel if to-day you be to hear the first story of you life all ready ask helma the silence in the room say plainer than word that all be ready for the world story this time it be a story about a man name saint franci and a story after eric 's own heart almost as fast as the story go the work of helma 's finger but ivra be neither so swift nor so skilled and the leggin be drop many time from forgetful hand because all she thought be go away follow the story yet somehow the leggin get do and the jacket and trousers get do and even a little round cap and all before dusk for a finish touch helma sew two soft little brown feather she have pick up in the snow one on either side of the cap -- which give eric small as they be and soft as they be a look of fly then nothing remain but the sandal and because eric be well rest by then he be allow to help at they they be cut from the strip of brown leather and helma show eric how to shape they and sew they himself so after supper he stand attire all in brown a pale happy child ready for he first party ivra and eric be to go to the tree man 's party alone for helma be go far away from the wood to spend the evening with a comrade it be to be a very long walk for she for she put on she heaviest sandal and pull the hood of she cloak up over she hair she walk with the child as far as little pine hill it be a low hill bare of tree except for a dwarf pine on the top in summer the slope be slippery with the needle of the little pine but now it be several inch deep in snow it be bright starlight and far away down a avenue of tree eric saw shine open field and beyond they the light of the town there helma say good-by eric look up at she in the starlight see she hair like pale firelight under she dark hood and she eye so calm and friendly he cling to she hand for a minute have a good time she tell they ivra leap away and eric after she helma stand watch until they little form have flicker out of sight among tree-shadow then she speed down the starlit avenue towards the open field and the town chapter vi at the heart of a tree ivra and eric run until the star be almost lose to they under the snow roof of the forest once eric stop to tie he sandal-string which have loosen and be bother he then the stillness of the world startle he he cry to ivra to wait and she come back to he side do not be frighten she comfort there be forest people near we they would walk with we for some of they be go to the party too but they be afraid of you that be why they have draw they white hood over they head and keep away once we be inside the tree man 's though it will be all right they 'll come in too and not be afraid any more but why be they afraid of I ask eric tug at he sandal-string no one else have ever be afraid of I even juno mr freg 's cat who be afraid of ` most every one like I and jump into my lap why be the forest people afraid well they be forest people you see and you be a earth child mother and i be not afraid of you of course because -- we be not exactly forest people ivra pause and the silence come back eric look up at she be you cold he ask no no but she begin to jump up and down and knock she heel together to get warm eric still struggle with he lacing ivra stop jump and go down on she knee in the snow to straighten they out for he eric 's finger be awkward with knot and besides now they be numb with the cold but ivra have everything right in a minute she cross the string over he instep and tie they snugly above he ankle almost before he could think then they run on in starlit space eric catch glimpse of hurry figure so swift and light he could not tell whether they walk or fly they cloak sparkle white in starlight until he be not sure but they might be starbeam and not forest people at all one suddenly start up just at he elbow and be away like the wind ivra begin to run and to call after it wild star silly wild star it be only i ivra and my playmate wait for we eric follow she running as fast as he could but the snow hold he back and all the tree in the forest seem to gather to stand in he way ivra come back to he laugh they be so afraid of you no one will come near we until the tree man be there to protect he soon they come to a big beech-tree standing in a open space with smaller beech make a circle around it the starlight show strangely a narrow door in the trunk ivra push it open and eric follow in after she wonder at go into a tree they be on a flight of stair light by starlight from a window somewhere high up at the head of the flight they come to a door and through the crack beneath it stream a warmer light than starlight ivra open that door gayly and through it with she eric go to he first party it be the jolliest room in all the world the firelight and candlelight do not reach so far as the wall but leave they in soft darkness so eric have the feeling that the room be really much too large to be inside of a tree but in spite of its bigness it be very cozy the fireplace be in the middle of the floor just a great hollowed boulder heap with crackle twig the candle red green yellow brown and orange stand circlewise on a table by which the tree man sit carve a doll out of a stick a workbasket on the table be overflow with bright thread and piece of queer cloth eric see these thing because just for a minute he be too shy to look at the people in the room almost at once he have to look at the tree man however for he come and shake he by the shoulder eric have be shake by the shoulder before so he shrink away but this be very different from mr freg 's shaking the tree man be chuckle not scold and the dark eye that eric look up above the long white beard to find be friendly and wise do not fear we little earth child he say it be we that have cause to fear you you have only to blink you eye pretend to be know and we be nothing but you eye be so wide and so clear we trust you ivra tell we there be not the tiniest shadow in they not even the shadow of leaf only hunger but we be not afraid of hunger come have a good time at the party then the tree girl the tree man 's daughter come to he she be shy and shake all she soft brown hair about she cheek a circle of little yellow leaf keep she hair from she eye which in spite of she bashfulness be steady and kind like she father 's i be glad you be here she say from that minute eric feel at home in the tree eric and ivra be the first of the guest the other perhaps have be too scared to come but soon knock after knock sound at the door and in flock the forest people who have be invite first come the bird fairy five of they together merry and good little creature as ever live in the wood they have arrive only that day from they summer home in the far north ` way up among the snow-barren they always spend the winter in this wood living in the empty bird ' nest and spend they time make up song to teach the bird that would come back in the spring bird fairy can not sing a note themselves nor carry a air but they make up fine song for the spring bird who while they can sing with beautiful voice really have but few idea they be fluffy cuddly swift little creature tiny and quiet one might think they of little account just at first but not for long for they be the farthest-traveled of all the forest people except the wind creature only now they be flutter in and off come they white cloak and forth they hop in bright color little foot twinkle and patter little wing lift and waver they gather around the tree man nestle in a row on he shoulder run up and down he arm give all of the news of they long journey into he ear he chuckle and chuckle and soon sit down by the table again nod he head with delight at the tale they be tell he meanwhile another group enter -- the forest child the forest child be little girl and boy who live all by themselves in moss house deep in the thickest of the forest and know nothing of mother nurse or school they come tumble cheer and skip in curl bob eye shine when they white cloak be take off with the help of the tree girl and ivra it be plain to see that they have no mother they frock be tear and stain and half they sandal-strings untied and flap the tree girl sigh as she pat the bob curl into some order tie the lace and straighten a buckle here and there now the room be musical with sound the last guest arrive wild star who have run away from eric in the forest he be a wind creature wind creature be growing-up girl and boy who live near the edge of the forest like all fairy they can only be see by earth people on a day that be clearer than a day should be or by people like eric who have no shadow in they eye wild star drop he bright white cloak as he enter he wing be purple the color of early morning high and pointed but they clap themselves neatly down he back to avoid the ceiling he be a beautiful boy wild and starry and that be how he get he name wind creature be strong and swift a little too wide-awake and far-traveled to be very intimate with the forest people but wild star though he be as swift and strong as any often come to the tree man 's and often play with the forest child in they moss village for day together he love the tree man and now he sit down cross leg by he and lay he bright cheeck against he knee so the party begin chapter vii tree mother and the drowsy boat let 's play hide-and-go-seek cry the forest child for that be always they favorite game up jump wild star down flutter the bird fairy in crowd the forest child and the tree man count out for they he point he finger at each in turn while he say this verse which he make up on the spot : stick be race in the flood -- tree be race in the wood -- in the tree-tops wind be race -- in the sky-tops cloud be chase in the tree-heart snug and warm we hear nothing of the storm when we play at hide-and-seek it be _ you _ must count the sheep at you the finger point at eric and it mean that he be to be it put you head here on my knee shut you eye and count one hundred sheep jump over a stone wall not too fast explain the tree man while you be count the other hide anywhere in this room and anywhere on the stair out-door be no fair but _ where _ be the sheep ask eric and how can i count they with my eye shut every one suddenly look puzzle the forest child 's eye grow wide with wonder the bird fairy flutter uneasily the tree girl seem dazed wild star say why we never think of that -- where _ be _ they but ivra laugh and run to eric she take he hand and say the sheep be inside you own head just shut you eye and try to see they it be very easy the wall be low and there be a place where the stone be begin to roll down the sheep go over there one by one eric shut he eye and put he head down on the tree man 's knee and it begin to happen just as ivra have say there be a green hill-pasture a little gray stone wall slant across it and sheep one by one jump where the wall be break down follow they leader he count one hundred of they and then stop although a dear little lamb be trot down the hill trail the procession he want to see if the lamb would be able to jump the wall too but the tree man have say one hundred so he stop and open he eye thing be strange the tree man be nothing but a old stump the room feel very cold and it be bare the fire in the boulder have go out but he hear a soft flutter somewhere and take heart the bird fairy they might be hide high have wing he go all around the room look up into the dusk at last there they be in row on a beam they wing spread over they eye bird fairy i spy cry eric and run towards the stump but wing be swifter than foot and the bird fairy reach the goal first he find ivra at the top of the second flight of stair curl up in a shadow i spy and he run just as fast as he could down the stair he be ahead of she to the door and think he would surely win but she pass he in the room and touch the stump first the tree girl of all place be kneel behind the stump of course she touch it the minute eric spy she and so she be safe the forest child be hide some in the hall behind the door some on the stair one under the table and everyone of they beat he to the goal and touch it first now there be only wild star ivra cry you must catch he eric or else you 'll have to be ` it ' again wild star be outside up in the top of the tree in the starlight eric discover he by see one of the tip of he purple wing which be catch in a crack of the sky door i spy he call and pull the wing-tip to let wild star know he be find but of course wild star pass he like a flash he strong wing beat down tear of vexation well in eric 's eye one thing he have gain though because he have find they all even though he could not run so fast as they the tree man have come back and sit there in the place of the stump and all be warm and bright again the tree man have only wanted to prove for himself that eric could see wild star the bird fairy and the other without ivra to point they out to he but he feel satisfied now that eric 's eye be really clear and that he would never hurt any of they by look through they or pretend that they do not exist wild star be it now he say for he do not play fair go outside like that oh i forget outside be no fair cry wild star laugh so this time eric hide with the other while wild star count sheep he run wildly all round the room try to find a hiding-place but everywhere there be someone ahead of he at last he come back to the tree man himself with wild star count sheep at he knee ninety-five ninety-six ninety-seven count wild star oh dear oh dear eric whisper to himself in despair ivra be hide behind the tree man and so she jump out and pull eric back to hide with she ninety-eight ninety-nine one hundred wild star start up and never think to look behind the tree man go circle the room in swift flight he see ivra and eric as he fly over they head of course and they laugh and touch the tree man first but he catch most of the other even the forest child who be so swift and clever after that almost everyone have to take he turn at be it when the merry game come to a end at last they gather around the boulder fireplace the twig be glowing ember now and look like myriad of golden flower-bud then the forest child begin clamor for a world story so ivra climb up on the tree man 's knee and tip she head back against he chest look into the fire and tell one of helma 's world story it be the story of a glacier that may not sound like a very interesting story to you but if you could hear ivra tell it in all its wonder just as helma have tell it to she you would never ask for a better story no you would ask for that one over and over again as the forest child do the minute she be through but instead of tell that one over ivra tell another a little story about some egg and a brood of chicken and they want _ that _ over but there must be a end to everything and so the tree girl bring out a bowl of beechnut and they forget the story and eat as much as they want there be apple too big and red and cold cheeked everyone be hungry when all be satisfy there be sudden whispering among the guest the bird fairy flutter and hum with excitement the forest child 's eye begin to shine expectantly ivra who still sit on the tree man 's knee speak what they be all think the surprise she say to the tree man you know you promise we a surprise to-night be it time for it yet yes say the tree man it be _ high _ time come put on you cloak it be a cold night but the surprise they all cry at once we do not want to go home until we have have the surprise oh the surprise be up in the branch my mother be there with she air-boat wait to take you all home the forest child clap they hand and jump up and down until they sandal-lace that be not already loose and flap come undo and flap too wild star spring towards the stair he face alight ivra slip down from the tree man 's knee and run to eric the tree mother the dear beautiful tree mother we be to see she and ride with she she cry then she dash away for she cloak the forest child with the tree girl 's help be tumble into theirs wrong-end-to mostly rip off buckle in they hurry the tree mother the dear tree mother they little tooth chatter in ecstasy when all be ready they crowd up the straight starlit stair at the top they crawl out through the sky door one by one into the branch eric follow ivra and see a great black moth-like thing poise in air by the tree 's top but it be hollow like a boat and a shadowy woman be stand upright in it a dark cloak cover she but the hood have fall back and she face in the starlight be very beautiful and very young younger even than helma 's whose face eric have think all that day too young and glad to be a mother 's how could this be the tree man 's mother he wonder -- the tree girl 's grandmother then he see that she hair be white whiter than all the snow that lay in the forest it be very cold kneel there and cling in the tip of the great beech-tree the forest below be still and dark but the air and the wintry star-filled sky be bright with a blue cold light after the warmth at the heart of the tree the cold be almost unbearable eric long to wave he arm about and jump up and down to get warm but he have to cling still and motionless to the branch to keep from fall at last ivra whisper it be we turn now and take eric 's hand she make he jump with she right out into cold space for one awful instant he think they be both fall down down to the ground but they have only drop into the air-boat the tree mother lean forward and pull a blanket over they she eye as she do it look straight into eric 's they be dark and deep as the forest shadow he begin to speak to tell she who he be for she look be question but she put she finger to she lip then he notice for the first time that every one be silent even the tree man and he daughter who stand in the tree top wave good-by speak no word only nod and wave the last bird fairy flutter noiselessly in eric lay back under the warm blanket snuggle against ivra a bird fairy nestle into the palm of each of he hand all be still and warm the air-boat slip away high and higher over the tree-top and on and on on a cold starlit night nestle in feathery warmth to sail over the dark tree-top high and higher and on and on -- that be a wonderful thing and when the tree mother stand above you wrap in she dark cloak with she face shine under she cloudy white hair now and then bend to tuck the blanket more snugly about you -- what could be more blissful very soon eric become drowsy against he will he eyelid drop like curtain shut out the star but he rouse when the boat stop hover and sink down like a bird until it rest on the crusted snow in the middle of a tiny village of tiny moss house only now of course the house be cover with snow and look like baby eskimo hut the forest child creep sleepily out of the boat kiss the tree mother good-by as though in a dream not a word be speak there be the creak of they little foot on the cold snow -- that be all each child go alone into he little house they be light and look warm through the door and tree mother nod as though that be well but before the air-boat have rise out of sight the light be all out and the forest child sound asleep snuggle into they moss bed from then on stop be frequent and eric wake at each one at every bird fairy nest at which they stop the tree mother lean from the boat and scoop the crusted snow out of the nest then when the bird fairy be settle down she powdered the snow with she finger until it be soft and heap it over the little creature who be already asleep wild star be leave in the tip of the tallest tree in the forest there he lay without cover he face up to the cold sky he arm fling back above he head he wing fold tight he half open he slumbrous eye on the tree mother as the boat float away but before the smile in they fade he be asleep there be straight sure even fly then to helma 's little house set in its snowy garden -- and down they sink to the door stone the tree mother carry ivra who be fast asleep in in she arm the fire leap when they enter until the wall and floor dance with light the tree mother undressed ivra who never once open she eye and tuck she into bed then she help eric who be fumble and miss button in a sleepy way but he be awake enough to kiss she good-night and that be the end of everything until morning chapter viii a witch at the window when the child wake the next morning there be no helma she bed have not be sleep in they have be too sleepy the night before to wonder at she absence but now they could hardly believe they eye the room be strange and lonely without she the fire have die in the night they sit up in they bed and talk about it she always come back before bedtime say ivra she have never stay away before eric say perhaps that be why the tree mother bring you in and undressed you -- perhaps she know we mother have not come back she look wise as though she know everything she do know everything -- at least everything in the forest but do she bring I in right here in she arm eric and undressed you while you be sound asleep ivra laugh with delight and clasp she hand truly truly the dear tree mother undress I be you sure do she kiss I good-night -- but suddenly she grow solemn yes she know that mother be not here she only take care of those who have no one else well we will have to wait for mother that be all she will surely come this morning but she do not come that morning nor that day nor for many day you shall hear it all the child lay the fire together -- shiver but hopeful ivra get the breakfast teaching eric so that next time he could help they chatter and play a good deal and really have quite a merry time over it it be only at first that ivra be solemn over helma 's disappearance soon she good sense tell she that helma love they both and nothing could keep she long from she child after breakfast they wash and put away the dish then they tidy the room they hurry over it a little perhaps for it be a bright winter day and all the forest be wait to be play in before they run out they put a log on the fire that it take both of they to lift if helma should come back while they be away she must find a warm house ivra skip back after they be outside to set out a bowl and spoon for she and stand the cream jug beside they then away they flee run and jump in the frosty morning air ivra teach eric some game that could be play by two alone they be run game climb game hide game jump game ivra be swift and strong and unafraid she cheek redden like apple in the cold she be a fine playfellow not until they be hungry do they think of home then they run hand in hand at last jump the garden hedge like deer they heart beat with the expectation of run straight into helma 's arm but no helma be there nora have come with the milk leave it eat the rest of the porridge and go away again without wait for a word with any one the child wish she have stay they need some one to talk with about they mother of course they know she would come back all in she good time ivra make eric understand that but the room seem even emptier without she than it have in the morning they cheer each other as best they could drink a lot of the fresh milk and eat some nut they want to get away into the forest again and forget the empty house so they do not try to cook anything they play hard all the afternoon towards twilight it grow warmer and begin to snow great wet flake they run home leap the hedge again the house be still empty helma be not there they stir up the fire and sit down on the floor in front of it to talk over what they should do then it happen -- the strange the beautiful the frightful thing eric see a face at the window it be so perfectly beautiful that face that he want to shut he eye against it it almost hurt it be the face of a young woman very pale but when she eye meet eric 's they fill with dancing laughter she hair under she peaked white hood glisten blue-black like a river in the snow she lift a small white hand and tap on the window pane nodding to he merrily ivra turn at the sound of the little finger on the glass when she see the face she start to she foot with a frightened cry and rush to the door draw the bolt she can not get in she can not get in eric do not be afraid we be safe but the poor little girl do not believe she own word she be tremble why i be not afraid say eric run to the window the merry eye draw he now she mouth dance into smile with she eye she make pretty sign to he to open the window and let she in but ivra pull he back do not you know it be the beautiful wicked witch she whisper but eric be impatient how can she be wicked when she be so beautiful he exclaim he be so little used to beautiful people in he life that now he be fascinate and delight the beautiful wicked witch look at ivra then and ivra see how she eye be dance great black eye full of splendor and fun she catch she breath she laugh back at the beautiful wicked witch she could not help herself but she hand fly to she mouth to stop the laugh shut you eye eric that must be best not to look at she at all that be what mother do when she come before she bolt the door and then we sit down in front of the fire and never look at the window once while she tell I a long lovely world story about psyche and she little playmate ero then when we have forget all about the beautiful wicked witch we look at the window by accident and she be go come i 'll tell you a world story now the same one but eric hardly hear what she be say he move nearer and nearer to the window ivra follow he charm by the laughing face there too then together they unbolt the windowpane and open it outward the beautiful wicked witch step in how silly to be afraid of I child she laugh i have only come to play with you oh goody cry both of the child together for now that she be in the room all they fear and wonder have vanish it be dusk and so they light all the candle and poke the fire before they turn to entertain they guest but the candle do not burn very well very faintly and flickeringly -- and the fire fall lower and lower instead of grow higher and higher as they nurse it do not mind about that laugh the beautiful wicked witch there be enough light from the window for we to play together in we will not bother with the stubborn old fire and the silly little copy-cat candle come what shall we play but the child have be play hard all day and they body be tired oh tell we a story instead of play begged ivra this be the time when mother tell she very best story well i be not mother say the beautiful wicked witch but i will tell you the best story i can come sit near the window where the light be stronger that fire will never burn while i be here i be brighter than it and the old thing be jealous the child laugh at she joke but it be true -- she be very bright she eye seem to light the room or perhaps it be she gown like a opal fire blue and pink and purple change and glowing and make of the softest silk ivra nestle close to she knee where she could stroke the gleaming silk eric sprawl on the floor at she foot he face upturn to hers then she tell they a story it be not like any of helma 's world story but the child like it it be all about a gorgeous bird she have at home in she tree-house she tell how she have hear it sing one morning in early spring high up in the branch of she tree and how she have watch it day after day fly back and forth in the forest its yellow breast flash among the green leave it have a long golden bill and its tail be black as jet and its wing be the softest gray in the world with a feather of jet in either one its song be the clearest the highest the purest of all the bird song in the forest it be a wonderful bird and she want it for she own then she tell the child how she have set trap for it and how it have escape every time but at last she have make a dear little cage all weave of spring flower and leave and put food in it still the bird escape pull the food out with its long bill and never get inside the door and finally she tell they how she do capture that wild shy bird by learn its song and singing it sit in she tree-house with the window open until the bird hear and come fly in wonder to find what other bird be call it then she have close the window and the bird be hers it hang now in the pretty cage in she prettiest room and sometimes sing in the middle of the night eric like the story and all the better because it be a true story and the beautiful wicked witch say he could see the bird himself if he would come to she house he could stroke its bright breast and it would sing perhaps then there be other thing cage in she house cunning little animal and some big one worth any boy 's see but ivra answer for eric shake she head hard no no mother do not want we to visit you but eric say may i open the cage door and the window and see the bird flash away i should like that no well perhaps say the beautiful wicked witch will you come then i can not i suppose if mother helma do not want I to be you sure she do not ivra ivra be sure the beautiful wicked witch laugh then of course if you _ tell _ she she will not let you come but if you come without tell how could she mind that sound true -- but someway it can not be say ivra and that seem to end it but after a little the beautiful wicked witch begin another story this one be about a frock she have make a wonderful thing all of cobweb and violet petal with tiniest rosebud around the neck if ivra be to slip that frock over she head and unbraid she funny little pigtail she would look as pretty as any fairy in the world ivra be not too young to want to be pretty if she would only go to the beautiful wicked witch 's house she could try on that dress and wear it for one whole day if she like ivra clasp she hand but then she think and ask a question could i play in it and run and climb would i be as free as in this little old brown smock the beautiful wicked witch raise she hand in horror my cobweb frock why it would be ruin it would be in shred how can you even think of treat it so so ivra shake she head until she funny little pigtail flop from side to side i do not want to wear it then for even a minute what fun would there be well think about it anyway say the beautiful wicked witch and rise to go away it be the fir you know beyond the white birch thank you for the story say the child good-by say the beautiful wicked witch perhaps eric will remember and come it be a gorgeous bird and i have not say he could not free it then she slip out into the snow flake turn to give they one dancing look over she shoulder before the door swing to up flame the candle clear high flame when she be go and the fire crackle again and take on new life reach higher and higher they get they supper together rather silently but just before go to sleep ivra rouse herself to say let 's promise each other we will not go to the beautiful wicked witch 's fir until mother come home -- and we can tell she how jolly the witch be and what good story she tell we i do not want to go anyway answer eric unless i can free the bird -- but you see he have not promise after a while do you notice how pale she face be when she be not laugh ask eric yes and not so beautiful then mother may come in the night and we never know it till morning soon they be asleep a tired but happy little girl and boy i think the tree mother sink down in she air-boat to look in at they and open the door wide which they have forget so they would have fresh air all night but it be dark and the room be shadowy so perhaps it be only the wind chapter ix the wind hunt after all mother helma be not there the next morning -- nor the next nor the next she do not come back for day and day and day much happen before she return and much happen after i will tell you during the day the child roam the forest look for they mother they ask every one they could find whether he have see she the tree man he daughter the bird fairy and the forest child not one of they have see or hear of she since she go away but they all say with one accord that she would surely come back in she own time it be not wise to go seek she so she love they she would return wait and be patient they say time will bring helma but they be forest people who live long long live and see far eric be a earth child and ivra be not all a forest child so they find it hard to be wise and wait and do nothing but trust helma and know she would return so they go wander all the day they do not go home for meal even after a while but eat with the tree man and he daughter or the forest child sometimes as they walk through the forest look all about even up into the tree for they mother they would suddenly burst into play tag ivra would cry tap eric on the shoulder and away she would fly he after she in a race that grow merrier and merrier as it run on ivra dart and twist away when eric thought he have she roll down little hill on the snow crust climb tree jump brook until he be lucky enough to catch she by one of she pigtail at last or snatch she fly skirt tag then away he speed and the game would go on for a happy while but sooner or later they always stop run stop laugh and remember why they be wander the wood alone then they would call for helma ivra 's voice be shrill and sweet and ring through the bare wood like a birdsong eric 's waver a little uncertainly as though he doubt whether helma know it well enough to answer helma helma helma ohh helma helmaa-a no helma answer sometimes a forest child come run to say we have not see she yet ivra but we be watch the bird fairy flutter at the call and nod they little head uneasily child 's voice call for they mother be a sad sound and make the kindly little creature restless one or two of they would fly to nestle in ivra 's neck and whisper give she time do not hurry she so she will come back but the child be lose faith they go call seek and play through the wood all the hour of daylight at night ivra tell eric world story world story after world story until sleep make they forget the fifth morning of they search dawn blue and clear and windy the wind creature will be happy to-day say ivra when she open she eye and hear the wind push at all the window of the house and see the blue morning sky wild star will be circle the world why then he will see helma somewhere cry eric ivra spring from she bed eric how splendid we must go with he why do not i think of it at the very first they do not stop for breakfast but be into they coat and ready for the day 's search in a twinkling neither of they have bother to undress the night before ivra 's hair have go unbrushed for two day thing like that be apt to slip when one 's mother be away so she little pigtail be no longer smooth and glossy but frowsy and loose and the rest of she hair be ruffle until it look something like the bird fairy ' soft plumage eric 's head too be shaggier than ever and a smudge from firebuild have darken one of he cheek since the morning before they have not bath in the bird bath since helma have go away they never seem to have time or else they be too sleepy now they no more think of bath than they think of breakfast eric follow ivra who know all the way in the forest to the spot where wild star be most likely to be if he be to be find at all on such a windy perfect day they run earnestly never slacken to skip or play and soon they come in sight of some giant cedar tree near the edge of the forest there be several wind creature stand there laugh in shrill glad voice point with they arm and flap they purple wing wind creature be growing-up boy and girl with fairy-heart and strong never-tiring purple wing remember wild star be among they but before the child have come up to they the wind creature suddenly join hand -- as they do just before fly -- and start run down the sloping hill that end the forest for a minute ivra be in despair now they be go for the day to circle the world and i shall never find mother she think but she do not waste any more breath run she stop short and lift she voice clear and insistent wild star wild star i need you do not run away wild star the wind creature have reach the foot of the hill run swiftly hand in hand and they wing be already lift for fly but wild star at the sound of ivra 's voice lean back suddenly on the hand he be hold almost throw he comrade on they face and break the line he turn right about swing the other with he and come leap and run back what be the matter little comrade he ask what be the matter in all you fly ` round the world wild star you must have see my mother helma she be lose oh can not you tell we where she be yes of course but i do not know she be lose i think she be visit earth-friends truly truly ivra 's eye shine with joy and eric grab he cap from he head and throw it up in the air shout hurrah oh will you bring she to we right away ivra begged wild star look doubtful perhaps she would not want to come ivra laugh merrily at that then take we to she she say and you will see how she want to come when we ask she give we you hand then they hold out they hand ivra 's be grasp by wild star 's and eric 's by another wind creature with they free hand they clasp each other 's so the four start run down the hill while the rest of the wind creature fly off over they head wild star and he comrade run faster and faster until eric wonder how it be that he and ivra be ever keep up with they soon he realize that he foot be scarcely touch the ground at the foot of the hill stand a little group of birch and they be run right upon it he do not see how they could either turn out or stop themselves at that speed almost as soon as he have see the birch though they be beyond they they have not turn out they have jump right over the birch and they be much higher than eric 's head they be run so swiftly now that only they toe ever touch the ground -- if _ they _ do what fun it be to run like that the wind at they back and the wind creature draw they strongly forward faster and faster and faster until they be really fly just above the snow across white field they skim -- over fence and frozen stream bush and bank through orchard and meadow on on on until they come to the town there ivra pull back for a minute and the wind creature slow down eric know why ivra be afraid of the town she have tell he all about it while they play in the wood helma she mother be a human but she hate the town and love the fairy and they way that be why she have run away to live by herself in the wood but ivra be neither fairy nor human she be both now the fairy be afraid of human because human look right through they and do not see they that upset the fairy and make they uncomfortable of course helma and eric be exception for because they have no shadow in they eye they could see they and play with they so the fairy accept those two as one of themselves ivra be different because she be only half fairy any human could see she whether he eye be shadow or not if he would only look hard enough the dreadful part be that when a human do see she he be likely not to believe in she he would just think he be day-dreaming and that the little girl with the soft eye the ash-colored pigtail and the quick foot be just a piece of he day-dream not to be see be bad enough but it be much worse to be see and not believe in that be why ivra be afraid of the town people see she there and either rub they eye and look another way or laugh but now she be go for she mother and she could bear anything even that she do not hold back long they run past the canning factory and eric do not give a glance to it a little girl look out over a pile of can see he however and wonder at he warm suit of brown cloth he leggin sandal and the cap with wing she remember he in rag she see ivra too and do not rub she eye and think she a dream but she do not call to any one in the factory or point for she know _ they _ would think it a dream through the crooked narrow street past the crooked narrow house -- one of they mr freg 's -- they speed faster than the wind on on on -- up the wide avenue through the residential section where big house eye they from proud terrace -- out into the country again they race there they come to a high gray stone wall block they way and stand still you must climb say wild star she be in there chapter x on the gray wall it be a very high wall that hide they mother and at first glance it seem impossible that they could ever climb it but ivra do not stop to wonder she run up and down hunting for a foothold at last she reach the end of the wall and disappear around the corner eric and the wind creature follow when they come up to she she have already find a place where the stone be lay a bit unevenly one on the other and be half way to the top cling with toe and finger bravo cry the wind creature eric go up after she often slip back and bruise and scratch he hand and knee but as resolute as he playmate at last they gain the top the wind creature have fly up and be wait for they there sit cross-legged with they purple wing fold down they back the wall enclose the garden of a very rich family it be a formal garden with straight walk trellis fountain bench and neat flower bed lay out in square and circle now pile high with blossom snow just as the child reach the top of the wall the door into the garden from the stern gray mansion behind it open and through it come three people first be a very tall lady all wrap up in fur -- tail and head of the poor animal that have be slay to make they hang from she shoulder and down she back even the child could see that she face be sour in spite of all its smile then come a young man in a stiff funny hat carry a cane beat up the snow flower with it as he pass the flower bed and behind they walk -- helma with she gaze on the ground that be why they do not know she at first that and she very strange clothes she be dress all in velvet and fur and she arm up to she elbow be hide in a huge white muff she sway as she walk on weird little high heel and the toe of she boot draw out to long point almost like a goblin 's she hat be a velvet affair so awkward and heavy it seem to weigh down she head and she candleflame hair be smother under it be it any wonder that they do not know she like that but when she walk close under the wall and they hear she voice they know she and the wind creature have to hold ivra from jump down and throw herself into she arm wait they whisper from they high place on the wall they could look down on the head of the three people and hear all they be say they have never learn that it be not fair to listen that way from all helma say they could plainly see she be a prisoner she be plead with the old woman she be say no never never never in a thousand day and year will i ever be happy here my place be in the forest oh how these heel bother silly girl cry the old woman smile more than ever and look more disagreeable than ever at the same time you place be where you be born-in a fine house and wear clothes like other people heel indeed do you expect they to do any thing else but bother mine have bother for sixty year but you have not hear _ I _ complain neither would i helma say if i do not know about other kind of shoe that do not hurt those sandal i wear when you catch I do not hurt why can not i wear those at least when i walk in the garden well you might begin the old woman a little more kindly and smile less if you promise always to put on the high heel before come into the draw room -- no say the young man sharply let she once into the garden in she sandal and she 'll climb the wall and be off i say that we give she no chance to escape after she have be to a hundred or so ball and wear these beautiful and appropriate clothes long enough she 'll be glad of she luck and nothing could drag she into the forest believe I now helma stop plead and laugh at the young man do you think high heel or even a hat that weigh down my head like this horrid one can keep I much longer from my little daughter and that dear new little boy what they be do without I all this time -- i wonder she stop laugh to sigh the old woman take she hand not unkindly my poor dear girl she

have party and good time enough here if you will only get into the spirit of they to make up for all you forest foolishness helma answer in a low even voice that show well enough how sure she be of the truth of what she be say -- no they be realer than you ivra be realer than all the people in that mansion put together cousin uncle aunt guest servant and all she be my little fairy daughter no say the young man the wing of the wind creature on the top of the wall rustle just then in a gust of cold north wind helma throw up she head as at a familiar sound and she eye slowly lift to the face of the child look down for a minute she look steadily at they without believe and then it be as though she pale face suddenly burst into song but the old woman and the young man be not look at she and so they notice nothing the young man say the neighbor have talk about we enough already for all you queer idea and doings so you 'll wear no sandal no nor sleep with you skylight open as you be always ask nor go one step outside the wall until you have come to you sens and be more like other people so there but helma laugh she head throw back so that the child could look into she happy eye and see the glow of she short hair under she grotesque hat keep you key cousin she say and you old skylight keep shut tight as tight i shall find a way out but my child must be patient and ivra must teach eric to keep he face and body clean they must not forget meal-time and when anything go wrong or they think it be go wrong they must ask the tree man 's advice i will find a way to they soon they must keep happy and wait she say all that slowly and distinctly she eye smile into theirs what silly talk laugh the sour old lady just as though you be make a speech well it must be luncheon time now and high time we be change we frock wear you gray velvet helma and do not forget to put on stocking to match there be to be strawberry ice to-day -- and goose to begin with of course cook say she have

the way she have come out she head be high and she step out in she funny high heeled boot as though she be walk in sandal at the little door into the mansion she turn and wave she queer great muff to the child and the wind creature and they hear she laugh but when she be go and the door be shut and lock -- they hear the great key scrape -- eric turn joyfully to ivra she be stare intently at the closed door she face very pale suddenly she bury she head in she arm and burst into sob hoarse jerky sob the first and the last time eric be ever to hear she cry eric and the wind child sit cross-legged and wait soon she stop and wipe she face on she sleeve she be lock in but she _ will _ find a way home she say almost laugh how glad and how surprised she be to see we it be almost as though she have begin to believe all they talk about dream until she hear the wind creature ' wing the wind creature take they back to the forest under the giant cedar they say good-by and leave they the child go straight to the tree man 's to tell he the news he give they deep bowl of warm milk to drink and take off they sandal so that they toe might spread and warm in front of the fire then the tree girl beg for a story and ivra tell a world story about the river -- how they go in search of they mother the ocean day and night around mountain and through mountain and across whole continent and never stop until they find she -- and of the myriad present they carry to she -- of the thing they see and the thing they do as they flow search it be a long story and almost before the end the little story teller have fall asleep with she head tip back against the tree man 's chest they spend that night in the tree and that be good for a storm have rise outside and it be bitter cold in the forest chapter xi the beautiful wicked witch the next morning before eric wake ivra slip away to play with the forest child on such wild day as this they usually play indoors for they be little thing and the snow witch love to tease they say the tree man perhaps she 'll be tell they world story think eric and so he decide to go to the little moss village too for though ivra have tell he dozen of world story by now he always want to hear more so after breakfast with the tree man and he pretty shy daughter he run out in search of ivra it be indeed a cold morning bluster and raw eric feel chill

bird cage he do not like the song so well it be all too sad eric want to go away then out of the tree and never never see the witch again he would find ivra and the forest child and forget all about these cage so he say good-by to the witch and run down the spiral staircase but he could not find the door out he go round and round the wall but there be no sign of a door it be indeed as though a flower have let he in and then close its petal tight the little posy swing in they case the bird sing up stair and the beautiful wicked witch play and dance and laugh at all he search she would do nothing to help he find the door all that day he wander up stair and down stair or stand at the window look down through the green fir branch to the free forest-floor once the witch offer to tell he

comrade at last night fall the room blossom with candlelight in the yellow room up stair the beautiful wicked witch parade back and forth before the mirror loving she own reflection smile at herself courtesy frown look back over she shoulder -- lift she hair to let it fall again in electric wave eric stand by the window thoroughly weary of he search and loneliness and watch she the bird sit in the cage and watch she all the little bright eye of animal watch she the candle burn steadily how eric long for ivra now and they own big friendly room he imagine ivra in the room there all alone get she supper over the fire bathing in the fountain bath open the window and at last fall softly to sleep before the firelight fade oh if there be only a window open here how hot it be and how over-sweetly scented the beautiful wicked witch go on pose and preen before the mirror and seem to have forget all about she new little prisoner so he pull back the yellow satin curtain and look out it be clear cold starlight he press he face against the window pane and stare down into the shadow beneath the fir and there stand erect in the shadow she face lift like a pale little moon stand ivra she see he but do not wave she only nod as though she know now what she have come to make sure of she stand still for a few minute until eric almost think she be freeze in the cold but at last she move and disappear under the fir music tinkle through the house the beautiful wicked witch poise on she toe surprisedly look into the reflection of she own eye some one have come in for that be the door she say it open inward with music eric 's heart stand still have ivra come into the witch 's house ivra who be so afraid of the witch he run down the stair and the witch follow he yes ivra stand there in the middle of the warm flower-hung room like a little cold star beam but she do not look at the quaint flower in they golden vase and when the witch run to she and kiss she she do not even look at she she look only at eric and she eye say i have come to free you oh so you do want to try on the pretty frock after all cry the witch and draw she up the stair eric follow to the yellow room no say ivra but the witch bring it out and try to slip it over she head it be sheerest gossamer web and shimmer like moonlight and the little rosebud seem to make it belong to ivra eric forget all about be a prisoner and forget the little caged creature around the wall he be delighted with the frock be push down on ivra 's shoulder how beautiful you 'll be he cry but ivra wriggle away from it and stand clear she rudely make brown frock and worn sandal look odd in that satin room i do not come to see the frock she say shake she head till she pigtail bob i come to get eric the beautiful wicked witch laugh get he if you can she say then she turn she back on the child and begin to braid she black hair among the mirror they go to the window and wait there watch she the door do not open out -- only in i think eric whisper so we can not get out mother have tell I how it would be ivra whisper back we 'll have to wait until she be asleep and then find a way then ivra sit down on the floor and begin to rock back and forth and sing a lullaby it be a lullaby she mother have sing to she all she babyhood ivra sing in a very little voice almost a murmur only but by listen eric and the beautiful wicked witch could catch the word she sing the same word over and over and over night be in the forest tree mother be nigh by-abye by-abye-bye sleep be in the forest -- he feather brush you eye by-abye by-abye-bye mother 's arm be hold you forest dream be folding you by-abye by-abye -- bye the beautiful wicked witch sit down before the mirror after a while still watch she reflection but listen to the song too she head gradually sink lower and lower first rest chin in hand and at last right down on she arm stretch along the floor she face lay turn towards the child and they see the mirth slowly fade in she great black eye the lid drop lower and lower -- and then she be asleep suddenly now she look almost as young as themselves and like a pale child who have fall to sleep at its play but the child do not stop to look at she once they be sure she be asleep they be off search for the door up and down the stair and all around the room they run on tiptoe but it be no use and at last they come back to the window we must jump whisper ivra eric look down and wonder it be a long way to the ground the snow be soft beneath the crust ivra say it will only cut we a little let 's take the bird eric say ivra run to it and open the cage door it hop onto she finger eagerly and she hold its bill so that it would not sing eric open the window i 'll jump first he whisper but ivra say oh let 's hold hand and jump together the beautiful wicked witch feel the cold night air from the window on she face and stir in she sleep she eyelid quiver so the child do not wait a minute more they climb up onto the window sill ivra still hold the bird one two three she whisper and they jump out and down they go like two shooting star and plunk through the snowcrust they be up in a second they wrist and elbow be a little bruised and cut but they be not really hurt at all but strange and strange the bird have flutter near ivra 's hand for that second and then fly straight back up and into the open window it have be cage so long it do not really want its freedom after all eric cry out with regret but ivra seize he hand and they run home together through the cold starlit forest before they leap the hedge into they own garden eric see the firelight blossoming in the window but he stand still outside the door after ivra have go in for a time breathe the cold air and the clear silence right down into he toe chapter xii ivra 's birthday to-morrow be the shortest day in the year ivra tell eric one night after they be in bed he do not answer for he be very sleepy but after a

drift into sleep and dream of a party they be rouse early in the morning by something tap lightly on the door and window eric be out of bed first and see the wind creature half a dozen or more of they look in and beckon they purple wing gleam gold in the early morning sun wild star be stand in the open door happy birthday he cry and toss a snow ball into ivra 's bed she pop to she knee laugh and

one too you forest friend have see to that the child be radiant with joy and ivra whisper to eric we have we pretend too the wind creature would not come in to breakfast for of course they do not like in-door at all and besides they need very little food so they play in the garden while the child dress and eat very soon the child be do though and come leap out ready for a day 's joy the wind creature lead they then out through the forest the tree girl be watch for they at she door it be plain to be see when she join they that she carry something in she arm very secretly under she white cloak but no one mention it ivra know it must be a surprise for she birthday where the party be to be no one tell she and she do not ask she like surprise they come to the forest child 's little moss village the youngest forest child of all be the only one up so early he be busily break dead twig from bush to build he morning fire and make up a little rhymeless song about ivra 's birthday as he work this be she birthday spring 's little daughter -- spring 's little daughter -- this be she birthday wake now wake now all you forest child wake for she birthday and tie you sandal on when he see they he cry hurrah happy birthday ivra at he cry all the little window in the little moss house open and there be the tousled head of the forest child they eye blinking sleepily against the gilded morning light thank you thank you ivra cry back to the youngest forest child hurry and follow before they have go on they way five minute more the forest child be up with they tug at buckle and sandal string as they run beg not to be leave behind soon they come to big pine hill a hill deep in the forest with no tree but a giant pine at the top the wind creature have build a slide there by brushing away the snow and leave a broad track of shine blue ice up under the pine be sled enough for every one make all of weave hemlock branch they need no runner for the ice be so slippery and the hill so steep _ anything _ would go down it fast enough ivra 's forest friend must have work all the day before to make those sled -- and now she shine face and clasped hand be reward enough she be the first to try the hill she throw herself on she sled and down she flash at the bottom she tumble off and still on she knee shout up to eric and the other at the top oh it be splendid come on then the hill be cover with speeding sled the bird fairy have none of they own for they be so little they might have come to harm on that hill but they have just as good a time for all of that catch ride with the other cling to shoulder or head or foot as it happen every one be there even the snow witch who have not be invite they come whirling and dancing through the forest almost as soon as the slide have begin ivra give they glad welcome in spite of they rough way and stinging hair for she the only one of all who be there like they very well and have make they she comrade often and often on windy winter day and they who care for nobody care for she she be not like anybody they explain it to each other _ she be a great little girl _ but they would not take ivra 's sled as she want they to they have not come to spoil she fun instead they race down the hill behind she or before she push and pull they stinging hair in she face but that only make she cheek very red and she do not mind they at all then she try slide down on she foot with the long line of witch push from behind they hand on each other 's shoulder that be the best fun of all and almost always end in a tumble before the bottom be reach though the other avoid the witch as much as they could they admire ivra for such hardy comrading before noon every one be very hungry then the littlest forest child say follow I the tree girl have go ahead it be true she have slip away when no one notice the littlest forest child lead they away to a little valley-place where hemlock bough have be spread to make a floor and raise on three side to make a shelter when they have come close enough for ivra to see what it be perch so big and white in the middle of the hemlock floor she stop and sigh with joy while she clasp she hand it be a beautiful frosted birthday cake with nine brave candle of all color and burn steadily just the kind of cake she mother have always baked for she birthday -- only last year there have be eight candle she have not hope for this final delight she run quickly forward and be the first to kneel down by it the tree girl be there wait and now ivra know it be the cake that she have be carry so secretly under she cloak the snow witch do not follow into that shelter they have a great fear of shelter you must know for when force into they they quickly lose they fierceness and they fierceness be they greatest pride but before they leave the party one of they come close to eric so close that tear be whip into he eye and quickly freeze on he lash take this to you little comrade she say thrust a box make of pine cone into he hand it be for she to keep she paper doll in we witch make it then all the witch go screech and swirl away through the forest and ivra eric and the other settle down to the business of eat the birthday cake but first the tree girl who be very sensible insist that they eat some nut and apple indeed she would allow no one a bite of the wonderful cake until he have eat at least one apple and twenty nut before ivra cut the cake the other blow out the candle one after another and make she a wish in turn for every candle the tree girl wish she a bright new year the bird fairy that she mother would soon return the wind creature that she would keep she gay heart forever the forest child that she would become the most famous story teller in the forest world and then it be eric 's turn he have never be to a birthday party before and never have he make a wish for some one else so he be a little puzzle but at last he have a idea and cry i wish that you hair will grow golden and curly before to-morrow morning all princess ivra have ever tell he about have curly golden hair and though she have never say it eric have suspect for some time that ivra would like that kind of hair herself then he puff he cheek and blow out he candle a fat green one ivra laugh the snow witch would never let I keep curly hair she say they would whip it straight in a hour that remind eric of the pine cone box and he give it to she and tell she about it she be almost as delighted with that as with the cake what a wonderful cake it be such food eric have never dream of and he be a great dreamer the frosting be over a inch thick then of course ivra must tell they story all the forest people love she story they build a fire to keep from freezing the wind creature sit a little way off where it be cool enough for they comfort but not too far to hear ivra 's clear voice this time she tell all she know about the birthday of this earth one of the most magical and splendid and strange of she story but it be the shortest day in the year ivra 's birthday and night fall all too soon then the tree girl who seldom forget to be sensible say they have better go home the littlest forest child be already asleep curl close by the fire they rouse he gently good-night be call and a few minute after the shelter be desert and the fire out and by starlight could be see many footprint lead away in the white snow out into all part of the forest eric and ivra walk toward home hand in hand they have to pass the morning 's slide on the way when they come in sight of it they begin to walk more quickly and quietly and to look intently the blue ice shone bluer than ever in starlight but more than the ice shone shine _ people _ be use the sled and the hill be cover with they why they must be star people ivra cry excitedly when they be quite near they stand to watch the strange star folk be very silent never call and laugh as those who have slide there in the morning have do two a little boy and a young girl come spin down on the same sled and stop so near that ivra and eric might have touch they by lean forward but the star-two must have think the forest-two shadow for they pay no attention to they at all now that they be so near eric could see that they hair be blue like the shadow on snow and they face a beautiful shine white they straight short garment be blue like shadow too and they arm leg and foot be bare but they do not seem conscious of the cold eric do not hear they speak but they look at each other as though they _ be _ speaking and then suddenly the little boy laugh merrily as though the young girl have just tell he something very amusing soon the girl turn and run away up the hill but the little boy be as quick as she and throw himself on the sled while she never slacken she pace but draw he straight and fast up the steep slope i have never see they before ivra whisper to eric but mother have tell I of they they do not talk as we do you see they do not _ have _ to they know each other 's thought they almost never leave they star do you think -- perhaps to-night they see we slide shine and wonder so much about it they have to come down even mother have never see they it be tree mother tell she eric be very silent for he have never see such beautiful people the little boy have have a face like a star and great shine eye the young girl have be clear like the day and without smile she face have be brim with happiness but now he feel ivra tremble she whisper again you know eric it be wonderful for we to see they like this some day mother say we may get to be like they and speak without word eric ask wonder yes and more than that we may be as _ alive _ as they now we be only forest people and not all _ that _ even -- almost dream they be _ real _ then she take he hand and draw he away i can not look any more she say can you they be too beautiful eric put he finger to he eye as he walk yes it be hard to see the ground now my eye ache a little but how the child wish they mother be wait for they in the little house to hear the tale chapter xiii nora 's grandchild one afternoon eric and ivra start out for the forest child 's moss village to play with they but when they get there they find all the little house desert : not a forest child be to be find they must have go into some other part of the forest to play so ivra and eric wander on and on a little lonely a little tired of just each other for comrade till at last they come to the very edge of the forest -- and there be nora 's farm a rambling red brick house with a barn twice its size behind it down in the pasture by the house half a dozen snow witch be dance in a circle now near now far all over the pasture and sometimes right up to the farm-house window ivra clap she hand and bound forward eric do not follow he stand to watch when the snow witch see ivra run to they they rush to meet she for a minute she be lose in a cloud of blow snow and then there she be dance in they circle back and forth across the pasture and then away away away but before she frolic quite out of sight she turn to look for she playfellow and beckon to he come on she call we be go to slide on the brook below the cornfield but eric do not follow he do not like the snow witch and just as ivra and the witch drift out of sight he think he hear the forest child laugh the sound come from the barn so eric run to the door it be a big slide door and now stand open on a crack just large enough for a child to slip through eric go in the barn be tremendously big a great dusty place full of the smell of hay ahead of he be two stall with a horse in one but eric be most interested in the empty stall for it be from there the laughter seem to come he stand

when they meet eric 's puzzle one and all the time eric have only to turn he head to see ivra walk out there around in the field look at the farm house wait for he but gradually as the story go on the little figure out there grow more and more to look like just a blue shadow on the snow paler and paler finally he have to strain he eye to see it at all then he jump down from the table and say he must go home he heart be beat a little wildly for he be afraid ivra might fade away from he altogether these red-headed child be fine playfellow he like they -- oh so much he wish he could stay and

time with the witch he ask why do not you come too she say oh it be too cold nora 's grandchild be awfully good fun we play hide-and-go-seek just as we play it at the tree man 's party do they laugh

sight on go the new smock over she head in a twinkling she step into the sandal and there be they mother the helma eric have first see the garden now we must see about that she say in she old quiet way then they go out into the garden and helma begin to plan just where there should plant seed and just what must be do the child cling to she hand look up into she face and would not let she take a step away from they when she stand still they lean against she one against either side and wind they arm about she in mid-afternoon spring come -- not the spring of the year but spring himself the person the season be name for he be a tall young man with a radiant face and fair curl lift in a cloud from he head where he walk the earth spring up in green grass after he bare foot and flower follow he like a procession helma run to he swifter than the child and he kiss she lip he lift ivra nigh on he shoulder for one minute where she think she look away over the treetop hundred of mile to the blue ocean but it may have be only he eye which be very blue that shee be look into with he come two earth giant they be huge brown fellow with roll muscle and kind sleepy eye they crouch down at the opening in the hedge and wait for spring to go on with they shall we plant the garden helma ask spring yes yes cry the child and helma say yes yes as eagerly as they so the earth giant come in and plow it all up with they hand -- hand twenty time as large as a earth man 's when they be do the garden be a rich golden color and right for plant then helma point out to spring where she want the seed to be violet here rose there lily there pansy there and daisies there spring give some seed to the child and sow some himself helma sit on the door stone and joyously direct the work by twilight the garden be do and spring go away with he earth giant as he go out through the forest flower and green grass follow he -- and the next morning even the dullest earth person would know that spring have come as for helma and ivra and eric the house would not hold they joy and so they drag out they bed and sleep that night in the new-plowed sweet-smelling garden chapter xv spring wander there go another say helma as she stand in the door the very next morning after she return the littlest forest child that be and all by himself he seem rather small to go spring-wandering alone he like to go alone ivra answer she be set the table for breakfast and eric be help she ` most always he be play or wander off by himself somewhere helma stand watch the little fellow until he have vanish amid the delicate green of the forest morning then she toss back she hair with a shake of she head and cry gayly let 's go wander ourselves pet it be good to be home but we have all we life for that now let 's adventure the child be overjoy they do not want to wait for breakfast but helma think they have better for no one know where when or how they next meal would be of course though it be hard to eat you know yourself how you feel about food when you be go on a adventure however the bowl of cereal be swallow somehow then the stoutest sandal be strap on and the three be ready to set out first they go to nora 's farm and before they have wait many minute in the shadow of the tree on the edge of the field nora come from the door carry they jug of milk they run to meet she and tell she not to leave any more milk until they should come back how glad the old woman be to see helma i think spring would bring you she say spring free everything then helma ivra and eric be off for they spring wander it seem as though every one else be wander too for they could hardly walk a mile without meet some friend or stranger forest person all give they greet whether stranger or friend and all look very glad that helma be in the forest again for good news travels fast there and even the stranger know of she home-coming in a secret wooded valley walk softly to hear the bird and the thousand little other song of earth they suddenly come upon a strange and thrilling sight a party of little girl and boy all in bright color frock purple orange green blue yellow be put the finish touch on a air-boat they be make it be build of delicate leaved branch and decorate with wild flower a great anchor of dog-tooth violet hang over the side and keep it on the ground when they see helma and the child come so silently toward they they jump into the boat and crowd there look like a bunch of larger spring flower then they draw in the anchor rapidly but the little girl sit high in the back the one in the tear yellow dress and with blow cloud-dark hair cry oh no fear it be ivra and she mother and the clear-eyed earth child want to come ivra we be off spring wander among the white cloud ivra shake she head and call not unless three of we can come too full for that call down the yellow-frocked one for now the boat have lift softly almost to the tree top you earth child would weigh we down so hail and farewell good wander so the three on the ground stand look up and wave and call back good wander until the green boat have drift away and away and be lose in the spring sky but for a long time after there float down to they in the valley far laughter and glad cry the spring night be cold and so at twilight they make themselves a shelter of bough they sleep as soon as it be night and wake and be off at the break of dawn helma carry sweet chocolate in she pocket and forest friend and stranger offer they from they store all along the way sometimes when they be tired or warm with walk they would climb into the top of some tall tree and there swing among the cool new leaf helma begin tell they she world story again while the child look off over the tremble forest roof and watch for homing bird but when the hemlock and fir tree begin to crowd out the maple and oak helma say quietly one day we be near the sea the sea cry eric almost wild with sudden delight shall we see it shall we swim in it oh i have never see it oh i see it from spring 's shoulder ivra cry -- she really think she have -- but mother mother what a wonderful surprise you have for we they begin to run in they eagerness but helma hold they back it be a day 's journey yet she say and so they walk as patiently as they could down a long long slope through dark fir and hemlock it be noon of the follow day when they finally come to the sea they have struggle through a thick undergrowth of thorned bush where the great arm of the fir shut out everything ahead then suddenly they be out of it in the open on the shore with the wave almost lap they toe it be high tide the blue sea stretch away to the blue sky eric 's leg give way under he and he kneel on the white sand just look and look at the bigness of it the splendor of it the color of it and listen to the music of it ivra run right out into the foam bring in by the breaker up to she waist where she splash the water with she palm until she hair and face be drench with salt spray helma stand look away to foreign country which she could almost see but they be not leave long to themselves the head of a little girl and boy and a young woman appear over the crest of a great wave and the three be sweep up to the shore they grab ivra and draw she along with they as they pass laugh musically ivra do not like it at first and spring away from they the minute she could shake herself free but when she see they merry face and hear they laugh she return shyly the child be about eric 's and ivra 's age and the young woman be they mother the child 's name be nan and dan and the woman 's name be sally but though they have earth name they be of the fairy-kind -- call in the forest blue water people just peer into a clear pool or stream almost any bright day and you will be pretty sure to see one of they look up at you they be the sauciest and most mischievous of all fairy only stare at they a little and they will mock you to you face with smile and pout and will not go away as long as you stay for they have no fear of you or any earth people they follow they stream right into town and city under bridge and over dam you be as likely to find one in you city park as in the forest helma speak to sally while the child eye each other curiously she say how happy you blue water people must be now spring have free you at last sally drop down on the beach she dark hair fling like a shadow on the sand she laughing face look straight up into the sky she stretch she arm above she head he come just in time another day -- and we would have have to break through the ice ourselves truly we have never have such a long winter why a _ month _ ago we begin to look for spring we lay with we face press against the cold ice for hour at a time watch we could just see light through and shadow now and then and then i see he first cry dan who be listen to he mother no i cry nan no no sallv laugh i hear he sing a long way off and i call you child away from you game of shell when he foot touch the ice we dance in circle of joy and tap message through to he with we finger the ice vanish under he foot and we stream rush hither away to the sea we come with it and wave he hail and farewell as we pour down who can stop at home in spring-time and we have be ice-bound so long and now we be here boast dan i be go to swim across the sea to-morrow -- or the next day you be too little for that calm water be best or little rush stream warn sally what be it like across the sea ask eric another world i 'll tell you about it in the next story promise helma and then when i have tell you eric you may want to go across yourself and see the wonder eric draw a deep breath yes you and ivra and i in a boat he point to a white sail far out stick up like a feather slantwise in the water ivra clap she hand but helma shake she head when you go it must be alone ivra and i belong to the forest why then i do not want to go ever eric shake the think from he like water well let 's swim across now dan shout and run into the wave fall flat as soon as he be deep enough and swimming fast away the other child follow he ready for a frolic you or i would have find that water very cold but these be hardy child and one of they all winter have make comrade of the snow witch remember they wade out to the surf and plunge through it head first they take hand and float in a circle beyond rise and fall in the even motion of the roller nan be very mischievous and soon succeed in push eric out under where the wave break when he look up suddenly and see the great watery roof hang over he he be terrify but he do not scream people who comrade with ivra could not do that he shut he eye tight and then thunder down come the water-roof and a second after up bob eric like a cork choke and sputter they be laugh at he even ivra the minute the salt water be out of he eye he laugh too and try to push nan into the surf but she be too quick for he and slip away farther out to sea then begin a game of water tag eric because he be not such a good swimmer as the other be it most of the time but ivra have to take a few turn as well it be impossible to catch the other two they move in the water as reflect light move along a wall not really swim at all but flash from spot to spot helma and sally lay on the sand in the spring sunshine and talk about they child nan and dan tear they clothes so sigh sally i could spend all my time mend i must make little eric some new clothes say helma i hope i have cloth enough at home nan be naughty but she be a darling laugh sally as eric be push under the surf helma wait to see that he come up smile and then say ivra and eric never quarrel they play together from morn till night like two squirrel they all have lunch together on the shore the blue water child instead of eat smell some spring flower which sally have find that be the way they always take they nourishment helma turn some little cake of chocolate out of she pocket and though at first it seem like a small luncheon when it be all eat they feel satisfied all the afternoon the child play up and down the beach they find a smooth round pink sea-shell which they use for a ball eric be the best at throw it make he happy and proud to excel in something at last he teach they how to play base ball which he have once watch mr freg 's boy play on sunday in the back yard they use a piece of drift wood for a bat and when the shell get accidentally bat into the sea the blue water child field it like fish when they be tire of ball the blue water child draw line on the sand for hop scotch -- a game they have sometimes watch city child play in a park -- and teach ivra and eric about that then they build a castle of sand and wall it in with sea shell helma show they how to make the moat and the bridge and sally and she take turn and make up a story about the castle and tell it to they towards evening some earth people come by near to the shore in a little steam launch there be man and woman and several child in it they crowd into the side of the boat towards the shore to stare curiously at helma and eric they could not see the other of course helma with she free bright hair and bare foot look very strange to they and they could not understand what eric be do with he arm hold straight out at each side he be between dan and nan hold they hand and stand to watch but the earth people look right through the blue water child or think they be shadow perhaps one of the man put he hand to he mouth like a megaphone and call to helma ask she if she do not want to be pick up they think she be there in that wild place with a little boy alone and barefoot very singular they think she might have be shipwreck but helma shake she head and so they have to take they wonder away with they the boat sweep by ivra run out into the wave waist deep to watch the strange thing she have never see a steam launch before or anything like it a baby hold in he nurse 's arm catch sight of she and wave tiny dimpled hand call and coo she see he sparkling eye he light fuzzy hair he little white dress and sock she run farther into the water wave back to he and throw he dozen of kiss but no one else in the boat see she and after a minute the baby 's attention turn to a sea gull fly overhead ivra return to shore she face shine there have be no doubt of it -- the baby have see she at once and have have no doubt he have laugh and reach he hand to she the little fairy child almost hug herself with delight they build themselves shelter of drift wood when night fall eric 's be just large enough for he to crawl into and lie still one whole side of it be open to the sea soft fir bough make he bed and helma have leave a kiss with he but he do not sleep for a long while he lay on he side look out over the star-sprinkled water and up at the star-flowering sky and he could not have tell how or from where the command have come but he know as he look that he must cross that sea and go into the new world beyond it and see all thing for himself world story be good but they be not enough how he be to go or how live when he get there -- he do not once think of that just that he _ be _ to go fill he whole mind he forget that he have say he would not go without helma and ivra he do not think of they at all he just lay still listen to the sea 's command to go beyond and beyond chapter xvi over the tree top he be wake by ivra 's joyous cry just at dawn and roll out of he shelter rub he eye and stretch he arm and leg but as soon as he eye be well open he jump up and utter a cry of joy himself for hang just above the water on the edge of the sea be a great blue sea-shell air-boat with blue sail and the tree mother stand in it talk to helma and ivra who have run down to the water 's edge the boat and the sail be blue tree mother 's gown be blue the sea and the sky be blue tiny white cap feathered the water tiny white cloud feathered the sky and tree mother 's hair be whiter and more feathery than either she eye be dark like the tree man 's only keener and softer both and in spite of she be a grandmother she face be brown and golden like a young out-of-door girl 's and she be slim and quick and more than beautiful eric stand beside ivra he face lift up to the tree mother 's aglow and quiver she be go to take we home ivra say softly then tree mother turn the boat and it drift in and down on the sand the child and helma climb in the tree mother say very little on the long ride but she presence be enough the three be almost tremble for joy for the tree mother 's companionship be rare and one of the splendidest thing that can happen to a forest person the minute they be in the boat it shoot up and away towards home where be the blue water child eric cry suddenly remember they playmate of yesterday have you be play with blue water child ask tree mother they be gypsy-folk and you never know where you will find they next they be probably mile away by now faster faster tree mother beg ivra who be hang over the side of the boat and lose herself in joy with the motion and height faster say the tree mother then take care hold on the boat shot forward with a sudden rush the spring air change from cool feather to a sharp wing beat they face eric and ivra slip to the floor and lay on they back they dare not sit up for fear of be sweep overboard they could see nothing but the sky from where they lay but they love the speed and clap they hand and ivra cry faster faster the tree mother laugh these be brave child she think shut you eye then she say and do not try too hard to breathe they sweep on more swiftly than a wild-goose so swiftly that soon the child could neither hear speak nor see and then at last they be travel so fast that it feel as though the boat be stand perfectly still in a cold dark place gradually light begin to leak through they shut eyelid the wing of the wind beat away from they and the boat rock slower and slower in warm spring-scented air but in that brief time they have travel many many mile now when the child lean over the side they see that they be sail slowly over they own forest the tree top be like a restless green sea just a little beneath they they fly low enough to hear bird call and the voice of the stream it be then they suddenly notice that the littlest of the forest child be there curl up fast asleep at tree mother 's foot ivra cry to he in surprise and he wake slowly stretch he little brown leg shake he curly head and lift a sleepy face he be puzzle at see other beside tree mother in the boat he have be ride and awake with she all night up near the star and have drop to sleep as the star fade she bent now and take he hand i pick these wanderer up at dawn she say and now we be all go back together we be well on the way they have leave the forest roof and be sail over open country -- a short cut tree mother explain oh look cry ivra excitedly almost tumble over the edge in she endeavor to see better be not that the gray wall off there yes it be the gray wall the gray wall that have prison they mother all winter the boat go slower and slower as they near it and then almost hang still over the garden the garden be full of people have some kind of a party for many little table be set there with silver and glass that shine brilliantly in the sun servant be hurry back and forth carry tray and they gilt button sparkle almost as much as the silver but how strange be the people eric and ivra and the littlest forest child laugh aloud they be stand about so straight and stiff hold they cup and saucer and they voice rise up to the air-boat in confusion sound like a hundred parrot why do not they sit down on the grass to eat wonder the

of this adventure none the less for not believe it when she be go the three take the dish into the house and wash they then they go out and work in the garden until dusk chapter xvii the June moon now every day eric be become acquaint with strange forest people : those who have hide away from winter in tree and those who be wander up from the south along with the bird and blue water people of course all along the forest stream the forest teem with new playmate for he and ivra hide-and-go-seek be still the favorite game and now it be more fun to be it than to be hide almost for one be likely to come upon stranger peep out of tree hollow swim under water or swinging in the tree top any minute when the person who be it come across one of these stranger he would simply say i spy and you be it then he would draw the stranger away to the goal where he usually join the game and be as much at home as though he have be play in it from the very first the day that eric find wild thyme so be the best of all -- or rather she be the best of all and that be strange for when he first spy she he do not like she at all she dress be a purple slip just to she knee with a big rent in the skirt she hair be short and bushy and dark and she face be soberer than most forest people 's face she be sit out at the edge of the forest on a flat rock she chin in she hand and she do not look eager to make friend with any one but he cry i spy you be it just the same she do not lift she eye she only say you must catch I first i be wild thyme and that will be hard eric laugh for she be not a yard away from he and he spring forward as he laugh but she be quicker than he she have be at perfect rest on the rock she chin in she hand and not look at he but the instant he jump she be off like a flash a purple streak across the field but eric do not let he surprise delay he he run after she just as fast as he could and that be very very fast for run with ivra have teach he to run faster than most earth child ever dream of run soon wild thyme slow down a little and face he run backward she bushy hair raise from she head in the wind of she run she little brown face and great purple eye gleam mischievously eric spring for she she dodge he spring again she dodge again he cry out in vexation and spring again straight and sure he catch she by she bushy hair as she turn to fly and a strange thing happen to he in that second the second he catch she hair instead of wild thyme and the sunny field he be look at the sea he be stand on the shore look away and away almost to foreign land now ever since that spring night on the shore he have be think of the sea and longing with all he might to cross it and see foreign land for himself only that have seem impossible and something he must surely wait till he be grow up to do but now in a flash as he finger close on wild thyme 's hair he know that he could indeed do that and anything else he really set he heart on no girl even a fairy like to have she hair pull so wild thyme be angry she pinch eric 's arm with all she strength then _ he _ be angry and so they stand hold each other he she by the hair and she he by the arm stare hotly into each other 's face but slowly they relax and become they own natural self again break into laughter you 'll play with we will not you eric ask of course she say and i _ be _ it and away they run to find the other ivra the tree girl the forest child and dan and nan when those saw who it be eric have capture they run to meet she shouting gayly wild thyme goody goody hello wild thyme they seem to have know she always she and ivra throw they arm about each other 's shoulder and dance away to the goal wild thyme be a wonderful playfellow she be so wild so free so strong so mischievous and when the game be end she invite they to a dance that very night it be to be around the tree man 's tree she say and all come -- come when the moon rise perhaps eric 's good time in the forest reach they very height that June night of the dance he have never be to a dance before and just at first he do not think there would be much fun in it but ivra want he to go and offer to show he about the dance so they run away from the other to the edge of the field where eric have discover wild thyme and there on the even grassy ground ivra show he how to dance it be very easy -- not at all like the dance earth child dance it be much more fun and much livelier the dance be just whirling and skip and jump each dancer by himself but all in a circle eric like it as well as though it have be a new game late that afternoon helma and ivra and eric gather fern and flower to deck themselves for the evening they put they on over the stream which be the only mirror in the forest helma make a girdle of brake for herself and a dandelion wreath for she hair she weave a dear little cap of star flower for ivra and a chain of they for she neck eric crown himself with bloodroot and contrived grass sandal for he foot but the sandal of course wear through before the end of the first dance and fall off they have a splendid supper of raspberry and cream which they sit on the door stone to eat and then tell story to each other while they wait for the moon to rise it come early big and round and yellow shine through the tree flood the aisle of the forest with silver light until they look like still stream and the tree like mast of great ship stand in they then the three hurry away to the tree man 's they run hand in hand through the forest aisle they face as bright to each other as in daylight but before they even come in sight of the tree they hear music thrum thrum thrum thrummmm thrummmmmmmmmmmm very soft very insistent very simple and strangely thrilling when they come to the tree there be the forest child who have come early whirling around in a circle and the tree girl in the center of the circle make music with a tiny instrument she hold in one hand and touch with the finger of the other soon forest people begin arrive from every direction there be the blue water child bright pebble around they neck and white sea shell in they blue hair the forest child be crown with maidenhair fern the tree girl be the most beautiful of all in she silver cobweb frock and she cloudy hair the tree man stand still in the shadow but he long white beard gleam out and he deep eye wild thyme wear a rope of the flower that be name for she around she neck but there be a new rent in she purple frock and she leg be scratch as though she have remember she dance only the last minute and come plunge the shortest way through bush which be true thrum thrum thrum thrummmmmmmmmm every one except the tree man be dance bewitch in the moonlight all over the grassy space around the great tree the grass be cool and refreshing under eric 's bare foot and he often dig he bare toe into the soft earth at its root as he leap or run just to make sure he be on earth at all for he feel as though he be swim in moonlight or at least tread it thrum thrum thrum thrummmmmmmmmm when the tree girl 's music stop between dance then it would go on in eric 's head it be just the sound of the night after all once eric notice that the beautiful wicked witch be dance next to he in the circle but he be not afraid of she there with the other and in bright moonlight and she be plot no ill she face be sparkling with delight and she have utterly forget herself in the dance when the great moon hang just above they and shadow be few and far between the tree mother come walk through the forest quieter and more beautiful than the moon wild thyme run to she and lay she bushy head against she breast for wild thyme only of all the forest people love she without awe the tree mother put she hand on wild thyme 's head and stand to watch the dance she robe gleam like frost and she hair be a pool of light above she head thrum thrum thrum thrummmmmmmmm wild thyme jump back into the dance and the tree mother stand alone but although she stand as still as a moonbeam under the tree she make eric think of dance more than all the other put together it be she eye the thrum thrum thrum thrummmmmmmmmm be in they and the rest of that night eric feel as though the music-instrument the tree girl be swing be silent and that all the music flow from tree mother but eric after all be only a earth child and he leg get very tired in spite of the music and the moonlight so at last he slip out of the circle and stumble with weariness and sleepiness go to tree mother she pick he up in she arm and the minute he head touch she shoulder he be sound asleep the music at last hushed in he head when he wake it be summer dawn the bird be flit above in the tree-bough and make high singing he be alone lie beneath a silver birch he head among the star flower he know that helma and ivra have not want to wake he but have go home when the moon set and be wait breakfast for he there now so he jump up and run home through the dew chapter xviii the deepest place in the wood it be on the hottest day of all the hot day of summer that eric find the deepest place in the forest he wander into it while he be look for wild thyme ivra have be no good to he that day she be usually ready to play in any weather but on this the hottest day of the year she stay indoors where it be a little cooler and lie on the settle she draw paper doll on birch bark and afterwards cut they out yes even fairy child love paper doll and ivra love they more than most eric want she to go swim in the stream but he tease she to in vain for she be entrance with the doll and would hardly lift she eye from they helma be swing in a vine swing she have make for herself high in a tree above the garden one of the little people be perch on a leaf just over she head and they be chatter together like equal they eager voice float down to eric standing disconsolate near the door stone but helma usually know when she child be in trouble no matter how tiny the trouble and so before eric have stand there long or dig up more than a bushel of earth with he bare toe she lean over the nest and call to he why do not you go and play with wild thyme she do not mind the heat every one else be stay quiet till sundown wild thyme be a happy thought and eric walk away in search of she but she be in the very last place he would have think to look on such a scorching day and that be how he miss she she be lie full length on the hot burnt grass in the field at the forest 's edge love the heat and sunshine which cover she like a mantle if eric have see she it be probable he would not have know she or stop to look twice he would have think she just a little patch of the flower that be name for she so he wander on and on look high and low and all about for she and he go deeper and deeper into the forest the deeper he go the cooler it become for the forest roof keep out the sunshine the light grow dimmer and dimmer too eric have never be so far in before and everything be strange to he he see no forest people except a little brown goblin who peer at he from some underbrush and then scuttle away into the darkness of denser brush eric have never see a goblin before but he have no fear of goblin and so this one do not bother he at all he hear other scuttle and squeak and one throw a chunk of gray moss at he he stop and pick it up and throw it back with a laugh in the direction it have come from come out and play why do not you he call i know where there be a fine swimming pool but there be no answer to he invitation instead there be sudden and utter silence he be disappoint for he do want a playmate and he have almost give up look for wild thyme after walk for a long while he come at last to one of the winding of the forest stream and gratefully step into the shallow clear water dark with shadow he foot be burn and he head be hot so he drink a long drink of the cold delicious water duck he head and finally wash he face then he wade on with no purpose in mind now but just to keep he foot in the water it be so he come to the deepest place where not even ivra have ever be it be almost cool there and more like twilight than early afternoon and right in the deepest place in a nest of smooth leaf with he foot in the water lay wild star when eric first catch sight of he he think he be asleep for he wing be lie on the leaf half fold and drop and he knee be higher than he head but when eric go close enough to see he eye he know that he be very wide awake for they be wide open watchful and intent -- and purple like the early morning such wide-awake eye be startling in such a sleepy still place eric expect he to spread he wing in a flash and dart away but the wing stay half open purple shadow on the leaf and wild star do not even raise he head only he eye greet eric but eric know without word that wild star be glad to see he so he step up out of the water and stretch himself on a mound of silvery moss near by with he chin rest in he palm and he elbow support he face the wind creature he clear blue eye open to the intent purple one it be wild star who speak first i think little eric you would have cross the sea before this and be out of the forest i expect to find you next fall on the other side of the world eric be amaze for he have not say one word of he dream about that to any one how do you know i want to go he cry oh you be a earth child after all and i know you would want to be go on as soon as you see the sea but _ why _ do i want to go on ask eric he face clouding with the puzzle of it i be so happy here and helma be my mother now there can not be another mother across the sea for I and if there be i would not want she -- not after helma no helma be my only mother and ivra be my comrade and still i want to leave they -- and go on and away over there it be very funny no say wild star it be not funny you be a grow earth child not a fairy it be you own kind call you it be the music of you human life i do not know what you mean say eric it be like this : you know when you begin to sing a song you go on and on to the end without think about it at all it be the theme that carry you well a human life be make like a song -- it carry itself along you do not stop to think why it can not stop in the middle on one chord for long yours now be rest on a chord of happiness but soon it will go on again you want it to life in the forest though be not like that here it be music without any theme like the music we dance to thrum thrum thrum thrummmmmmmm but there be more than that to a earth child 's life it run on like this stream the stream be happy here in the forest too but it go on seek the sea just the same there be a long stillness while eric look down into the green depths of the water at last he ask but how could i ever get across the sea and when i get there how could i get back time enough to think about get back when you be there laugh wild star but as to get there helma be the one to tell you that she have be a earth child too you know she feel just as you do that spring night on the shore she have feel it many time it be only ivra that keep she in the forest ivra doc not belong out in the world of human and helma will never leave she but she will understand you longing all you have to do be tell she eric clap he hand a habit he have catch from ivra oh i shall cross in a ship he cry and see all the foreign land and when i come back think of the world story i shall have to tell helma and ivra he spring up in he joy and feel as though he have wing on he shoulder like wild star and have only to spread they out to go beat around the world for a second the wind creature and the earth child look very much alike and indeed the only difference be that wild star have to wait for the wind and eric need wait for no wind or no season he wing be _ inside of he head _ but they be as strong as wild star 's and he have only to spread they and lift they to go anywhere he want now he want to get back to helma and tell she all about it wild star point he the shortest way and off he run jump the stream and the moss bed beyond and disappear into the underbrush i 'll look for you next time the other side of the world wild star shout after he it be twilight when he reach home helma and ivra be sit on the door stone hand in hand they make room for eric but he do not snuggle up he stay erect he face lift towards the first dim star and tell helma all about he want to go away from they out through the forest and across the sea and all that wild star have say about music and earth people 's life and he tell she too of the vision of success he have have when he catch wild thyme that first day by she bushy hair helma listen quietly and say nothing for many minute after he be through but at last she speak put a hush hand on eric 's dreamful head i understand she say i know you would want to go on sometime and i have a friend across there who will help we he have a school for boy and i get to know he very well behind the gray stone wall he ask I about the forest and you child and he say that eric sometime would surely want to go back to human and when he do he would help he he understand boy it be to he you have better go eric and when you be really ready i will tell you how and start you on you way eric sigh with contentment and lean he head against helma 's shoulder but ivra stay at she mother 's other side as still and silent as a shadow soon the firefly begin they nightly dance in the garden but ivra do not go dart after they as usual to make they dance the swifter and eric 's head be too full of dream and he eye too full of vision of the sea to notice they at all chapter xix more magic in a mist indian summer have come round again before eric really make up he mind to go the flower be asleep in the garden and there be a steady gentle shower of yellow leaf down the forest that morning when he wake the little house seem suspend in a golden mist as he stand in the doorway he feel as though it might drift away up over the tree and into space any minute but after a little he know it be not helma 's little forest house that be to go swing away into space and adventure -- it be himself and suddenly he want to go _ then _ -- to the sea and over and beyond he call the news in to helma and ivra who be still within door helma come swiftly out to he the tree be beckon again mother he cry the way they do a year ago when i first come here now it be just as wild star say the music be begin to go on there be magic out to-day oh what make wild star know so much sit down say helma she take he hand and draw he down beside she on the door stone then she hold it firmly while very slowly and distinctly but once only she give he direction about how to go where to go and what to do so that he might follow the magic eric sit and listen attentively in spite of the high beating of he heart and the magic working in he head as soon as she be do he want to go right away that minute for even in he happiness he know that say good-by to all he friend in the forest would be too sad a task they do not say good-by when they go on long adventure or follow summer south they simply disappear one day and those who stay behind forget they until next season so eric would do as they only last week helma have make he a warm brown suit for the come winter the new strong sandal on he foot he have make himself he cap be new too and helma have stick two new little brown feather in it as in the old one so he still have a look of fly there be really nothing to delay he departure further helma call to ivra and she come out slowly there be no need to explain thing to she for she have hear everything helma lift eric 's chin in she palm and look long and earnestly at the child she be let go away from she all alone out into the queer world of earth people she pick he up in she strong arm then as though he be a very little boy and kiss he she run with he to the opening in the hedge and set he down there laugh run along now ` round the world she say and when you come back bring a hundred new world story with you eric laugh too and promise and stand on tiptoe to kiss she again he stroke she short flower petal hair and kiss she cool brown cheek over and over but he do not cling to she and he do not say another word but run to catch up with ivra who be to walk with he until noon and have go on ahead the child do not scuffle through the bank of leaf or jump and run and burst into play as they be use to do they walk steadily forward say very little neither hurry nor delay they step once when eric 's sandal come untied ivra knelt to fix it for she be still more skillful with knot than he but when the sun show that it be noon ivra 's step grow slower and slower drag and drag until at last she stand still in a billow of leaf i have to go back now she say in a flash all the magic sweep out of the day for eric he know he could never say good-by to ivra so he stay silent look ahead into the flutter golden forest but even as he look the tree begin to beckon with they high finger and ` way away down long avenue of tree he _ almost _ glimpse the sea ivra throw she arm about he neck and kiss he good-by comrade be all she say he kiss she cheek i 'll come back he promise but before he have go many step he turn to see she again she be stand in the billow of leave a lonely-looking little girl she face paler than it have be even on that day of the wind-hunt he want to run back to she and tell she he would be she playmate always and never leave the forest but he want too to go on and across the sea and into foreign land he stay irresolute and then quite suddenly stand just behind ivra he see tree mother she be not look at he at all but at ivra and she eye be kind star when ivra turn to go home she must walk right into tree mother 's arm and against she breast so eric be happy again ivra could not be lonely with dear tree mother perhaps she would take she up in she air-boat high above the fall leave where she could look down on the magic he wave call remember I to the snow witch when they come that be not because he really want to be remember to they but because he know that ivra like they best of all and it would please she she nod and wave too and throw he a kiss then a shower of flutter leaf come between the playmate when it be clear again eric have run on out of sight and be lose to ivra in the forest on and on and on through the shower of golden leaf he go magic at he elbow and around he and beckon ahead of he and after long walking and many thought at last he do see the sea gleam blue and white sparkle between the golden tree end of the project gutenberg ebook of the little house in the fairy wood by ethel cook eliot
