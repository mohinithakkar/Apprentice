http:\/\/gallicabnffr thought on the necessity of improve the condition of the slave in the british colony with a view to they ultimate emancipation and on the practicability the safety and the advantage of the latter measure by t clarkson esq 1823 preface the follow sheet first appear in a periodical work call the inquirer they be now republish without undergo any substantial alteration the author however think it due to himself to state that _ he would have materially qualify those part of he essay which speak of the improve condition of the slave in the west indy since the abolition _ have he then be acquaint with the recent evidence obtain upon that subject he present conviction certainly be that he have overrate that improvement and that in point of fact negro slavery be in its main and leading feature the same system which it be when the abolition controversy first commence it be possible there may be some who have glance over the title page of this little work may be startle at the word _ emancipation _ i wish to inform such that mr dunda afterwards lord melville a acute man and a friend to the planter _ propose this very measure to parliament _ in the year 1792 we see then that the word emancipation can not be charge with _ novelty _ it contain now _ no new idea _ it contain now nothing but what have be _ think practicable _ and _ even desirable to be accomplish _ the emancipation which i desire be such a emancipation only as i firmly believe to be compatible not only with the due subordination and happiness of the labourer but with the permanent interest of he employer i wish also to say in case any thing like a undue warmth of feeling on my part should be discover in the course of the work that i have no intention of be warm against the west indian as a body i know that there be many estimable man among they live in england who deserve every desirable praise for have send over instruction to they agent in the west indy from time to time in behalf of they wretched slave and yet alas even these _ the master themselves have not have influence enough to secure the fulfilment of they own instruction upon they own estate _ nor will they _ so long as the present system continue _ they will never be able to carry they meritorious design into effect against _ prejudice law and custom _ if this be not so how happen it that you can not see the slave belong to such estimable man _ without mark of the whip upon they back _ the truth be that _ so long as overseer driver and other be entrust with the use of arbitrary power _ and _ so long as negro-evidence be invalid against the white oppressor _ and _ so long as human nature continue to be what it be _ _ no order _ from the master for the better personal treatment of the slave _ will or can be obey _ it be against the _ system _ then and not against the west indian as a body that i be warm should i be find so unintentionally in the present work one word or two now on another part of the subject a great noise will be make no doubt when the question of emancipation come to be agitate about _ the immense property at stake _ i mean the property of the planter -- and other connect with they this be all well they interest ought undoubtedly to be attend to but i hope and trust that if property be to be attend to _ on one side _ of the question it will be equally attend to _ on the other _ this be but common justice if you put into one scale _ the gold _ and _ jewel _ of the planter you be bind to put into the other _ the liberty _ of 800000 of the african race for every man 's liberty be _ he own property _ by the law of _ nature _ _ reason _ _ justice _ and _ religion _ and if it be not so with we west indian slave it _ be only because _ they have be and continue to be _ deprive _ of it _ by force _ and here let we consider for a moment which of these two different sort of property be of the greatest value let we suppose a english gentleman to be seize by ruffian on the bank of the thame -lrb- and why not a _ gentleman _ when african _ prince _ have be so serve -rrb- and hurry away to a land -lrb- and algier be such a land for instance -rrb- where white person be hold as slave now this gentleman have not be use to severe labor -lrb- neither have the african in he own country -rrb- and be therefore unable though he do he best to please he master he be rouse to further exertion _ by the whip _ perhaps he take this treatment indignantly this only secure he _ a severer punishment _ i say nothing of he be badly feed or lodge or clothe if he should have a wife and daughter with he how much more cruel would be he fate to see the tender skin of these lacerate by the whip to see they tear from he with a knowledge that they be go to be compel to submit to the lust of a overseer _ and no redress _ how long say he be this frightful system which tear my body in piece and excruciate my soul which kill I by inch and which involve my family in unspeakable misery and unmerited disgrace to continue -- for _ ever _ reply a voice suddenly : _ for ever _ as relate to you _ own _ life and the life _ of you wife and daughter _ and that of _ all they posterity _ now would not this gentleman give _ all that he have leave behind he _ in england and _ all that he have in the world besides _ and _ all that he have in prospect and expectancy _ to get out of this wretched state though he foresee that on he return to he own country he would be oblige to beg he bread for the remainder of he life i be sure he would i be sure he would _ instantly _ prefer he _ liberty to he gold _ there would not be _ the hesitation of a moment _ as to the choice he would make i hope then that if _ the argument of property _ should he urge on _ one side _ of the question the _ argument of property -lrb- liberty -rrb- will not be overlook on the other _ but that they will be fairly weigh the one against the other and that a allowance will be make as the scale shall preponderate on either side thought & c i know of no subject where humanity and justice as well as public and private interest would be more intimately unite than in that which should recommend a mitigation of the slavery with a view afterwards to the emancipation of the negro wherever such may be hold in bondage this subject be take up for consideration so early as when the abolition of the slave trade be first practically think of and by the very person who first publicly embark in that cause in england but it be at length abandon by they not on the ground _ that slavery be less cruel or wicked or impolitic than the slave trade _ but for other reason in the first place there be not at that time so many obstacle in the way of the abolition as of the emancipation of the negro in the second place abolition could be effect immediately and with but comparatively little loss and no danger emancipation on the other hand appear to be rather a work of time it be beset too with many difficulty which require deep consideration and which if not treat with great caution and prudence threaten the most alarming result in the third place it be suppose that by effect the abolition of the slave trade the axe would be lay to the root of the whole evil so that by cut off the more vital part of it the other would gradually die away : -- for what be more reasonable than to suppose that when master could no longer obtain slave from africa or elsewhere they would be compel individually by a sort of inevitable necessity or a fear of consequence or by a sense of they own interest _ to take better care of those whom they might then have in they possession _ what be more reasonable to suppose than that the different legislature themselves move also by the same necessity _ would immediately interfere _ without even the loss of a day _ and so alter and amend the law _ relative to the treatment of slave as to enforce that as a public duty which it would be thus the private interest of individual to perform be it not also reasonable to suppose that a system of better treatment thus begin by individual and enforce directly afterwards by law would produce more willing as well as more able and valuable labourer than before and that this effect when once visible would again lead both master and legislator on the score of interest to treat they slave still more like man nay at length to give they even privilege and thus to elevate they condition by degree till at length it would be no difficult task and no mighty transition _ to pass they _ to that most advantageous situation to both party _ the rank of free man _ these be the three effect which the simple measure of the abolition of the slave trade be expect to produce by those who first espouse it by mr granville sharp and those who form the london committee and by mr pitt mr fox mr burke mr wilberforce and other of illustrious name who bring the subject before parliament the question then be how have these fond expectation be realize or how many and which of these desirable effect have be produce i may answer perhaps with truth that in we own island where the law of the abolition be not so easily evade or where there be less chance of obtain new slave than in some other part there have be already that be since the abolition of the slave trade a somewhat _ better individual _ treatment of the slave than before a certain care have be take of they the plough have be introduce to ease they labor indulgence have be give to pregnant woman both before and after they delivery premium have be offer for the rearing of infant to a certain age religious instruction have be allow to many but when i mention these instance of improvement i must be careful to distinguish what i mean -- i do not intend to say that there be no instance of humane treatment of the slave before the abolition of the slave trade i know on the other hand that there be i know that there be planter who introduce the plough upon they estate and who much to they honor grant similar indulgence premium and permission to those now mention previously to this great event all then that i mean to say be this that independently of the common progress of humanity and liberal opinion the circumstance of not be able to get new slave as formerly have have its influence upon some of we planter that it have make some of they think more that it have put some of they more upon they guard and that there be therefore upon the whole more instance of good treatment of slave by individual in we island -lrb- though far from be as numerous as they ought to be -rrb- than at any former period but alas though the abolition of the slave trade may have produce a somewhat better individual treatment of the slave and this also to a somewhat greater extent than formerly _ not one of the other effect _ so anxiously look for have be realize the condition of the slave have not yet be improve by _ law _ it be a remarkable and indeed almost a incredible fact _ that no one effort have be make _ by the legislative body in we island with _ the real _ intention of meet the new the great and the extraordinary event of the abolition of the slave trade while indeed this measure be under discussion by the british parliament a attempt be make in several of we island to alter the old law with a view as it be then pretend of provide better for the want and personal protection of the slave but it be afterwards discover that the promoter of this alteration never mean to carry it into effect it be intend by make a show of these law _ to deceive the people of england _ and _ thus to prevent they from follow up the great question of the abolition _ mr clappeson one of the evidence examine by the house of common be in jamaica when the assembly pass they famous consolidated law and he tell the house that he have often hear from people there that it be pass because of the stir in england about the slave trade and he add that slave continue to be as ill treat there _ since the passing of that act as before _ mr cook another of the evidence examine be long resident in the same island and though he live there also _ since the passing of the _ act _ he know of no legal protection _ which slave have against injury from they master mr dalrymple be examine to the same point for grenada he be there in 1788 when the act for that island be pass also call a act for the better protection and promote the increase and population of slave he tell the house that while he reside there the proposal in the british parliament for the abolition of the slave trade be a matter of general discussion and that he believe that this be a principal reason for pass it he be of opinion however that this act would prove ineffectual because as negro evidence be not to be admit those who choose to abuse they slave might still do it with impunity and people who live on term of intimacy would dislike the idea of become spy and informer against each other we have the same account of the ameliorate act of dominica this act say governor prevost appear to have be consider from the day it be pass until this hour as _ a political measure to avert the interference of the mother country in the management of the slave _ we be inform also on the same authority that the clause of this act which have give a promise of better day _ have be wholly neglect _ in short the act pass in we different island for the pretended purpose of better the condition of the slave have be all of they most shamefully neglect and they remain only a dead letter or they be as much a nullity as if they have never exist at the present day and as we planter have do nothing yet effectively by _ law _ for ameliorate the condition of they slave so they have do nothing or worse than nothing in the case of they _ emancipation _ in the year 1815 mr wilberforce give notice in the house of common of he intention to introduce there a bill for the registration of slave in the british colony in the following year a insurrection break out among some slave in barbado now though this insurrection originate as there be then reason to believe in local or peculiar circumstance or in circumstance which have often produce insurrection before the planter choose to attribute it to the registry bill now mention they give out also that the slave in jamaica and in the other island have imbibe a notion that this bill be to lead to _ they emancipation _ that while this notion exist they mind would be in a unsettled state and therefore that it be necessary that _ it should be do away _ accordingly on the 19th day of June 1816 they move and procure a address from the common to the prince regent the substance of which be -lrb- as relate to this particular -rrb- that he royal highness would be please to order all the governor of the west indium island to proclaim in the most public manner he royal highness 's concern and surprise at the false and mischievous opinion which appear to have prevail in some of the british colony -- that either he royal highness or the british parliament have send out order for _ the emancipation _ of the negro and to direct the most effectual method to be adopt for discountenance _ these unfounded and dangerous impression _ here then we have a proof that in the month of June 1816 the planter _ have no notion of alter the condition of they negro _ it be also evident that they have entertain _ no such notion since _ for emancipation imply a _ preparation _ of the person who be to be the subject of so great a change it imply a previous alteration of treatment for the better and a previous alteration of custom and even of circumstance no one of which can however be really and truly effect without _ a previous change of the law _ in fact a progressively better treatment _ by law _ must have be settle as a preparatory and absolutely necessary work have _ emancipation be intended _ but as we have never hear of the introduction of any new law to this effect or with a view of produce this effect in any of we colony we have a evidence almost as clear as the sun at noonday that we planter have no notion of alter the condition of they negro though fifteen year have elapse since the abolition of the slave trade but if it be true that the abolition of the slave trade have not produce all the effect which the abolitionist anticipate or intend it would appear to be they duty unless insurmountable obstacle present themselves _ to resume they labor : _ for though there may be upon the whole as i have admit a somewhat better _ individual _ treatment of the slave by they master arise out of a increase prudence in same which have be occasion by stop the importation yet it be true that not only many of the former continue to be ill-treat by the latter but that _ all may be so ill-treated _ if the _ latter be so disposed _ they may be ill-fed hard-worked ill-used and wantonly and barbarously punish they may be tortured nay even deliberately and intentionally kill without the means of redress or the punishment of the aggressor so long as the evidence of a negro be not valid against a white man if a white master only take care that no other white man see he commit a atrocity of the kind mention he be safe from the cognizance of the law he may commit such atrocity in the sight of a thousand black spectator and no harm will happen to he from it in fact the slave in we island have _ no more real protection or redress from law _ than when _ the abolitionist first take up the question of the slave trade _ it be evident therefore that the latter have still one-half of they work to perform and that it be they duty to perform it if they be ever influence by any good motive whether of humanity justice or religion to undertake the cause of the negro they must even now be influence by the same motive to continue it if any of those disorder still exist which it be they intention to cure they can not -lrb- if these be curable -rrb- retire from the course and say -- there be now no further need of we interference the first step then to be take by the abolitionist be to attempt to introduce a _ entire new code of law _ into we colony the treatment of the negro there must no longer be make to depend upon _ the presumed effect _ of the abolition of the slave trade indeed there be person well acquaint with colonial concern who call the abolition _ but a half measure _ at the time when it be first publicly talk of they be sure that it would never _ of itself _ answer the end propose mr steele also confess in he letter to dr dickson -lrb- 1 -rrb- -lrb- of both of whom more by and by -rrb- that the abolition of the stave trade would _ be useless _ unless at the same time the infamous law which he have point out _ be repeal _ neither must the treatment of the negro be make to depend upon what may be call _ contingent humanity _ we now leave in this country neither the horse nor the ass nor oxen nor sheep to the contingent humanity even of _ british bosom _ -- and shall we leave those whom we have prove to be _ man _ to the contingent humanity of a _ slave colony _ where the eye be familiarize with cruel sight and where we have see a constant exposure to oppression without the possibility of redress no the treatment of the negro must be make to depend _ upon law _ and unless this be do we shall look in vain for any real amelioration of they condition in the first place all those old law which be repugnant to humanity and justice must be do away there must also be new law positive certain easy of execution binding upon all by means of which the negro in we island shall have speedy and substantial redress in real case of ill-usage whether by starvation over-work or act of personal violence or otherwise there must be new law again more akin to the principle of _ reward _ than of _ punishment _ of _ privilege _ than of _ privation _ and which shall have a tendency to raise or elevate they condition so as to fit they by degree to sustain the rank of free man but if a new code of law be indispensably necessary in we colony in order to secure a better treatment to the slave to whom must we look for it i answer that we must not look for it to the west indian legislature for in the first place judge of what they be likely to do from what they have already do or rather from what they have _ not _ do we can have no reasonable expectation from that quarter one hundred and fifty year have pass during which long interval they law have be nearly stationary or without any material improvement in the second place the individual compose these legislature have be use to the exercise of unlimited power would be unwilling to part with that portion of it which would be necessary to secure the object in view in the third place they prejudice against they slave be too great to allow they to become either impartial or willing actor in the case the term _ slave _ be synonymous accord to they estimation and usage with the term _ brute _ they have fix a stigma upon they negro such as we who live in europe could not have conceive unless we have have irrefragable evidence upon the point what evil have not this cruel association of term produce the west indian master look down upon he slave with disdain he have besides a certain antipathy against he he hate the sight of he feature and of he color nay he mark with distinctive opprobrium the very blood in he vein attach different name and more or less infamy to those who have it in they accord to the quantity which they have of it in consequence of they pedigree or of they greater or less degree of consanguinity with the whites hence the west indian feel a unwillingness to elevate the condition of the negro or to do any thing for he as a human be i have no doubt that this prejudice have be one of the great cause why the improvement of we slave population _ by law _ have be so long retard and that the same prejudice will continue to have a similar operation so long as it shall continue to exist not that there be want man of humanity among we west indian legislator they humanity be discernible enough when it be to be apply to the _ whites _ but such be the system of slavery and the degradation attach to this system that they humanity seem to be lose or go when it be to be apply to the _ black _ not again that there be want man of sense among the same body they be shrewd and clever enough in the affair of life where they maintain a intercourse with the _ whites _ but in they intercourse with the _ black _ they sense appear to be shrivel and not of its ordinary size look at the law of they own making as far as the negro be concerned and they be a collection of any thing but -- wisdom it appear then that if a new code of law be indispensably necessary in we colony in order to secure a better treatment of the slave there we be not to look to the west indian legislature for it to whom then be we to turn we eye for help on this occasion we answer to the british parliament the source of all legitimate power to that parliament _ which have already hear and redress in part the wrong of africa _ the west indian legislature must be call upon to send they respective code to this parliament for revision here they will be well and impartially examine some of the law will be strike out other amend and other add and at length they will be return to the colony mean have be previously devise for they execution there but here no doubt a considerable opposition would arise on the part of the west indium planter these would consider any such interference by the british parliament as a invasion of they rights and they would cry out accordingly we remember that they set up a clamor when the abolition of the slave trade be first propose but what do mr pitt say to they in the house of common i will now say he consider the proposition that on account of some patrimonial rights of the west indian the prohibition of the slave trade would be a invasion of they legal inheritance this proposition imply that parliament have no right to stop the importation : but have this detestable traffic receive such a sanction as place it more out of the jurisdiction of the legislature for ever after than any other branch of we trade but if the law respect the slave trade imply a contract for its perpetual continuance the house could never regulate any other of the branch of we national commerce but _ any contract _ for the promotion of this trade must in he opinion _ have be void from the begin _ for if it be _ a outrage upon justice _ and only another name for _ fraud robbery and murder _ what _ pledge _ could devolve upon the legislature to incur the obligation of become principal in the commission of such enormity by sanction they continuance they set up again a similar clamor when the registry bill before mention be discuss in parliament contend that the introduction of it there be a interference with they rights also : but we must not forget the reply which mr canning make to they on that occasion he have know -lrb- he say -rrb- and there might again occur instance of obstinacy in the colonial assembly which leave the british parliament no choice but direct interference such conduct might now call for such a exertion on the part of parliament but all that he plead for be that time should be grant that it might be know if the colonial assembly would take upon they to do what that house be please to declare should be do the present address could not be misunderstand it tell the colonial assembly you be safe for the present from the interference of the british parliament on the belief and on the promise make for you that leave to yourselve you will do what be require of you to hold this language be sufficient the assembly might be leave to infer the consequence of a refusal and parliament might rest satisfied with the consciousness that they hold in they hand the means of accomplish that which they have propose in a subsequent discussion of the subject in the house of lord lord holland remark that in he opinion there have be more prejudice against this bill than the nature of the thing justified but whatever might be the objection feel against it in the colony it might be well for they to consider that it would be _ impossible for they to resist _ and that if the thing be not do by they _ it would be do for they _ but on this subject that be on the subject of colonial rights i shall say more in another place it will be proper however to repeat here and to insist upon it too that there be no _ effectual way _ of remedy the evil complain of but by subject the colonial law to the _ revision of the legislature of the mother country _ and perhaps i shall disarm some of the opponent to this measure and at any rate free myself from the charge of a novel and wild proposition when i inform they that mr long the celebrated historian and planter of jamaica and to whose authority all west indian look up adopt the same idea write on the affair of jamaica he say : the system -lrb- 2 -rrb- of colonial government and the imperfection of they several law be subject which never be but _ which ought to be _ strictly canvass examine and amend by the british parliament the second and last step to be take by the abolitionist should be to collect all possible light on the subject of _ emancipation _ with a view of carry that measure into effect in its due time they ought never to forget that _ emancipation _ be include in _ they original idea of the abolition of the slave trade _ slavery be then as much a evil in they eye as the trade itself and so long as the former continue in its present state the extinction of it ought to be equally a object of they care all the slave in we colony whether man woman or child whether _ african or creole _ have be unjustly deprive of they rights there be not a master who have the least claim to they service in point of equity there be therefore a great debt due to they and for this no payment no amends no equivalent can be find but a _ restoration to they liberty _ that all have be unjustly deprive of they rights may be easily show by examine the different grounds on which they be allege to be hold in bondage with respect to those in we colony who be _ african _ i never hear of any title to they but by the _ right of purchase _ but it will be ask where do the purchaser get they it will be answer that they get they from the seller and where do the seller that be the original seller get they they get they by _ fraud or violence _ so say the evidence before the house of common and so in fact say both house of parliament when they abolish the trade : and this be the plea set up for retain they in a cruel bondage with respect to the rest of the slave that be the _ creole _ or those bear in the colony the service the perpetual service of these be claim on the plea of the _ law of birth _ they be bear slave and this circumstance be say to give to they master a sufficient right to they person but this doctrine spring from the old roman law which teach that all slave be to be consider as _ cattle _ partus sequitur ventrem say this law or the condition or lot of the mother determine the condition or lot of the offspring it be the same law which we ourselves now apply to cattle while they be in we possession thus the calf belong to the man who own the cow and the foal to the man who own the mare and not to the owner of the bull or horse which be the male parent of each it be then upon this the old roman law and not upon any english law that the planter find they right to the service of such as be bear in slavery in conformity with this law they deny for one hundred and fifty year both the moral and intellectual nature of they slave they consider they themselves and they wish they to be consider by other in these respects as upon a level only _ with the beast of the field _ happily however they effort have be in vain the evidence examine before the house of common in the year 1789 1790 and 1791 have confirm the falsehood of they doctrine it have prove that the social affection and the intellectual power both of african and creole be the same as those of other human being what then become of the roman law for as it take no other view of slave than as _ cattle _ how be it applicable to those whom we have so abundantly prove _ to be man _ this be the grand plea upon which we west indian planter have found they right to the perpetual service of they _ creole _ slave they consider they as the young or offspring of cattle but as the slave in question have be prove and be now acknowledge to be the offspring of man and woman of social intellectual and accountable being they right must fall to the ground nor do i know upon what other principle or right they can support it they can have surely no _ natural right _ to the infant who be bear of a woman slave if there be any right to it by _ nature _ such right must belong not to the master of the mother but to the mother herself they can have no right to it again either on the score of _ reason _ or of _ justice _ debt and crime have be generally admit to be two fair grounds on which man may be justly deprive of they liberty for a time and even make to labor inasmuch as they include _ reparation of injury _ and the duty of the magistrate to _ make example _ in order that he may not bear the sword in vain but what injury have the infant do when it come into the world to the master of its mother that reparation should be seek for or punishment inflict for example and that this reparation and this punishment should be make to consist of a course of action and suffer against which more than against any other human nature would revolt be it reasonable be it just that a poor infant who have do no injury to any one should be subject _ he and he posterity for ever _ to _ the arbitrary will and tyranny of another _ and moreover to _ the condition of a brute _ because by _ mere accident _ and by _ no fault _ or _ will of he own _ he be bear of a person who have be previously in the condition of a slave and as the right to slave because they be bear slave can not be defend either upon the principle of reason or of justice so this right absolutely fall to piece when we come to try it by the touchstone _ of the christian religion _ every man who be bear into the world whether he be white or whether he be black be bear accord to christian notion a _ free agent _ and _ a accountable creature _ this be the scriptural law of he nature as a human bring he be bear under this law and he continue under it during he life now the west indian slavery be of such a arbitrary nature that it may be term _ proper _ or _ absolute _ the dominion attach to it be a despotism without control a despotism which keep up its authority by terror only the subject of it _ must do _ and this _ instantaneously _ whatever they master _ order they to do _ whether it _ be right or wrong _ he will and he will alone be they law if the wife of a slave be order by a master to submit herself to he lust and therefore to commit adultery or if she husband be order to steal any thing for he and therefore to commit theft i have no conception that either the one or the other would _ dare _ to disobey he command the whip the shackle the dungeon say mr steele before mention be at all time in he power whether it be to gratify he _ lust _ or display he authority -lrb- 3 -rrb- now if the master have the power _ a just and moral power _ to make he slave do what he order they to do even if it be wrong then i must contend that the scripture whose authority we venerate be false i must contend that he slave never could have be bear free agent and accountable creature or that as soon as they become slave they be absolved from the condition of free-agency and that they lose they responsibility as man but if on the other hand it be the reveal will of god that all man without exception must be leave free to act but accountable to god for they action -- i contend that no man can be bear nay further that no man can be make hold or possess as a proper slave i contend that there can be accord to the gospel-dispensation _ no such state as west indian slavery _ but let we now suppose for a moment that there might be find a instance or two of slave enlighten by some pious missionary who would refuse to execute they master 's order on the principle that they be wrong even this would not alter we view of the case for would not this refusal be so unexampled so unlooked-for so immediately destructive to all authority and discipline and so provocative of anger that it would be follow by _ immediate and signal punishment _ here then we should have a west indian master reverse all the law and rule of civilized nation and turn upside down all the morality of the gospel by the novel practice of _ punish man for they virtue _ this new case afford another argument why a man can not be bear a proper slave in fact the whole system of we planter appear to I to be so directly in opposition to the whole system of we religion that i have no conception how a man can have be bear a slave such as the west indian be nor indeed have i any conception how he can be rightly or justly or properly a west indian slave at all there appear to I something even impious in the thought and i be convince that many year will not pass before the west indian slavery will fall and that future age will contemplate with astonishment how the precede could have tolerate it it have now appear if i have reason conclusively that the west indian have no title to they slave on the ground of purchase nor on the plea of the law of birth nor on that of any natural right nor on that of reason or justice and that christianity absolutely annihilate it it remain only to show that they have no title to they on the ground of _ original grant or permission of government _ or of _ act of parliament _ or of _ charter _ or of _ english law _ with respect to original grant or permission of government the case be very clear history inform we that neither the african slave trade nor the west indian slavery would have be allow have it not be for the _ misrepresentation _ and _ falsehood _ of those _ who be first concern in they _ the government of those time be make to believe first that the poor african embark _ voluntarily _ on board the ship which take they from they native land and secondly that they be convey to the colony principally for _ they own benefit _ or out of _ christian feeling for they _ that they might afterwards _ be convert to christianity _ take as a instance of the first assertion the way in which queen elizabeth be deceive in whose reign the execrable slave trade begin in england this great princess seem on the very commencement of the trade to have question its lawfulness she seem to have entertain a religious scruple concern it and indeed to have revolt at the very thought of it she seem to have be aware of the evil to which its continuance might lead or that if it be sanction the most unjustifiable means might be make use of to procure the person of the native of africa and in what light she would have view any act of this kind have they take place to she knowledge we may conjecture from this fact -- that when captain -lrb- afterwards sir john -rrb- hawkin return from he first voyage to africa and hispaniolum whither he have carry slave she send for he and as we learn from hill 's naval history express she concern lest any of the african should be carry off _ without they free consent _ declare that it would be detestable and call down the vengeance of heaven upon the undertaker capt hawkin promise to comply with the injunction of elizabeth in this respect but he do not keep he word for when he go to africa again _ he seize _ many of the inhabitant _ and carry they off _ as slave here -lrb- say hill -rrb- begin the horrid practice of force the african into slavery a injustice and barbarity which so sure as there be vengeance in heaven for the worst of crime will sometime be the destruction of all who encourage it take as a instance of the second what labat a roman missionary record in he account of the isle of america he say that loui the thirteenth be very uneasy when he be about to issue the edict by which all african come into he colony be to be make slave and that this uneasiness continue till he be assure that the introduction of they in this capacity into he foreign dominion be the readiest way of _ convert they _ to the principle _ of the christian religion _ it be upon these idea then namely that the african leave they own country voluntarily and that they be to receive the blessing of christianity and upon these alone that the first transportation be allow and that the first _ english _ grant and act of parliament and that the first _ foreign _ edict sanction they we have therefore the fact well authenticate as it relate _ to original government grant and permission _ that the owner of many of the creole slave in we colony have no better title to they as property than as be the descendant of person force away from they country and bring thither by a traffic which have its allow origin in _ fraud and falsehood _ neither have the master of slave in we colony any title to they slave on account of any _ charter _ which they may be able to produce though they charter be the only source of they power it be through these that they have hitherto legislate and that they continue to legislate take away they charter and they would have no right or power to legislate at all and yet though they have they charter and though the slavery which now exist have be form and keep together entirely by the law which such charter have give they the power to make this very slavery _ be illegal _ there be not a individual who hold any of the slave by a _ legal _ title : for it be express in all these charter whether in those give to william penn and other for the continent of north america or in those give for the island now under we consideration that the law and statute to be make there be _ not to be repugnant _ but as near as may be _ agreeable to the law _ and statute of this we _ kingdom of great britain _ but be it consistent with the law of england that any one man should have the power of force another to work for he without wages be it consistent with the law of england that any one man should have the power of flog beat bruising or wounding another at he discretion be it consistent with the law of england that a man should be judge by any but he peer be it consistent with the same law that a man should be deprive of the power of give evidence against the man who have injure he or that there should be a privileged class against whom no testimony can be admit on certain occasion though the perpetrator of the most horrid crime but when we talk of consistency on this occasion let we not forget that old law of barbado make while the charter of that island be fresh in every body 's memory and therefore in the very tooth of the charter itself which run thus : if any slave under punishment by he master or by he order shall suffer in life or member no person shall be liable to any fine for the same : but if any person shall _ wantonly _ or _ cruelly _ kill he own slave he shall pay the treasury 15 l and here let we remark that when lord seaforth governor of barbado propose so lately as in 1802 the repeal of this bloody law the legislature of that island reject the proposition with indignation nay the very proposal to repeal it so stir up at the time the bad passion of many that several brutal murder of slave be commit in consequence and it be not till two or three year afterwards that the governor have influence enough to get the law repeal let the west indian then talk no more of they _ charter _ for in consequence of have legislate upon principle which be at variance with those upon which the law of england be found they have _ forfeit they all _ the mother country have therefore a right to withdraw these charter whenever she please and to substitute such other as she may think proper and here let it be observe also that the right of the west indian to make any law at all for they own island be found upon they charter and upon these alone and the law relate to the slave be contrary to what such charter prescribe the _ slavery itself _ that be the daily living practice with respect to slave under such law _ be illegal _ and _ may be do away _ but if so all we west indian slave be without exception unlawfully hold in bondage there be no master who have a legal title to any of they this assertion may appear strange and extravagant to many but it do not follow on that account that it be the less true it be a assertion which have be make by a west indian proprietor himself mr steele -lrb- 4 -rrb- before quote furnish we with what pass at the meeting of the society of art in barbado at they committee-room in August 1785 when the follow question be in the order of the day : be there any law write or print by which a proprietor can prove he title to he slave under or conformable to the law of england and why -lrb- immediately say one of the member -rrb- why conformable to the law of england will not the court in england admit such proof as be authorize by _ we slave law _ -- i apprehend not -lrb- answer a second -rrb- unless we can show that _ we slave law _ -lrb- accord to the limitation of the charter -rrb- be _ not _ repugnant to the law of england -- the same gentleman resume : do the original purchaser of a african slave in this island obtain any legal title from the merchant or importer of slave -- and of what nature do it set forth any title of propriety agreeable to the law of england -lrb- or even to the law of nation -rrb- to be in the importer more than what depend upon he simple averment and have not free negro be at sundry time trepan by such dealer and be bring contrary to the law of nation and sell here as slave -- there be no doubt -lrb- observe a third -rrb- but such villainous action have be do by worthless people : however though a honest and unsuspicious man may be deceive in buy a steal horse it do not follow that he may not have a fair and just title to a horse or any thing else buy in a open and legal market but accord to the obligation _ of be not repugnant to the law of england _ i do not see how _ we can have any title to we slave _ likely to be support by the law of england in fact the colonial system be a excrescence upon the english constitution and be constantly at variance with it there be not one english law which give a man a right to the liberty of any of he fellow creature of course there can not be accord to charter any colonial law to this effect if there be it be _ null and void _ nay the very man who be hold in bondage by the colonial law become free by english law the moment he reach the english shore but we have say enough for we present purpose we have show that the slave in we colony whether they be african or whether they be creole _ have be unjustly deprive of they rights _ there be of course a great debt due to they they have a claim to a restoration to liberty and as this restoration be include by the abolitionist in they original idea of the abolition of the slavetrade so it be they duty to endeavor to obtain it _ the first moment it be practicable _ i shall conclude my observation on this part of the subject in the word of that old champion of african liberty mr w smith the present member for norwich when address the house of common in the last session of parliament on a particular occasion he admit allude to the slave in we colony that immediate emancipation might be a injury and not a blessing to the slave themselves a period of _ preparation _ which unhappily include delay seem to be necessary the ground of this delay however be not the intermediate advantage to be derive from they labor but a conviction of its expediency as it related to themselves we have to _ compensate _ to these wretched being _ for age of injustice _ we be bind by the strongest obligation _ to train up _ these subject of we past injustice and tyranny _ for a equal participation with ourselves in the blessing of liberty and the protection of the law _ and by these consideration ought we measure to be strictly and conscientiously regulate it be only in consequence of the necessity of time to be consume in such a preparation that we could be justify in the retention of the negro in slavery _ for a single hour _ and he trust that the eye of all man both here and in the colony would be open to this view of the subject as they clear and indispensable duty have lead the reader to the first necessary step to be take in favor of we slave in the british colony -- namely the procure for they a new and better code of law and have since lead he to the last or final one -- namely the procure for they the rights of which they have be unjustly deprive : i shall now confine myself entirely to this latter branch of the subject be assure that it have a claim to all the attention that can be bestow upon it and i trust that i shall be able to show by appeal to historical fact that however awful and tremendous the work of _ emancipation _ may seem it be yet _ practicable _ that it be practicable also _ without danger _ and moreover that it be practicable with the probability of _ advantage _ to all the party concern in appeal however to fact for this purpose we must expect no light from antiquity to guide we on we way for history give we no account of person in those time similarly situate with the slave in the british colony at the present day there be no particular nation in those time like the african expressly set apart for slavery by the rest of the world so as to have a stigma put upon they on that account nor do a difference of the color of the skin constitute always as it now do a most marked distinction between the master and the slave so as to increase this stigma and to perpetuate antipathy between they nor do the slave of antiquity except perhaps once in sparta form the whole labor population of the land nor do they work incessantly like the african under the whip nor be they generally so behind they master in cultivate intellect neither do ancient history give we in the case of manumission which it record any parallel from which we might argue in the case before we the ancient manumission be those of individual only generally of but one at a time and only now and then whereas the emancipation which we contemplate in the colony will comprehend _ whole body of man _ nay _ whole population _ at a give time we must go therefore in quest of example to modern time or rather to the history of the colonial slavery itself and if we should find any there which appear to bear at all upon the case in question we must be thankful for they and though they should not be entirely to we mind we must not turn they away but keep they and reason from they as far as they analogy will warrant in examine a period comprehend the last forty year i find no less than six or seven instance of the emancipation of african slave _ in body _ the first of these case occur at the close of the first american war a number of slave have run away from they north american master and join the british army when peace come the british government do not know what to do with they they service be no longer want to leave they behind to fall again into the power of they master would have be great cruelty as well as injustice and as to take they to england what could have be do with they there it be at length determine to give _ they they liberty _ and to disband they in nova scotium and to settle they there upon grant of land as _ british subject _ and as _ free man _ the nova scotian on learn they destination be alarm they could not bear the thought of have such a number of black person among they and particularly as these understand the use of arm the government however persevere in its original intention they be convey to halifax and distribute from thence into the country they number comprehend man woman and child be two thousand and upward to gain they livelihood some of they work upon little portion of land of they own other work as carpenter other become fisherman and other work for hire in other way in process of time they raise place of worship of they own and have minister of they own from they own body they lead a harmless life and gain the character of a industrious and honest people from they white neighbor a few year afterwards the land in nova scotium be find too poor to answer and the climate too cold for they constitution a number of they to the amount of between thirteen and fourteen hundred volunteer to form a new colony which be then first thought of at sierra leone accordingly have be convey there they realize the object in view and they be to be find there they or they descendant most of they in independent and some of they in affluent circumstance at the present day a second case may be take from what occur at the close of the second or last american war it may be remember that a large british naval force have on board a powerful land force sail in the year 1814 to make a descent on the coast of the southern state of america the british army when land march to washington and burnt most of its public building it be engage also at different time with the american army in the field during these expedition some hundred of slave in these part join the british standard by invitation when the campaign be over the same difficulty occur about dispose of these as in the former case it be determine at length to ship they to trinidad _ as free labourer _ but here that be at trinidad a objection be start against receive they but on a different ground from that which have be start in the similar case in nova scotium the planter of trinidad be sure that no free negro would ever work and therefore that the slave in question would if make free and settle among they support themselves _ by plunder _ sir ralph woodford however the governor of the island resist the outcry of these prejudice he receive they into the island and settle they where he suppose the experiment would be most safely make the result have show he discernment these very man formerly slave in the southern state of america and afterwards emancipate in a body at trinidad be now earn they own livelihood and with so much industry and good conduct that the calumny originally spread against they have entirely die away a third case may comprehend those negro who lately form what we call we west indian black regiment some of these have be originally purchase in africa not as slave but recruit and other in jamaica and elsewhere they have all serve as soldier in the west indy at length certain of these regiment be transport to sierra leone and disband there and the individual compose they receive they discharge _ as free man _ this happen in the spring of 1819 _ many hundred _ of they be _ set at liberty at once _ upon this occasion some of these be afterwards march into the interior where they found waterloo hasting and other village other be ship to the isle de loss where they make settlement in like manner many in both case take with they they wife which they have bring from the west indy and other select wife from the native on the spot they be all settle upon grant give they by the government it appear from account receive from sir charle m ` carthy the governor of sierra leone that they have conduct themselves to he satisfaction and that they will prove a valuable addition to that colony a fourth case may comprehend what we call _ the capture negro _ in the colony now mention these be totally distinct from those either in the first or in the last of the case which have be mention it be well know that these be take out of slave-ship capture at different time from the commencement of the abolition of the slave trade to the present moment and that on be land _ they be make free _ after have be recruit in they health they be march in body into the interior where they be teach to form village and to cultivate land for themselves they be _ make free _ as they be land from the vessel _ from fifty to two or three hundred at a time _ they occupy at present twelve town in which they have both they church and they school regent town have be one of the first established contain about thirteen hundred soul stand foremost in improvement and have become a pattern for industry and good example the people there have now fall entirely into the habit of english society they be decently and respectably dress they attend divine worship regularly they exhibit a orderly and moral conduct in they town little shop be now begin to make they appearance and they land show the mark of extraordinary cultivation many of they after have supply they own want for the year have a surplus produce in hand for the purchase of superfluity or comfort here then be four case of slave either african or descendant of african _ emancipate _ in _ considerable body _ at a time i have keep they by themselves become they be of a different complexion from those which i intend should follow i shall now reason upon they let I premise however that i shall consider the three first of the case as one so that the same reasoning will do for all they be alike indeed in they _ main _ feature and we must consider this as sufficient for to attend minutely to every shade of difference -lrb- 5 -rrb- which may occur in every case would be to bewilder the reader and to swell the size of my work unnecessarily or without confer a adequate benefit to the controversy on either side it will be say then -lrb- for my reasoning will consist principally in answer objection on the present occasion -rrb- that the three first case _ be not strictly analogous _ to that of we west indian slave whose emancipation we be seek it will be contend that the slave in we west indian colony have be constantly in a abject and degraded state they faculty be benumb they have contract all the vice of slavery they be become habitually thief and liar they bosom burn with revenge against the whites how then can person in such a state be fit to receive they freedom the slave on the other hand who be comprehend in the three case above mention find in the british army a school as it be _ which fit they by degree for make a good use of they liberty _ while they be there they be never out of the reach of discipline and yet be daily leave to themselves to act as free man they obtain also in this _ preparatory school _ some knowledge of the custom of civilized life they be in the habit also of mix familiarly with the white soldier hence it will be say they be in a state much _ more favourable for undergo a change in they condition _ than the west indian slave before mention i admit all this i admit the difference between the two situation and also the preference which i myself should give to the one above the other on account of its desirable tendency but i never state that we west indian slave be to be emancipate _ suddenly _ but _ by degree _ i always on the other hand take it for grant that they be to have _ they preparatory school _ also nor must it be forget as a comparison have be institute that if there be _ less danger _ in emancipate the other slave _ because they have receive something like a preparatory education _ for the change there be _ far more _ in another point of view because _ they be all acquaint with the use of arm _ this be a consideration of great importance but particularly when we consider _ the prejudice of the black against the whites _ for would we west indian planter be as much at they ease as they now be if they slave have acquire _ a knowledge of the use of arm _ or would they think they on this account more or less fit for emancipation it will be say again that the fourth case consist of the sierra leone capture negro _ be not strictly analogous _ to the one in point these have probably be slave but _ for a short time _ -- say a few month include the time which elapse between they reduction to slavery and they embarkation from africa and between this they embarkation and they capture upon the ocean they have scarcely be slave when they be return to the rank of free man little or no change therefore could have be effect in so short a interim in they disposition and they character and as they be never carry to the west indy so they never could have contract the bad habit or the degradation or vice of the slavery there it will be contend therefore that they be _ better _ _ or less hazardous _ subject for _ emancipation _ than the slave in we colony i admit this objection and i give it its full weight i admit it to be _ less hazardous _ to emancipate a _ new _ than a _ old _ slave and yet the case of the sierra leone capture negro be a very strong one they be all _ african _ they be all _ slave _ they must have contract _ as mortal a hatred of the whites _ from they suffering on board ship by fetter whip and suffocation in the hold as the west indian from those severity which be attach to they bondage upon shore under these circumstance then we find they _ make free _ but observe not after any _ preparatory _ discipline but almost _ suddenly _ and _ not singly _ but _ in body _ at a time we find they also settle or make to live under the _ unnatural _ government of the _ whites _ and what be more extraordinary we find they present number as compare with that of the whites in the same colony nearly as _ one hundred and fifty to one _ notwithstanding which superiority fresh emancipation be constantly take place as fresh cargo of the capture arrive in port it will be say lastly that all the four case put together prove nothing they can give we nothing like _ a positive assurance _ that the negro slave in we colony would pass through the ordeal of emancipation without danger to they master or the community at large certainly not nor if these instance have be far more numerous than they be could they in this world of accident have give we _ a moral certainty of this _ they afford we however _ a hope _ that emancipation be practicable without danger : for will any one pretend to say that we should have have as much reason for entertaining such a hope _ if no such instance have occur _ or that we should not have have reason to despair _ if four such experiment have be make and if they have all fail _ they afford we again ground for believe that there be a peculiar softness and plasticity and pliability in the african character this softness may be collect almost every where from the travels of mr mungo park and have be notice by other writer who have contrast it with the unbending ferocity of the north american indian and other tribe but if this be a feature in the african character we may account for the uniformity of the conduct of those african who be liberate on the several occasion above mention or for they yield so uniformly to the impression which have be give they by they superior after they have be make free and if this be so why should not we colonial slave if emancipate conduct themselves in the same manner besides i be not sure whether the good conduct of the liberate in these case be not to be attribute in part to a sense of interest when they come to know that they condition _ be to be improve _ self-interest be a lead principle with all who be bear into the world and why be the negro slave in we colony to be shut out from this common feeling of we nature -- why be he to rise against he master when he be inform that he condition be to be better do not the planter as i have before related declare in the house of common in the year 1816 that they negro have then imbibe the idea that they be to be make free and that they be _ extremely restless on that account _ but what be the cause of all this restlessness why undoubtedly the thought of they emancipation be so interesting or rather a matter of such exceedingly great joy to they that _ they could not help think and talk of it _ and would not this be the case with we negro at this moment if such a prospect be to be set before they but if they would be overjoy at this prospect be it likely they would cut the throat of those who should attempt to realize it would they not on the other hand be dispose to conduct themselves equally well as the other african slave before mention when they come to know that they be immediately to be prepare for the reception of this great blessing the _ first guarantee _ of which would be a _ immediate _ and _ living experience _ of better law and better treatment the fifth case may comprehend the slave of st domingo as they be make free at different interval in the course of the french revolution to do justice to this case i must give a history of the different circumstance connect with it it may be remembered then that when the french revolution which decree equality of rights to all citizen have take place the _ free people of color _ of st domingo many of whom be person of large property and liberal education petition the national assembly that they might enjoy the same political privilege as the _ whites _ there at length the subject of the petition be discuss but not till the 8th of march 1790 when the assembly agree upon a decree concern it the decree however be word so ambiguously that the two party in st domingo the _ whites _ and the _ people of color _ interpret it each of they in its own favor this difference of interpretation give rise to animosity between they and these animosity be augment by political party-spirit accord as they be royalist or partizan of the french revolution so that disturbance take place and blood be shed in the year 1791 the people of color petition the assembly again but principally for a explanation of the decree in question on the 15th of may the subject be take into consideration and the result be another decree in explicit term which determine that the _ people of color _ in all the french island be entitle to all the rights of citizenship provide _ they be bear of free parent on both side _ the news of this decree have no sooner arrive at the cape than it produce a indignation almost amount to phrensy among the _ whites _ they directly trample under foot the national cockade and with difficulty be prevent from seize all the french merchant ship in the road after this the two party arm against each other even camp begin to be form horrible massacre and conflagration follow the report of which when bring to the mother-country be so terrible that the assembly abolish the decree in favor of _ the free people of color _ in the same year in the year 1792 the news of the rescind of the decree as now state produce when it reach st domingo as much irritation among the people of color as the news of the passing of it have do among the whites and hostility be renew between they so that new battle massacre and burning take place suffice it to say that as soon as these event become know in france the conventional assembly which have then succeed the legislative take they into consideration see however nothing but difficulty and no hope of reconciliation on either side they know not what other course to take than to do justice whatever the consequence might be they resolve accordingly in the month of April that the decree of 1791 which have be both make and reverse by the precede assembly in the same year should stand good they restore therefore the people of color to the privilege which have be before vote to they and appoint santhonax polverel and another to repair in person to st domingo with a large body of troops and to act there as commissioner and among other thing to enforce the decree and to keep the peace in the year 1793 the same division and the same bad blood continue notwithstanding the arrival of the commissioner a very trivial matter viz a quarrel between a _ mulatto _ and a _ white man _ -lrb- a officer in the french marine -rrb- give rise to new disaster this quarrel take place on the 20th of June on the same day the seaman leave they ship in the road and come on shore and make common cause of the affair with the white inhabitant of the town on the other side be oppose the mulatto and other people of color and these be afterwards join by some insurgent black the battle last nearly two day during this time the arsenal be take and plunder and some thousand be kill in the street and more than half the town be burn the commissioner who be spectator of this horrible scene and who have do all they could to restore peace escape unhurt but they be leave upon a heap of ruin and with but little more power than the authority which they commission give they they have only about a thousand troops leave in the place they determine therefore under these circumstance to call in the negro slave in the neighborhood to they assistance they issue a proclamation in consequence by which _ they promise to give freedom to all the black who be willing to range themselves under the banner of the republic _ this be the first proclamation make by public authority for emancipate slave in st domingo it be usually call the proclamation of santhonax though both commissioner have a hand in it and sometimes in allusion to the place where it be issue -lrb- the cape -rrb- the proclamation of the north the result of it be that a considerable number of slave come in and be enfranchise soon after this transaction polverel leave he colleague santhonax at the cape and go in he capacity of commissioner to port au prince the capital of the west here he find every thing quiet and cultivation in a flourishing state from port au prince he visit les cayes the capital of the south he have not however be long there before he find that the mind of the slave begin to be in a unsettled state they have become acquaint with what have take place in the north not only with the riot at the cape but the proclamation of santhonax now this proclamation though it sanction freedom only for a particular or temporary purpose do not exclude it from any particular quarter the term therefore appear to be open to all who would accept they polverel therefore see the impression which it have begin to make upon the mind of the slave in these part be convince that emancipation could be neither stop nor retarded and that it be absolutely necessary for _ the personal safety of the white planter _ that it should be extend _ to the whole island _ he be so convinced of the necessity of this _ that he draw up a proclamation _ without further delay _ to that effect _ and _ put it into circulation _ he date it from les cayes he exhort the planter to patronize it he advise they if they wish to avoid the most serious calamity to concur themselves in the proposition of give freedom to they slave he then cause a register to be open at the government house to receive the signature of all those who should approve of he advice it be remarkable that all the proprietor in these part inscribe they name in the book he then cause a similar register to be open at port au prince for the west here the same disposition be find to prevail all the planter except one give in they signature they have become pretty generally convince by this time that they own personal safety be connect with the measure it may be proper to observe here that the proclamation last mention which precede these registry though it be the act of polverel alone be sanction afterwards by santhonax it be however usually call the proclamation of polverel or of les cayes it come out in September 1793 we may now add that in the month of February 1794 the conventional assembly of france though probably ignorant of what the commissioner have now do pass a decree for the abolition of slavery throughout _ the whole of the french colony _ thus the government of the mother-country without know it confirm freedom to those upon whom it have be bestow by the commissioner this decree put therefore _ the finish stroke to the whole _ it complete the emancipation of the _ whole slave population of st domingo _ have now give a concise history of the abolition of slavery in st domingo i shall inquire how those who be liberate on these several occasion conduct themselves after this change in they situation it be of great importance to we to know whether they use they freedom properly or whether they abuse it with respect to those emancipate by santhonax in the north we have nothing to communicate they be make free for military purpose only and we have no clue whereby we can find out what become of they afterwards with respect to those who be emancipate next in the south and those directly afterwards in the west by the proclamation of polverel we be enable to give a very please account fortunately for we view colonel malenfant who be resident in the island at the time have make we acquaint with they general conduct and character he account though short be quite sufficient for we purpose indeed it be highly satisfactory -lrb- 6 -rrb- after this public act of emancipation say he -lrb- by polverel -rrb- the negro _ remain quiet _ both _ in the south and in the west _ and they _ continue to work upon all the plantation _ there be estate indeed which have neither owner nor manager resident upon they for some of these have be put into prison by montbrun and other fear the same fate have flee to the quarter which have just be give up to the english yet upon these estate though abandon the negro _ continue they labor _ where there be any even inferior agent to guide they and on those estate where no white man be leave to direct they they betake themselves to the planting of provision but upon _ all the plantation _ where the whites reside the black _ continue to labor as quietly as before _ a little further on in the work ridicule the notion entertain in france that the negro would not work without compulsion he take occasion to allude to other negro who have be liberate by the same proclamation but who be more immediately under he own eye and cognizance -lrb- 7 -rrb- if say he you will take care not to speak to they of they return to slavery but talk to they about they liberty you may with this latter word chain they down to they labor how do toussaint succeed how do i succeed also before he time in the plain of the cul de sac and on the plantation gouraud more than eight month after liberty have be grant -lrb- by polverel -rrb- to the slave let those who know I at that time and even the black themselves be ask they will all reply that _ not a single negro _ upon that plantation consist of more than four hundred and fifty labourer _ refuse to work _ and yet this plantation be think to be under the worst discipline and the slave the most idle of any in the plain i myself inspire the same activity into three other plantation of which i have the management the above account be far beyond any thing that could have be expect indeed it be most gratifying we find that the liberated negro _ both in the south and the west _ continue to work upon they _ old plantation _ and for they _ old master _ that there be also _ a spirit of industry _ among they and that they give no uneasiness to they employer for they be describe as continue to work _ as quietly as before _ such be the conduct of the negro for the first nine month after they liberation or up to the middle of 1794 let we pursue the subject and see how they conduct themselves after this period during the year 1795 and part of 1796 i learn nothing about they neither good nor bad nor indifferent though i have ransack the french historian for this purpose have there however be any thing in the way of _ outrage _ i should have hear of it and let I take this opportunity of set my reader right if for want of know the date of occurrence they should have connect _ certain outrage _ which assuredly take place in st domingo _ with the emancipation of the slave _ the great massacre and conflagration which have make so frightful a picture in the history of this unhappy island have be all effect _ before the proclamation _ of santhonax and polverel they have all take place _ in the day of slavery _ or before the year 1794 that be before the great conventional decree of the mother country be know they have be occasion too _ not originally by the slave themselves _ but by quarrel between _ the white and colored planter _ and between the _ royalist _ and the _ revolutionist _ who for the purpose of reek they vengeance upon each other call in the aid of they respective slave and as to the insurgent negro of the north who fill that part of the colony so often with terror and dismay they be originally put in motion accord to malenfant under _ the auspices of the royalist _ themselves to strengthen they own cause and _ to put down the partizan of the french revolution _ when jean franois and biassou commence the insurrection there be many _ white royalist _ with they and the negro be make to wear the _ white cockade _ i repeat then that during the year 1795 and 1796 i can find nothing in the history of st domingo wherewith to reproach the emancipate negro in the way of outrage -lrb- 8 -rrb- there be every reason on the other hand to believe that they conduct themselves during this period in as orderly a manner as before i come now to the latter part of the year 1796 and here happily a clue be furnish I by which i have a opportunity of pursue my inquiry with pleasure we shall find that from this time there be no want of industry in those who have be emancipate nor want of obedience in they as hire servant : they maintain on the other hand a respectable character let we appeal first to malenfant the colony say he -lrb- 9 -rrb- be _ flourish under toussaint the whites live happily and in peace upon they estate and the negro continue to work for they _ now toussaint come into power be general-in-chief of the army of st domingo a little before the end of the year 1796 and remain in power till the year 1802 or till the invasion of the island by the french expedition of buonaparte under leclerc malenfant mean therefore to state that from the latter end of 1796 to 1802 a period of six year the planter or farmer keep possession of they estate that they live upon they and that they live upon they peaceably that be without interruption or disturbance from any one and finally that the negro though they have be all set free continue to be they labourer can there be any account more favourable to we view than this after so sudden a emancipation i may appeal next to general lacroix who publish he memoirs for a history of st domingo at paris in 1819 he inform we that when santhonax who have be recall to france by the government there return to the colony in 1796 _ he be astonish at the state in which he find it on he return _ this say lacroix -lrb- 10 -rrb- be owe to toussaint who while he have succeed in establish perfect order and discipline among the black troops have succeed also in make the black labourer return to the plantation there to resume the drudgery of cultivation but the same author tell we that in the next year -lrb- 1797 -rrb- the most wonderful progress have be make in agriculture he use these remarkable word : _ the colony _ say he -lrb- 11 -rrb- _ march as by enchantment towards its ancient splendor cultivation prosper every day produce perceptible proof of its progress the city of the cape and the plantation of the north rise up again visibly to the eye _ now i be far from wish to attribute all this wonderful improvement this daily visible progress in agriculture to the mere act of the emancipation of the slave in st domingo i know that many other circumstance which i could specify if i have room contribute towards its growth but i must be allow to maintain that unless the negro who be then free _ have do they part as labourer _ both by work regularly and industriously and by obey the direction of they superintendant or master the colony could never have go on as relate to cultivation with the rapidity describe the next witness to whom i shall appeal be the estimable general vincent who live now at paris though at a advanced age vincent be a colonel and afterwards a general of brigade of artillery in st domingo he be station there during the time both of santhonax and toussaint he be also a proprietor of estate in the island he be the man who plan the renovation of its agriculture after the abolition of slavery and one of the great instrument in bring it to the perfection mention by lacroix in the year 1801 he be call upon by toussaint to repair to pari to lay before the directory the new constitution which have be agree upon in st domingo he obey the summons it happen that he arrive in france just at the moment of the peace of amien here he find to he inexpressible surprise and grief that buonaparte be prepare a immense armament to be command by leclerc for the purpose of _ restore slavery in st domingo _ he lose no time in see the first consul and he have the courage to say at this interview what perhaps no other man in france would have dare to say at this particular moment he remonstrate against the expedition he tell he to he face that though the army destine for this purpose be compose of the brilliant conqueror of europe it could do nothing in the antille it would most assuredly be destroy by the climate of st domingo even though it should be doubtful whether it would not be destroy by the black he state as another argument against the expedition that it be totally unnecessary and therefore criminal for that every thing _ be go on well _ in st domingo _ the proprietor be in peaceable possession of they estate cultivation be make a rapid progress the black be industrious and beyond example happy _ he conjure he therefore in the name of humanity not to reverse this beautiful state of thing but alas he effort be ineffectual the die have be cast : and the only reward which he receive from buonaparte for he manly and faithful representation be banishment to the isle of elba have carry my examination into the conduct of the negro after they liberation to 1802 or to the invasion of the island by leclerc i must now leave a blank for nearly two year or till the year 1804 it can not be expect during a war in which every man be call to arm to defend he own personal liberty and that of every individual of he family that we should see plantation cultivate as quietly as before or even cultivate at all but this be not the fault of _ the emancipate negro _ but of _ they former master _ it be owe to the prejudice of the latter that this frightful invasion take place prejudice indeed common to all planter where slavery obtain from the very nature of they situation and upon which i have make my observation in a former place accustom to the use of arbitrary power they could no longer brook the loss of they whip accustomed again to look down upon the negro as a inferior race of being or as the reptile of the earth they could not bear peaceably as these have conduct themselves to come into that familiar contact with they as _ free labourer _ which the change of they situation require they consider they too as property lose but which be to be recover in a evil hour they prevail upon buonaparte by false representation and _ promise of pecuniary support _ to restore thing to they former state the hellish expedition at length arrive upon the shore of st domingo : -- a scene of blood and torture follow _ such as history have never before disclose _ and compare with which _ though plan and execute by whites -lrb- 12 -rrb- _ all the barbarity say to have be perpetrate by the _ insurgent black _ of the north _ amount comparatively to nothing _ in fine the french be drive from the island till that time the planter retain they property and then it be but not till then that they lose they all it can not therefore be expect as i have say before that i should have any thing to say in favor of the industry or good order of the emancipate negro _ during such a convulsive period _ in the year 1804 dessaline be proclaimed emperor of this fine territory here i resume the thread of my history -lrb- though it will be but for a moment -rrb- in order that i may follow it to its end in process of time the black troops contain the negro in question be disband except such as be retain for the peace-establishment of the army they who be disband return to cultivation as they be free when they become soldier so they continue to be free when they become labourer again from that time to this there have be no want of subordination or industry among they they or they descendant be the person by whom the plain and valley of st domingo _ be still cultivate _ and they be report to follow they occupation still and with _ as fair a character _ as other free labourer in any other quarter of the globe we have now see that the emancipate negro never abuse they liberty from the year 1793 -lrb- the era of they general emancipation -rrb- to the present day a period of _ thirty _ year a important question then seem to force itself upon we what be the measure take after so frightful a event as that of emancipation to secure the tranquillity and order which have be describe or to rescue the planter and the colony from ruin i be bind to answer this if i can be it only to gratify the curiosity of my reader but more particularly when i consider that if emancipation should ever be in contemplation in we own colony it will be desirable to have all the light possible upon that subject and particularly of precedent or example it appear then that the two commissioner santhonax and polverel aware of the mischief which might attend they decree be oblige to take the best measure they could devise to prevent it one of they first step be to draw up a short code of rule to be observe upon the plantation these rule be print and make public they be also order to be read aloud to all the negro upon every estate for which purpose the latter be to be assemble at a particular hour once a week the preamble to these regulation insist upon _ the necessity of work without which everything would go to ruin _ among the article the two the most worthy of we notice be that the labourer be to be oblige to hire themselves to they master for _ not less than a year _ at the end of which -lrb- September -rrb- but not before they might quit they service and engage with other and that they be to receive _ a third part _ of the produce of the estate as a recompense for they labor these two be _ fundamental _ article as to the minor they be not alike upon every estate this code of the commissioner subsist for about three year toussaint when he come into power reconsider this subject and adopt a code of rule of he own he first object be to prevent oppression on the part of the master or employer and yet to secure obedience on the part of the labourer conceive that there could be no liberty where any one man have the power of punish another at he discretion he take away from every master the use of the whip and of the chain and of every other instrument of correction either by himself or he own order : he take away in fact _ all power of arbitrary punishment _ every master offend against this regulation be to be summon on complaint by the labourer before a magistrate or intendant of police who be to examine into the case and to act accordingly conceive on the other hand that a just subordination ought to be keep up and that wherever delinquency occur punishment ought to follow he ordain that all labourer offend against the plantation law or not perform they contract should be bring before the same magistrate or intendant of police who should examine they touch such delinquency and decide as in the former case : thus he administer justice without respect of person it must be notice that all punishment be to be execute by a civil officer a sort of public executioner that they might be consider as punishment _ by the state _ thus he _ keep up discipline _ on the plantation _ without lessen authority _ on the one hand and _ without invade the liberty of individual _ on the other among he plantation offence be idleness on the part of the labourer a man be not to receive wages from he master and to do nothing he be oblige to perform a reasonable quantity of work or be punish another offence be absence without leave which be consider as desertion toussaint differ from the commissioner as to the length of time for which labourer should engage themselves to master he think it unwise to allow the former in the infancy of they liberty to get notion of change and ramble at the end of every year he ordain therefore that they should be attach to the plantation and make though free labourer a sort of _ adscriptus gleba _ for five year he differ again from the commissioner as to the quantum of compensation for they labor he think one-third of the produce too much see that the planter have another third to pay to the government he order therefore one-fourth to the labourer but this be in the case only where the labourer clothe and maintain himself : where he do not do this he be entitle to a fourth only nominally for out of this he master be to make a deduction for board and clothing the above be all i have be able to collect of the code of toussaint which under he auspices have the surprising effect of preserve tranquillity and order and of keep up a spirit of industry on the plantation of st domingo at a time when only idleness and anarchy be to have be expect it be in force when leclerc arrive with he invade army and it continue in force when the french army be beat and negro-liberty confirm from toussaint it pass to dessaline and from dessaline to christophe and petion and from the two latter to boyer and it be the code therefore which regulate and i believe with but very little variation the relative situation of master and servant in husbandry at this present hour but it be time that i should now wind up the case before we and first will any one say that this case be not analogous to that which we have in contemplation let we remember that the number of slave liberate by the french decree in st domingo be very little short of 500000 person and that this be nearly equal to the number _ of all the slave _ then in the british west indian island when put together but if there be a want of analogy the difference lie on my side of the question i maintain that emancipation in _ st domingo _ be attend with _ far more hazard _ to person and property and with _ far greater difficulty _ than it could possibly be if attempt _ in we own island _ can we forget that by the decree of polverel sanction afterwards by the convention all the slave _ be make free at once _ or _ in a single day _ no notice be give of the event and of course _ no preparation _ could be make for it they be release _ suddenly _ from _ all they former obligation and restraint _ they be let loose upon the whites they master with _ all the vice of slavery _ upon they what be to have be expect but the dissolution of all civilized society with the reign of barbarism and terror now all i ask for with respect to the slave in we own island be that they should be emancipate _ by degree _ or that they should be make to pass through a certain course of discipline _ as through a preparatory school _ to fit they for the right use of they freedom again can we forget the unfavourable circumstance in which the slave of st domingo be place for a year or two before they liberation in another point of view the island at this juncture be a prey to _ political discord civil war _ and _ foreign invasion _ at the same time they master be politically at variance with each other as they be white or color person or republican or royalist they be quarrel and fight with each other and shed each other 's blood the english who be in possession of the strong maritime post be alarming the country by they incursion : they the slave have be train up to the same political animosity they have be make to take the side of they respective master and to pass through scene of violence and bloodshed now whenever emancipation be to be propose in we own colony i anticipate neither _ political party _ nor _ civil war _ nor _ foreign invasion _ but a time of _ tranquillity and peace _ who then will be bold enough to say after these remark that there could be any thing like the danger and difficulty in emancipate the slave there which exist when the slave of st domingo be make free but some objector may say after all there be one point in which you analogy be deficient while toussaint be in power the government of st domingo be a _ black _ one and the black would be more willing to submit to the authority of a _ black _ -lrb- they own -rrb- government than of a _ white one _ hence there be less disorder after emancipation in st domingo than would have probably occur have it be try in we own island but to such a objector i should reply that he know nothing of the history of st domingo the government of that island be french or _ white _ from the very infancy of emancipation to the arrival of the expedition of leclerc the slave be make free under the government of santhonax and polverel when these retire other _ white _ commissioner succeed they when toussaint come into power he be not supreme general hedouille vincent and other have a share in the government toussaint himself _ receive he commission from the french directory _ and act under it he cause it every where to be make known but particularly among he officer and troops that he retain the island for the _ french government _ and that _ france _ be the _ mother-country _ a sixth class of slave emancipate in body may comprehend those who begin to be liberate about eighteen month ago in the newly-erected state of columbium general bolivar begin the great work himself by enfranchise he own slave to the number of between seven and eight hundred but he be not satisfy with this for believe as he do that to hold person in slavery at all be not only morally wrong but utterly inconsistent with the character of man fight for they own liberty he bring the subject before the congress of venezuelum the congress there after have duly consider it draw up resolution accordingly which it recommend to the first general congress of columbium when it should be assemble this last congress which meet at the time expect pass a decree for emancipation on the 19th of July 1821 all slave who have assist in a military capacity in achieve the independence of the republic be at once declare free all the child of slave bear after the say 19th of July be to be free in succession as they attain the eighteenth year of they age a fund be establish at the same time by a general tax upon property to pay the owner of such young slave the expense of bring they up to they eighteenth year and for put they afterwards to trade and useful profession and the same fund be make applicable to the purchase of the freedom of adult in each district every year during the three national festival in December as far as the district-fund would permit care however be to be take to select those of the best character it may be proper to observe that emancipation as above explain have be proceed regularly from the 19th of July 1821 accord to the term of the decree and also accord to the ancient spanish code which still exist and which be make to go hand in hand with it they who attain they eighteenth year be not allow to go at large after they liberation but be put under the charge of special junta for a useful education the adult may have land if they desire it or they may go where they please the state have lately purchase freedom for many of the latter who have a liking to the army they freedom be secure to they whether they remain soldier or be discharge it be particularly agreeable to I to be able to say that all who have be hitherto emancipate have conduct themselves since that time with propriety it appear by a letter from columbium date 17th February 1822 about seven month after emancipation have commence address to jame stephen esq of london and since make public that the slave be all then _ peaceably at work _ throughout the republic as well as _ the newly enfranchise _ and those originally free and it appear from the account of a gentleman of high consideration just arrive from columbium in london that up to the time of he departure they who have be emancipate be _ steady _ and _ industrious _ and that they _ have conduct themselves well without a single exception _ but as this be a experiment which it will yet take sixteen year to complete it can only be call to we aid as far as the result of it be know it be however a experiment to which as far as it have be make we may appeal with satisfaction : for when we consider that _ eighteen _ month have elapse and that _ many -lrb- 13 -rrb- thousand _ have be free since the passing of the decree and the date of the last account from columbia the decree can not but be consider to have have a sufficient trial the seventh class may comprehend the slave of the honorable joshua steele whose emancipation be attempt in barbado between the year 1783 and 1790 it appear that mr steele live several year in london he be vice-president of the london society of art manufacture and commerce and a person of talent and erudition he be the proprietor of three estate in barbado he agent there use to send he account annually of he concern but these be latterly so ruinous not only in a pecuniary point of view but as they relate to what mr steele call the _ destruction _ of he negro that he resolve though then at the advanced age of eighty to go there and to look into he affair himself accordingly he embark and arrive there early in the year 1780 mr steele have not be long in barbado before he see enough to convince he that there be something radically wrong in the management of the slave there and he be anxious to try as well for the sake of humanity as of he own interest to effect a change in it but how be he to accomplish this -lrb- 14 -rrb- he consider within himself how difficult it would be nay impossible for a single proprietor to attempt so great a novelty as to bring about a alteration of manners and custom protect by iniquitous law and to which the gentleman of the country be reconcile as to the best possible for amend the indocile and intractable ignorance of negro slave it strike he however among the expedient which occur that he might be able to form a society similar to the one in london for the purpose of improve the art manufacture and commerce of barbado and if so he indulge a hope that by means of it conference might be introduce on patriotic subject in the course of which new idea and new opinion might soften the national bigotry so far as to admit some discourse on the possibility of amendment in the mode of govern slave follow up this idea he bring it at length to bear a society be form in consequence of gentleman of the island in 1781 the subject under its discussion become popular it print its first minute in 1782 which be very favourably receive and it seem to bid fair after this to answer the benevolent view of its founder during this time a space of two year mr steele have be gain a practical knowledge of the west indian husbandry and also a practical knowledge of the temper disposition habit and custom of the slave he have also read much and think much it may be infer from he writings that three question especially have employ he mind 1 whether he could not do away all arbitrary punishment and yet keep up discipline among the slave 2 whether he could not carry on the plantation-work through the stimulus of reward 3 whether he could not change slavery into a condition of a milder name and character so that the slave should be lead by degree to the threshold of liberty from whence they might step next without hazard into the rank of free man if circumstance should permit and encourage such a procedure mr steele think after mature consideration that he could accomplish all these object and he resolve to make the experiment gradually upon he own estate at the end of the year 1783 he put the first of these question to trial i take say he the whip and all power of arbitrary punishment from all the overseer and they white servant which occasion _ my chief overseer to resign _ and i soon dismiss all he deputy who _ could not bear the loss of they whip _ but at the same time that a proper subordination and obedience to lawful order and duty should be preserve i create a _ magistracy out of the negro _ themselves and appoint a court or jury of the elder negro or head-men for trial and punishment of all casual offence -lrb- and these court be always to be hold in my presence or in that of my new superintendant -rrb- which court _ very soon grow respectable _ seven of these man be of the rank of driver in they different department be also constitute _ ruler _ as magistrate over all the gang and be charge to see at all time that nothing should go wrong in the plantation but that on all necessary occasion they should assemble and consult together how any such wrong should be immediately rectify and i make it known to all the gang that the authority of these ruler should supply the absence or vacancy of a overseer in all case they make daily or occasional report of all occurrence to the proprietor or he delegate for he approbation or he order it appear that mr steele be satisfy with this he first step and he take no other for some time at length in about another year he venture upon the second he try whether he could not obtain the labor of he negro by _ voluntary _ mean instead of the old method by violence on a certain day he offer a pecuniary reward for hole cane which be the most laborious operation in west indian husbandry he offer two-pence half-penny -lrb- currency -rrb- or about three-halfpence -lrb- sterling -rrb- per day with the usual allowance to holer of a dram with molasses to any twenty-five of he negro both man and woman who would undertake to hole for cane a acre per day at about 96-1\/2 hole for each negro to the acre the whole gang be ready to undertake it but only fifty of the volunteer be accept and many among they be those who _ on much lighter occasion _ have usually plead _ infirmity and inability _ : but the ground have be moist they hole twelve acre within six day with great ease have have _ a hour _ more or less _ every evening to spare _ and the like experiment be repeat with the like success more experiment with such premium on weed and deep hoeing be make by task-work per acre and all succeed in like manner they premium be all punctually pay they in proportion to they performance but afterwards some of the same people be put _ without premium _ to weed on a loose cultivate soil in the common manner _ eighteen _ negro do not do as much in a give time as _ six _ have perform of the like sort of work a few day before with the premium of two-pence half-penny the next year mr steele make similar experiment success attend he again and from this time task-work or the _ voluntary _ system become the general practice of the estate mr steele do not proceed to put the third question to trial till the year 1789 the society of art which he have institute in 1781 have greatly disappointed he some of the member look back to the discussion which have take place on the subject of slavery begin to think that they have go too far as slaveholder in they admission they begin to insinuate that they have be take in under the specious appearance of promote the art manufacture and commerce of barbado _ to promote dangerous design against its established law and custom _ discussion therefore of this sort become too unpopular to be continue it be therefore not till mr steele find that he have no hope of assistance from this society and that he be oblige to depend solely upon himself that he put in force the remainder of he general plan he have already -lrb- in 1783 -rrb- as we state some time ago abolish arbitrary punishment and institute a negro-magistracy and since that time -lrb- in 1785 -rrb- he have adopt the system of _ working by the piece _ but the remain part of he plan go the length of _ alter the condition _ of the slave themselves and it be of this alteration a most important one -lrb- in 1789 -rrb- that i be now to speak mr steele take the hint for the particular mode of improve the condition of he slave which i be go to describe from the practice of we anglo-saxon ancestor in the day of villainage which he say be the most wise and excellent mode of civilize savage slave there be in those day three class of villain the first or lowest consist of villain in gross who be alienable at pleasure the second of villain regardent who be _ adscripti gleba _ or attach as freehold property to the soil and the third or last of copyhold bondman who have tenement of land for which they be bind to pay in service the villain first mention or those of the lowest class have all these gradation to pass through from the first into the second and from the second into the third before they could become free man this be the model from which mr steele resolve to borrow when he form he plan for change the condition of he slave I do not however adopt it throughout but he choose out of it what he think would be most suitable to he purpose and leave the rest we may now see what the plan be when put together from the follow account in the year 1789 he erect he plantation into _ manor _ it appear that the governor of barbado have the power by charter with the consent of the majority of the council of divide the island into manor lordship and precinct and of make freeholder and though this have not yet be do mr steele hope as a member of council to have influence sufficient to get he own practice legalize in time presume upon this he register in the _ manor _ - book all he adult male slave as _ copyholder _ he then give to these separate tenement of land which they be to occupy and upon which they be to raise whatever they might think most advantageous to they support these tenement consist of half a acre of plantable and productive land to each adult a quantity suppose to be sufficient with industry to furnish he and he family with provision and clothing the tenement be make descendible to the heir of the occupier or copyholder that be to they child _ on the plantation _ for no part of the succession be to go out of the plantation to the issue of any foreign wife and in case of no such heir they be to fall in to the lord to be re-granted accord to he discretion it be also inscribe that any one of the copyholder who would not perform he service to the manor -lrb- the refractory and other -rrb- be to forfeit he tenement and he privileged rank and to go back to villain in gross and to be subject to corporal punishment as before thus say mr steele we run no risk whatever in make the experiment by give such copyhold-tenement to all we well-deserving negro and to all in general when they appear to be worthy of that favor matter have be adjust so far mr steele introduce the practice of _ rent _ and _ wages _ he put a annual rent upon each tenement which he value at so many day ' labor he set a rent also upon personal service as due by the copyholder to he master in he former quality of slave see that he master or predecessor have purchase a property in he and this be value in the same manner he then add the two rent together make so many day ' work altogether and estimate they in the current money of the time have do this he fix a daily wages or pay to be receive by the copyholder for the work which they be to do they be to work 260 day in the year for he and to have 48 besides sunday for themselves he reduce these day ' work also to current money these wages he fix at such a rate that they should be more than equivalent to the rent of they copyhold and the rent of they personal service when put together in order to hold out to they a evident and profitable incentive to they industry it appear that the rent of the tenement half a acre be fix at the rate of 9 l currency or between forty and fifty shilling sterling per acre and the wages for a man belong to the first gang at 7-1\/2 d currency or 6d sterling per day as to the rent for the personal service it be not mention with respect to labor and thing connect with it mr steele enter the follow among the local law in the _ court-roll _ of the tenant and tenement the copyholder be not to work for other master without the leave of the lord they be to work ten hour per day if they work over and above that time they be to be pay for every hour a tenth part of they daily wages and they be also to forfeit a tenth for every hour they be absent or deficient in the work of the day all sort of work however be to be reduce as far as it could be do by observation and estimation to equitable task-work hoe be to be furnish to the copyholder in the first instance but they be to renew they when wear out at they own expense the other tool be to be lend they but to be return to the storekeeper at night or to be pay for in default of so do mr steele be to continue the hospital and medical attendance at he own expense as before mr steele have now rent to receive and wages to pay be oblige to settle a new mode of accounting between the plantation and the labourer he bring therefore all the minor crop of the plantation such as corn grain of all sort yam eddo besides rum and molasses into a regular cash account by weight and measure which he charge to the copyhold-storekeeper at market price of the current time and the storekeeper pay they at the same price to such of the copyholder as call for they in part of wages in whose option it be to take either cash or goods accord to they earnings to answer all they want rice salt salt fish barrel pork cork butter flour bread biscuit candle tobacco and pipe and all species of clothing be provide and furnish from the store at the lowest market price a account of what be pay for daily subsistence and of what stand in they arrears to answer the rent of they land the fine and forfeiture for delinquency they head-levy and all other casual demand be accurately keep in column with great simplicity and in book which check each other such be the plan of mr steele and i have the pleasure of be able to announce that the result of it be _ highly satisfactory to himself _ in the year 1788 when only the first and second part of it have be reduce to practice he speak of it thus : -- a plantation say he of between seven and eight hundred acre have be govern by fix law and a negro-court _ for about five year with great success _ in this plantation no overseer or white servant be allow to lift he hand against a negro nor can he arbitrarily order a punishment fix law and a court or jury of they peer _ keep all in order _ without the ill effect of sudden and intemperate passion and in the year 1790 about a year after the last part of he plan have be put to trial he say in a letter to dr dickson my copyholder have succeed beyond my expectation this be he last letter to that gentleman for he die in the beginning of the next year mr steele go over to barbado as i have say before in the year 1780 and he be then in the eightieth year of he age he begin he humane and glorious work in 1783 and he finish it in 1789 it take he therefore six year to bring he negro to the state of vassalage describe or to that state from whence he be sure that they might be transfer without danger in no distant time to the rank of freeman if it should be think desirable he live one year afterwards to witness the success of he labor he have accomplish therefore all he wish and he die in the year 1791 in the ninety-first year of he age it may be proper now and indeed useful to the cause which i advocate to stop for a moment just to observe the similarity of sentiment of two great man quite unknown to each other one of whom -lrb- mr steele -rrb- be concern in prepare negro-slave for freedom and the other -lrb- toussaint -rrb- in devise the best mode of manage they after they have be suddenly make free it appear first that they be both agree in this point viz that the _ first step _ to be take in either case be _ the total abolition of arbitrary punishment _ it appear secondly that they be nevertheless both agree again as to the necessity of punish delinquent but that they adopt different way of bring they to justice toussaint refer they to _ magistrate _ but mr steele _ to a negro-court _ i should prefer the latter expedient first because a negro-court may be always at hand whereas magistrate may live at a distance from the plantation and not be always at home secondly because the holding of a negro-court would give consequence to those negro who should compose it not only in they own eye but in the eye of other and every thing that might elevate the black character would be useful to those who be _ on the road to emancipation _ and lastly because there must be some thing satisfactory and consoling to the accuse to be try by they peer it appear thirdly that both of they be agree again in the principle of make the negro in either case _ adscripti gleba _ or attach to the soil though they might differ as to the length of time of such ascription and it appear lastly that they be agree in another and this the only remain point viz on the necessity of hold out a stimulus to either so as to excite in they a very superior spirit of industry to any they have know before they resort however to different means to effect this toussaint give the labourer one _ fourth _ of the produce of the land deduct board and clothing mr steele on the other hand give they _ daily wages _ i do not know which to prefer but the plan of mr steele be most consonant to the english practice but to return it be possible that some objector may rise up here as before and say that even the case which i have now detail be not strictly speak analogous to that which we have in contemplation and may argue thus : -- the case of mr steele be not a complete precedent because he slave be never _ fully _ emancipate he have bring they only to _ the threshold _ of liberty but no further they be only _ copyholder _ but _ not free man _ to this i reply first that mr steele _ accomplish all that he ever aim at _ i have he own word for say that so long as the present iniquitous slave-law and the distinction of color should exist it would be imprudent to go further i reply again that the partisan of emancipation would be happy indeed if they could see the day when we west indian slave should arrive at the rank and condition of the copyholder of mr steele they wish for no other freedom than that which be _ compatible with the joint interest of the master and the slave _ at the same time they must maintain that the copyholder of mr steele have be bring so near to the condition of free man that a removal from one into the other after a certain time seem more like a thing of course than a matter to be attend either with difficulty or danger : for unquestionably they moral character must have be improve if they have cease for seven year to feel themselves degrade by arbitrary punishment they must have acquire some little independence of mind if they have be pay for they labor they must have acquire something like a spirit of industry if they have be make to pay rent for they cottage and land and to maintain themselves they must have be make to _ look beforehand _ to _ think for themselves and family from day to day _ and to _ provide against the future _ all which operation of the mind be the characteristic only of free man the case therefore of mr steele be most important and precious : for it show we first that the emancipation which we seek be a thing which _ may be effect _ the plan of mr steele be put in force in _ a british _ island and that which be do in one british island may under similar circumstance _ be do again in the same as well as in another _ it show we again _ how _ this emancipation may be bring about the process be so clearly detail that any one may follow it it be also a case for encouragement inasmuch as it be attend with success i have now consider no less than six case of slave emancipate in body and a seventh of slave who be lead up to the very threshold of freedom comprehend altogether not less than between five and six hundred thousand person and i have consider also all the objection that could be reasonably advance against they the result be a belief on my part that emancipation be not only _ practicable _ but that it be _ practicable without danger _ the slave whose case i have be consider be resident in different part of the world there must have be amongst such a vast number person of _ all character _ some be liberate who have be _ accustom to the use of arm _ other at a time when the land in which they sojourn be afflict _ with civil and foreign war _ other again _ suddenly _ and with _ all the vicious habit of slavery upon they _ and yet under all these disadvantageous circumstance i find they all without exception _ yield themselves to the will of they superior _ so as to be bring by they _ with as much ease and certainty into the form intend for they _ as clay in the hand of the potter be fashion to he own model but if this be so i think i should be chargeable with a want of common sense be i _ to doubt for a moment _ that emancipation _ be not practicable _ and i be not sure that i should not be expose to the same charge be i to doubt that emancipation _ be practicable without danger _ for i have not be able to discover -lrb- and it be most remarkable -rrb- _ a single failure _ in any of the case which have be produce i have not be able to discover throughout this vast mass of emancipated person _ a single instance of bad behavior _ on they part not even of a refusal to work or of disobedience to order much less have i see frightful commotion or massacre or a return of evil for evil or revenge for past injury even when they have it amply in they power in fact the negro character be malleable at the european will there be as i have observe before a singular pliability in the constitutional temper of the negro and they have besides a quick sense of they own interest which influence they conduct i be convince that west indium master can do what they will with they slave and that they may lead they through any change they please and with perfect safety to themselves if they will only make they -lrb- the slave -rrb- understand that they be to be benefit thereby have now establish i hope two of my point first that emancipation be _ practicable _ and secondly that it be _ practicable without danger _ i proceed to show the probability that _ it would be attend with profit _ to those planter who should be permit to adopt it i return therefore to the case of mr steele i give he the prior hearing on this new occasion because i be sure that my reader will be anxious to learn something more about he or to know what become of he plan or how far such humane endeavor be attend with success i shall begin by quote the follow expression of mr steele i have employ and amuse myself say he by introduce _ a entire new mode _ of govern my own slave for they happiness and also _ for my own profit _ it appear then that mr steele 's new method of management be _ profitable _ let we now try to make out from he own account of what these profit consist mr steele inform we that he superintendant have oblige he to hire all he holing at 3 l currency or 2 l 2 10d sterling per acre he be very much displeased at these repeat charge and then it be that he put he second question to trial as i have before related viz whether he could not obtain the labor of he negro by voluntary means instead of by the old method by violence he make therefore a attempt to introduce task-work or labor with a expected premium for extraordinary effort upon he estate he give he negro therefore a small pecuniary reward over and above the usual allowance and the consequence be as he himself say that the _ poorest feeblest _ and by character _ the most indolent _ negro of the whole gang cheerfully perform the holing of he land generally say to be the most laborious work for _ less than a fourth part _ of the state price pay to the undertaker for hole this experiment i have detail in another place after this he continue the practice of task-work or premium he describe the operation of such a system upon the mind of he negro in the follow word : accord to the vulgar mode of govern negro-slave they feel only the despond fear of punishment for do less than they ought without be sensible that the settle allowance of food and clothing be give and should be accept as a reward for do well while in task-work the expectation of win the reward and the fear of lose it have a double operation to exert they endeavor mr steele be also benefit again in another point of view by the new practice which he have introduce he be clearly convince that save time by do in one day as much as would otherwise require three day be _ worth more than double the premium _ the _ timely effect _ on vegetation _ be critical _ he find also to he satisfaction that during all the operation under the premium there be _ no disorder no crowding to the sick-house _ as before i have now to make my remark upon this account it show we clearly how mr steele make a part of he profit these profit consist first of a _ saving of expense _ in he husbandry which save _ be not make by other _ he have he land hole _ at one-fourth _ of the usual rate let we apply this to all the other operation of husbandry such as weed deep hoeing & c in a large farm of nearly eight hundred acre like he and we shall see how considerable the savings would be in one year he negro again do not counterfeit sickness as before in order to be excuse from labor but rather wish to labor in order to obtain the reward there be therefore no crowd to the hospital this constitute a _ second source of save _ for they who be in the hospital be maintain by mr steele without earn any thing while they who be work in the field leave to they master in they work when they go home at night a value equal at least to that which they have receive from he for they day 's labor but there be another saving of equal importance which mr steele call a saving of _ time _ but which he might with more propriety have call a saving of _ season _ this saving of season he say be worth _ more than double the premium _ and so it might easily have be there be soil every farmer know which be so constitute that if you miss you day you miss you season and if you miss you season you lose probably half you crop the saving therefore of the season by have a whole crop instead of half a one be _ a third source of saving of money _ now let we put all these savings together and they will constitute a great saving or profit for as these savings be make by mr steele in consequence of _ he new plan _ and _ be therefore not make by other _ they constitute a _ extraordinary _ profit to he or they add to the profit whatever it might have be which he use to receive from the estate before he new plan be put in execution but i discover other way in which mr steele be benefit as i advance in the perusal of he writings it be impossible to overlook the following passage : now say he -lrb- allude to he new system -rrb- every species of provision raise on the plantation or buy from the merchant be charge at the market-price to the copyhold-store and discharge by what have be pay on the several account of every individual bond-slave whereas for all those species heretofore i never see in any plantation-book of my estate any account of what become of they or how they be dispose of nor of they value other than in these concise word _ they be give in allowance to the negro and stock _ every year for six year past this great plantation have buy several hundred bushel of corn and be scanty in all ground-provision we produce always fall short this year 1790 _ since the establishment of copyholder though several less acre be plant _ last year in guinea corn than usual yet we have be able to sell _ several hundred bushel _ at a high price and _ we have still a great stock in hand _ i can place this save to no other account than that there be now a exact account keep by all produce be pay as cash to the bond-slave and also as all we watchman be oblige to pay for all loss that happen on they watch they have find it they interest to look well to they charge and consequently that we have have much less steal from we than before this new government take place here then we have see _ another considerable source of save _ to mr steele viz that _ he be not oblige to purchase any corn for he slave as formerly _ my reader will be able to judge better of this saving when i inform they of what have be the wretched policy of many of we planter in this department of they concern look over they farming memorandum and you will see _ sugar sugar sugar _ in every page but you may turn over leaf after leaf before you will find the word _ provision ground _ for they slave by means of this wretched policy slave have often suffer most grievously some of they have be half-starved starvation too have bring on disorder which have ultimately terminate in they death hence they master have suffer loss besides the expense incur in buy what they ought to have raise upon they own estate and this perhaps at a dear market : and in this wretched predicament mr steele appear to have be himself when he first go to the estate he slave he tell we have be reduce in number by bad management even for six year afterwards he have be oblige to buy several hundred bushel of corn but in the year 1790 he have sell several hundred bushel at a high price and have still a great stock on hand and to what be all this owe not to a exact account keep at the store -lrb- for some may have so misunderstand mr steele -rrb- for how could a exact account keep there have occasion a increase in the produce of the earth but as mr steele himself say _ to the establishment of he copyholder _ or to the _ alteration of the condition _ of he slave he slave do not only three time more work than before in consequence of the superior industry he have excite among they but by so do they be enable to put the corn into the earth three time more quickly than before or they be so much forwarder in they other work that they be enable to sow it at the critical moment or so as _ to save the season _ and thus secure a full crop or a larger crop on a less number of acre than be before raise upon a greater the copyholder therefore be the person who increase the produce of the earth but the exact account keep at the store prevent the produce from be misapply as formerly it could no longer be put down in the general expression of give in allowance to the negro and the stock but it be put down to the copyholder and to he only who receive it thus mr steele save the purchase of a great part of the provision for he slave he have formerly a great deal to buy for they but now nothing on the other hand he have to sell but as he slave be make accord to the new system to _ maintain themselves _ he have now _ the whole produce of he estate to _ _ dispose of _ the circumstance therefore of have nothing to buy but every thing to sell constitute another source of he profit what the other particular profit of mr steele be i can no where find neither can i find what be he particular expense so as to be enable to strike the balance in he favor happily however mr steele have do this for we himself though he have not furnished we with the item on either side -- he say that from the year 1773 to 1779 -lrb- he arrive in barbado in 1780 -rrb- he stock have be so much reduce by ill management and wasteful economy that the annual average neat clearance be little more than _ one and a quarter _ per cent on the purchase in a second period of four year in consequence of the exertion of a honest and able manager -lrb- though with a further reduction of the stock and include the loss from the great hurricane -rrb- the annual average income be bring to clear _ a little above two _ per cent but in a third period of three year from 1784 to 1786 inclusive _ since the new mode of govern the negro _ -lrb- besides increase the stock and lay out large sum annually in add necessary work and in repair of the damages by the great hurricane -rrb- the estate have clear very nearly _ four and a quarter _ per cent that be its annual average clearance in each of these three period be in this proportion for every 100 l annually clear in the first period the annual average clearance in the second period be 158 l 10 and in the third period be 345 l 6 8d this be the statement give by mr steele and a most important one it be for if we compare what the estate have clear in the first with what it have clear in the last of these period and have recourse to figure we shall find that mr steele have _ more than triple _ the income of it in consequence of _ he new management _ during he residence in barbado and this be in fact what he say himself in word at full length in he answer to the 17th question propose to he by the committee of the privy-council on the affair of the slave trade in a plantation say he of 200 slave in June 1780 consist of 90 man 82 woman 56 boy and 60 girl though under the exertion of a able and honest manager there be only 15 birth and no less than 57 death in three year and three month a alteration be make in the mode of govern the slave the whip be take from all the white servant all arbitrary punishment be abolish and all offence be try and sentence pass by a negro court in four year and three month after this change of government there be 44 birth and only 41 death of which ten death be of superannuated man and woman some above 80 year old but in the same interval the annual neat clearance of the estate be _ above three time more than it have be for ten year before _ dr dickson the editor of mr steele mention these profit also and in the same term and connect they with a eulogium on mr steele which be worthy of we attention mr steele say he see that the negro like all other human being be to be stimulate to permanent exertion only by a sense of they own interest in provide for they own want and those of they offspring he therefore try _ reward _ which immediately rouse the most indolent to exertion he experiment end in _ regular wages _ which the industry he have excite among he whole gang enable he to pay here be a natural efficient and profitable reciprocity of interest he people become contented he mind be free from that perpetual vexation and that load of anxiety which be inseparable from the vulgar system and in little more than four year the annual neat clearance of he property _ be more than triple _ again in another part of the work mr steele 's plan may no doubt receive some improvement which he great age oblige he to decline -- but it be perfect as far as it go _ to advance above 300 field-negro who have never before move without the whip to a state nearly resemble that of contented honest and industrious servant and after pay for they labor to triple in a few year the annual neat clearance of the estate _ -- these i say be great achievement for a aged man in a untried field of improvement pre-occupied by inveterate vulgar prejudice he have indeed accomplish all that be really doubtful or difficult in the undertaking and perhaps all that be at present desirable either for owner or slave for he have ascertain as a fact what be before only know to the learn as a theory and to practical man as a paradox that _ the pay of slave for they labor do actually produce a very great profit to they owner _ i have now prove -lrb- _ as far as the plan -lrb- 15 -rrb- of mr steele be concerned _ -rrb- my third proposition or _ the probability that emancipation would promote the interest of those who should adopt it _ but as i know of no other estate similarly circumstance with that of mr steele that be where emancipation have be try and where a detailed result of it have be make known i can not confirm it by other similar example i must have recourse therefore to some new species of proof now it be a old maxim as old as the day of pliny and columellum and confirm by dr adam smith and all the modern writer on political economy that _ the labor of free man be cheaper than the labor of slave _ if therefore i should be able to show that this maxim would be true if apply to all the operation and demand of west indian agriculture i should be able to establish my proposition on a new ground : for it require no great acuteness to infer that if it be cheaper to employ free man than slave in the cultivation of we island emancipation would be a profitable undertaking there i shall show then that the old maxim just mention be true when apply to the case in we own island first by establish the fact that _ free man _ people of color in the east indy be employ in _ precisely the same concern _ -lrb- the cultivation of the cane and the making of sugar -rrb- as the slave in the west and that they be employ _ at a cheaper rate _ the testimony of henry botham esq will be quite sufficient for this point that gentleman reside for some time in the east indy where he become acquaint with the business of a sugar estate in the year 1770 he quit the east for the west he object be to settle in the latter part of the world if it should be find desirable so to do for this purpose he visit all the west indian island both english and french in about two year he become during this time a planter though he do not continue long in this situation and he superintend also messr bosanquet ' and j fatio 's sugar-plantation in they partner ' absence finding at length the unprofitable way in which the west indian planter conduct they concern he return to the east indy in 1776 and establish sugar-works at bencoolen on he own account be in london in the year 1789 when a committee of privy council be sit to examine into the question of the slave trade he deliver a paper to the board on the mode of cultivate a sugar plantation in the east indy and this paper be think of great importance he be summon afterwards in 1791 by a committee of the house of common to be examine personally upon it it be very remarkable that the very first sentence in this paper announce the fact at once that sugar better and _ cheaper _ than that in the west indian island be produce _ by free man _ mr botham then explain the simple process of make sugar in the east a proprietor generally a dutchman use to let he estate say 300 acre or more with proper building upon it to a chinese who live upon it and superintend it and who re-let it to free man in parcel of 50 or 60 acre on condition that they should plant it in cane for so much for every pecul 133 lb of sugar produce this superintendant hire people from the adjacent village to take off he crop one lot of task-men with they cart and buffalo cut the cane carry they to the mill and ground they a second set boil they and a third clayed and basket they for market at so much per pecul thus the renter know with certainty what every pecul would cost he and he incur no unnecessary expense for when the crop be over the task-men return home by divide the labor in this manner it be better and cheaper do mr botham detail next the improve method of make sugar in batavium which we have not room to insert here we may just state however that the person concern in it never make spirit on the sugar estate the molasses and skimming be send for sale to batavium where one distillery might buy the produce of a hundred estate here again be a vast saving say mr botham there be not as in the west indy a _ distillery _ for _ each estate _ he then proceed to make a comparison between the agricultural system of the two country the cane be cultivate _ to the utmost perfection _ in batavium whereas the culture of it in the west indy be but _ in its infancy the hoe be scarcely use _ in the east whereas it be almost _ the sole implement _ in the west the _ plough be use instead of it in the east _ as far as it could be do young cane there be keep also often plough as a weeding and the hoe be keep to weed round the plant when very young but of this there be little need if the land have be sufficiently plough when the cane be ready to be earth up it be do by a _ sort of shovel _ make for the purpose _ two person _ with this instrument would earth up more cane in a day than _ ten negro _ with hoe the cane-root be also _ plough up _ in the east whereas they be _ dig up with the severest exertion _ in the west many alteration say mr botham be to be make and expense and human labor lessen in the west _ have experience the difference of labourer for profit and labourer from force _ i can assert that _ the savings by the former be very considerable _ he then point out other defect in the west indian management and they remedy i be of opinion say he that the west indian planter should for he own interest give more labor to beast and less to man a larger portion of he estate ought to be in pasture when practicable cane should be carry to the mill and cane top and grass to the stock in waggon the custom of make a hard-worked negro get a bundle of grass twice a day should be abolish and in short a _ total change take place in the miserable management in we west indian island _ by these means follow as near as possible the east indian mode and consolidate the distillery i do suppose we sugar-island might be better work than they now be by _ two-third _ or indeed _ one-half _ of the present force let it be consider how much labor be lose by the person _ oversee the forced labourer _ which be save when he work _ for he own profit _ i have state with the strictest veracity a plain matter of fact that sugar estate can _ be work cheaper by free man than by slave _ -lrb- 16 -rrb- i shall now show that the old maxim which have be mention be true when apply to the case of we west indian island by establish a fact of a very different kind viz that the slave in the west indy do much more work in a give time when _ they work for themselves _ than when _ they work for they master _ but how it will be say do you prove by establish this fact that it would be cheaper for we planter to employ free man than slave i answer thus : i maintain that _ while the slave be work for themselves _ they be to be consider indeed that they be _ bon fide free labourer _ in the first place they never have a driver with they on any of these occasion and in the second place _ have all they earnings to themselves _ they have that stimulus within they to excite industry which be only known _ to free man _ what be it i ask which give birth to industry in any part of the world see that labor be not agreeable to man but the stimulus arise from the hope of gain what make a english labourer do more work in the day than a slave but the stimulus arise from the knowledge that what he earn be _ for himself and not for another _ what again make a english labourer do much more work _ by the piece _ than by _ the day _ but the stimulus arise from the knowledge that he may gain more by the former than by the latter mode of work just so be the west indian slave situate when _ he be work for himself _ that be when he know _ that what he earn be for he own use _ he have then all the stimulus of a free man and he be therefore _ during such work _ -lrb- though unhappily no longer -rrb- really and in effect and to all intent and purpose as much _ a free labourer _ as any person in any part of the globe but if he be a free man while he be work for himself and if in that capacity he do twice or thrice more work than when he work for he master it follow that it would be cheaper for he master to employ he as a free labourer or that the labor of free man in the west indy would be cheaper than the labor of slave that west indian slave when they work for themselves do much more in a give time than when they work for they master be a fact so notorious in the west indy that no one who have be there would deny it look at long 's history of jamaica the privy council report gaisford 's essay on the good effect of the abolition of the slave trade and other book let we hear also what dr dickson the editor of mr steele and who reside so many year in barbado say on this subject for what he say be so admirably express that i can not help quote it the planter say he do not take the right way to make human being put forth they strength they apply main force where they should apply moral motive and punishment alone where reward should be judiciously intermix they first beslave they poor people with they cursed whip and then stand and wonder at the tremor of they nerve and the laxity of they muscle and yet strange to tell _ those very man affirm and affirm truly _ that a slave will do more work for himself _ in a afternoon _ than he can be make to do for he owner _ in a whole day or more _ and do not the whole assembly of grenada as we collect from the famous speech of mr pitt on the slave trade in 1791 affirm the same thing he -lrb- mr pitt -rrb- would show he say the futility of the argument of he honorable friend he -lrb- he honorable friend -rrb- have himself admit that it be in the power of the colony to correct the various abuse by which the negro population be restrain but they could not do this without _ improve the condition of they slave _ without make they _ approximate towards the rank of citizen _ without give they _ some little interest in they labor _ which would occasion they to work _ with the energy of man _ but now the assembly of grenada have themselves state that _ though _ the _ negro be allow the afternoon of only one day in every week they would do as much work in that afternoon when employ for they own benefit as in the whole day when employ in they master ' service _ now after this confession the house might burn all he calculation relative to the negro population for if this population have not quite reach the desirable state which he have point out this confession have prove that further supplies be not want a negro _ if he work for himself could do double work _ by a improvement then in the mode of labor the work in the island could be double but if so what would become of the argument of he honorable friend for then only half the number of the present labourer be necessary but the fact that the slave in the west indy do much more work for themselves in a give time than when they work for they master may be establish almost arithmetically if we will take the trouble of calculate from authentic document which present themselves on the subject it be surprising when we look into the evidence examine by the house of common on the subject of the slave trade to find how little a west indian slave really do when he work for he master and this be confess equally by the witness on both side of the question one of they -lrb- mr francklyn -rrb- say that a labor man could not get he bread in europe if he work no harder than a negro another -lrb- mr tobin -rrb- that no negro work like a day-labourer in england another -lrb- sir john dalling -rrb- that the general work of negro be not to be call labor a fourth -lrb- dr jackson -rrb- that a english labourer do three time as much work as a negro in the west indy now how be these expression to be reconcile with the common notion in england of negro labor for to work like a negro be a common phrase which be understand to convey the meaning that the labor of the negro be the most severe and intolerable that be know one of the witness however just mention explain the matter the hardship say he of negro field-labour be more in the _ mode _ than in the _ quantity _ do the slave see no end of he labor stand over the work and only throw the hoe to avoid the lash he appear to work without actually work the truth be that a negro have no interest in he work while work for he master will work only while the whip be upon he i can no where make out the clear net annual earnings of a field negro on a sugar plantation to come up to 8 l sterling now what do he earn in the course of a year when he be work for himself i dare not repeat what some of the witness for the planter state to the house of common when represent the enviable condition of the slave in the west indy for this would be to make he earn more for himself _ in one day _ than for he master _ in a week _ let we take then the lowest sum mention in the book of evidence this be state to be 14d sterling per week and 14d sterling per week would make 3 l sterling per year but how many day in the week do he work when he make such annual earnings the most time which any of the witness give to a field slave for he own private concern be every Sunday and also every Saturday afternoon in the week besides three holiday in the year but this be far from be the general account many of they say that he have only Sunday to himself and other that even Sunday be occasionally trespass upon by he master it appear also that even where the afternoon be give he it be only out of crop-time now let we take into the account the time lose by slave in go backwards and forwards to they provision-grounds for though some of these be describe as be only a stone 's throw from they hut other be describe as be one and two and three and even four mile off and let we take into the account also that Sunday be by the confession of all the negro market day on which alone they can dispose of they own produce and that the market itself may be from one to ten or fifteen mile from they home and that they who go there can not be work in they garden at the same time and we shall find that there can not be on a average more than a clear three quarter of a day in the week which they can call they own and in which they can work for themselves but call it a whole day if you please and you will find that the slave do for himself in this one day more than a third of what he do for he master in six or that he work _ more than three time harder _ when _ he work for himself _ than when _ he work for he master _ i have now show first by the evidence of mr botham and secondly by the fact of negro earn more in a give time when they work in they own garden than when they work in they master 's service that the old maxim of _ its be cheaper to employ free man than slave _ be true when apply to the _ operation and demand of west indian agriculture _ but if it be cheaper to employ free man than slave in the west indy then they who should emancipate they negro there would _ promote they interest by so do _ but hold say a objector we allow that they successor would be benefit but not the _ emancipator themselves _ these would have a great sacrifice to make they slave be worth so much money at this moment but they would lose all this value if they be to set they free i reply and indeed i have all along affirm that it be not propose to emancipate the slave _ at once _ but to prepare they for emancipation _ in a course of year _ mr steele do not make he slave _ entirely free _ they be _ copyhold-bond slave _ they be still _ he freehold property _ : and they would if he have live have continue so for many year they therefore who should emancipate would lose nothing of the value of they slave so long as they bring they only to the door of liberty but do not allow they to pass through it but suppose they be to allow they to pass through it and thus admit they to freedom they would lose nothing by so do for they would not admit they to freedom till _ after a certain period of year during which _ i contend that the _ value of every individual slave _ would have be _ reimburse _ to they from _ the increase income of they estate _ mr steele as we have see _ more than triple _ the value of he income during he experiment : i believe that he more than quadruple it for he say that he more than triple it _ besides increase he stock _ and _ lay out large sum annually in add necessary work _ and _ in repair of the damage by the great hurricane _ suppose then a west indium estate to yield at this moment a nett income of 500 l per annum this income would be increase accord to mr steele 's experience to somewhere about 1700 l per annum would not then the surplus beyond the original 500 l viz 1200 l per annum be sufficient to reimburse the proprietor in a few year for the value of every slave which he have when he begin he plan of emancipation but he would be reimburse again that be -lrb- twice over on the whole for every individual slave -rrb- from a new source viz _ the improve value of he land _ it be a fact well know in the united state that a certain quantity of land or farm in full cultivation by free man will fetch twice more money than the same quantity of land similarly circumstance in full cultivation by slave let we suppose now that the slave at present on any west indian plantation be worth about as much as the land with the building upon it to which they be attach and that the land with the building upon it would rise to double its former value when cultivate by free man it follow that the land and building alone would be worth as much then that be when work by free labourer as the land building and slave together be worth at the present time i have now i think pretty well canvass the subject and i shall therefore hasten to a conclusion and first i ask the west indian whether they think that they will be allow to carry on they present cruel system the arbitrary use of the whip and the chain and the brutal debasement of they fellow-creature _ for ever _ i say no i entertain better hope of the humanity and justice of the british people i be sure that they will interfere and that when they _ once take up the cause _ they _ will never abandon it till they have obtain they object _ and what be it after all that i have be propose in the course of the precede page two thing only viz that the law relate to the slave may be revise by the british parliament so that they may be make -lrb- as it be always intend -rrb- _ to accord with and not to be repugnant to _ the principle of the british constitution and that when such a revision shall have take place the slave may be put into _ a state of preparation for emancipation _ and for such a emancipation only as may be compatible with the joint interest of the master and the slave be there any thing unreasonable in this proposition be it unreasonable to desire that those law should be repeal which be contrary to the law of god or that the african and they descendant who have the shape image intellect feeling and affection of man should be treat as human being the measure then which i have be propose be _ not unreasonable _ i trust it _ would not be injurious _ to the interest of the west indian themselves these be at present it be say in great distress and so they have be for year and so they will still be -lrb- and moreover they will be get worse and worse -rrb- _ so long as they continue slavery _ how can such a wicked such a ill-framed system succeed have not the almighty in he moral government of the world stamp a character upon human action and give such a turn to they operation that the balance should be ultimately in favor of virtue have he not take from those who act wickedly the power of discerning the right path or have he not so confound they faculty that they be for ever frustrate they own scheme it be only to know the practice of we planter to be assure that it will bring on difficulty after difficulty and loss after loss till it will end in ruin if a man be to sit down and to try to invent a ruinous system of agriculture could he devise one more to he mind than that which they have be in the habit of use let we look at some of the more striking part of this system the first that stare we in the face be the unnatural and destructive practice of _ force labor _ here we see man work without any rational stimulus to elicit they exertion and therefore they must be follow by driver with whip in they hand well might it be say by mr botham to the committee of privy-council and house of common let it be consider how much labor be lose by the person oversee the force labourer which be save when he work for he own profit and notwithstanding all the vigilance and whipping of these driver i have prove that the slave do more for themselves in a afternoon than in a whole day when they work for they master it be doubtless the conviction that _ force labor be unprofitable _ as well as that there would be less of human suffering which make mr steele take away the whip from he driver as _ the very first step necessary _ in he improved system or as the _ sine qu non _ without which such a system could not properly be begin and do not this very measure _ alter the face of he affair in point of profit in three year after it have be put into operation _ and here it must be observe that if ever emancipation should be begin by we planter this must be -lrb- however they may dislike to part with arbitrary power -rrb- as much a first step with they as it be with mr steele _ force labor _ stand at the head of the catalogue of those nuisance belong to slavery which oppose the planter 's gain it must be remove before any thing else can be do see what mischief it lead to independently of its want of profit it be impossible that force labor can be keep up from day to day without injury to the constitution of the slave and if they health be injure the property of they master must be injure also force labor again send many of they to the sick-house here be at any rate a loss of they work time but it drive they also occasionally to run away and sometimes to destroy themselves here again be a loss of they work time and of property into the bargain _ force labor _ then be one of those striking part in the west indian husbandry in which we see a _ constant source of loss _ to those who adopt it and may we not speak and yet with truth as unfavourably of some of the other striking part in the same system what shall we say first to that injurious disproportion of the article of croppage with the want of the estate which make little or no provision of food for the labourer -lrb- _ the very first to be care for _ -rrb- but leave these to be feed by article to be buy three thousand mile off in another country let the market there be ever so high or the price ever so unfavourable at the time what shall we say again to that obstinate and ruinous attachment to old custom in consequence of which even acknowledge improvement be almost forbid to be receive how generally have the introduction of the plough be oppose in the west indy though both the historian of jamaica have recommend the use of it and though it have be prove that _ one plough _ with _ two set of horse _ to relieve each other would turn up as much land _ in a day as one hundred negro _ could with they hoe be not the hoe also continue in earth up the cane there when mr botham prove more than thirty year ago that _ two _ man would do more with the east indian shovel at that sort of work in a day than _ ten _ negro with the former instrument so much for _ unprofitable instrument _ of husbandry a few word now on _ unprofitable mode of employment _ it seem first little less than infatuation to make negro carry basket of dung upon they head basket after basket to the field i do not mention this so much as a intolerable hardship upon those who have to perform it as a improvident waste of strength and time why be not horse or mule or ox and cart or other vehicle of convenience use oftener on such occasion i may notice also that cruel and most disadvantageous mode of employment of make negro collect grass for the cattle by pick it by the hand blade by blade be no artificial grass to be find in we island and be the existence of the scythe unknown there but it be of no use to dwell longer upon this subject the whole system be a ruinous one from the begin to the end and from whence do such a system arise it have its origin in _ slavery _ alone it be practice no where but in the land of ignorance and slavery slavery indeed or rather the despotism which support slavery have no compassion and it be one of its characteristic _ never to think of spare the sinew of the wretched creature call a slave _ hence it be slow to adopt help with which a beneficent providence have furnish we by give to man a inventive faculty for ease he burthen or by submit the beast of the field to he dominion and he use and it fly to expedient which be contrary to nature and reason how then can such a system ever answer be a english farmer to have recourse to such a system he would not be able to pay he rent for a single year if the planter then be in distress it be they own fault they may however thank the abolitionist that they be not worse off than they be at present the abolition of the slave trade by cut off the purchase of new slave have cut off one cause of they ruin -lrb- 17 -rrb- and it be only the abolition _ of slavery which can yet save they _ have the planter when the slave trade be abolish take immediate measure to meet the change have they then revise they law and substitute better have they then put they slave into a state of preparation for emancipation in what a different that be desirable situation would they have be at this moment in fact _ nothing can save they but the abolition of slavery on a wise and prudent plan _ they can no more expect without it to meet the present low price of colonial produce than the british farmer can meet the present low price of grain unless he can have a abatement of rent tithe and taxation and unless he present poor rate can be diminish also take away however from the planter the use and practice of slavery and the hour of _ they regeneration _ would be begin can we doubt that providence would then bless they endeavor and that _ salvation _ from they difficulty would be they portion in the end it have appear i hope by this time that what i have be propose be not unreasonable and that so far from be injurious to the interest of the planter it would be highly advantageous to they i shall now show that i do not ask for the introduction of a more humane system into we colony _ at a time when it would be improper to grant it _ or that no fair objection can be raise against the _ present moment _ as _ the fit era _ from whence the measure in contemplation should commence there be indeed a time when the planter might have offer something like a excuse for the severity of they conduct towards they slave on the plea that the greater part of they then in the colony be _ african-born _ or _ stranger _ and that cargo be constantly pour in one after the other consist of the same sort of being or of _ stubborn ferocious people never accustom to work whose spirit it be necessary to break _ and _ whose neck to force down to the yoke _ and that this could only be effect by the whip the chain the iron collar and other instrument of the kind but _ now _ no such plea can be offer it be now sixteen year since the slave trade be abolish by england and it be therefore to be presume that no new slave have be import into the british colony within that period the slave therefore who be there at this day must consist either of african whose spirit must have be long ago broken or of creole bear in the cradle and bring up in the trammel of slavery what argument then can be produce for the continuation of a barbarous discipline there and we be very glad to find that two gentleman both of whom we have have occasion to quote before bear we out in this remark mr steele speaking of some of the old cruel law of barbado apply they to the case before we in these word : -- as accord to ligon 's account there be not above two-third of the island in plantation in the year 1650 we must suppose that in the year 1688 the great number of _ african-born _ slave bring into the plantation in chain and compel to labor by the terror of corporal punishment might have make it appear necessary to enact a temporary law so harsh as the statute no 82 but when the _ great majority _ of the negro be become _ vernacular bear in the island naturalized by language _ and _ familiarise by custom _ do not _ policy _ as well as humanity require : they _ to be put under milder condition _ such as be grant to the slave of we saxon ancestor colonel malenfant speak the same sentiment in defend he plan which he offer to the french government for st domingo in 1814 against the vulgar prejudice that where you employ negro you must of necessity use slavery he deliver himself thus : -- -lrb- 18 -rrb- if all the negro on a plantation have not be more than six month out of africa or if they have the same idea concern a independent manner of life as the indian or the savage of guiana i should consider my plan to be impracticable i should then say that coercion would be necessary : but ninety-nine out of every hundred negro in st domingo be aware that they can not obtain necessaries without work they know that it be they duty to work and they be even desirous of work but the remembrance of they cruel suffering in the time of slavery render they suspicious we may conclude then that if a cruel discipline be _ not necessary _ in the year 1790 and 1794 to which these gentleman allude when there must have be _ some thousand of newly import african _ both in st domingo and in the english colony it can not be necessary _ now _ when there have be no importation into the latter for _ fifteen year _ there can be no excuse then for the english planter for not alter they system and this _ immediately _ it be on the other hand a great reproach to they consider the quality and character of they slave _ that they should not of themselves have come forward on the subject before this time _ see then that nothing have be do where it ought it be the duty of the abolitionist to _ resume they labor _ if through the medium of the abolition of the slave trade they have not accomplish as they expect the whole of they object they have no alternative but to resort to _ other measure _ or to attempt by constitutional means under that legislature which have already sanction they effort the mitigation of the cruel treatment of the negro with the ultimate view of extinguish in due time and in a suitable manner the slavery itself nor ought any time to be lose in make such a attempt for it be a melancholy fact that there be scarcely any increase of the slave population in we island at the present moment what other proof need we require _ of the severity of the slavery there and of the necessity of its mitigation _ severe punishment want of sufficient food labor extract by the whip and a system of prostitution conspire _ almost as much as ever _ to make inroad upon the constitution of the slave and to prevent they increase and let it be remember here that any former defect of this kind be supply by importation but that importation be _ now unlawful _ unless therefore the abolitionist interfere and that soon we west indian planter may come to parliament and say we have now try you experiment it have not answer you must therefore give we leave to go again to the coast of africa for slave there be also another consideration worthy of the attention of the abolitionist viz that _ a public attempt _ make in england to procure the abolition of _ slavery _ would very much promote they original object the cause of the abolition of the slave trade for foreign court have greatly doubt we sincerity as to the latter measure and have therefore be very backward in give we they assistance in it if england say they abolish the slave trade _ from moral motive _ how happen it _ that she continue slavery _ but if this _ public attempt _ be to succeed then the abolitionist would see they wish in a direct train for completion : for if slavery be to fall in the british island this event would occasion death in a give time and without strike any further blow to the execrable trade in every part of the world because those foreigner who should continue slavery no longer able to compete in the market with those who should employ free man must abandon the slave trade altogether but here perhaps the planter will say what right have the people of england to interfere with we property which would be the case if they be to attempt to abolish slavery the people of england might reply that they have as good a right as you the planter have to interfere with that most precious of all property _ the liberty of you slave _ see that _ you hold they by no right that be not oppose to nature reason justice and religion _ the people of england have no desire to interfere with you _ property _ but with you _ oppression _ it be probable that you property would be improve by the change but to examine this right more minutely i contend first that they have always a right to interfere in behalf of humanity and justice wherever they appeal can be hear i contend secondly that they have a more immediate right to interfere in the present case because the oppressed person in question living in the british dominion and under the british government be _ they fellow subject _ i contend again that they have this right upon the ground that they be give you the west indian _ a monopoly _ for they sugar by buy it from you exclusively _ at a much dearer rate _ than _ they can get it from other quarter _ surely they have a right to say to you as customer for you produce change you system and we will continue to deal with you but if you will not change it we will buy we sugar elsewhere or we will not buy sugar at all the east indian market be open to we and we prefer sugar that be not stain with blood nay we will petition parliament to take off the surplus duty with which east indian sugar be load on you account what superior claim have you either upon parliament or upon we that you should have the preference as to the east indian they be as much the subject of the british empire as yourselve as to the east indium company they support all they establishment both civil and military at they own expense they come to we treasury for nothing while you with naval station and a extraordinary military force keep up for no other purpose than to keep in awe a injured population and with heavy bounty on the exportation of you sugar put we to such a expense as make we doubt whether you trade be worth have on its present term they the east indium company again have be a blessing to the native with whom they have be concern they distribute a equal system of law and justice to all without respect of person they dispell the cloud of ignorance superstition and idolatry and carry with they civilization and liberty wherever they go you on the other hand have no code of justice but for yourselve you _ deny it _ to those who _ can not help themselves _ you _ hinder liberty _ by you cruel restriction on manumission and dread the inlet of light _ you study to perpetuate ignorance and barbarism _ which then of the two competitor have the claim to preference by a english parliament and a english people it may probably soon become a question with the latter whether they will consent to pay a million annually more for west indium sugar than for other of like quality or which be the same thing whether they will allow themselves to be _ tax annually to the amount of a million sterling to support west indian slavery _ i shall now conclude by say that i leave it and that i recommend it to other to add to the light which i have endeavor to furnish on this subject by collect new fact relative to emancipation and the result of it in other part of the world as well as relative to the superiority of free over servile labor in order that the west indian may be convince if possible that they would be benefit by the change of system which i propose they must already know both by past and present experience that the way of unrighteousness be not profitable let they not doubt when the almighty have decree the balance in favor of virtuous action that they effort under the new system will work together for they good so that they temporal redemption may be at hand the end print by richard taylor shoe-lane
