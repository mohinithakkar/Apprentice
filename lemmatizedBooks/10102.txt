i exclaimed anything that interest we yes signore reply the tall thin italian consular-clerk speak with a strong accent a english steam yacht run aground on the melorium about ten mile out and be discover by a fishing-boat who bring the news to harbor the admiral send out two torpedo-boat which manage after a lot of difficulty to bring in the yacht safely but the captain of the port have a suspicion that the crew be try to make away with the vessel to lose she you mean the faithful francesco whose english have mostly be acquire from sea-faring man and be not the choicest vocabulary nod and true tuscan that he be place he finger upon he closed lip indicative of silence sound curious i remark since the consul go away on leave thing seem to have be hum -- two stab affray eight drunken seaman lock up a mutiny on a tramp steamer and now a yacht be cast away -- a fairly decent list and yet some stay-at-home people complain that british consul be only pay to be ornamental they should spend a week here at leghorn and they would soon alter they opinion yes they would signore respond the thin-faced old fellow with a grin as he twist he fierce gray mustache francesco carduccus be a well-known character in leghorn interpreter to the consulate and keeper of a sailor 's home a honest good-hearted easy-going fellow who for twenty year have occupy the same position under half a dozen different consul at that moment however there come from the outer office a long-drawn moan hulloa what be that i enquired startle only a mad stoker off the _ oleander _ signora the captain have bring he for you to see they want to send he back to he friend at newcastle oh a case of madness i exclaimed better get doctor ridolfus to see he i be not a expert on mental disease my old friend frank hutcheson he britannic majesty 's vice-consul at the port of leghorn be away on leave in england he duty be relegate to young bertram cavendish the pro-consul the latter however have go down with a bad touch of malaria which he have pick up in the deadly maremma and i as the only other englishman in leghorn have be ask by the consul-general in florence to act as pro-consul until hutcheson 's return it be in mid-july and the weather be blaze in the glare sun-blanched mediterranean town if you know leghorn you probably know the consulate with its black and yellow escutcheon outside a large handsome suite of huge airy office face the cathedral and overlook the principal piazza which be as big as trafalgar square and much more picturesque the legend paint upon the door office hour 10 to 3 and the green persienne close against the scorching sun give one the idea of a easy appointment but such be certainly not the case for a consul 's life at a port of discharge must necessarily be a very active one and he duty never-ending carduccus have leave I to the correspondence for half a hour or so and i confess i be in no mood to write reply in that stifle heat therefore i sit at the consul 's big table smoking a cigarette and stretch lazily in my friend 's chair resolve to escape to the cool of england as soon as he return in the follow week italy be all very well for nine month in the year but leghorn be no place for the englishman in mid-july my thought be wander toward the english lake and a bit of grouse-shooting with my uncle up in scotland when the faithful francesco re-enter say -- i have send the captain and he madman away till this afternoon signora but there be a english signora wait to see you who be he i do not know he he will give no name but want to see the signor console all right show he in i say lazily and a few moment later a tall smartly-dressed middle-aged englishman in a navy serge yachting suit enter and bow enquire whether i be the british consul when he have seat himself i explain my position whereupon he say -- i could not make much out of you clerk he speak so brokenly and i do not know a word of italian but perhaps i ought to first introduce myself my name be philip hornby and he hand I a card bear the name with the address woodcroft park somerset ------ brook 's then he add : i be cruise on board my yacht the _ lolum _ and last night we unfortunately go aground on the melorium i have a new captain whom i engage a few month ago and he seem a arrant fool very fortunately for we a fishing-boat see we plight and give the alarm at port the admiral send out two torpedo-boat and a tug and after about three hour they manage to get we off and you be now in harbor yes but the reason i have call be to ask you to do I a favor and write I a letter of thanks in italian to the admiral and one to the captain of the port -- polite letter that i can copy and send to they you know the kind of thing certainly i reply the more interested in he on account of the curious suspicion that the port authority seem to entertain he be evidently a gentleman and after i have be with he ten minute i scout the idea that he have endeavor to cast away the _ lolum _ i take down a couple of sheet of paper and scribble the draft of two letter couch in the most elegant phraseology as be customary when address italian officialdom fortunately i leave my wife in england or she would have be terribly frighten he remark presently there be a nasty wind blow all night and the fool of a captain seem to add to we peril by every order he give you be alone then i have a friend with I be the answer and how many of the crew be there sixteen all tell english i suppose not all i find french and italian be more sober than english and better behave in port i examine he critically as he sit face I and the mere fact of he desire to send thanks to the authority convince I that he be a well-bred gentleman he be about forty-five with a merry round good-natured face red with the southern sun blue eye and a short fair beard he countenance be essentially that of a man devote to open-air sport for it be slightly furrow and weather-beaten as a true yachtsman 's should be he speech be refine and cultivate and as we chat he give I the impression that as a enthusiastic lover of the sea he have cruise the mediterranean many time from gibraltar up to smyrna he have however never before put into leghorn after we have arrange that he captain should come to I in the afternoon and make a formal report of the accident we go out together across the white sunny piazza to nasus 's the well-known pastry-cook 's where it be the habit of the livornese to take they ante-luncheon vermouth the more i saw of hornby the more i like he he be chatty and witty and treated he accident as a huge joke we shall be here quite a week i suppose he say as we be take we vermouth we be on we way down to the greek island as my friend chater want to see they the engineer say there be something strain that we must get mend but by the way he add why do not you dine with we on board to-night do we can give you a few english thing that may be a change to you this invitation i gladly accept for two reason one be because the suspicion of the captain of the port have arouse my curiosity and the other be because i have honestly speak take a great fancy to hornby the captain of the _ lolum _ a short thickset scotsman from dundee with a barely heal cicatrice across he left cheek call at the consulate at two o'clock and make he report which appear to I to be a very lame one he strike I as be unworthy he certificate for he be evidently entirely out of he bearing when the accident occur the owner and he friend chater be in they berth asleep when suddenly he discover that the vessel be make no headway they have in fact run upon the dangerous shoal without be aware of it a strong sea be run with a stiff breeze and although he seamanship be poor he be capable enough to recognize at once that they be in a very perilous position very fortunate it be not more serious sir he add after tell I he story which i write at he dictation for the ultimate benefit of the board of trade do not you send up signal of distress i inquire no sir -- never think of it and yet you know that you might be lose i remark with recur suspicion the canny scot whose name be mackintosh hesitate a few moment then answer -- well sir you see the fishing-boat have sight we and we see she turn back to port to fetch help he excuse be a neat one probably it be he neglect to make signal of distress that have arouse the suspicion of the captain of the port from first to last the story of the master of the _ lolum _ be i consider a very unsatisfactory one how long have you be in mr hornby 's service i inquire six month sir be the man 's reply before he engage I i be with the wilson of hull run up the baltic as master i have hold my master 's certificate these fifteen year sir i be with the bibby before the wilson and before that with the general steam i do eight year in the mediterranean with they when i be chief mate and you have never be into leghorn before never sir i dismiss the captain with a distinct impression that he have not tell I the whole truth that cicatrice do not improve he personal appearance he have leave he certificate on board he say but if i wish he would bring they to I on the morrow be it possible that a attempt have actually be make to cast away the yacht and that it have be frustrate by the master of the felucca who have sight the vessel aground there certainly seem some mystery surround the circumstance and my interest in the yacht and its owner deepen each hour how i wonder have the captain receive that very ugly wound across the cheek i be half-inclined to inquire of he but on reflection decide that it be best to betray no undue curiosity that evening when the fiery sun be sink in its crimson glory bathing the glassy sea with its blood-red light and cause the island of gorgona and capraja to loom forth a deep purple against the distant horizon i take a cab along the old sea-road to the port where within the inner harbor i find the _ lolum _ one of the most magnificent private vessel i have ever see she dimension surprise I she be paint dead white with shine brass everywhere at the stern hung limply the british flag while at the masthead the ensign of the royal yacht squadron the yellow funnel emit no smoke and as she lay calmly in the sunset a crowd of dock-lounger and crimp lean upon the parapet discuss she merit and wonder who could be the rich englishman who could afford to travel in a small liner of he own -- for she size surprise even those italian dock-hand use as they be to see every kind of craft enter the busy port on step on deck hornby who like myself wear a clean suit of white linen as the most sensible dinner-garb in a hot climate come forward to greet I and take I along to the stern where lie in a long wicker deck-chair beneath the awning be a tall dark-eyed clean-shaven man of about forty also dress in cool white linen he keen face give one the impression that he be a barrister my friend hylton chater -- mr gordon gregg he say introduce we and then when as we shake hand the clean-shaven man exclaim smile pleasantly -- glad to make you acquaintance mr gregg you be not a stranger by any means to hornby or myself indeed we have get a couple of you book on board but i have no idea you live out here at ardenza i say three mile along the sea-shore to-morrow i hope you 'll both come and dine with I delighted i be sure declare hornby to eat ashore be quite a treat when one have be box up on board for some time so we 'll accept will not we hylton certainly reply the other and then we begin chat about the peril of the previous night hornby tell I how he have copy the two letter of thanks in italian and send they to they respective address phil blaspheme like a levant skipper when he copy those italian word laugh chater he have make three copy of each letter before he could get all the lingo in accordance with you copy i have be the whole afternoon at they -- confound they declare the owner of the _ lolum _ with a laugh but of course i do not want to make a lot of error in spell these italian be so very punctilious well you certainly do the right thing to thank the admiral i say it be very unusual for he to send out torpedo-boat to help a vessel in distress that be generally leave to the harbor tug yes i feel that it be most kind of he that be why i take all the trouble to write i do not understand a word of italian neither do chater but you have italian on board i remark the two sailor who row I out be genoese from they accent hornby and chater exchange glance -- glance of distinct uneasiness i think then the owner of the _ lolum _ say -- yes they be useful for make arrangement and buy thing in italian port we have a spaniard a greek and a syrian all of whom act as interpreter in different place and make a handsome thing in the way of secret commission i suppose i laugh of course but to cruise in comfort one must pay and be pleasant declare the man with the fair beard in greece and the levant they be more rapacious than in naple and the custom officer always want square otherwise they be for ever rummage and discover mare ' nest do you have any trouble here i inquire they do not visit we he say with a smile and at the same time he rub he thumb and finger together the action of feel paper money this increase my surprise for i happen to know that the leghorn custom officer be not at all give to the acceptance of bribe they be too well watch by they superior if the yacht have really escape a search then it be a most unusual thing besides what motive could hornby have in elude the custom visit they would of course seal up he wine and liquor but even if they do they would leave he out sufficient for the consumption of himself and he friend no philip hornby have some strong motive in pay a heavy bribe to avoid the visit of the _ dogana _ if he really have pay he must have pay very heavily of that i be convince be it possible that some mystery be hide on board that splendidly appoint craft presently the gong sound and we go below into the elegantly fit saloon where be spread a table that sparkle with cut glass and shone with silver around the center fresh flower have be trail by some artistic hand while on the buffet at the end the neck of wine bottle peer out from the ice pail both carpet and upholstery be in pale blue while everywhere it be apparent that none but a extremely wealthy man could afford such a magnificent craft hornby take the head of the table and we sit on either side of he chat merrily while we eat one of the choicest and best cook dinner it have ever be my lot to taste chater and i drink wine of a brand which only a millionaire could keep in he cellar while we host apparently a most abstemious man take only a glass of iced cinciano water the two smart steward serve in a manner which show they to be well train to they duty and as the evening light filter through the pale blue silk curtain over the open port-hole slowly fade we gossip on as man will gossip over a unusually good dinner from he remark i discern that contrary to my first impression hylton chater be a experienced yachtsman he own a craft call the _ alicium _ and be a member of the cork yacht club he live in london he tell I but give I no information as to he profession it might be the law as i have surmise you have see we ass of a captain mr gregg he remark presently what do you think of he well i say rather hesitatingly to tell the truth i do not think very much of he seamanship -- nor will the board of trade when he report reach they ah exclaim hornby i be a fool to engage he from the very first i mistrust he only my wife somehow take a fancy to the fellow and as you know if you want peace you must always please the woman in this case however she choice almost cost I the vessel and perhaps we life into the bargain you know nothing of he previously nothing and he engage the crew i ask of course be they all fresh hand all except the cook and the two steward i be silent i do not like mackintosh indeed i entertain a distinct suspicion of both master and crew the captain seem to have have a nasty cut across the cheek i remark whereupon my two companion again exchange quick apprehensive glance he fall down the other day explain chater with a rather sickly smile i think he face catch the edge of a iron stair in the engine-room and cause a nasty gash i smile within myself for i know too well that the ugly wound in the captain 's face have never be inflict by fall on the edge of a stair but i remain silent be content that they should endeavor to mislead I after dessert have be serve we rise and in the summer twilight when all the port be open hornby take I over the vessel everywhere be abundant luxury -- a veritable float palace to each of the cabin of the owner and he guest a bathroom be attach with sea-water or fresh water as desire while the lady ' saloon the boudoir the library and the smoking-room be furnished richly with exquisite taste as he be conduct I from he own cabin to the boudoir we pass a door that have be blow open by the wind and which he hasten to close not however before i have time to glance within to my surprise i discover that it be a armory cram with rifle revolver and ammunition it have not be intend that i should see that interior and the reason why the custom officer have be bribe be now apparent i pass on without remark make believe that i have not discern anything unusual and we enter the boudoir chater have go back to the saloon to obtain cigar the dainty little chamber be upholster in carnation-pink silk with furniture of inlaid rosewood and bear everywhere the trace of have be arrange by a woman 's hand although no lady passenger be on board just as we have enter and i be admire the dainty nest of luxury chater shout to he host ask for the key of the cigar cupboard and hornby excuse himself turn back along the gangway to hand they to he friend thus leave I alone for a few moment i stand glance around and as i do so my eye fall upon a quantity of photograph frame and unframed that be scatter about -- evidently portrait of hornby 's friend upon a small side table however stand a heavy oxidize silver frame but empty while lie on the floor beneath a couch be the photograph it have contain which have apparently be take hastily out tear first in half and then in half again and cast away curiosity prompt I to stoop pick up the four piece and place they together when i find they to form the cabinet portrait of a sweet-looking and extremely pretty english girl of eighteen or nineteen with a bright smile expression and wear a fresh morning blouse of white piqué she hair be dress low and fasten with a bow of black ribbon while the brooch at she throat be in the form of a heart edge with pearl whether it be she sweet expression or whether the curious look in she eye have attract my attention and rivet the face upon my memory i know not perhaps it be the mystery of why it should have be so hastily tear from its frame and destroy that hold my attention it seem as though it have be tear up surreptitiously by someone who have be sit on that couch and who have have no opportunity of cast the fragment away through the port-hole into the water i look at the back of the tear photograph and see that it have be take by a well-known and fashionable firm in new bond street about the expression of that picture face be something which i can not describe -- a curious look in the eye which be at the same time both attractive and mysterious in that brief moment the girl 's feature be indelibly impressed upon my memory next second however hear hornby 's return footstep i flung the fragment hastily beneath the couch where i have discover they why i wonder have the picture be destroy -- and by whom the face of the empty frame have be purposely turn towards the panelling therefore when he enter he do not notice that the picture have be destroy but after a brief pause explain that that cosy little place be he wife 's particular nook he conduct I on through the lady ' saloon and afterwards on deck where we fling ourselves into the long chair take we coffee and certosina that liqueur essentially tuscan and smoke on as the moon rise and the light of the harbor begin to twinkle in the steely night as i sit talk my thought run back to that tear photograph to I it seem as though some previous visitor that day have sit upon the couch destroy the picture and cast it where i have find it but for what reason who be the merry-faced girl whose picture have arouse such jealousy or revenge i purposely lead the conversation to hornby 's family and learn from he that he have no child you 'll get the repair to you engine do at orlando 's i suppose i remark name the great shipbuilding firm of leghorn yes i have already give the order they be contract to be finish by next Thursday and then we shall be off to zante and chio for what reason i wonder recollect that formidable armory on board already i have see quite sufficient to convince I that the _ lolum _ although outwardly a pleasure yacht be build of steel armored in its most vulnerable part and capable of resist a very sharp fire the hour pass and beneath the brilliant moon we smoke long into the night for after the blaze sunshine of that tuscan town the cool sea-wind at night be very refreshing from where we sit we command a view of the whole of the sea-front of leghorn and ardenza with its bright open-air café-concert and restaurant in full swing -- all the life and gayety of that popular watering-place presently when hornby have rise to call a steward and leave I alone with hylton chater the latter whisper to I in confidence -- if you find my friend hornby a little bit strange in he manner mr gregg you must take no notice to tell the truth he be a man who have become suddenly wealthy beyond the wildest dream of avarice and i fear it have have a effect upon he brain he do very queer thing at time i look at my companion in surprise he be either tell the truth or else he be endeavor to allay my suspicion by a extremely clever ruse now i have already decide that philip hornby be no eccentric but a particularly level-headed and practical man therefore i instantly arrive at the conclusion that the clean-shaven fellow who look so much like a london barrister have some distinct and ulterior purpose in arouse within my mind suspicion of he host 's sanity it be past midnight when have bid the strange pair adieu i be put ashore by the two sailor who have row I out and drive home along the sea-front puzzle and perplex next morning on my arrival at the consulate old francesco who have enter only a moment before meet I with blanch face gasp -- there have be thief here in the night signora the signor console 's safe have be open the safe i cry dash into hutcheson 's private room and find to my dismay the big safe wherein the seal cipher and other confidential document be keep stand open and the contents in disorder as though a hasty search have be make among they be it possible that the thief have be after the admiralty and foreign office cipher copy of which the chancellery of certain european power be ever endeavor to obtain i smile within myself when i realize how bitterly disappoint the burglar must have be for a british consul when he go on leave to england always take he cipher with he and deposit they at the foreign office for safekeep hutcheson have of course take he accord to the regulation curiously enough however the door of the consulate and the safe have be open with the key which my friend have leave in my charge indeed the small bunch still remain in the safe door in a instant the recollection flash across my mind that i have feel the key in my pocket while at dinner on board the _ lolum _ have i lose they on my homeward drive or have my pocket be pick carduccus with a italian 's volubility commence to hurl imprecation upon the head of the unknown son of dog who dare to tamper with he master 's safe and while we be engage in put the scatter papers in order the door-bell ring and the clerk go to attend to the caller in a few moment he return say -- the english yacht leave suddenly last night signora and the captain of the port have send to inquire whether you know to what port she be bind left i gasp in amazement why i think she engine be disabled a quarter of a hour later i be sit in the private office of the shrewd gray-haired functionary who have send this messenger to I do you know signor commendatore he say some mystery surround that vessel she be not the _ lolum _ for yesterday we telegraph to lloyd 's in london and this morning i receive a reply that no such yacht appear on they register and that the name be unknown the police have also telegraph to you english police inquire about the owner signor hornby with a like result there be no such place as woodcroft park in somerset and no member of brook 's club of the name of hornby i sit stare at the official too amaze to utter a word certainly they have not allow the grass to grow beneath they foot unfortunately the telegraphic reply from england be only to hand this morning he go on because just before two o'clock this morning the harbor police whom i specially order to watch the vessel see a boat come to the wharf contain a man and woman the pair be put ashore and walk away into the town the woman seem to walk with considerable difficulty the boat return and a hour after to the complete surprise of the two detective steam be suddenly get up and the yacht turn and go straight out to sea leave the man and the woman leave they of course they be probably still in the town the police be now search for trace of they but could not you have detain the vessel i suggest of course have i but known i could have forbid she departure but as she owner have present himself at the consulate and be recognize as a respectable person i feel that i could not interfere without some tangible information -- and that alas have come too late the vessel be a swift one and have already seven hour start of we i have ask the admiral to send out a couple of torpedo-boat after she but unfortunately this be impossible as the flotilla be sail in a hour to attend the naval review at spezium i tell he how the consul 's safe have be open during the night and he sit listen with wide-open eye you dine with they last night he say at last they may have surreptitiously steal you key they may be my answer probably they do but with what motive the captain of the port elevate he shoulder exhibit he palm and declare -- the whole affair from begin to end be a complete and profound mystery chapter ii why the safe be open that day be a active one in questura or police office of leghorn detective call examine the safe and sagely declare it to be burglar-proof have not the thief possess the key the foreign office know that for they supply all the safe to the consulate abroad in order that the precious cipher shall be keep from the prying eye of foreign spy the questore or chief of police be of opinion that it be the cipher of which the thief have be in search and be much relieved to hear that they be in safekeep far away in down street he conjecture be the same as my own namely that the reason of hornby 's call upon I be to ascertain the situation of the consulate and the whereabouts of the safe which by the way stand in a corner of the consul 's private room captain mackintosh too have take he bearing and probably while i sit at dinner on board the _ lolum _ my key have be steal and pass on to the scar scotsman who have promptly go ashore and ransack the place while i have remain with he master smoking and unsuspicious but what be the motive why have they ransack all those confidential papers my own idea be that they be not in search of the cipher at all but either want some blank form or other or else they desire to make use of the consular seal the latter however still remain on the floor near the safe as though it have roll out and be leave unheeded as far as francesco and i could ascertain nothing whatever have be take therefore we re-arrange the papers re-lock the safe and resolve not to telegraph to hutcheson and unduly disturb he as in a few day he would return from england and there would be time enough then to explain the remarkable story one fact however we establish the detective on duty at the railway station distinctly recollect a thin middle-aged man accompany by a lady in deep black pass the barrier and enter the train which leave at three o'clock for colle salvettus to join the rome express they be foreigner therefore he do not take the same notice of they as though they have be italian inquiry at the booking-office show however that no passenger have book direct to rome by the train in question to grossetto cecina campiglium and the other place in the maremma passenger have take ticket but not one have be book to any of the great town therefore it be apparent that the mysterious pair who have come ashore just prior to the sailing of the yacht have merely take ticket for a false destination and have re-book at colle salvettus the junction with that long main line which connect genoa with rome the police be puzzle the two fisherman who sight the _ lolum _ and first give the alarm of she danger declare that when they draw alongside and proffer assistance the captain threaten to shoot the first man who come aboard they be english remark the sturdy brown-faced toiler of the sea grin knowingly and the english when they drink they cognac know not what they do do you get any reward for return to harbor and report i ask reward echo one of the man the elder of the pair not a soldo the english only curse we for interfere that be why we believe that they be try to make away with the vessel the description of the _ lolum _ its owner he guest and the captain be circulate by the police to all the mediterranean port with a request that the yacht should be detain yet if the vessel be really one of mystery as it seem to be its owner would no doubt go across to some quiet anchorage on the algerian coast out of the track of the vessel and calmly proceed to repaint rename and disguise he craft so that it would not be recognize in marseille naple smyrna or any of the port where private yacht habitually call thus from the very first it seem to I that hornby and he friend have very cleverly trick I for some mysterious purpose and afterwards ingeniously evade they watcher and get clean away have the italian admiral be able to send a torpedo-boat or two after the fugitive they would no doubt soon have be overhaul yet circumstance have prevent this and the _ lolum _ have consequently escape for purpose of they own the police keep the affair out of the papers and when frank hutcheson step out of the sleeping-car from pari on to the platform at pisa a few night afterwards i related to he the extraordinary story the scoundrel want these that be evident he respond hold up the small strong leather hand-bag he be carry and which contain he jealously-guarded cipher by jove he laugh how disappointed they must have be it may be so i say as we enter the midnight train for leghorn but my own theory be that they be search for some paper or other that you possess what can my papers concern they exclaim the jovial round-faced consul a man whose courtesy be know to every skipper trading up and down the mediterranean and who be perhaps one of the most culture and popular man in the british consular service i do not keep bank note in that safe you know we fellow in the service do not roll in gold as we public at home appear to think no but you may have something in there which might be of value to they you be often the keeper of valuable document belong to englishman abroad you know certainly but there be nothing in there just now except perhaps the register of birth marriage and death of british subject and the papers concern a board of trade inquiry no my dear gordon depend upon it that the yacht run ashore be all a blind they do it so as to be able to get the run of the consulate secure the cipher and sail merrily away with they it seem to I however that they give you a jolly good dinner and get nothing in return they might very easily have carry I off too i declare perhaps it would have be better if they have you would at least have have the satisfaction of know what they little game really be but the man and the woman who leave the yacht a hour before she sail and who slip away into the country somewhere i wonder who they be hornby distinctly tell I that he and chater be alone and yet there be evidently a lady and a gentleman on board i guess there be a woman there from the way the boudoir and lady ' saloon be arrange and certainly no man 's hand decorate a dinner table as that be decorate yes that be decidedly funny remark the consul thoughtfully they go to colle salvettus you say they change there of course express call there one go north and the other south within a quarter of a hour after the train arrive from leghorn they show a lot of ingenuity otherwise they would have go direct to pisa ingenuity i should think so the whole affair be most cleverly plan hornby would have deceive even you my dear old chap he have the air of the perfect gentleman and a glance over the yacht convinced I that he be a wealthy man travel for pleasure you say something about a armory yes there be maxim stow away in one of the cabin they arouse my suspicion they would not have arouse mine reply my friend yacht carry arm for protection in many case especially if they be go to cruise along uncivilized coast where they must land for water or provision i tell he of the tear photograph which cause he some deep reflection i wonder why the picture have be tear up have there be a row on board -- a quarrel or something it have be destroy surreptitiously i think pity you do not pocket the fragment we could perhaps have discover from the photographer the identity of the original ah i sigh regretfully i never think of that i recollect the name of the firm however i shall have to report to london the whole occurrence as british subject be under suspicion hutcheson say we 'll see whether scotland yard know anything about hornby or chater most probably they do not long ago a description of man on board a yacht be circulate from london as be a pair of well-known burglar who be cruise about in a vessel cram with booty which they dare not get rid of they be however not the same as we friend on the _ lolum _ for both man want be arrest in new orlean about eight month ago without they yacht for they confess that they have deliberately sink it on one of the island in the south pacific then these fellow might be another pair of london burglar i exclaimed eagerly as the startling theory occur to I they might be but of course we can not form any opinion until we hear what scotland yard have to say i 'll write a full report in the morning if you will give I minute description of the man as well as of the captain mackintosh next morning i hand over my charge of the consulate to frank and then assist he to go through the papers in the safe which have be examine by the thief the ruffian seem to have thoroughly overhaul everything remark the consul in dismay when he see the disorder state of he papers they seem to have read every one deliberately which show that have they be in search for the cipher-book they would only have look for they alone i remark decisively what on earth could interest they in all these dry unimportant shipping report and thing goodness only know reply my friend then call cavendish a tall fair young man who have now recover from he touch of fever and have return to the consulate he commence to check the number of those adhesive stamp rather larger than ordinary postage-stamp use in the consular service for the registration of fee receive by the foreign office the value be from sixpence to one pound and they be keep in a portfolio after a long calculation the consul suddenly raise he face to I and say -- then six ten shilling one have be take why there must be some motive they be of no use to anyone except to consul he explain perhaps they be want to affix to some false certificate see he add open the portfolio there be six stamp here and all be go but they would have to be obliterate by the consular stamp remark cavendish ah of course exclaim hutcheson take out the brass seal from the safe and examine it minutely by jove he cry a second later it be be use they have stamp some document with it look they have use the wrong ink-pad can not you see that there be violet upon it while we always use the black pad i take it in my hand and there sure enough i see trace of violet ink upon it -- the ink of the pad for the date-stamp upon the consul 's table then some document have be stamp and seal i gasp yes and my signature forge to it no doubt they have fabricate some certificate or other which bear the stamp seal and signature of the consulate will be accept as a legal document i wonder what it be ah i say i wonder and the three of we look at each other in sheer bewilderment the reason the papers be all upset be because they be evidently in search of some blank form or other which they hope to find remark my friend as you say the whole affair be most carefully and ingeniously plan we cross the great sunlit piazza together and enter the questura that sun-blanch old palace with its long cool loggia where the sentry pace day and night the chief of police whom we see have no further information the mysterious yacht have not put in at any italian port from he however we learn the name of the detective who have see the two stranger leave leghorn by the early morning train and a hour afterwards the police-officer a black-eyed man short of stature but of a intelligent type sit in the consulate reply to we question as far as i could make out signora he say the man be a englishman wear a soft black feel hat and a suit of dark blue serge he have hair just turn gray a small dark mustache and rather high cheek-bone in he hand he carry a small bag of tan leather of that square english shape he seem

over the consulate in the piazza in the night the british mediterranean fleet cruise down from malta have come into the roadstead and at the signal from the flagship have maneuver and drop anchor form a long line of gigantic battleship swift cruiser torpedo-boat destroyer torpedo-boats despatch-boat and other craft extend for several mile along the coast in the bright morning sunlight the sight be both picturesque and impose for from every vessel flag be fly and ever and anon the great battleship of the admiral make signal which be repeat by all the other vessel each in turn lie still on those

when a man be away from he _ fiancée _ or wife for three whole year he anxiety to get back even for a brief day be easily understand the youngster however go for mere caprice -- whenever they can obtain leave this be not often for the admiral have very fixed view upon the matter you time 's soon up be not it i remark as i loll back in the easy deck-chair and gaze away at the white port and its background of purple apennine the dark good-looking fellow in he smart summer uniform lean over the bulwark and say with a slight sigh i think -- yes this be my last trip to leghorn i think i go back in November and i really sha not be sorry three year be a long time to be away from home you go next week you say lucky devil to be you own master i only wish i be year after year on this deck grow confoundedly wearisome i can tell you my dear fellow durnford be a man who have write much on naval affair and be accept as a expert on several branch of the service the admiralty do not encourage officer to write but in durnford 's case it be recognize that of naval topic he possess a knowledge that be of use and therefore he be allow to write book and to contribute critical article to the service magazine he have study the relative strength of foreign navy and by keep he eye always open he have on many occasion be able to give valuable information to we naval _ attachés _ at the embassy more than once however he trenchant criticism of the action of the naval lord have bring upon he head rebuke from head-quarter nevertheless so universally be he talent as a naval expert recognize that to write have never be forbid he as it have be to certain other how 's hutcheson he ask a moment later turn and face I fit as a fiddle just back from he month 's leave at home he wife be still up in scotland however she can not stand leghorn in summer no wonder it be a perfect furnace when the weather begin to stoke up i go as soon as you have sail i only stay because i promise to

as you like -- but why such mystery he ask as we walk together to the other side of the spick-and-span quarter-deck of the gigantic battleship you 'll understand when i tell you the story and then stand together beneath the awning i related to my friend the whole of the curious circumstance just as i have record they in the foregoing page confoundedly funny he remark with he dark eye fix upon mine a mystery by jove it be what name do the yacht bear the _ lolum _ what he gasp suddenly turn pale the _ lolum _ be you quite sure it be the _ lolum _ -- _ l-o-l-a _ absolutely certain i reply but why do you ask do you happen to know anything about the craft I he stammer and i could see that he have involuntarily betray the truth yet for some reason he wish to conceal he knowledge from I I how should i know anything about such a craft they be thief on board evidently -- perhaps pirate as you say but the name _ lolum _ be familiar to you jack i be sure it be by you manner he pause a moment and i could see what a strenuous effort he be make to avoid betray knowledge it be -- well -- he say hesitatingly with a rather sickly smile it be a girl 's name -- a girl i once know the name bring back to I certain memory pleasant one -- i hope no bitter one -- very bitter one he say in a hard tone stride across the deck and back again and i saw in he eye a strange look half of anger half of deep regret be he tell the truth i wonder some tragic romance or other concern a woman have i know overshadow he life in the year before we have become acquaint but the real fact he have never reveal to I he have never before refer to the bitterness of the past although i know full well that he heart be in secret fill by some overwhelming sorrow outwardly he be as merry as the other fellow who officer that huge float fortress on board he be a typical smart marine and on shore he dance and play tennis and flirt just as vigorously as do the other but a heavy heart beat beneath he uniform when he return to where i stand i see that he face have change : it have become draw and haggard he bear the appearance of a man who have be strike a blow that have stagger he crush out all life and hope what be the matter jack i ask come tell I -- what ail you nothing my dear old chap he answer hoarsely really nothing -- only a touch of the blues just for a moment he add try hard to smile it 'll pass what i have just tell you about that yacht have upset you you can not deny it he start he mouth be i see hard set he know something concern that mysterious craft but would not tell I the sound of a bugle come from the further end of the ship and immediately man be scamper along the deck beneath as some order or other be be obey with that precision that characterize the handy man why be you silent i ask slowly my eye fix upon my friend the officer i have tell you what i know and i want to discover the motive of the visit of those man and the reason they open hutcheson 's safe how can i tell you he ask in a strained unnatural voice i believe you know something concern they come tell I the truth i admit that i have certain grave suspicion he say at last standing astride with he hand behind he back he sword trail on the white deck you say that the yacht be call the _ lolum _ -- paint gray with a black funnel no dead white with a yellow funnel ah of course he remark as though to himself they would repaint and alter she appearance but the dining saloon be there a long carve oak buffet with a big heavy cornice with three gilt dolphin in the center -- and be there not dolphin in gilt on the back of the chair -- a armorial device yes i cry you be right i remember they you have surely be on board she and there be a lady ' saloon and a small boudoir in pink beyond while the smoking-room be entirely of marble for the heat exactly -- the same yacht no doubt but what do you know of she the captain who give he name to you as mackintosh be a undersized american of a rather low-down type i take he for a scotsman because he put on a scotch accent he laugh he be a man who can speak a dozen language brokenly and pass for a italian a german a frenchman as he wish and the -- the man who give he name as philip hornby durnford 's mouth close with a snap he draw a long breath he eye grow fierce and he bite he lip ah i see he be not exactly you friend i say meaningly you be right gordon -- he be not my friend be he slow meaning response then why not be outspoken and tell I all you know concern he frank hutcheson be anxious to clear up the mystery because they have tamper with the consular seal and thing besides it would be put down to he credit if he solve the affair well to tell you the truth i be mystified myself i can not yet discern they motive but at any rate you know the man i argue you can at least tell we who they really be he shake he head still disincline for some hidden reason to reveal the truth to I you see no woman on board he ask suddenly look straight into my eye no hornby tell I that he and chater be alone and yet a hour after you leave a man and a woman come ashore and disappear ah if we only have a description of that woman it would reveal much to we she be young and dark-haired so the detective say she have a curious fixed look in she eye which attract he but she wear a thick motor veil so that he could not clearly discern she feature and she companion middle-aged prematurely gray with a small dark mustache jack durnford sigh and stroke he chin ah just as i think he exclaim and they be actually here in this port a week ago what a bitter irony of fate i do not understand you i say you be so mysterious and yet you will tell I nothing the police fool that they be have allow they to escape and they will never be catch now ah you do not know they as i do they be the cleverest pair in all europe and they have the audacity to call they craft the _ lolum _ -- the _ lolum _ of all name but as you know who and what the fellow be you ought i think in common justice to hutcheson to tell we something i complain if they be adventurer they ought to be trace what can i do -- a prisoner here on board he argue bitterly how can i act leave it all to I i be free to travel after they and find out the truth if only you will tell I what you know concern they i say eagerly gordon let I be frank and open with you my dear old fellow i would tell you everything -- everything -- if i dared but i can not -- you understand and he final word seem to choke he i stand before he open-mouthed in astonishment you really mean -- well that you be in fear of they -- eh i whisper he nod slowly in the affirmative add : to tell you the truth would be to bring upon myself a swift relentless vengeance that would overwhelm and crush I ah my dear fellow you do not know -- you can not dream -- what bring those desperate man into this port i can guess -- i can guess only too well -- but i can only tell you that if you ever do discover the terrible truth -- which i fear be unlikely -- you will solve one of the strangest and most remarkable mystery of modern time what do the mystery concern i ask in breathless eagerness it concern a woman chapter iii the house over the water the mediterranean squadron that magnificent display of naval force that be the guarantee of peace in europe after a week of gay festivity in leghorn have sail for gaeta while i glad to escape from the glaring heat find myself back once more in dear old london one pass one 's time in the south well enough in winter but after a year even the most ardent lover of italy long to return to he own people be it ever for so brief a space exile for a whole year in any continental town be exile indeed therefore although i live in italy for choice i like so many other englishman always manage to spend a month or two in summer in we temperate if much maligned climate london the same dear dusty old london only perhaps more dear and more dusty than ever be my native city hence i always spend a few week in it even though all the world might be absent in the country or at the seaside i have idle away a pleasant month up in buxton and from there have go north to the lake and it be one hot evening in mid-august that i find myself again in london cross st jame 's square from the sport club where i have dine walk towards pall mall darkness have just fall and there be that stifle oppression in the air that fore-token a thunderstorm the club be not gay with life and merriment as it be in the season for everyone be away many of the room be close for re-decoration and most of the furniture swathe in linen i be on my way to pay a visit to a lady who live up at hampstead a friend of my late mother 's and have just turn into pall mall when a voice at my elbow suddenly exclaim in italian -- ah signora -- why actually my padrone and look round i see a thin-faced man of about thirty dress in neat but rather shabby black whom i instantly recognize as a man who have be my servant in leghorn for two year after which he have leave to better himself why olinto i exclaimed surprise as i halt you -- in london -- eh well and how be you get on most excellently signora he answer in broken english smile but it be so pleasant for I to see my generous padrone again what fortune it be that i should pass here at this very moment where be you work i inquire at the restaurant milano in oxford street -- only a small place but we gain discreetly so i must not complain i live over in lambeth and be on my way home i hear you married after you leave I be that true yes signora i married armida who be in you service when i first enter it you remember she ah well he add sigh poor thing i regret to say she be very ill indeed she can not stand you english climate the doctor say she will die if she remain here yet what can i do if we go back to italy we shall only starve and i see that he be in deep distress and that mention of he ail wife have arouse within he bitter thought olinto santinus walk back at my side in the direction of trafalgar square answer the question i put to he he have be a good hard-working servant and i be glad to see he again when he leave I he have go as steward on one of the anchor line boat between naple and new york and that be the last i have hear of he until i find he there in london a waiter at a second-rate restaurant when i try to slip some silver into he hand he refuse to take it and with a merry laugh say -- i wonder if you would be offend signora if i tell you of something for which i have be longing and longing not at all well the signora smoke we tuscan cigar i wonder if by chance you have one we can not get they in london you know i feel in my pocket laughing and discover that i have a couple of those long thin penny cigar which i always smoke in italy and which be so dear to the tuscan palate these i hand he and he take they with delight as the greatest delicacy i could have offer he poor fellow as a exile italian he cling to every little trifle that remind he of he own beloved country when we halt before the national gallery prior to parting i make some further inquiry regard armida the black-eyed good-looking housemaid whom he have marry ah signora he respond in a voice choke with emotion drop into italian it be the one great sorrow of my life i work hard from early morning until late at night but what be the use when i see my poor wife gradually fading away before my very eye the doctor say that she can not possibly live through the next winter ah how delighted the poor girl would be if she could see the padrone once again i feel sorry for he armida have be a good servant and have serve I well for nearly three year old rosina my housekeeper have often regret that she have be compel to leave to attend to she aged mother the latter he tell I have die and afterwards he have marry she there be more romance and tragedy in the life of the poor italian in london than london ever suspect we be too apt to regard the italian as a bloodthirsty person give to the unlawful use of the knife whereas as a whole the italian colony in london be a hard-working thrifty and law-abiding one very different indeed to those colony of alien from northern europe who be so continually bring filth disease and immorality into the east end and be a useless incubus in a already over-populated city he speak so wistfully that he wife might see I once more that have nothing very particular to do that evening and feel a deep sympathy for the poor fellow in he trouble i resolve to accompany he to he house and see whether i could not in some slight manner render he a little help he thank I profusely when i consent to go with he ah signor padrone he say gratefully she will be so delighted it be so very good of you we hail a hansom and drive across westminster bridge to the address he give -- a gloomy back street off the york road one of those narrow grimy thoroughfare into which the sun never shine ah how often do the poor italian those child of the sun pine and die when shut up in we dismal sordid street dirt and squalor do not affect they it be the damp and cold and lack of sunshine that so very soon prove fatal a low-looking evil-faced fellow open the door to we and growl acquaintance with olinto who strike a match ascend the worn carpetless stair before I apologize for pass before I and say in italian -- we live at the top signora because it be cheaper and the air be better quite right i say quite right go on and i think i hear my cab drive away it be a gloomy forbid unlighted place into which i would certainly have hesitate to enter have not my companion be my trust servant i instinctively dislike the look of the fellow who have open the door he be one of those hulk loafer of the peculiarly lambeth type yet the alien poor i recollected can not choose where they shall reside contrary to my expectation the sitting-room we enter on the top floor be quite comfortably furnished clean and respectable even though trace of poverty be apparent a cheap lamp be burn upon the table but the apartment be unoccupied olinto in surprise pass into the adjoining room return a moment later exclaim -- armida must have go out to get something or perhaps she be with the people a compositor and he wife who live on the floor below they be very good to she i 'll go and find she accommodate yourself with a chair signora and he draw the best chair forward for I and dust it with he handkerchief i allow he to go and fetch she rather surprise that she should be well enough to get about after all he have tell I concern she illness yet consumption do not keep people in bed until its final stage as i stand there gaze round the room i could not well distinguish its furthermost corner for the lamp bear a shade of green paste-board which throw a zone of light upon the table and leave the remainder of the room in darkness when however my eye grow accustomed to the dim light i discern that the place be dusty and somewhat disorder the sofa be i see a folding iron bedstead with greasy old cushion while the carpet be threadbare and full of hole when i draw the old rep curtain to look out of the window i find that the shutter be close which i think unusual for a room so high up as that be olinto return in a few moment say that he wife have evidently go to do some shopping in the lower-marsh for it be the habit of the denizen of that locality to go marketing in the evening among the costermonger ' stall that line so many of the thoroughfare perishable commodity the overplus of the market and shop be cheaper at night than in the morning i hope you be not press for time signora he say apologetically but of course the poor girl do not know the surprise await she she will surely not be long then i 'll wait i say and fling myself back into the chair he have bring forward for I i have nothing to offer you signer padrone he say with a laugh i do not expect a visitor you know no no olinto i have only just have dinner but tell I how you have fare since you leave I ah he laugh bitterly i have many up and downs before i find myself here in london the sea do not suit I -- neither do the work they put I in the emigrant ' quarter and consequently i could gain nothing the other steward be neapolitan therefore because i be a tuscan they relegate I to the worst post ah signore you do not know what it be to serve those emigrant i make two trip then return and marry armida i call on you but tito say you be in london at first i get work at a café in viareggio but when the season end and i be throw out of employment i manage to work my way from genoa to london my first place be scullion in a restaurant in tottenham court road and then i become waiter in the beer-hall at the monico and manage to save sufficient to send armida the money to join I here afterwards i go to the milano and i hope to get into one of the big hotel very soon -- or perhaps the grill-room at the carlton i have a friend who be there and they make lot of money -- four or five pound every week in tip they say i 'll see what i can do for you i say i know several hotel-manager who might have a vacancy ah signora he cry fill with gratification if you only would a word from you would secure I a good position i can work that you know -- and i do work i will work -- for she sake i have promise you i say briefly and how can i sufficiently thank you he cry standing before I while in he eye i think i detect a strange wild look such as i have never see there before you serve I well olinto i reply and when i discover real sterling honesty i endeavor to appreciate it there be alas very little of it in this world yes he say in a hoarse voice he manner suddenly change you have to-night show I signore that you be my friend and i will in return show you that i be yours and suddenly grasp both my hand he pull I from the chair in which i be sit at the same time ask in a low intense whisper : do you always carry a revolver here in england as you do in italy yes i answer in surprise at he action and he question why because there be danger here he answer in the same low earnest tone get you weapon ready you may want it i do not understand i say feeling my handy colt in my back pocket to make sure it be there forget what i have say -- all -- all that i have tell you to-night sir he say i have not explain the whole truth you be in peril -- in deadly peril how i exclaimed breathlessly surprise at he extraordinary change of manner and he evident apprehension lest something should befall I wait and you shall see he whisper but first tell I signore that you will forgive I for the part i have play in this dastardly affair i like yourself fall innocently into the hand of you enemy my enemy who be they they be unknown and for the present must remain so but if you doubt you peril watch -- and take the rusty fire-tong from the grate he carefully place they on end in front of the deep old armchair in which i have sit and then allow they to fall against the edge of the seat spring quickly back as he do so in a instant a bright blue flash shoot through the place and the iron fall aside fuse and twist out of all recognition i stand aghast utterly unable for the moment to sufficiently realize how narrowly i have escape death look see here behind cry the italian direct my attention to the back leg of the chair where on bend with the lamp i see to my surprise that two wire be connect and run along the floor and out of the window while conceal beneath the ragged carpet in front of the chair be a thin plate of steel whereon my foot have rest those who have so ingeniously entice I to that gloomy house of death have connect up the overhead electric light main with that innocent-looking chair and from some unseen point have be able to switch on a current of sufficient voltage to kill fifty man i stand stock-still not daring to move lest i might come into contact with some hidden wire the slightest touch of which must bring instant death upon I you enemy prepare this terrible trap for you declare the man who be once my trust servant when i enter into the affair i be not aware that it be to be fatal they give I no inkling of they dastardly intention but there be no time to admit of explanation now signore he add breathlessly in a low desperate voice say that you will not prejudge I he plead earnestly i will not prejudge you until i have hear you explanation i say i certainly owe my life to you to-night then quick fly from this house this instant if you be stop then use you revolver do not hesitate in a moment they will be here upon you but who be they olinto you must tell I i cry in desperation _ dio _ go go he cry push I violently towards the door fly or we shall both die -- both of we run downstairs i must make feint of dash after you i turn and see he desperate eagerness precipitately flee while he run down behind I utter fierce imprecation in italian as though i have escape he a man in the narrow dark passage attempt to trip I up as i run but i fire point blank at he and gain the door unlock it and a instant later find myself out in the street it be the narrowest escape from death that i have ever have in all my life -- surely the strangest and most remarkable adventure what i wonder do it mean next morning i search up and down oxford street for the restaurant milano but could not find it i ask shopkeeper postman and policeman i examine the london directory at the bar of the oxford music hall and make every inquiry possible but all be to no purpose no one know of such a place there be restaurant in plenty in oxford street from the frascatus down to the humble coffeeshop but nobody have ever hear of the milano even olinto have play I false i be fill with chagrin for i have trust he as honest upright and industrious and be puzzle to know the reason he have deceive I and why he have entice I to the very brink of the grave he have tell I that he himself have fall into the trap lay by my enemy and yet he have steadfastly refuse to tell I who they be the whole thing be utterly inexplicable i drive over to lambeth and wander through the maze of mean street off the york road yet for the life of I i could not decide into which house i have be take there be a dozen which seem to I that they might be the identical house from which i have so narrowly escape with my life gradually it become impressed upon I that my ex-servant have somehow gain knowledge that i be in london that he have watch my exit from the club and that all he pitiful story regard armida be false he be the envoy of my unknown enemy who have so ingeniously and so relentlessly plot my destruction that i have enemy i know quite well the man who believe he have not be a arrant fool there be no man breathing who have not a enemy from the pauper in the workhouse to the king in he automobile but the unseen enemy be always the more dangerous hence my deep apprehensive reflection that day as i walk those sordid back street over the water as the cockney refer to the district between those two main artery of traffic the waterloo and westminster bridge road my unknown enemy have secure the service of olinto in they dastardly plot to kill I with what motive i wonder as i cross waterloo bridge to the strand whether olinto santinus would again approach I and make the promise explanation i have give my word not to prejudge he until he reveal to I the truth yet i could not in the circumstance repose entire confidence in he when one 's enemy be unknown the feeling of apprehension be always much greater for in the imagination danger lurk in every corner and every action of a friend cover the ruse of a suspect enemy that day i do my business in the city with a distrust of everyone not know whether i be not follow or whether those who seek my life be not plot some other equally ingenious move whereby i might go innocently to my death i endeavor to discover olinto by every possible means during those stifle day that follow the heat of london be to I more oppressive than the fiery sunshine of the old-world tuscany and everyone who could be out of town have leave for the country or the sea the only trace i find of the italian be that he be register at the office of the international society of hotel servant in shaftesbury avenue as be employ at gattus 's adelaide gallery but on inquiry there i find he have leave more than a year before and none of he fellow-waiter know he whereabouts thus be defeat in every inquiry and my business at last conclude in london i go up to dumfry on a duty visit which i pay annually to my uncle sir george little have know dumfry since my earliest boyhood and have spend some year of my youth there i have many friend in the vicinity for sir george and my aunt be very popular in the county and move in the best set each time i return from abroad i be always a welcome guest at greenlaw as they place outside the city of burn be call and this occasion prove no exception for the country house of dumfry be always gay in August in prospect of the shoot some new people have take rannoch castle rather nice they seem remark my aunt as we be sit together at luncheon the day after my arrival they name be leithcourt and they have ask I to drive you over there to tennis this afternoon i be not much of a player you know aunt in italy we do not believe in athletics but if it be out of politeness of course i 'll go very well she say then i 'll order the victorium for three there be several nice girl there gordon remark my uncle mischievously you have a good time so do not think you be go to be bore no fear of that be my answer and at three o'clock sir george he wife and myself set out for that fine old historic castle that stand high on the bognie overlook the cairn water beyond dunscore one of the stronghold of the black dougla in those turbulent day of long ago and now a splendid old residence with a big shoot which be sometimes let for the season at a very high rent by its aristocratic if somewhat impecunious owner we could see its great round tower stand grim and gray on the hillside command the whole of the valley long before we approach it and when we drive into the grounds we find a gay party in summer toilette assemble on the ancient bowling-green now transform into a modern tennis-lawn mr leithcourt and she husband a tall thin gray-headed well-dressed man both come forward to greet we and after a few introduction i join a set at tennis they be a merry crowd the leithcourt be entertain a large house-party and they hospitality be on a scale quite in keep with the fine old place they rent tea be serve on the lawn by the footman and afterwards be tire of the game i find myself stroll with muriel leithcourt a bright dark-eyed girl with tightly-bound hair and wear a cotton blouse and flannel tennis skirt i be apologize for my terribly bad play explain that i have no practice out in italy whereupon she say -- i know italy slightly i be in florence and naple with mother last season and then we begin to discuss picture and sculpture and the sight of italy generally i discern from she remark that she have travel widely indeed she tell I that both she father and mother be never happier than when move from place to place in search of variety and distraction we have enter the huge paneled hall of the castle and have pass up the quaint old stone staircase to the long banqueting hall with its paneled oak ceiling which in these modern day have be transform into a bright pleasant drawing-room from the window of which be present a marvelous view over the lovely nithsdale and across to the heather-clad hill beyond it be pleasant lounge there in the cool old room after the hot sunshine outside and as i gaze around the place i note how much more luxurious and tasteful it now be to what it have be in the day when i have visit its owner several year before we be awfully glad to be up here my pretty companion be say we have such a busy season in london and then she go on to describe the court ball and two or three of the most notable function about which i have read in my english paper beside the mediterranean she attract I on account of she bright vivacity quick wit and keen sense of humor therefore i sit listen to she pleasant chatter exile as i be in a foreign land i seldom speak english save with hutcheson the consul and even then we generally speak italian if there be other present in order that we companion should understand therefore she gossip interested I and as the golden sunset flood the handsome old room i sit listen to she inwardly admire she innate grace and handsome countenance i have no idea who or what she father be -- whether a wealthy manufacturer like so many who take expensive shoot and give big entertainment in order to edge they way into society by its back door or whether he be a gentleman of means and of good family i rather guess the latter from he gentlemanly bearing and polished manner he appearance tall and erect be that of a retired officer and he clean-cut face be one of marked distinction i be tell my pretty companion something of my own life how because i love italy so well i live in tuscany in preference to live in england and how each year i come home for a month or two to visit my relation and to keep in touch with thing suddenly she say -- i be once in leghorn for a few hour we be yachting in the mediterranean i love the sea -- and yachting be such awfully good fun if you only get decent weather the mention of yachting bring back to my mind the visit of the _ lolum _ and its mysterious sequel you father have a yacht then i remark with as little concern as i could yes the _ iri _ my uncle be cruise on she up the norwegian fiord for we it be a change to be here because we be so often afloat we go across to new york in she last year and have a most delightful time -- except for one bad squall which make we all a little bit nervous but moye be such a excellent captain that i never fear the crew be all north sea fisherman -- father will engage nobody else i do not blame he so you must have make many long voyage and see many odd corner of the world miss leithcourt i remark my interest in she increase for she seem so extremely intelligent and well-informed oh yes we have be to mexico and to panama besides morocco egypt and the west coast of africa and you have actually land at leghorn i remark yes but we do not stay there more than a hour -- to send a telegram i think it be father say there be nothing to see there he and i go ashore and i must say i be rather disappointed you be quite right the town itself be ugly and uninteresting but the outskirts -- san jacopo ardenza and antigniano be all delightful it be unfortunate that you do not see they be it long ago when you put in there not very long i really do not recollect the exact date be she reply we be on we way home from alexandrium have you ever in any of the port you have be see a yacht call the _ lolum _ i ask eagerly for it occur to I that perhaps she might be able to give I information the _ lolum _ she gasp and instantly she face change a flush overspread she cheek succeed next moment by a death-like pallor the _ lolum _ she repeat in a strange hoarse voice at the same time endeavor strenuously not to exhibit any apprehension no i have never hear of any such a vessel be she a steam-yacht who be she owner i regard she in amazement and suspicion for i see that mention of the name have arouse within she some serious misgiving that look in she dark eye as they fix themselves upon I be one of distinct and unspeakable terror what could she possibly know concern the mysterious craft i do not know the owner 's name i say still affect not to have notice she alarm and apprehension the vessel run aground at the melorium a dangerous shoal outside leghorn and through the stupidity of she captain be very nearly lose yes she gasp in a half-whisper bend to I eagerly unable to sufficiently conceal the terrible anxiety consume she and you -- do you go aboard she yes be the only word i utter a silence fall between we and as my eye fix themselves upon she i see that from she handsome mobile countenance all the light and life have suddenly go out and i know that she be in secret possession of the key to that remarkable enigma that so puzzle I of a sudden the door open and a voice cry gayly -- why i have be look everywhere for you muriel why be you hide here be not you come we both turn and as she do so a low cry of blank dismay involuntarily escape she next instant i spring to my foot the reason of she cry be apparent for there in the full light of the golden sunset streaming through the long open window stand a broad-shouldered fair-bearded man in tennis flannel and a panama hat -- the fugitive i know as philip hornby i face he speechless chapter iv in which the mystery increase neither of we speak equally surprise at the unexpected encounter we stand face each other dumbfounded hornby start quickly as soon as he eye fall upon I and he face become blanch to the lip while muriel leithcourt quick to notice the sudden change in he rise and introduce we in as calm a voice as she could command i do not think you be acquaint she say to I with a smile this be mr martin woodroffe -- mr gordon gregg i bow to he in sudden resolve to remain silent in pretense that i doubt whether the man before I be actually my host of the _ lolum _ i intend to act as though i be not sufficiently convince to openly express my doubt therefore we bow exchange greeting as stranger while carefully watch i see how greatly the mind of both be relieve they shoot mean glance at each other and then as though reassure that i be mystified and uncertain the man who call himself woodroffe explain to my companion ------ i have be over to newton stewart with fred all day and only get back a quarter of a hour ago be not you play any more to-day i think not be she reply we have be out there the whole afternoon and i be rather tired but they be still on the lawn you can surely get a game with someone if you do not play i sha not i return to keep the promise i make this morning he laugh standing before the big open fireplace hold he tennis racquet behind he back i examine he countenance and be more than ever convince that he be actually the man who give I the name of hornby and the false address in somerset the pair seem to be on familiar term and i wonder whether they be engage in any case the man seem quite at home there as he chat with the daughter of the house he cast a quick covert glance at I and then dart a meaning look at she -- a look of renew confidence as though he feel that he have successfully avert any suspicion i might have hold we talk of the prospects of the grouse and the salmon and from he remark he seem to be as keen at sport as he have once make out himself to be at yachting my friend leithcourt be awfully fortunate in get such a splendid old place as this on every hand i hear glowing account of the number of bird the place have be well preserve in the past and there be plenty of good cover yes i say gilrae the owner be a keen sportsman and before he become so hard up he spend a lot of money on the estate which i believe have always be consider one of the very best in the southwest there be salmon they say down in the glen yonder -- but i have never try for any certainly there be i have see several i hope to try one of these day the glen be deep and shady -- a ideal place for fish the only disappointment here as far as i can make out be the very few head of black-game yes but every year they be get rarer and rarer in this part of scotland a really fine black-cock be quite a event nowadays i say while we be talk or rather while i be carefully watch the rapid working of he mind leithcourt himself enter and join we he have be play tennis and have come in to rest and cool host and guest be evidently on the most intimate term leithcourt address he as martin and begin to relate a quarrel which he head-gamekeeper have have that day with one of the small farmer on the estate regard the killing of some rabbit and while they be talk muriel suggest that we should stroll down to the tennis-court again a invitation which much as i regret leave the two man i be bind to accept it seem as though she wish purposely to take I away from that man 's presence fear that by remain there longer my suspicion might become confirm she be act in conjunction with the man whom i have know as hornby there be still a good many people watch the game for it be pleasant in those old-world garden in the sunset hour the dried-up moat be now transform into a garden fill with rhododendron and bright azalea while the high ancient beech-hedge the quaint old sundial with its motto : each time ye shadowe turneth y one daye nearer unto dethe and the old stone balustrade gray with lichen all speak mutely of those glorious day when the fierce horseman of the laird of rannoch be fear across the border and when many a prisoner of the black dougla have pine and die in those narrow stone chamber in the grim north tower that still stand high above among the party stroll and lounge there prior to departure be quite a number of people i know people who have shooting-box in the vicinity and be my uncle 's friend in scotland there be always a hearty hospitality among the sport folk and the law of caste be far less rigorous than they be in england i be stand chat with two lady who be about to take leave of they hostess when leithcourt return but alone hornby have not accompany he be it because he fear to again meet I in order to ascertain something regard the man who have so mysteriously flee from leghorn i manage by the exercise of a little diplomacy to sit on the lawn with a young married woman name tennant wife of a cavalry captain who be one of the house-party after a little time i succeed in turn the conversation to she fellow guest and more particularly to the man i know as hornby oh mr woodroffe be most amusing declare the bright little woman he be always play some practical joke or other after dinner he be usually the life and soul of we party yes i say i like what little i have see of he he be a very good fellow i should say i have hear that he be engage to muriel i hazard be that true of course they have be engage nearly a year but he be be abroad until quite lately he be rather close about he own affair and never talk about he travels and adventure although one day mr leithcourt declare that he hairbreadth escape would make a most exciting book if ever write leithcourt and he be evidently most intimate friend oh quite inseparable she laugh and the other man who be always with they be that short stout red-faced old fellow standing over there with the lady in pale blue sir ughtr gardner mr woodroffe have nickname he ` sir putrid ' and we both laugh of course do not say i say so she whisper they do not call he that to he face but it be so easy to make a mistake in he name when he be not within hearing we woman do not care for he so the nickname just fit and she gossip on tell I much that i desire to know regard the new tenant of rannoch and he friend and more especially of that man who have first introduce himself to I in the consulate at leghorn half a hour later my uncle 's carriage be announce and i leave with the distinct impression that there be some deep mystery surround the leithcourt what it be however i could not for the life of I make out perhaps it be philip leithcourt 's intimate relation with the man who have so cleverly deceive I that incite my curiosity concern he perhaps it be that mysterious intuition that curious presage of evil that sometimes come to a man as warning of impend peril whatever the reason i have become fill with grave apprehension the mystery grow deeper day by day and be inexplicable during the week that follow i seek to learn all i could regard the new people at the castle they be take up everywhere declare my aunt when i question she of course we know very little of they except that they have a shoot up near fort william two year ago and that they have a town house in green street they be evidently rather smart folk do not you think so judge from they house-party yes i respond they be about as gay a crowd as one could find north of carlisle just at present exactly there be some well-known people among they too say my aunt i have ask they over to-morrow afternoon and they have accept excellent i exclaimed for i want a opportunity for another chat with the dark-eyed girl who be engage to the man whose alias be hornby i particularly desire to ascertain the reason of she fear when i have mention the _ lolum _ and whether she possess any knowledge of hylton chater the opportunity come to I in due course for next afternoon the rannoch party drive over in two large brake and with other people from the neighborhood and a band from dumfry my aunt 's grounds present a gay and animated scene there be the usual tennis and croquet while some of the man enjoy a little put on the excellent course my uncle a golf enthusiast have recently lay down as i expect woodroffe do not accompany the party mr leithcourt a slightly fussy little woman apologize for he absence explain that he have be recall to london suddenly a few day before but be return to rannoch again at the end of the week we could not afford to lose he she declare to my aunt he be so awfully humorous -- he droll saying and antic keep we in a perfect roar each night at dinner he be such a perfect mimic i turn away and stroll with muriel plead a excuse to show she my uncle 's beautiful grounds not a whit less picturesque than those of the castle and perhaps rather better keep i only hear yesterday of you engagement miss leithcourt i remark presently when we be alone allow I to offer my best congratulation when you introduce I to mr woodroffe the other day i have no idea that he be to be you husband she glance at I quickly and i saw in she dark eye a look of suspicion then she flush slightly and laugh uneasily say in a blank hard voice -- it be very good of you mr gregg to wish I all sort of such pleasant thing and when be the happy event to take place the date be not exactly fix -- early next year i believe and i think she sigh and you will probably spend a good deal of time yachting i suggest my eye fix upon she in order to watch the result of my pointed remark but she control herself perfectly i love the sea she respond briefly and she eye be set straight before she mr woodroffe have go up to town you mother say yes he receive a wire and have to leave immediately it be a awful bear for we have arrange to go for a picnic to dundrennan abbey yesterday but he 'll be back here again will not he i really do not know it seem quite uncertain i have a letter this morning which say he might have to go over to hamburg on business instead of come up to we again there be disappointment in she voice and yet at the same time i could not fail to recognize how the man to whom she be engage have flee from scotland because of my presence how i long to ask she point-blank what she really know of the yachtsman who be shroud in so much mystery yet by betray any undue anxiety i should certainly negative all my effort to solve the puzzling enigma therefore i be compel to remain content with ask ingeniously disguise question and draw my own conclusion from she answer as we pass along those gravel walk it somehow become vividly impressed upon I that she marriage be be force upon she by she parent she manner be that of one who be conceal some strange and terrible secret which she fear might be reveal there be a distant look of unutterable terror in those dark eye as though she exist in some constant and ever-present dread of course she tell I nothing of she own feeling or affection yet i recognize in both she word and she bearing a curious apathy -- a want of the real enthusiasm of affection woodroffe much she senior be she father 's friend and it therefore seem to I more than likely that leithcourt be press a matrimonial alliance upon he daughter for some ulterior motive in the mad hurry for place power and wealth man relentlessly sell they daughter in the matrimonial market and ambitious mother scheme and intrigue for they own aggrandizement at sacrifice of they daughter 's happiness more often than the public ever dream tragedy be alas write upon the face of many a bride whose portrait appear in the fashion-papers and whose toilette be so faithfully chronicle in the paragraph beneath indeed the girl in society who be allow she own free choice in the matter of a husband be alas nowadays the exception for parent who want to get on up the social scale have find that pretty daughter be a marketable commodity and many a man have be place on he leg both financially and socially by he son-in-law hence the marriage of convenience be fast become common while in the same ratio the divorce petition be unfortunately on the increase i read tragedy in the dark luminous eye of muriel leithcourt i know that she young heart be over-burdened by some secret sorrow or guilty knowledge that she would reveal to I if she dare she own word tell I that she be perplexed that she long to confide and seek advice of someone yet by reason of some hidden and untoward circumstance she lip be seal i try to question she further regard woodroffe of what profession he follow and of he past but she evidently suspect I for i have unfortunately mention the _ lolum _ she want to speak to I in confidence and yet she would reveal to I nothing -- absolutely nothing martin woodroffe do not rejoin the house-party at rannoch although i remain the guest of my uncle much longer than i intend indeed right through the shooting season in order to watch the leithcourt yet as far as we could judge they be extremely well-bred people and very hospitable we exchange a good many visit and dinner and while my uncle several time invite leithcourt and he friend to he shoot with _ al fresco _ luncheon which the lady join the tenant of rannoch always invite we back in return thus i gain many opportunity of talk with muriel and of watch she closely i have the reputation of be a confirm bachelor and on account of that it seem that she be in no way averse to my companionship she could handle a rook-rifle as well as any woman and be really a very fair shot therefore we often find ourselves alone tramp across the wide open moorland or along those delightful glen of the nithsdale glorious in the autumn tint of they luxurious foliage she father on the other hand seem to view I with considerable suspicion and i could easily discern that i be only ask to rannoch because it be impossible to invite my uncle without include myself leithcourt who perhaps think i be court he daughter be ever endeavor to avoid I and would never allow I to walk with he alone why i wonder do he fear I have woodroffe tell he of we strange encounter in leghorn he pronounced antipathy towards I cause I to watch he surreptitiously and more closely than perhaps i should otherwise have do he be a man of gloomy mood and often he would leave he guest and take walk alone muse and brood on several occasion i follow he in secret and find to my surprise that although he make long detour in various direction yet he always arrive at the same spot at the same hour -- five o'clock the place where he halt be on the edge of a dark wood on the brow of a hill about three mile from rannoch -- a good place to get woodpigeon as they come to roost it be fully two mile across the hill from the high road to moniaive and from the break the gray wall where he be in the habit of sit to rest and smoke there stretch the beautiful panorama of loch urr and the heatherclad hill beyond leithcourt never go direct to the place but always so time he walk that he arrive just at five and remain there smoking cigarette until half-past as though await the arrival of some person he expect once or twice he guest suggest shooting pigeon at sundown but he always have some excuse for oppose the proposal and thus the party unsuspect the reason be keep away from that particular lonely spot in my youth i have sit many a quiet hour there in the darkening gloom and shoot many a pigeon therefore i know the wood well and be able to watch the tenant of rannoch from point where he least suspect the presence of another once when i be alone with muriel i mention she father 's capacity for walk alone whereupon she say -- oh yes he be always fond of walk he use to take I with he when we first come here but he always go so far that i refuse to go any more she never once mention woodroffe i allow she plenty of opportunity for do so chaff she about she forthcoming marriage in order that she might again refer to he but never do he name pass she lip i understand that he have go abroad -- that be all often when alone i reflect upon my curious adventure on that night when i meet olinto and of my narrow escape from the hand of my unknown enemy i wonder if that ingenious and dastardly attempt upon my life have really any connection with that strange incident at leghorn as day succeed day my mind become fill by increase suspicion mystery surround I on every hand indeed by one curious fact alone it be increase a hundredfold late one afternoon when i have be out shoot all day with the rannoch party i drive back to the castle in the perth-cart with three other man and find the lady assemble in the great hall with tea ready a welcome log-fire be blaze in the huge old grate for in October it be chilly and damp in scotland and a fire be pleasant at evening muriel be seat upon the high padded fender -- like those one have at club -- which always form a cosy spot for the lady especially after dinner when i enter she rise quickly and hand I my cup exclaim as she look at I -- oh mr gregg what a state you be in yes i be after snipe and slip into a bog i laugh but it be early this morning and the mud have dry come with I and i 'll get you a brush she urge and i follow she through the long corridor and upstairs to a small sitting-room which be she own little sanctum where she work and read -- a cosy little place with two queer old window in the colossal wall and a floor of polished oak and great black beam above when the owner have occupy the house that room have be disused but it have i find be now completely transform and be a most tasteful little nest of luxury with its bright chintz its turkey rug and its cheerful fire on the old stone hearth she laugh when i express admiration of she little den and say -- i believe it be the armory in the old day but it make quite a comfy little boudoir i can lock myself in and be quite quiet when the party be too noisy she add merrily but as my eye wander around they suddenly fall upon a object which cause I to start with profound wonder -- a cabinet photograph in a frame of crimson leather the picture be that of a young girl -- a duplicate of the portrait i have find tear across and fling aside on board the _ lolum _ the merry eye laugh out at I as i stand stare at it in sheer bewilderment what a pretty girl i exclaimed quickly conceal my surprise who be she my companion be silent a moment she dark eye meet mine with a strange look of inquiry yes she laugh everyone admire she she be a schoolfellow of mine -- elma heath heath i echo where be she at school with you at chichester long ago a little over two year she be very beautiful i declare take up the photograph and discover that it bear the name of the same well-known photographer in new bond street as that i have find on the carpet of the _ lolum _ in the mediterranean yes she be really prettier than she photograph it hardly do she justice and where be she now why be you so very inquisitive mr gregg laugh the handsome girl have you actually fall in love with she from she picture i be hardly give to that kind of thing miss leithcourt i answer with mock severity i do not think even my worst enemy could call I a flirt could she no i will give you you due she declare you never do flirt that be why i like you thanks for you candor miss leithcourt i say only she add you seem smitten with elma 's charm i think she be extremely pretty i remark with the photograph still in my hand do you ever see she now never she reply since the day i leave school we have never meet she be several year younger than myself and i hear that a week after i leave chichester she people come and take she away where she be now i have no idea she people live somewhere in durham she father be a doctor she reply disappoint I yet i have at least retain knowledge of the name of the original of the picture and from the photographer i might perhaps discover she address for to I it seem that she be somehow intimately connect with those mysterious yachtsman what muriel tell I concern she i do not doubt for a single instant yet it be certainly more than a coincidence that a copy of the picture which have create such a deep impression upon I should be preserve in she own little boudoir as a souvenir of a devoted school-friend then you have hear absolutely nothing as to she present position or whereabouts -- whether she be marry for instance ah she cry mischievously you betray yourself by you own word you have fall in love with she i really believe mr gregg if she know she would be most gratified -- or at least she ought to be at which i smile prefer that she should adopt that theory in preference to any other she speak frankly as a pure honest girl would speak she be not jealous but she nevertheless resent -- as woman do resent such thing -- that i should fall in love with a friend 's photograph there be a mystery surround that tear picture of that i be absolutely certain the remembrance of that memorable evening when i have dine on board the _ lolum _ arise vividly before I why have the girl 's portrait be so ruthlessly destroy and the frame turn with its face to the wall there be some reason -- some distinct and serious motive in it have muriel tell I the truth i wonder or be she merely seek to shield the suspect man who be she lover hour by hour the mystery surround the leithcourt become more inscrutable more intensely absorb i have search a copy of the london directory at the station hotel at carlisle and find that no house in green street be register as occupy by the tenant of rannoch and further when i come to examine the list of guest at the castle i find that they be really person unknown in society they be merely of that class of witty well-dressed parasite who always cling on to the wealthy and make believe that they be smart and of the _ grande monde _ rannoch be a expensive place to keep up with all that big retinue of servant and gamekeeper and with those nightly dinner cook by a french _ chef _ yet leithcourt seem to possess a long pocket and smile upon those parasite officer of doubtful commission and younger sprig of the pseudo-aristocracy who surround he while he wife keen-eyed and of superb bearing be punctilious concern all point of etiquette and at the same time indefatigable that she mixed set of guest should enjoy a really good time but i be not the only person who could not make they out my uncle be the first to open my eye regard the true character of certain of the man stay at rannoch i think gordon that one or two of those fellow with leithcourt be rank outsider he say confidentially to I one night after we have have a hard day 's shooting and be play a hundred up at billiards before retire one man who arrive yesterday i know too well he be strike off the list at boodle 's three year ago for card-sharping -- that thin-faced fair-mustached man name cadby i suppose leithcourt do not know it or he would not have he up here among respectable folk and my uncle chew the end of he cigar sniff angrily seeming half inclined to give he friend a gentle hint that the name cadby be place beyond the pale of good society better not say anything about it i urge it be leithcourt 's own affair uncle -- not ours yes but if a man set up a position in the country he must not be allow to ask we to meet such fellow it be come it a little too thick gordon we man can stand the woman of the party but the man -- well i tell you candidly i sha not accept he invite to shoot again no no uncle i protest probably it be owe to ignorance you 'll be able a little later on to give he valuable tip he be a good fellow and only want experience in scotland to get along all right yes but i do not like it my boy i do not like it it be not play a fair game declare the rigid old gentleman color resentfully i be not go to return the invitation and ask that sharper cadby to my house -- and i tell you that plainly next day i shoot with the carmichael of crossburn and about four o'clock after a good day take leave of the party in the black glen and start off alone to walk home a distance of about six mile it be already grow dusk and would be quite dark i know before i reach my uncle 's house my most direct way be to follow the river for about two mile and then strike straight across the large dense wood and afterwards over a wide moor full of treacherous bog and pitfall for the unwary my gun over my shoulder i have walk on for about three-quarter of a hour and have nearly traverse the wood at that hour so dark that i have considerable difficulty in find my way when -- of a sudden -- i fancied i distinguish voice i halt yes man be talk in low tone of confidence and in that calm stillness of evening they appear nearer to I than they actually be i listen try to distinguish the word utter but could make out nothing they be move slowly together in close vicinity to myself for they foot stir the dry leaf and i could hear the bough crack as they force they way through they of a sudden while stand there not daring to breathe lest i should betray my presence a strange sound fall upon my eager ear next moment i realize that i be at that place where leithcourt so persistently keep he disappointed tryst have approach it from within the wood the sound alarmed I and yet it be neither a explosion of fire-arm nor a startling cry for help one word reach I in the darkness -- one single word of bitter and withering reproach heedless of the risk i run and the peril to which i expose myself i dash forward with a resolve to penetrate the mystery until i come to the gap in the rough stone wall where leithcourt 's habit be to halt each day at sundown there in the fall darkness the sight that meet my eye at the spot hold I rigid appal stupefy in that instant i realize the truth -- a truth that be surely the strangest ever reveal to any man chapter v contain certain confidence as i dash forward to the gap in the boundary wall of the wood i nearly stumble over a form lie across the narrow path so dark be it beneath the tree that at first i could not plainly make out what it be until i bent and my hand touch the garment of a woman she hat have fall off for i feel it beneath my foot while the cloak be a thick woolen one be she dead i wonder that cry -- that single word of reproach -- sound in my ear and it seem plain that she have be strike down ruthlessly after a exchange of angry word i feel in my pocket for my vesta but unfortunately my box be empty yet just at that moment my strained ear catch a sound -- the sound of someone move stealthily among the fall leaf seize my gun i demand who be there there be however no response the instant i speak the movement cease as far as i could judge the person in concealment be within the wood about ten yard from I separate by a impenetrable thicket as however i stand out against the sky my silhouette be i know a well-defined mark for anyone with fire-arm it seem evident that a tragedy have occur and that the victim at my foot be a woman but whom of a sudden while i stand hesitate blame myself for be without match i hear the movement repeat someone be quickly recede -- escape from the spot i listen again the sound be not of the rustling of leaf or the crackling of dry stick but the low thud of a man 's foot race over softer ground he have scale the rough stone dyke and be out in the turnip-field adjacent i spring through the gap strain my eye into the gloom and as i do so could just distinguish a dark figure recede quickly beneath the wall of the wood in a instant i dash after it but the agility of whoever the fugitive be man or woman be marvelous i consider myself a fairly good runner but race across those rough turnip and heavy newly-plowed land in the darkness and carry my gun soon cause I to pant and blow yet the figure i be pursue be so fleet of foot and so nimble in climb the high rough wall that from the very first i be outrun down the steep hill to the scarwater i follow the fugitive cross the old footbridge near penpont and then up a wild wind glen towards the cairnsmore of deugh for a couple of mile or more i be close behind until at a turn in the dark wooded glen where it branch in two direction i lose all trace of the person who fly from I whoever it be they have very cleverly go into hide in the undergrowth of one or other of the two glen -- which i could not decide i stand out of breath the perspiration pour from I undecided how to act be it leithcourt himself whom i have surprise that idea somehow become impressed upon I and i suddenly resolve to go boldly across to rannoch and ascertain for myself therefore with the excuse that i be belated on my walk home i turn back down the glen and half a hour afterward enter the great well-lighted hall of the castle where the guest ready dress be assemble prior to dinner i be welcome warmly as i be always by the man of the party who see my muddy plight at once offer I a glass of the sportsman 's drink in scotland and while i be add soda to it leithcourt himself join he guest ready dress in he dinner jacket have just descend from he room hulloa gregg he exclaim heartily hold out he hand have a long day of it evidently good sport with carmichael -- eh very fair i say i remain longer with he than i ought to have do and have get belated on my way home so look in for a refresher quite right he laugh merrily you be always welcome you know i would have be annoy if i know you have pass without come in and muriel a pretty figure in a low-cut gown of turquoise chiffon standing behind she father smile secretly at I i smile at she in return but it be a strange smile i fear for with the knowledge of that additional mystery within I -- the mystery of the woman lie unconscious or perhaps dead up in the wood -- hold I stupefy i have suspect leithcourt because of he constant tryst at that spot but i have at least prove that my suspicion be entirely without foundation he could not have get home and dress in the time for i have take the nearest route to the castle while the fugitive would be compel to make a wide detour i only remain a few minute then go forth into the darkness again utterly undecided how to act my first impulse be to return to the woman 's aid for she might not be dead after all and yet when i recollect that hoarse cry that ring out in the darkness i know too well that she have be strike fatally it be this latter conviction that prevent I from turn back to the wood you will perhaps blame I but the fact be i fear that if i go there suspicion might fall upon I now that the real culprit have so ingeniously escape if the victim be dead what aid could i render a knife have i believe be use for my foot catch against it when i have start off after the fugitive the only doubt in my own mind be whether the unfortunate woman be actually dead for if she be not then my disinclination to return to the scene of the tragedy be culpable whether or not i act rightly in remain away from the place i leave it to you to judge in the light of the amazing truth which afterwards transpire i decide to walk straight back to my uncle 's and dinner be over before i have have my tub and dress i therefore eat my meal alone davi the grave old butler serve I with that stateliness which always amuse I i usually chat with he when other be not present but that night i remain silent my mind full of that strange and startling affair of which i alone hold secret knowledge next day the body would surely be find then the whole countryside would be fill with horror and surprise be it possible that leithcourt that calm well-groomed distinguished-looking man hold any knowledge of the ghastly truth no he manner as he stand in the hall chat gayly with I be surely not that of a man with a guilty secret i become firmly convince that although the tragedy affect he very closely and that it have occur at the spot which he have each day visit for some mysterious purpose yet up to the present he be in ignorance of what have transpire but who be the woman be she young or old a thousand time i regret bitterly that i have no match with I so that i might examine she feature one sudden thought that strike I as i sit there at table cause I to lay down my fork and pause in breathless bewilderment be the victim that sweet-face young girl whose photograph have be so ruthlessly cast from its frame and destroy the theory be a weird one but be it the truth i long for the come of the dawn when the rannoch keeper would most certainly discover she then at least i should know the truth for i might go and see the body out of curiosity without arouse any suspicion i try to play my usual game of billiards with my uncle but my hand be so unsteady that the old gentleman begin to chaff I it be the gun i suppose i remark i have be carry it all day and be tire out i walk all the way home from crossburn the carmichael be very thick with the leithcourt i hear my uncle remark strange they do not ask leithcourt to they shoot they do but he would get another engagement -- over at kenmure castle i think i retire to my room that night full of fevered apprehension have i act rightly in not return to that lonely spot on the brow of the hill have i do as a man should do in keep the tragic secret to myself i open my window and gaze away across the dark nithsdale where in the distant gloom the black line of wood loom up against the stormy sky the star be no longer shine and the rain cloud have gather i stand with my face turn to the dark indistinct spot that hold the secret lose in wonderment at last i close the window and turn in but no sleep come to my eye so full be my mind of the startling event of those past few month and of that gruesome discovery i have make have the fugitive actually recognize I probably my voice when i have call out have betray I hour after hour i lay puzzling try to arrive at some solution of that intricate problem which now present itself muriel could tell I what i wish to know of that i be certain yet she dare not speak some inexpressible terror hold she dumb -- she be affiance to the man martin woodroffe again i rise light the gas and try to read a novel but i could not concentrate my thought which be ever wander to that strange mystery of the wood at six i shave descend and go out with the dog for a short walk but on return i hear of nothing unusual and be compel to remain inactive until near mid-day i be cross the stable-yard where i have go to order the carriage for my aunt when a english groom suddenly emerge from the harness-room touch he cap say -- have you ` eard sir of the awful affair up yonder of what i ask quickly well sir there seem to have be a murder last night up in rannoch wood say the man quickly holden the gardener have just come back from that village and say that mr leithcourt 's under-gamekeeper as he be go home at five this morning come upon a dead body a dead body i exclaimed feign great surprise yes sir -- a youngish man he have be stab to the heart a man yes sir -- so holden say call holden i would like to know all he be hear i say and presently when the gardener emerge from the grape-house i seek of he all the particulars he have gather i do not know very much sir be the man 's reply i go into the inn for a glass of beer at eleven as i always do and hear they talk about it a young man be murder last night up in rannoch wood the gamekeeper think at first there would be a fight among poacher but from the dead man 's clothes they say he be not a poacher at all but a stranger in this district the body be that of a man then i ask try to conceal my utter bewilderment yes -- about thirty they say the police have take he to the mortuary at dumfry and the detective be up there now look at the spot they say a man and yet the body i find be that of a woman -- that i could swear after lunch i take the dog-cart and drive alone into dumfry when i inquire of the police-constable on duty at the town mortuary to be allow to view the body of the murder man he regard I i think with considerable suspicion my request be a unusual one nevertheless he take I up a narrow alley unlock a door and i find myself in the cold gloomy chamber of death from a small dingy window above the light fall upon a object lie upon a large slab of gray stone and cover with a soil sheet the sight be ghastly and gruesome the body lay there await the official inquiry into the cause of death the silence of the tomb be unbroken save for the heavy tread of the policeman who have remove he helmet in the presence of the dead lift the end of the sheet reveal to I a white hard-set face with closed eye and drop jaw i start back as my eye fall upon the dead countenance i be entirely unprepared for such a revelation the truth stagger I the victim be the man who have act as my friend -- the italian waiter olinto i advance and peer into the thin inanimate feature scarce able to realize the actual fact but my eye have not deceive I though death distort the facial expression of every man i have no difficulty in identify he you recognize he sir remark the officer who be he we people be very anxious to know for up to the present moment they have not succeed in establish he identity i bit my lip i have be a arrant fool to betray myself before that man yet have do so i see that any attempt to conceal my knowledge must of necessity reflect upon I i will see you inspector i answer with as much calmness as i could muster where have the poor fellow be wound through the heart respond the constable as turn the sheet further down he show I the small knife wound which have penetrate the victim 's jacket and vest full in the chest this be the weapon he add take from a shelf close by a long thin poignard with a ivory handle which he hand to I in a instant i recognize what it be and how deadly it be a old florentine _ misericordium _ a long thin triangular blade a quarter of a inch wide at its greatest width taper to a needle-point with a hilt of yellow ivory the most deadly and fatal of all the dagger and poignard of the middle age the blade be sharp on three angle produce a wound that cause internal hemorrhage and which never heal -- hence the name give to it by the florentine it be still blood-stained but as i take the deadly thing in my hand i see that its blade be beautifully damascen a most elegant specimen of a medieval arm yet surely none but a italian would use such a weapon or would aim so truly as to penetrate the heart and yet the person strike down be a woman and not a man a wound from a _ misericordium _ always prove fatal because the shape of the blade cut the flesh into little flap which on withdraw the knife close up and prevent the blood from issue forth at the same time however no power can make they heal again a blow from such a weapon be as surely fatal as the poison poignard of the borgium or the medicus i hand the stiletto back to the man without comment my resolve be to say as little as possible for i have no desire to figure publicly at the inquiry and consequently negative all my own effort to solve the mystery of the leithcourt and of martin woodroffe i return to where the figure be lie so ghastly and motionless and look again for the last time upon the dead face of the man who have serve I so well and yet who have entice I so nearly to my death in the latter incident there be a deep mystery he have relent at the last moment just in time to save I from my secret enemy could it be that my enemy be he have he fall a victim by the same hand that have attempt so ingeniously to kill I why have leithcourt go so regularly up to rannoch wood be it in order to meet the man who be to be entrap and kill what be olinto santinus do so far from london if he have not come expressly to meet someone in secret as i glance down at the cold inanimate countenance upon which mystery be write i become seize by regret he have be a faithful and honest servant and even though he have entice I to that fatal house in lambeth yet i recollect he word how he have do so under compulsion i remember too how he have implore I not to prejudge he before i become aware of the full fact with my own hand i re-cover the face with the sheet and inwardly resolve to avenge the dastardly crime i regret that i be compel to reveal the dead man 's name to the police yet i see that to make some statement be now inevitable and therefore i accompany the constable to the inspector 's office some distance across the town have be introduce to the big fair-haired man in a rough tweed suit who be apparently direct the inquiry into the affair he take I eagerly into a small back room and begin to question I i be however wary not to commit myself to anything further than the identification of the body the fact be i say confidentially you must omit I from the witness at the inquest why ask the detective suspiciously because if it be know that i have identify he all chance of get at the truth will at once vanish i answer i have come here to tell you in strictest confidence who the poor fellow really be then you know something of the affair he say with a strong highland accent i know nothing i declare nothing except he name h be and you say he be a foreigner -- a italian -- eh he be in my service in leghorn for several year and on leave I he come to london and obtain a engagement as waiter in a restaurant he father live in leghorn he be doorkeeper at the prefecture but why be he here in scotland how can i tell you know something of the affair i mean that you suspect somebody or you would have no objection to give evidence at the inquiry i have no suspicion to I the affair be just as much of a enigma as to you i hasten at once to explain my only fear be that if the assassin know that i have identify he he would take care not to betray himself you therefore think he will betray himself i hope so by the fact that the man be attack with a italian stiletto it would seem that he assailant be a fellow-countryman suggest the detective the evidence certainly point to that i reply you do not happen to be aware of anyone -- any foreigner i mean -- who be or might be he enemy i respond in the negative ah he go on these foreigner be always fight among themselves and use knife i do ten year ' service in edinburgh and make lot of arrest for stab affray italian like greek be a dangerous lot when they blood be up then he add : personally it seem to I that the murder man be entice from london to that spot and coolly do away with -- from some motive of revenge most probably most probably i say a vendetta perhaps i live in italy and therefore know the italian well i add i have give he my card and tell he with whom i be stay where be you yesterday sir he inquire presently i be shooting -- on the other side of the nithsdale i answer and then go on to explain my movement without however mention my visit to rannoch and although you know the murder man so intimately you have no suspicion of anyone in this district who be acquaint with he i know no one who know he when he leave my service he have never be in england you say he be engage in service in london yes at a restaurant in oxford street i believe i meet he accidentally in pall mall one evening and he tell I so you do not know the name of the restaurant he do tell I but unfortunately i have forget the detective draw a deep breath of regret someone who wait for he on the edge of that wood step out and kill he -- that be evident he say without a doubt and my belief be that it be a italian there be two foreigner who sleep at a common lodging-house two night ago and go on tramp towards glasgow we have telegraph after they and hope we shall find they scotsman or englishman never use a knife of that pattern with he latter remark i entirely coincide in my own mind that be the strongest argument in favor of leithcourt 's innocence that the tenant of rannoch have keep that secret tryst in daily patience i know from my own observation yet to I it scarcely seem feasible that he would use a weapon so peculiarly italian and yet so terribly deadly and then when i reflect further recollect that the body i have discover be that of a woman and not a man i stand staggered and bewildered by the utterly inexplicable enigma i promise the burly detective that in exchange for he secrecy regard my statement that i would assist he in every manner possible in the solution of the problem the real name of the murder man must be at all cost withhold i urge it must not appear in the papers for i feel confident that only by the pretense that he be unknown can we arrive at the truth if he name be give at the inquiry then the assassin will certainly know that i have identify he and what then well i say with some hesitation while i be believe to be in ignorance we shall have opportunity for obtain the truth then you do really suspect he say again look at I with those cold blue eye i know not whom to suspect i declare it be a mystery why the man who be once my faithful servant should be entice to that wood and stab to the heart there be no one in the vicinity who know he not to my knowledge we might obtain he address in london through he father in leghorn suggest the officer i will write to-day if you so desire i say readily indeed i will get my friend the british consul to go round and see the old man and telegraph the address if he obtain it capital he declare if you will do we this favor we shall be greatly indebted to you it be fortunate that we have establish the victim 's identity -- otherwise we might be entirely in the dark a murder foreigner be always more or less of a mystery therefore then and there i take a sheet of paper and write to my old friend hutcheson at leghorn ask he to make immediate inquiry of olinto 's father as to he son 's address in london i say nothing to the police of that strange adventure of mine over in lambeth or of how the man now dead have save my life that he enemy be my own he have most distinctly tell I therefore i feel some apprehension that i myself be not safe yet in my hip pocket i always carry my revolver -- just as i do in italy -- and i rather pride myself on my ability to shoot straight we sit for a long time discuss the strange affair in order to betray no eagerness to get away i offer the big highlander a cigar from my case and we smoke together the inquiry would be hold on the morrow he tell I but as far as the public be concern the body would remain as that of some person unknown and you have better not come to my uncle 's house or send anyone i say if you desire to see I send I a line and i will meet you here in dumfry it will be safer the officer look at I with those keen eye of he and say : really mr gregg i can not quite make you out i confess you seem to be apprehensive of you own safety why italian be a very curious people i respond quickly they vendetta extend widely sometimes then you have reason to believe that the enemy of this poor fellow santinus may be you enemy also one never know whom one offend when live in italy i laugh as lightly as i could endeavor to allay he suspicion he may have fall beneath the assassin 's knife by give quite a small and possibly innocent offense to somebody italian method be not english you know by jove sir and i be jolly glad they be not he say i should not think a police officer 's life be a very safe one among all those secret murder society i have read about ah what you read about they be often very much exaggerated i assure he it be the vendetta which be such a stain upon the character of the modern italian and depend upon it this affair in rannoch wood be the outcome of some revenge or other -- probably over a love affair but you will assist we sir he urge you know the italian language which will be of great advantage besides the victim be you servant be discreet i say and in return i will do my very utmost to assist you in hunting down the assassin and thus we make we compact half-an-hour after i be drive in the dog-cart through the pour rain up the hill out of gray old dumfry to my uncle 's house as i descend from the cart and give it over to a groom old davi the butler come forward say in a low voice : there be miss leithcourt wait to see you mr gordon she be in the morning-room and be there a hour she ask I not to tell anyone else she be here sir then my aunt have not see she i exclaimed scent mystery in this unexpected visit no sir she wish to see you alone sir i walk across the big hall and along the corridor to the room the old man have indicate and as i open the door and muriel leithcourt in plain black rise to meet I i plainly see from she white haggard countenance that something have happen -- that she have be force by circumstance to come to I in strictest confidence be she i wonder about to reveal to I the truth chapter vi the gathering of the cloud mr gregg exclaim the girl with agitation as she put forth she black-gloved hand i -- i suppose you know -- you have hear all about the discovery to-day up at the wood i need not tell you anything about it yes miss leithcourt i only wish you would tell I about it i say gravely invite she to a chair and seat myself i have hear some extraordinary story about a man be find dead but i have be in dumfry nearly all day who be the man ah that we do not know she reply pale-faced and anxious she attitude be as though she wish to confide in I and yet still hesitate to do so you have be wait for I quite a long time davi tell I i regret that you should have do this if you have leave word that you wish to see I i would have come over to you at once no i want to see you alone -- that be the reason i be here they must not know at home that i have be over here so i purposely ask the man not to announce I to you aunt you want to see I privately i say in a low earnest voice why be there any service i can render you yes a very great one she respond with quick eagerness i -- well -- the fact be i have summon courage to come to you and beg of you to help I i be in great distress -- and i have not a single friend whom i can trust -- in whom i can confide i shall esteem it the highest honor if you will trust I i say in deep earnestness i can only assure you that i will remain loyal to you interest and to yourself ah i believe you will mr gregg she declare with enthusiasm she large dark eye turn upon I -- the eye of a woman in sheer and bitter despair she face be perfect one of the most handsome i have ever gaze upon the more i saw of she the greater be the fascination she hold over I a silence fall between we as she sit with she gloved hand lie idly in she lap she lip move nervously but no sound come from they so agitate be she so eager to tell I something and yet at the same time reluctant to take I into she confidence well i ask at last in a low voice i be quite ready to render you any service if you will only command I ah but i fear what i require will strike you as so unusual -- you will hesitate to act when i explain what service i require of you she say doubtfully i can not tell you until i hear you wish i say smile and yet puzzle at she attitude it concern the terrible discovery make up in rannoch wood she say in a hoarse nervous voice at last that unknown man be murder -- stab to the heart well well she say scarcely above a whisper i have suspicion of the murder man 's identity no of the assassin i glance at she sharply and see the intense look in she dark wide-open eye you believe you know who deal the blow i have a suspicion -- that be all only i want you to help I if you will most certainly i respond but if you believe you know the assassin you probably know something of the victim only that he look like a foreigner then you have see he i exclaimed much surprised my remark cause she to hold she breath for a instant then she answer rather lamely it seem to I : i see he when the keeper bring the body to the castle now accord to the account i have hear the police have convey the dead man direct from the wood into dumfry be it possible therefore that she have see olinto before he meet with he sudden end i fear to press she for a explanation at that moment but nevertheless the admission that she have see he strike I as a very peculiar fact you judge he to be a foreigner i remark as casually as i could from he feature and complexion i guess he to be italian she respond quickly at which i pretend to express surprise i see he after the keeper have find he besides she go on the stiletto be evidently a italian one which would almost make it appear that a foreigner be the assassin be that you own suspicion no why she hesitate a moment then in a low eager voice she say : because i have already see that three-edged knife in another person 's possession that be pretty strong evidence i declare the person in question will have to prove that he be not in rannoch wood last evening at nightfall how do you know it be do at nightfall she ask quickly with some surprise half-rising from she chair i merely surmise that it be i respond inwardly blame myself for my ill-timed admission ah she say with a slight sigh there be more mystery in this affair than we have yet discover mr gregg what i wonder bring the unfortunate young man up into we wood a appointment without a doubt but with whom she shake she head say : my father often go to that spot to shoot pigeon in the evening he tell we so at luncheon to-day how fortunate he be not there last night or he might be suspect yes i say it be a very fortunate circumstance for it can not be a pleasant experience to be under suspicion of be a assassin he be at home last night be he i add casually of course do not you recollect that when you call he chat with you i do some typewriting for he in the study and we be together all the afternoon -- or at least till nearly five o'clock when we go out into the hall to tea then what be you theory regard the affair i inquire rather puzzle why she should so decisively prove a alibi for she father it seem certain that the poor fellow go to the wood by appointment and be kill but have you be up to the spot since the finding of the body no have you yes the affair interested I and as soon as i recognize the old italian knife in the hand of the keeper i go up there and look about i be glad i do so for i find something which seem to have escape the notice of the detective and what be that i ask eagerly why about three yard from the pool of blood where the unfortunate foreigner be find be another small pool of blood where the grass and fern around be all crush down as though there have be a struggle there there may have be a struggle at that spot and the man may have stagger some distance before he fall dead not if he have be strike in the heart as they say he would fall would he not she suggest no the police seem very dense and this plain fact have not yet occur to they they theory be the same as what you suggest but my own be something quite different mr gregg i believe that a second person also fall a victim she add in a low distinct tone i gaze at she open-mouthed do she i wonder know the actual truth be she aware that the woman who have fall there have disappear a second person i echo as though in surprise then do you believe that a double murder be commit i draw my conclusion from the fact that the young man on be strike in the heart could not have go such a distance as that which separate the one mark from the other but he might have be slightly wound -- on the hand or in the face -- at first and then at the spot where he be find strike fatally i suggest she shake she head dubiously but make no reply to my argument she confidence in she own surmise make it quite apparent that by some unknown means she be aware of the second victim indeed a few moment later she say to I : it be for this reason mr gregg that i have seek you in confidence nobody must know that i have come here to you or they would suspect and if suspicion fall upon I it would bring upon I a fate worse than death remember therefore that my future be entirely in you hand i do not quite understand i say rise and stand before she in the fading twilight while the rain drive upon the old diamond window pane but i can only assure you that whatever confidence you repose in I i shall never abuse miss leithcourt i know i know she say quickly i trust you in this matter implicitly i have come to you for many reason chief of they be that if a second victim have fall beneath the hand of the assassin it be i know a woman a woman whom at present i can not tell you i must first establish the true fact if this woman be really stricken down then she body lie conceal somewhere in the vicinity we must find it and bring home the crime to the guilty one but if we succeed in find it could we place we hand upon the assassin i ask look straight at she if we find it the crime would then tell its own tale -- it would convict the person in whose hand i have see that fatal weapon be she clear bold answer then you wish I to assist you in this search miss leithcourt i say wonder if she suspicion rest upon that mysterious yachtsman philip hornby the man to whom she be engage yes i would beg of you to do you utmost in secret to endeavor to discover the body of the second victim it be a woman -- of that i be certain find she and we shall then be able to bring the crime home to the assassin but my search may bring suspicion upon I i remark it will be difficult to examine the whole wood without arouse the curiosity of somebody -- the keeper or the police i have already think of that she say i will pretend to-morrow to lose this watch-bracelet in the wood and she hold up she slim wrist to show I the little enameled watch set in she bracelet then you and i will search for it diligently and the police will never suspect the real reason of we investigation to-morrow i shall write to you tell you about my loss and you will come over to rannoch and offer to help I i be silent for a moment be mr woodroffe back at the castle i hear he be to return to-day no i have a letter from he from bordeaux a week ago he be still on the continent i believe indeed he have go to russia where he sometimes have business i ask you the question miss muriel because i think if mr woodroffe be here he might object to we search in company i explain smile she cheek flush slightly as though confuse at my reference to she engagement and she say mischievously : i do not see why he should object in the least if you be good enough to assist I to search for my bracelet he surely ought to be much oblige to you it be on the tip of my tongue to explain to that dark-eyed handsome girl the circumstance in which i have meet she lover on the sunny mediterranean shore yet prudence forbid I to refer to the matter and i at once gladly accept she invitation to investigate the curious disappearance of the body of poor olinto 's fellow-victim what secret knowledge could be possess by that smart handsome girl before I that she suspicion be in the right direction i feel confident yet if the dead woman have be remove and hide by the assassin it must have be after the discovery make by I the fellow must have actually dare to return to the spot and carry off the victim yet if he have actually do that why do he allow the corpse of the italian to remain and await discovery he might perhaps have be disturb and compel to make good he escape if the woman be really remove the assassin must surely have have some assistance i point out he could not have carry the body very far unaided she agree with I but express a belief that the double crime have be commit alone and unaided have you any idea as to the motive i ask she eager to hear she reply well she answer hesitatingly if the woman have fall a victim the motive will become plain but if not then the matter must remain a complete mystery you tell I miss muriel that you suspect the truth and yet you deny all knowledge of the murder man i exclaimed in a tone of slight reproach until we have clear up the mystery of the woman i can say nothing be she answer i can only tell you mr gregg that if what i suspect be true then the affair will be find to be one of the strangest most startling and most ingenious plot ever devise by one man against the life of another then a man be the assassin you think i exclaimed quickly i believe so but even of that i be not at all sure we must first find the woman she seem so positive that a woman have also fall beneath that deadly _ misericordium _ that i fall to wonder whether she like myself have discover the body and be therefore certain that a second crime have be commit but i do not seek to question she further lest she own suspicion might become arouse my own policy be to remain silent and to wait the woman sit before I be herself a mystery then when the rain have abate i tell davi to send she trap a little way up the high-road so that my aunt and uncle should not see she depart and after help she on with she loose driving-coat we leave by one of the servant ' entrance and i see she into she high dog-cart and stand barehead in the muddy high-road as she drive away into the gloom \* \* \* \* \* rannoch wood be already in its gold-brown glory of autumn and as i stand with muriel leithcourt on the edge of it near the spot where olinto santinus have fall the morning sun be shine in a cloudless sky true to she promise she have send I a note by one of the groom ask I to help search for she bracelet and i have drive over at once to rannoch and find she alone await I the shoot party have go over to a distant part of the estate therefore we be able to stroll together up the hill and commence we investigation without let or hindrance she be sensibly dress in a short tweed skirt high shooting-boot and a tam-o ' - shanter hat while i also have on a old shooting-suit and carry a thick serviceable stick with which i could prod likely spot on arrival at the wood i ask she opinion which be the most likely corner but she reply : i know so little of this place mr gregg you have know it for year while this be only my first season here very well i answer let we place ourselves in the position of the murderer who probably know the wood and wish to conceal a body in the vicinity without risk of convey it far on this the left side the wood have be thin out for nearly half a mile and therefore afford but little cover while here to the right it slope down gently to the valley and be very thick and partly impenetrable there can therefore have be no two course open to he he would look for a likely place to the right let we start here and first take a small circle examine every bush carefully the body may have easily be push in beneath a thicket and well escape observation and so together after take we bearing we start off work we way into the thick undergrowth beat with we stick and make minute examination of every bush or heap of dead leaf in part the great spreading tree shut out the light render we investigation very difficult but we keep on my companion advance with a eagerness which show that the fact of the woman 's body be there be no mere surmise all through the morning we walk on we hand badly tear by bramble even muriel 's thick glove do not wholly protect she and once when she receive a nasty scratch across the cheek she stop and laughingly exclaim : now what untruth must i invent to account for that my own coat be badly tear and more than once i be compel to scramble through almost impassable thicket yet we find no trace of any previous intruder and have complete we circle be compel to admit that the gruesome evidence of the second crime do not exist at that spot more than once i feel half inclined to tell she how i have actually discover the body of the woman yet on reflection i foresee that in such circumstance silence be best if i desire to solve the strange complicated enigma which have thus culminate in a double crime it would be necessary for I to keep my own counsel and remain patient and watchful when hutcheson reply from leghorn and when i discover where olinto be employ i might perhaps follow up the clue from that end i might find he wife armida and learn something of importance from she so i be hopeful and by reason of that hope remain silent muriel be untiring in she activity hither and thither she go beat down the high bracken and tangle of weed poke with she stick into every hole and corner and go further and further into the wood in the certainty that the body be therein conceal for my own part however i be not too sanguine of success the portion of the wood which we have already exhaust seem to be the most likely point to carry the body far would require assistance and in my own mind i believe the crime to have be the work of one person there be no path in the wood in that direction but soon we come to a deep wooded ravine of the existence of which i be in ignorance it be a kind of small glen through which a rivulet flow but the bank be cover with a thick impenetrable undergrowth out of which spring many fine old tree a place that have apparently exist for century undisturbed for here and there a giant trunk that have decay and fall lay across the bank or have roll into the rocky bed far below this be a most likely place declare my dainty little companion as we approach it anything could easily be conceal in that high bracken down there let we search the whole glen from end to end she cry with enthusiasm act upon she suggestion and without thought of luncheon we make a descent of the steep bank until we reach the rocky bed of the stream and then by spring from stone to stone -- sometimes slip into the water be it say -- we commence to beat the bracken and carefully examine every bush progress be not swift once the girl lithe and athletic as she be slip off a mossy stone into a hole where the water be up to she knee but she only laugh gayly at the accident and wring out she wet skirt say : it do not matter in the least if we only find what we be in search of and then undaunted she go on spring from stone to stone and steadying herself with she stick if we could only discover the body of the dead woman then the rest would be clear she declare she would openly denounce the assassin as we go on i revolved within my mind all the curious circumstance in connection with the amazing affair and recollect my old friend jack durnford 's word when we stand upon the quarter-deck of the _ bulwark _ and i have relate to he the visit of the mysterious yacht i too have leave one effort untried and i blame myself for overlook it i have not seek of that bond street photographer the name and address of the original of the photograph that have be mutilate and destroy -- that girl with the magnificent eye that have so attract I the afternoon pass and yet we be not successful i be faint with hunger and thirst yet my companion do not once complain she energy be marvelous -- and yet be she not hunting down a criminal be she not determine to obtain such evidence as would enable she to speak the truth fearlessly and with confidence that it would have the effect of convict the guilty one slowly we toil on up the picturesque little glen for nearly a mile and a half its beauty be extraordinary and the silence be unbroken save for the musical ripple of the water over the stone hide there in the center of that great wood no one have visit it perhaps for year not even the keeper for no path lead there and by reason of the tangle of briar and bush it be utterly ungetatable indeed it have ruin we clothes to search there and as we go on with so many winding and turn we become utterly out of we bearing we know ourselves to be in the center of the wood but that be all the sun have set and the sky above show the crimson of the distant afterglow warn we that it be time we begin to think of how to make we exit we be pass around a sharp bend in the glen where the boulder be so thickly moss-grown that we foot fall noiselessly when i think i hear a voice and raise my hand we both halt suddenly someone be there i whisper quickly behind that rock she nod in the affirmative for she too have hear the voice we listen but the sound be not repeat that someone be on the other side of the rock i know for in a tree in the vicinity a thrush be hop from twig to twig sound its alarm-cry and object to be disturbed therefore we creep silently forward together to ascertain who be the intruder the only manner however in which to get a view beyond the huge rock that have fall across the stream century ago have divert its channel be to clamber up its mossy side to the summit this we do eagerly and breathlessly without betray we presence by the utterance of a single word to reach the side of the boulder we be compel to walk through the shallow water but muriel quite undaunted spring lithely along at my side and with one accord we swarm up the steep rock grip its slippery face with we hand and lay ourselves flat as we come to its summit then together we peer over just however in time to see two dark figure of man disappear into the thicket on the opposite side of the glen who be they i wonder i ask do you recognize they no they be entire stranger to I be she answer but they seem fairly well dress perhaps two sportsman from some shooting-party in the neighborhood they have lose they way most probably but i do not think they carry gun i say one of they have something over he shoulder be not it a gun i think it be no he be not carry it like he would carry a gun it be short -- and seem more like a spade a spade she gasp quickly in a low voice a spade be you certain of that no not at all certain we only have a instantaneous glance of they we be unfortunately too late to see they face to face the back of one of the man the tall fellow in the brown suit be broad and square -- the back of someone who be familiar to I only for the moment i can not recollect whose it resemble she only speak in a whisper fear lest we should be discover i long to scramble down and rush after the intruder only the belief that one of they carry a spade and the other a iron bar strike I as curious while at the same moment my eye catch sight of a portion of the ground below we at the base of the rock which have evidently be recently disturb it be a spade the man be carry i cry excitedly look down there they have just be bury something she quick eye follow the direction i indicate and she answer : i really believe they have conceal something then when we have allow the man to get beyond hearing we both slip down to the other side of the boulder and there discover many sign that the earth have be hurriedly excavate and only just replace quicker than it take to describe the exciting incident which follow we break down the branch of a tree and with it commence move the freshly disturbed earth which be still soft and easily remove muriel find a dead branch in the vicinity and both of we set to work with a will eager to ascertain what be hide there that something have certainly be conceal be to we quite evident but what it really be we could not surmise the hole they have dig do not seem large enough to admit a human body yet leave have be carefully strew over the place which if approach from any other point than the high-up one whence we have see it would arouse no suspicion that the ground have ever be interfere with digging with a piece of wood be hard and laborious work and it be a long time before we remove sufficient earth to make a hole of any size but muriel exert all she energy and both of we work on in dogged silence full of wonder and anticipation with a spade we should have soon be able to investigate but the earth have apparently be stamp down hard prior to the last cover be put upon it we progress be very slow and difficult at last a quarter of a hour or so after we have commence muriel standing in the hole and have dig she stake deeply into the ground suddenly cry : look look mr gregg why -- whatever be that i bent forward as she indicate and my eye meet a object so unexpected that i be hold dumb and motionless by what we have succeed in discover the mystery be increase rather than diminish i give vent to a ejaculation of complete bewilderment and look blankly into my companion 's face the amazing enigma be surely complete chapter vii contain a surprise the first object bring to light about two foot beneath the surface be a piece of dark gray woolen stuff which when the mold be remove prove to be part of a woman 's skirt with frantic eagerness i get into the hole we have make and remove the soil with my hand until i suddenly touch something hard a body lay there double up and crush into the well-like hole the man have dig together we pull it out when to my surprise on wipe away the dirt from the hard waxen feature i recognize it as the body of armida the woman who have be my servant in leghorn and who have afterwards marry olinto both have be assassinate when muriel gaze upon the dead woman 's face she give vent to a expression of surprise the body be evidently not that of the person she have expect to find who be she i wonder my companion ejaculate not a lady evidently by she dress and hand evidently not be my response for i still deem it best to keep my own counsel i recollect the story olinto have tell I about he wife of she illness and she longing to return to italy yet the dead woman 's countenance must have be healthy enough in life although she hand be rough and hard show that she have be do manual labor armida have be a particularly good housemaid a black-haired black-eyed tuscan quick cleanly and full of a keen sense of humor it be a great shock to I to find she lie there dead the breast of she dress be stain with dry blood which on examination i find have issue from a deep and fatal wound beneath the ear where she have be strike a unerring blow that have sever the artery those man -- those man who bury she i wonder who they be my companion exclaim in a hushed voice we must follow they and ascertain they be certainly the murderer who have return in secret and conceal the evidence of this second crime yes i say let we go after they they must not escape we then leave the exhume body beneath a tree i catch muriel by the waist and wade across the deep channel worn by the stream at that point after which we both ascend the steep bank where the pair have disappear in the darkness of the wood i blame myself a thousand time for not follow they yet my suspicion have not be arouse until after they have disappear the back of the man in a snuff-colored suit be she feel confident familiar to she she repeat what she have already tell I yet she could not remember where she have see a similar figure before we go on through the gloomy forest for the light have fade and evening be now creep on from time to time we halt and listen but there be a dead silence break only by the shrill cry of a night bird and the low rustling of the leaf in the autumn wind the man know they way it seem even though the wood be trackless yet they have nearly twenty minute start of we and in that time they might be already out in the open country would they succeed in evade we yet even if they do i could describe the dress of one of they while that of he companion be as far as i make out dark blue of a somewhat nautical cut he wear also a flat cap with a peak we go on striking straight for the open moorland which we know bound the wood in that direction and before the light have entirely fade we find ourselves out amongst the heather with the distant hill loom dark against the horizon but we see no sign of the man who have so secretly conceal the body of they victim i will take you back to the castle miss leithcourt i say and then i 'll drive on into dumfry and see the police these man must be arrest yes do she urge i will get into the house by the stable-yard for they must not see I in this terrible plight it be rough walk therefore at my invitation she take my arm and as she do so i feel that she be shiver you be very wet i remark i hope you will not take cold oh i be use to get wet i drive and cycle a lot you know and very often get drench be she reply then after a pause she say : we must discover who that woman be she seem from she complexion and she hair to be a foreigner like the man yes i think so be my reply i will tell the police all that we have find out and they will go there presently and recover the body if they can only find those two man then we should know the truth she declare one of they -- the one in brown -- be unusually broad-shouldered and seem to walk with a slight stoop you expect to discover another woman do you not miss leithcourt i ask presently as we walk across the moor yes she answer i expect to find a entirely different person and if you have find she it would have prove the guilt of someone with whom you be acquaint she nod in the affirmative then what we have find this evening do not convey to you the identity of the assassin no unfortunately it do not we must for the present leave the matter in the hand of the police but if the identity of the dead woman be establish i ask it might furnish I with a clue she exclaim quickly yes try and discover who she be who be the woman you expect to find a friend -- a very dear friend will you not tell I she name i inquire no it would be unfair to she she respond decisively a answer which to I be particularly tantalizing on we plod in silence we thought too full for word be it not strange that the mysterious yachtsman should be she lover and stranger still that on recognize I he should have escape not only from scotland but away to the continent be not that in itself evidence of guilt and fear it be quite dark when i take leave of my bright little companion who tire out and yet uncomplaining press my hand and wish I good fortune in my investigation i shall await you to-morrow afternoon call and tell I everything will not you i promise and then she disappear into the great stable-yard behind the castle while i go on down the dark road and then strike across the open field to my uncle 's house at half-past nine that night i pull up the dog-cart before the chief police-station in dumfry and alight at once seek the big fair highlander mackenzie with whom i have have the consultation on the previous day when we be seat in he room beneath the hiss gas-jet i related my adventure and the result of my investigation what he cry jump up you have unearth another body -- a woman 's i have and what be more i can identify she i reply she name be armida and she be wife of the murder man olinto santinus then both husband and wife be kill without a doubt -- a double tragedy but the two man who conceal the body will you describe they i do so and he write at my dictation afterwards remark -- we must find they and call in one of he sub-inspector he give he instruction for the immediate circulation of the description to all the police-station in the county say the two man be want on a charge of willful murder when the official have go out again and we be alone mackenzie turn to I and ask -- what induce you to search the wood why do you suspect a second crime he question nonplus I for the moment well you see i have identify the young man olinto and know he to be marry and devote to he wife i suspect that she have accompany he here it be entirely a vague surmise i wonder whether if the poor fellow have fall a victim to he enemy she have not also be strike down he lip be press together in distinct dissatisfaction i know my explanation to be a very lame one but at all hazard i could not import muriel 's name into the affair i have give she my promise and i intend to keep it then the body be still in the glen where you leave it yes if you wish i will take you to the spot i can drive you and you assistant up there certainly let we go he exclaim rise at once and ring he bell get three good lantern and some match and put they in this gentleman 's trap outside he say to the constable who answer he summons and tell gilbert campbell that i want he to go with I up to rannoch wood yes sir answer the man and the door again close it be a pity -- a thousand pity mr gregg that you do not stop those two man who bury the body they be already across the stream and disappear into the thicket before i mount the rock i explain besides at the moment i have no suspicion of what they would be do i believe they to be straggler from a neighbor shooting-party who have lose they way ah most unfortunate he say i hope they do not escape we if they be foreigner they be not likely to get away but if they be english or scot then i fear there be but little chance of we come up with they yesterday at the inquest the identity of the murder man be strictly preserved and the inquiry be adjourn for a fortnight of course my name be not mention i say of course not be the detective 's reply then he ask : when do you expect to get a telegram from you friend the consul at leghorn i be anxious for that in order that we may commence inquiry in london the day after to-morrow i hope he will certainly reply at once provide the dead man 's father can still be find and at that moment a tall thin man who prove to be detective campbell enter and five minute later we be all three drive over the uneven cobble of dumfry and out in the darkness towards rannoch it be cloudy and starless with a chill mist hang over the valley but my uncle 's cob be a swift one and we soon begin to ascend the hill up past the castle and then turn to the left drive along a steep rough by-road which lead to the south of the wood and out across the moor when we reach the latter we all descend and i lead the horse for owe to the many treacherous bog it be unsafe to drive further so with mackenzie and campbell carry lantern we walk on carefully skirt the wood for nearly a mile until we come to the rough wall over which i have clamber with muriel i recognize the spot and have tie up the cob we all three plunge into the pitch-darkness of the wood keep straight on in the direction of the glen and halt every now and then to listen for the ripple of the stream at last after some difficulty we discover it and search along the bank with we three powerful light i presently detect the huge moss-grown boulder whereon i have stand when the pair of fugitive have disappear look i cry there be the spot and quickly we clamber down the steep bank lower ourselves by the branch of the tree until we come to the water into which i wade be follow closely by my two companion on gain the opposite side i clamber up to the base of the boulder and lower my lantern to reveal to they the gruesome evidence of the second crime but the next instant i cry -- why it be go go gasp the two man yes it be here look this be the hole where they bury it but they evidently return and find it exhume they have retake possession of it and carry it away the two detective gaze down to where i indicate and then look at each other without exchange a word as we stand there dumbfounded at the disappearance of the body the highlander 's quick glance catch something and stoop he pick it up and examine the little object by the aid of he lantern within he palm i see lie a tiny little gold cross about a inch long enamel in red while in the center be a circular miniature of a kneel saint a elegant and beautifully execute little trinket which might have adorn a lady 's bracelet this be a pretty little thing remark the detective it may possibly lead we to something but mr gregg he add turn to I be you quite certain you leave the body here certain i echo why look at the hole i make you do not think i have any interest in lead you here on a fool 's errand do you not at all he say apologetically only the whole affair seem so very inconceivable -- i mean that the man have once get rid of the evidence of they crime would hardly return to the spot and re-obtain possession of it unless they watch I exhume it and fear the consequence if it fall into you hand i suggest of course they might have watch you from behind the tree and when you have go they come and carry it away somewhere else he remark dubiously but even if they do it must be in this wood they would never risk carry a body very far and here be surely the best place of concealment in the whole country the only thing remain be to search the wood at daylight i suggest if the two man come back here during my absence they may still be on the watch in the vicinity most probably they be we must take every precaution he say decisively and then with we lantern lower we make a examination of the vicinity without however discover anything else to furnish we with a clew while i have be absent the body of the unfortunate armida have disappear -- a fact which know all that i do be doubly mysterious the pair have without doubt watch muriel and myself and as soon as we have go they have return and carry off the ghastly remains of the poor woman who have be so foully do to death but who be the man -- the fellow with the broad shoulder whom muriel recognize and the slim seafarer in he pilot-coat and peak cap the enigma each hour become more and more inscrutable at dawn mackenzie with four of he man make a thorough examination of the wood but although they continue until dusk they discover nothing neither be anything hear of the mysterious seafarer and he companion in brown tweeds i call on muriel as arrange and explain how the body have so suddenly disappear whereupon she stare at I pale-faced say -- the assassin must have watch we they be aware then that we have knowledge of they crime of course i say ah she cry hoarsely then we be both in deadly peril -- peril of we own life these people will hesitate at nothing both you and i be mark down by they without a doubt we must both be wary not to fall into any trap they may lay for we she very word seem a admission that she be aware of the identity of the conspirator and yet she would give I no clue to they we go out and up the drive together to the kennel where she father a tall impose figure in he shooting-kit be give order to the keeper hulloa gregg he cry merrily extend he hand you 'll make one of a party to glenlea to-morrow will not you paton and phillip be come ten sharp here and the lady be come out to lunch with we thanks i say accept with pleasure for by so do i see that i might be afford a opportunity of be near muriel the fact that the assassin be aware of we knowledge seem to have cause she the greatest apprehension lest evil should befall we then as we turn away to go back to the house leithcourt say to I -- you know all about the discovery up at the wood the other day horrible affair -- a young foreigner find murder yes i have hear about it i respond and the police be worse than useless he declare with disgust they have not discover who the fellow be yet why if it have happen anywhere else but in scotland they would have arrest the assassin before this he be a entire stranger i hear i remark and then add : you often go up to the wood of a evening after pigeon it be fortunate you be not there that evening eh he glance at I quickly with he brow slightly contract as though he do not exactly comprehend I in a instant i see that my remark have cause he quick apprehension yes he answer with a sickly smile which he intend should convey to I utter unconcern they might have suspect I it certainly be a disagreeable affair to happen on one 's property i say still watch he narrowly and then muriel at he side manage with she feminine ingenuity to divert the conversation into a different channel next day i accompany the party over to glenlea about five mile distant and at noon at a spot previously arrange we find the lady await we with luncheon spread under the tree as soon as we approach muriel come forward quickly hand I a telegram say that it have be send over by one of my uncle 's groom at the moment they be leave the castle i tear it open eagerly and read its contents then turn to my companion say in as quiet a voice as i could command -- i must go up to london to-night whereat the man one and all express hope that i should soon return leithcourt 's party be a friendly set and at heart i be sorry to leave scotland yet the telegram make it imperative for it be from frank hutcheson in leghorn and read -- _ make inquiry olinto santinus marry you servant armida at italian consulate-general in london about a year ago they live 64b albany road camberwell : he be employ waiter ferrarus 's restaurant westbourne grove -- british consulate leghorn _ the lunch be a merry one as shooting luncheon usually be and while we eat the keeper pack we morning bag -- a considerable one -- into the perth-cart in wait then when we could wander away alone together i explain to muriel that the reason of my sudden journey to london be in order to continue my investigation regard the mysterious affair this puzzle she for i have not of course reveal to she that i have identify olinto yet i manage to make such excuse and promise to return that i think allay all she suspicion and that night after call upon the detective mackenzie i take the sleeping-car express to euston the restaurant which hutcheson have indicate be i find situate about half-way up westbourne grove nearly opposite whiteley 's a small place where confectionery and sweet be display in the window together with long-necked flask of italian chiantus chump-chop small joint and tomato it be soon after nine o'clock when i enter the long shop with its row of marble-topped table and greasy lounge of red plush a unhealthy-looking lad be sweep out the place with wet saw-dust and a big dark-bearded flabby-faced man in shirt-sleeve stand behind the small counter polish some fork i wish to see signor ferrarus i say address he there be no ferrarus he be dead respond the man in broken english my name be odinzoff i buy the place from madame you be russian i presume polish m ` sieur -- from varsovie i have see from the first moment we have meet that he be no italian he be too bulky and he face too broad and flat i have come to inquire after a waiter you have in you service a italian name santinus he be my servant for some year and i naturally take a interest in he santinus he repeat oh i you mean olinto he be not here yet he come at ten o'clock this reply surprise I i have expect the restaurant-keeper to express regret at he disappearance yet he speak as though he have be at work as usual on the previous day may i have a liqueur brandy i ask see that i would be compel to take something perhaps you will have one with I ach no but a kümmel -- yes i will have a kümmel and he fill we glass and toss off he own at a single gulp smack he lip after it for the average russian dearly love he national decoction of caraway seed you find olinto a good servant i suppose i say for want of something else to say excellent the italian be the best waiter in the world i be russian but dare not employ a russian waiter these english would not come to my shop if i do i look around and it strike I that the trade of the place mainly consist in chop and steak for chance customer at mid-day and tea and cake for those swarm of woman who each afternoon buzz around that long line of window of the world 's provider i could see that he be a cheap trade as reveal by the print notice stick upon one of the long fly-blown mirror : ice _ 4d _ and _ 6d _ how long have olinto be with you i inquire about a year -- perhaps a little more i trust he implicitly and i leave he in charge when i go away for holiday he do not get along very well with the cook -- who be milanese these italian from different province always quarrel he add laugh if you live in italy you know that no doubt i laugh in chorus and then glance at my watch say : i 'll wait for he if he will be here at ten i would much like to see he again the russian be by no means nonplused but merely remark -- he be late sometimes but not often he live on the other side of london -- over at camberwell he confidence that the waiter would return strike I as extremely curious nevertheless i possess myself in patience stroll up and down the restaurant and then stand watch the traffic in the grove outside the man odinzoff seem a quick hard-working fellow with a keen eye to business for he fall to polish the top of the marble table with a pail and brush at the same time direct the work of the pallid-looking youth suddenly a side door open and the cook put he head in to speak with he master in french he be a typical italian about forty with dark mustach turn upward and a easy-going careless manner see I however and believe I to be a customer he turn and close the door quickly in that instant i notice the high broadness of he shoulder and he back strike I as strangely similar to that of the man in brown whom we have see disappear in rannoch wood the suspicion hold I breathless be this russian endeavor to deceive I when he declare that olinto would arrive in a few minute it seem curious for the man now dead must i reflect have be away at least four day surely he absence from work have cause the proprietor considerable inconvenience that be you cook be not it the milanese who be quarrelsome i laugh when the side door have close yes m ` sieur but emilio be a very good workman -- and very honest even though i have constantly to complain that he use too much oil in he cooking these english do not like the oil i stand in the doorway again watch the busy throng pass outside towards royal oak ten o'clock strike from a neighbor church and i still wait know only too well that i wait in vain for a man whose body have already be commit to the grave outside that far-away old scotch town but i wait in order to ascertain the motive of the bearded russian in lead I to believe that the young fellow would really return presently odinzoff go outside carry with he two board upon which the menu of the eight-penny luncheon this day be write in scrawly character and proceed to affix they to the shop-front this be my opportunity and quick as think i move towards where the unhealthy youth be at work and whisper : i 'll give you half-a-sovereign if you 'll answer my question truthfully now tell I be the cook the man i have just see here yesterday yes sir be he here the day before no sir he be be away ill for four day and you master he be be away too sir i have no time to put any further question for the russian re-enter at that moment and the youth busy himself rub the front of the counter in pretense that i have not speak to he indeed i have some difficulty in slip the promise coin into he hand at a moment when he master be not look then i pace up and down the restaurant wait patiently and wonder whether the absence of emilio have any connection with the tragedy up in rannoch wood while i stand there a rather thin respectably-dressed man enter and seat himself upon one of the plush lounge at the further end remove he bowler hat and order from the proprietor a chop and a pot of tea then take a newspaper from he pocket he settle himself to read apparently oblivious to he surroundings and yet as i watch i see that over the top of he paper he be carefully take in the general appearance of the place and he eye be keenly follow the russian 's movement the latter shout -- in french -- the order for the chop through the speaking-tube to the man emilio and then return to he customer he spread out a napkin and place a small cruet with knife fork and bread before he but the customer seem immerse in he paper and never look up until after the russian 's back be turn then so deep be he interest in the place and so keen those dark eye of he that the truth suddenly dawn upon I mackenzie have telegraph to scotland yard and the customer sit there be a detective who have come to investigate i have advance to the counter to chat again with the proprietor when a quick step behind I cause I to turn before I stand the slim figure of a man in a straw hat and rather seedy black jacket _ dio signor padrone _ he cry i stagger as though i have receive a blow olinto santinus in the flesh smile and well stand there before I chapter viii life 's counter-claim no word of mine can express my absolute and abject amazement when i face the man whom i have see lie cold and dead upon that gray stone slab in the mortuary at dumfry my eye catch the customer who on the entry of olinto have drop he paper and sit stare at he in wonderment the detective have evidently be furnish with a photograph of the dead man and now like myself discover he alive and living signor padrone cry the man whose appearance be so absolutely bewildering how do you find I here i admit that i deceive you when i tell you i work at the milano he go on rapidly in italian but it be under compulsion -- my action that night be not my own -- but those of other yes i understand i say but come out into the street i do not wish to speak before these people you padrone know italian no doubt ah only a very little he answer smile have no fear of he but there be emilio the cook then you have meet he he exclaim quickly with a strange look of apprehension he be a undesirable person signora so i gather i answer but i desire to speak to you outside -- not here and then turn with a smile to the pole i apologize for take away he servant for a few minute recollect i be he old master i add of course m ` sieur answer the pole bow politely speak with he where and how long you will he be entirely at you service and when we be outside in westbourne grove olinto walk by my side in wonderment i ask suddenly : tell I have you ever be in scotland -- at dumfry never signore in my life why answer I another question i say quickly you married armida at the italian consulate where be she now -- where be she this morning he turn pale and i see a complete change in he countenance ah signora he respond i only wish i could tell it be untrue that she be a invalid i go on or that you live in lambeth you address be in albany road camberwell you can not deny these fact i do not deny they signor commendatore but how do you learn this the authority in italy know everything i answer like that of all you countryman you record be write down at the commune it be a clean one at any rate signora he declare with some slight warmth i have a permesso to carry a revolver which be in itself sufficient proof that i be a man of spotless character i cast no reflection whatever upon you olinto i answer i have merely inquire after you wife and you do not give I a direct reply we have walk to the royal oak and stand talk on the curb outside i give you no reply because i can not he say in italian armida -- my poor armida -- have leave home why do you tell I such a tale of distress regard she as i have already explain signora i be not then master of my own action i be rule by other but i save you life at risk of my own some day when it be safe i will reveal to you everything let we allow the past to remain i say where be you wife now he hesitate a moment look straight into my face well signor commendatore to tell the truth she have disappear disappear i echo and have you not make any report to the police no why not for reason know only to myself i do not wish the police to pry into my private affair i know because you be once convict at lucca of use a knife -- eh i recollect quite well that affair -- a love affair be it not yes signor commendatore but i be a youth then -- a mere boy then tell I the circumstance in which armida have disappear i urge for i see quite plainly that he sudden meeting with I have upset he and that he be try to hold back from I some story which he be burst to tell well signore he say at last in a low tone of confidence i do not like to trouble you with my private affair after those untruth i tell you when we last meet go on i say tell I the truth after the exciting incident of we last meeting i be half inclined to doubt he the truth be signor commendatore that my wife have mysteriously disappear last Saturday at eleven o'clock she be talk over the garden wall with a neighbor and be then dress to go out she apparently go out but from that moment no one have see or hear of she it be on the tip of my tongue to tell he the ghastly truth yet so strange be the circumstance that he own double even to the mole upon he face should be lie dead and bury in scotland that i hesitate to relate what i know she speak english i suppose she could make herself understand very well he say with a sigh and i see a heavy thoughtful look upon he brow that he be really devote to she i know with the italian of whatever station in life love be all-consuming -- it be either perfect love or genuine hatred the tuscan character be one of two extreme i glance across the road and see that the detective who have order he chop and coffee have stop to light he pipe and be watch we have you any idea where you wife be or what have induce she to go away from home perhaps you have some word word signora he echo why we be the happiest pair in all london no unkind word ever pass between we there seem absolutely no reason whatever why she should go away without wish I a word of farewell but why have not you tell the police for reason that i have already state i prefer to make inquiry for myself and in what have you inquiry result nothing -- absolutely nothing he say gravely you do not suspect any plot i recollect that night in lambeth you tell I that you have enemy ah so i have signora -- and so have you he exclaim hoarsely yes my poor armida may have be entrap by they and if entrap what then then they would kill she with as little compunction as they would a fly he say ah you do not know the callousness of those people i only hope and pray that she may have escape and be in hide somewhere and will arrive unexpectedly and give I a startling surprise she delight in startling I he add with a laugh poor fellow i think she would never again be able to startle he she have actually fall a victim just as he dread then you think she must have be call away from home by some urgent message i suggest by the manner in which she leave thing it seem as though she go away hurriedly there be five sovereign in a drawer that we have save for the rent and she take they with she i pause again hesitate whether to tell he the terrible truth i recollect that the body have disappear therefore what proof have i of my allegation that she have be murder tell I olinto i say as we move forward again in the direction of paddington station have you any knowledge of a man name leithcourt he start suddenly and look at I i have hear of he he answer very lamely and of he daughter -- muriel and also of she but i be not acquaint with they -- nor to tell the truth do i wish to be why because they be enemy of mine -- bitter enemy he declaration be strange for it throw some light upon the tragedy in rannoch wood and of you wife also i do not know that he respond my enemy be my wife 's also i suppose you have not tell I the secret of that dastardly attempt upon I when we last meet i say in a low voice why not tell I the truth i surely ought to know who my enemy really be so as to be warn against any future plot you shall know some day signora i dare not tell you now you say that before i exclaimed with dissatisfaction if you be faithful to I you ought at least to tell I the reason they wish to kill I in secret because they fear you be he answer why should they fear I but he shrug he shoulder and make a gesture with he hand indicative of utter ignorance i ask you one question answer yes or no be the man leithcourt my enemy the young italian pause and then answer : he be not you friend i be quite well aware of that and he daughter she be engage i hear i think so where do you first meet leithcourt i have know he several year when we first meet he be poor suddenly become rich -- eh buy a fine house in the country live mostly at the carlton when he and he wife and daughter be in london -- although i believe they now have a house somewhere in the west end -- and he often make long cruise on he steam-yacht and how do he make he money again olinto elevated he shoulder without reply if he would only betray to I the reason he have be induce to entice I to that house i might then be able to form some conclusion regard the tenant of rannoch and they friend who be the man who have represent the man now before I have be strike dead by a unerring hand be it possible that armida have be call by telegram to meet she husband and recognize the fraud perpetrate upon she threaten to disclose it and for that reason share the same fate as the masquerader this be the first theory that occur to I one which i believe to be the correct one the motive be a mystery yet the fact seem to I plain enough as the young italian have refuse to give any satisfactory explanation i resolve within myself to wait until the unfortunate woman 's body be recover before reveal to he the ghastly truth without doubt he have some reason in withholding from I the true fact either because he fear that i might become unduly alarm or else he himself have be deeply implicate in the plot of the two suggestion i be incline to believe in the latter he walk with I as far as the end of bishop 's road endeavor with all the italian 's exquisite diplomacy to obtain from I what i know concern the leithcourt but i tell he nothing nor do i reveal that i have only that morning return from scotland then at last we part and he retrace he step to the little restaurant in westbourne grove while i enter a hansom and drive to the well-known photographer 's in new bond street whose name have be upon the tear photograph of the young girl in the white piqué blouse and she hair fasten with a bow of black ribbon the picture that i have find on board the _ lolum _ on that memorable night in the mediterranean and a duplicate of which i have see in muriel 's cosy little room up at rannoch i recollect that she have tell I the name of the original be elma heath and that she have be a schoolfellow of hers at chichester therefore i inquire of the photographer 's lady-clerk whether she could supply I with a print of the negative for a considerable time she search in she book for the name and at last discover it then she say : i regret sir that we can not give you a print for the customer purchase the negative at the time ah i be very sorry for that i say to what address do you send it the customer who order it be apparently a foreigner she say at the same time turn round the ledger so that i could read and i see that the entry be : heath -- miss

leave who i wonder be this baron oberg and what relation be he to elma heath the picture of the girl in the white blouse somehow exercise a strange attraction for I have you never experience the fascination of a photograph inexplicable and yet forcible -- a kind of magnetism from which you can not release yourself perhaps it be the curious fact that some person have take it from its frame on board the _ lolum _ and destroy it that first arouse my interest or it might have be the discovery of it in muriel 's room at rannoch anyhow it have for I a absorb interest for i often wonder whether the unknown girl who have secretly go ashore from the yacht when i have leave it be not elma heath herself who be this baron oberg the name be german undoubtedly yet he live in the russian capital from london to petersburg be a far cry yet i resolve that if it be necessary i would travel there and investigate at the german embassy in carlton house terrace i find my friend captain nieberd the second secretary of whom i inquire whether the name of baron oberg be know but have refer to a number of german book in he excellency 's library he return and tell I that the name do not appear in the list of the german nobility he may be russian -- polish most probably add the captain a tall fair fellow in gold spectacles whom i have know when he be third secretary of embassy at rome he opinion be that it be not a german name for there be a little place call oberg he say on the railway between lodz and lowicz then after luncheon i go to albany road one of those dreary old-fashioned street that be pleasant back in the early victorian day when camberwell be a suburb and walworth common be still a open waste i find the house where olinto live -- a small smoke-blackened semi-detached place standing back in a tiny strip of weedy garden with a wooden veranda before the first floor window the house accord to the woman who keep a general shop at the corner be occupy by two family the eye-talian as she term they live above while the gibbonse rent the ground floor oh yes sir the foreigner be respectable enough always pay I ready money for everythink except the milk that they pay for weekly i understand that the wife have disappear what have you hear about that they do say sir that they ` ad some word together the other day and that the woman 's take herself off in a tantrum only you can not believe all you ` ear you know do they often quarrel not to my knowledge sir they be really very quiet respectable person for foreigner i repass the house of the dead woman and then regain the busy camberwell road i take a omnibus back to the hotel cecil in the strand where i have put up tired and disappointed next day i run down to chichester and after some difficulty find the cheverton college for lady a big old-fashioned house about half-a-mile out of the town on the drayton road the seminary be evidently a first-class one for when i enter i notice how well everything be keep to the principal a elderly lady of a somewhat severe aspect i say : i regret madam to trouble you but i be in search of information you can supply it be with regard to a certain elma heath whom you have as pupil here and who leave i believe about two year ago she parent live in durham i remember she perfectly be the woman 's response as she sit behind the big desk have apparently at first

girl 's whereabouts ah i regret sir that i can not tell you that the baron she uncle come here one day and take she away suddenly -- abroad i think have she no school-friend to whom she would probably write there be a girl name leithcourt -- muriel leithcourt -- who be she friend but who have also leave and no one else i ask girl often write to each other after leave school until they get marry and then the correspondence usually cease the principal be silent and reflective well she say at last there be another pupil who be also on friendly term with elma -- a girl name lydium moreton she may have write to she if you really desire to know sir i dare say i could find she address she leave we about nine month after elma i should esteem it a great favor if you would give I that young lady 's address i say whereupon she unlock a drawer in she writing-table and take therefrom a thick leather-bound book which she consult for a few minute at last exclaiming : yes here it be -- ` lydia moreton daughter of sir hamilton moreton kcmg whiston grange doncaster ' and she scribble it in pencil upon a envelope and hand it to I say : elma heath be i fear somewhat neglect by she parent she remain here for five year and have no holiday like the other girl she uncle the baron come to see she several time but on each occasion after he have leave i find she cry in secret he be mean and unkind to

to london could lydia moreton furnish any information if so i might find this girl whose photograph have arouse the irate jealousy of the mysterious unknown the ten o'clock edinburgh express from king 's cross next morning take I up to doncaster and hire a musty old fly at the station i drive three mile out of the town on the rotherham road finding whiston grange to be a fine old elizabethan mansion in the center of a great park with tall old twisted chimney and beautifully-kept garden when i descend at the door and ring the footman be not aware whether miss lydium be in he look at I somewhat suspiciously i think until i give my card and impressed upon he meaningly that i have come from london purposely to see he young mistress upon a very important matter tell she i say that i wish to see she regard she friend miss elma heath miss elma ` eath repeat the man very well sir will you walk this way and then i follow he across the big old oak-paneled hall fill with trophy of the chase and arm of the civil war into a small paneled room on the leave the deep-set window with its diamond pane give out upon the old bowling-green and the flower-garden beyond presently the door open and a tall dark-haired girl in white enter with a enquire expression upon she face as she halt and bow to I miss lydium moreton i believe i commence and as she reply in the affirmative i go on : i have first to apologize for come to you but miss sotheby the principal of the school at chichester refer I to you for information as to the present whereabouts of miss elma heath who i believe be one of you most intimate friend at school and i add a lie say : i be try on behalf of a aunt of hers to discover she well respond the girl i have have only one or two letter she be in she uncle 's hand i believe and he will not let she write poor girl she dread leave we why ah she would never say she have some deep-rooted terror of she uncle baron oberg who live in st petersburg and who come over at long interval to see she but possibly you know the whole story i know nothing i cry eagerly you will be further she interest as well as do I a great personal favor if you will tell I what you know it be very little she answer lean back against the edge of the table and regard I seriously poor elma she people treat she very badly indeed they send she no money and allow she no holiday and yet she be the sweetest-tempered and most patient girl in the whole school well -- and the story regard she it be suppose that she people at durham do not exist she explain elma have evidently live a greater part of she life abroad for she could speak french and italian better than the professor himself and therefore always win the prize the class revolt and then she do not compete any more yet she never tell we of where she have live when a child she come from durham she say -- that be all you have a letter from she after the baron come and take she away yes from london she say that she have be to several play and concert but do not care for life in town there be too much bustle and noise and study of clothes and what other letter do you receive from she three or four i think they be all from place abroad one be from vienna one be from milan and one from some place with a unpronounceable name in hungary the last -- yes the last i gasp eagerly interrupt she well the last i receive only a fortnight ago if you will wait a moment i will go and get it it be so strange that i have not destroy it and she go out and i hear by the frou-frou of she skirt that she be ascend the stair after five minute of breathless anxiety she rejoin I and hand I the letter to read say : it be not in she handwriting -- i wonder why the paper be of foreign make with blue line rule in square write in a hand that be evidently foreign for the mistake in the orthography be many be the follow curious communication : my dear lydium : perhaps you may never get this letter -- the last i shall ever be able to send you indeed i run great risk in send it ah you do not know the awful disaster that have happen to I all the terror and the torture i endure but no one can assist I and i be now look forward to the time when it will all be over do you recollect we old peaceful day in the garden at chichester i think of they always always and compare that sweet peace of the past with my own terrible suffering of to-day ah how i wish i might see you once again how that i might feel you hand upon my brow and hear you word of hope and encouragement but happiness be now debar from I and i be only sink to the grave under this slow torture of body and of soul this will pass through many hand before it reach the post if however it ever do get despatch and you receive it will you do I one last favor -- a favor to a unfortunate girl who be friendless and helpless and who will no longer trouble the world it be this : take this letter to london and call upon mr martin woodroffe at 98 cork street piccadilly show he my letter and tell he from I that through it all i have keep my promise and that the secret be still safe he will understand -- and also know why i can not write this with my own hand if he be abroad keep it until he return it be all i ask of you lydium and i know that if this reach you you will not refuse I you have be my only friend and confidante but i now bid you farewell for the unknown beckon I and from the grave i can not write again farewell and for ever you loving and affectionate friend elma a very strange letter be it not remark the girl at my side i can not make it out you see there be no address but the postmark be russian she be evidently in russium in finland i say examine the stamp and make out the post town to be abo but have you be to london and execute this strange commission no we be go up next week i intend to call upon this person name woodroffe i make no remark he be i know abroad but i be glad at have obtain two very important clue : first the address of the mysterious yachtsman woodroffe alia hornby and secondly ascertain that the young girl i seek be somewhere in the vicinity of the town of abo the finnish port on the baltic poor elma you see speak in she letter of some secret mr gregg my companion say she say she wish this mr woodroffe whoever he be to know that she have keep she promise and have not divulge it this only bear out what i have all along suspect what be you suspicion well from she deep thoughtful manner and from certain remark she at time make to I i believe that elma be in possession of some great and terrible secret -- a secret which she uncle baron oberg be desirous of learn i know she hold he in deadly fear -- she be in terror that she may inadvertently betray to he the truth chapter ix strange disclosure be make the strange letter of elma heath combine with what lydium moreton have tell I arouse within I a determination to investigate the mystery from the moment i have land from the _ lolum _ on that hot breathless night at leghorn mystery have crowd upon mystery until it be all bewilder it be now prove that the sweet-faced girl the original of the tear photograph hold a secret and that by she own word she know that death be approach the incomprehensible attempt upon my life the strange action of hornby and chater -- who by the way seem to have entirely disappear -- the assassination of the man who by masquerade as the italian waiter have meet he death and the murder of olinto 's wife be all problem which require solution have it not be for the mystery of it all -- and mystery ever arouse the human curiosity -- i should have give up try to get at the truth yet as a man with some leisure and know by that letter of elma heath 's that she be in sore distress i redoubled my effort to ascertain the reason of it all the mystery of the _ lolum _ be still a mystery along the mediterranean at every french and italian port the yacht 's false name and general build be write in the police-book while at lloyd 's the name _ lolum _ be mark down as among the mysterious craft at sea chater be miss while hornby be abroad perhaps they be both cruise again with they yacht repaint and bear a fresh name but why what have be they motive stir by the complete mystery which now seem to enshroud the unfortunate girl i set before myself the task of elucidate it hitherto i have remain passive rather than active but i now realize by that curious letter that at least one woman 's life be at stake -- that elma heath be in possession of some secret on leave leghorn i have give up all hope of trace the mysterious yachtsman and have leave the matter in the hand of the italian police but without any effort on my own part i seem to have be draw into a veritable network of strange incident all of which combine to form the most complete and remarkable enigma ever present in life surely no man be ever confront by so many mystery at one time as i be at this moment fortunately i have be careful not to show my hand to anyone and this perhaps give I a distinct advantage on my journey back to london as the train swing through peterborough and out across the rich level land towards hitchin i recollected jack durnford 's word when i have mention the _ lolum _ what i wonder do he know next month in November he be due back in london after he three year ' service on the mediterranean station then we should meet in a few week i hope would he tell I anything when he become aware of all i know he hold some secret knowledge be it possible that he secret be the same as that hold by the unfortunate girl in far-off dreary finland i call at the house in cork street indicate by elma and learn from the old commissionaire who act as lift-man and porter that mr woodroffe 's chamber be close ` e 's nearly always away sir -- abroad i think be all i could get out of the old soldier who like he class be no doubt well pay to keep he mouth close for two day i lounge about westbourne grove watch ferrarus 's restaurant in such a busy bustling thoroughfare with so many shop window as excuse for loitering the task be easy i see that olinto come regularly at ten o'clock in the morning work hard all day and leave at nine o'clock at night take a omnibus home from royal oak he exterior be calm and unconcerned unlike that of a man whose devoted wife have disappear i would have approach he and explain the ghastly truth have it not be for the fact that the poor woman 's body be miss those September day be full of anxiety for I alone and unaided i be try to solve one of the greatest of problem plunge as i be in a veritable sea of mystery i want to see muriel leithcourt and to question she further regard elma heath therefore again i leave euston and travel through the night take my seat at the breakfast-table at greenlaw next morning sir george who be sit alone -- it not be my aunt 's habit to appear early -- welcome I and then in he bluff manner sniff and exclaim : nice going on up at rannoch have you hear of they no what i cry breathlessly stare at he well my suspicion that those leithcourt be utter outsider turn out to be about correct why well it be a very funny story and there be a dozen different distorted version of it he say but from what i can gather the true fact be these : about seven o'clock the night before last as leithcourt and he house-party be dress for dinner a telegram arrive mr leithcourt open it and at once go off into hysteric while she husband in a breathless hurry slip off he evening clothes again and get into a old blue serge suit toss a few thing into a bag and then go along to muriel 's room to urge she to prepare for secret flight flight i gasp what have they go listen and i 'll tell you the servant have describe the whole affair down in the village so there be no doubt about it leithcourt show muriel the telegram and urge she to fly at first she refuse but for she father 's sake be induce to prepare to accompany he of course the guest be in ignorance of all this the brougham be order to be ready in the stable-yard and not to go round while mr leithcourt 's maid try to bring the lady back to she sens leithcourt himself it seem rush hither and thither seize the jewel-case of he wife and daughter and whatever valuable he could place he hand upon while the mother and daughter be put on they thing as he rush down the main staircase to the library where he check-book and some ready cash be lock in the safe he meet a stranger who have just be admit and show into the room leithcourt close the door and face he what afterwards transpire however be a mystery for two hour later after he and the two woman have escape leave the house-party to they own diversion the stranger be find lock in a large cupboard and insensible the sensation be a tremendous one cowan the doctor be call and declare that the stranger have be drug and be suffer from some narcotic the servant who admit he declare that the man have say he have a appointment with he master and that no card be necessary he however give the name of chater chater i cry start up be you certain of that name i only know what cowan tell I be my uncle 's reply but do you know he not at all only i have hear that name before i say i know a man out in italy of the same name but where be the visitor now in the hospital at dumfry they take he there in preference to leave he alone at rannoch alone of course everyone have leave now the host and hostess have slip off without say good-bye scandalous affair be not it but my boy you 'll remember that i always say i do not like those people there be something mysterious about they i feel certain that telegram give they warning of the visit of the man chater depend upon it and for some reason they be afraid of he it would be interesting to know what transpire between the two man in the library and these be people who have be take up by everybody -- mere adventurer i should call they and old sir george sniff again at thought of such scandal happen in the neighborhood if gilra must let rannoch then why in the name of fortune do not he let it to respectable folk and not to the first fellow who answer he advertisement in _ the field _ it be simply disgraceful certainly it be a most extraordinary story i declare leithcourt evidently wish to escape from he visitor and that be why he drug he why he poison he you mean cowan say the fellow be poison but that he 'll probably recover he be already conscious i hear i resolve to call on the doctor who happen to be well know to I and obtain further particulars therefore at eleven o'clock i drive into dumfry and enter he consulting-room he be a spare short fair man a trifle bald and when i be show in he welcome I warmly speak with he pronounced galloway accent well it be a very mysterious case mr gregg he say after i have tell he the object of my visit the gentleman be still in the hospital and i have to keep he very quiet he be poison without a doubt and have have a very narrow escape of he life the police get wind of the affair and mackenzie call to question he but he refuse to make any statement whatever apparently treat the affair very lightly the police however be mystify as to the reason of mr leithcourt 's sudden flight and be anxious to get at the bottom of the curious affair naturally and more especially after the tragedy up in rannoch wood a short time ago i say that be just it say the doctor remove he pince-nez and rub they mackenzie seem to suspect some connection between leithcourt 's sudden disappearance and that mysterious affair it seem very evident that the telegram be a warn to leithcourt of the man chater 's intention of call and that the last-named be show in just at the moment when the fugitive be on the point of leave chater i echo do you know he christian name hylton chater he be apparently a gentleman curious that he will tell we nothing of the reason he call and of the scene that occur between they know all that i do i be not surprised leithcourt have undoubtedly take he unawares but knight of industry never betray each other my next visit be to mackenzie for whom i have to wait nearly a hour as he be absent in another quarter of the town ah mr gregg he cry gladly as he come in to find I seat in a chair patiently read the newspaper you be the very person i wish to see have you hear of this strange affair at rannoch i have be my answer have the man in the hospital make any statement yet none he refuse point-blank answer the detective but my own idea be that the affair have a very close connection with the two mystery of the wood the first mystery -- that of the man -- prove to be a double mystery i say how explain it well the waiter olinto santinus be alive and well in london what he gasp start up then he be not the person you identify he to be no but he be masquerade as santinus -- make up to resemble he i mean even to the mole upon he face but you identify he positively when a person be dead it be very easy to mistake countenance death alter the countenance so very much that 's true he say reflectively but if the man we have bury be not the italian then the mystery be considerably increase why be the real man 's wife here and where have she body be conceal that be the question again a mystery we have make a thorough search for four day without discover any trace of it quite confidentially i be wonder if this man chater know anything it be curious to say the least that the leithcourt should have flee so hurriedly on this man 's appearance but have you actually see olinto santinus yes and have speak with he i send up to london ask that inquiry should be make at the restaurant in bayswater but up to the present i have receive no report i have chat with olinto he wife have mysteriously disappear but he be in ignorance that she be dead you do not tell he anything nothing ah you do well there be widespread conspiracy here depend upon it mr gregg it will be a interesting case when we get to the bottom of it all i only wish this fellow chater would tell we the reason he call upon leithcourt what do he say merely that he have no wish to prosecute and that he have no statement to make can not you compel he to say something i ask no i can not that be the infernal difficulty of it if he do not choose to speak then we must still remain in ignorance although i feel confident that he know something of the strange affair up in the wood and although i be silent i share the scotch detective 's belief the afternoon be chill and wet as i climb the hill to greenlaw the sudden disappearance of the tenant of rannoch be i find on everyone 's tongue in dumfry in the smoke-room of the railway hotel three man be discuss it with many grimace and sinister hint and the talkative young woman behind the bar ask I my opinion of the strange goings-on up at the castle as i walk on alone with the dark line of wood crowning the hill-top before I the scene of that double tragedy i again calmly review the situation i long to go to the hospital and see hylton chater yet when i recollect the part he have play with hornby on board the _ lolum _ i naturally hesitate he be ally with hornby apparently against leithcourt although the latter be hornby 's friend what i wonder have transpire in the library of that gray old castle which stand out boldly before I dark and grim as i plod on through the rain how have leithcourt succeed in render he enemy insensible and hide he in that cupboard do he believe that he have kill he if i go boldly to chater then it would only be the betrayal of myself no i decide that the man who have smoke and chat with I so affably on that hot breathless night in the mediterranean must remain in ignorance of my presence or of my knowledge therefore i stay for a week at greenlaw with eye and ear ever open yet exercise care that the patient in the hospital should be unaware of my presence mackenzie see he on several occasion but he still persist in that tantalizing silence the inquiry into the death of the unidentified man in rannoch wood have be resume and a verdict return of willful murder against some person unknown while of the second crime the public have no knowledge for the body be not discover time after time i search the wood alone on the pretense of shooting pigeon but discover nothing when not have sport on my uncle 's property i join various party in the neighborhood not because scotland at that time attract I but because i desire to watch event chater as soon as he recover leave the hospital and go south -- to london i ascertain -- leave the police utterly in the dark and fill with suspicion of the fugitive from rannoch i long to know the whereabouts of muriel hope to gain from she some information regard they visitor who have so nearly escape with he life that she be aware of the object of he visit be plain from the statement of the servant all of whom have be leave without either money or order one day i call at the castle the front entrance of which i find close gilrae the owner have come up from london meet he factor there and discharge all the late tenant 's servant keep on only three of he own who have be in service there for a number of year ann cameron a housemaid be one of these and it be she whom i meet when enter by the servant ' hall on question she i find she most willing to describe how she be in the corridor outside the young mistress 's room when mr leithcourt dash along in breathless haste with the telegram in he hand she hear he cry : look at this read it muriel we must go put on you thing at once my dear never mind about luggage every minute lose be of consequence what he cry a moment later you will not go you 'll stay here -- stay here and face they good heaven girl be you mad do not you know what this mean it mean that the secret be out -- the secret be out you hear we must fly the woman tell I that she distinctly hear miss muriel sob while she father walk up and down the room speak rapidly in a low tone then he come out again and return to he dressing-room while miss muriel presumably change from she evening-gown into a dark traveling-dress do she say anything to you i inquire only that they be call away suddenly sir but the domestic add the young lady be very pale and agitate and we all know that something terrible have happen mr leithcourt give order that nothing be to be tell to the guest who dine alone believe that they host and hostess have go down to the village to see a old man who be die that be the story we tell they sir and in the meantime the leithcourt be in the express go to carlisle yes sir they say in dumfry that the police telegraph after they but they have reach carlisle and evidently change there and so get away by the administration of a judicious tip i be allow to go up to miss muriel 's room a elegantly furnish little chamber in the front of the fine old place with a deep old-fashioned window command a magnificent view across the broad nithsdale the room have be tidy by the maid but allow to remain just as she have leave it i advance to the window in which be set the large dressing-table with its big swing-mirror and silver-topped bottle and on gaze out saw to my surprise it be the only window which give a view of that corner of rannoch wood where the double tragedy have take place indeed any person standing at the spot would have a clear view of that one distant window while out of sight of all the rest a light might be place there at night as signal for instance or by day a towel might be hang from the window as though to dry and yet could be plainly see at that distance another object in the room also attract my attention -- a pair of long field-glass have she use these to keep watch upon that spot i take they up and focus they upon the boundary of the wood finding that i could distinguish everything quite plainly that be where they find the man who be murder explain the servant who still stand in the doorway i know i reply i be just try the glass then i put they down and on turn saw upon the mantelshelf a small bright-red candleshade which i take in my hand it be make i find to fit upon the electric table-lamp miss muriel be very fond of a red light explain the young woman and as i hold it i wonder if that light have ever be place upon the toilet-table and the blind draw up -- whether it have ever be use as a warning of danger as i express a desire to see the young lady 's boudoir the maid cameron take I down to the luxurious little room where the first moment i enter one fact strike I as peculiar the picture of elma heath be no longer there the photograph have be take from its frame and in its place be the portrait of a broad-browed full-bearded man in a foreign military uniform -- a picture that be soil and fade have evidently be place there to fill the empty frame whose hand have secure that portrait before the leithcourt 's flight why indeed should i for the second time discover the unhappy girl 's picture miss have the gentleman who call on the evening of mr leithcourt 's disappearance be back here again since he leave the hospital i inquire as a sudden idea occur to I yes sir he call here in a fly on the day he come out and at he request i take he over the castle he go into the library and spend half-an-hour in pacing across it take measurement and examine the big cupboard in which he be find insensible it be a strange affair sir add the young woman be not it very i reply the gentleman might have be in there now have i not go into the library and find a lot of illustrated papers which i always put in the cupboard to keep the place tidy throw out on to the floor i go to put they back but discover the door lock the key i afterwards find in the grate where mr leithcourt have evidently throw it and on open the door imagine the shock i have when i find the visitor lie double up i of course think he be dead and when he return here on he recovery do he question you oh yes he ask about the leithcourt and especially about miss muriel i believe he be rather sweet on she by the way he speak and really no better or kinder lady never breathe i be sure we be all very sorry indeed for she but she have nothing to do with the affair of course not but she share in the scandal and disgrace you should have see the effect of the news upon the guest when they know that the leithcourt have go it be a regular pandemonium they order the best champagne out of the cellar and drink it the man clear all the cigar-box and the woman rummage in the wardrobe until they seem like a pack of hungry wolf everybody go away with they trunk full of the leithcourt 's thing they take whatever they could lay they hand on and we the servant could not stop they i do remonstrate with one lady who be cram into she trunk two of miss muriel 's best evening dress but she tell I to mind my own business and leave the room one man i see go away with four of mr leithcourt 's gun and there be a regular squabble in the billiard-room over a set of pearl and emerald dress-stud that somebody find in he dressing-room crane the valet say they toss for they disgraceful i ejaculate then as soon as the host and hostess have go they simply sweep through the room and clear they yes sir they take away all that be most valuable they would have have the silver only mason have throw it into the plate-chest all dirty as it be lock it up and hide the key the plate be mr gilra 's you know sir and mason be responsible he act wisely i say surprise at the domestic 's story why the guest act like a gang of thief they be sir they rush all over the house like demon let loose and they even steal some of we thing i lose a silver chain and what do the stranger say when you tell he of this he smile it do not seem to surprise he in the least for after all he visit be the cause of the sudden break up of the party be not it and do you show he over the whole house i inquire yes sir respond the servant curiously enough he have with he what seem to be a large plan of the castle and as we go from room to room he compare it with he plan he be here for hour and tell I he want to make a thorough examination of the place and do not want to be disturb he also say that he might probably take the place for next season if he like it i think however he only tell I this because he think i would be more patient while he take he measurement and make he investigation he be here from twelve till nearly six o'clock and go through every room even up to the turret he come into this room i suppose yes sir she respond with just a slight hesitation i think this be the room where he stay the longest there be a photograph in that frame over there she add indicate the frame that have hold the picture of elma heath a portrait of a young lady which he beg I to give he and you give it to he i cry quickly well -- yes sir he beg so hard for it say that it be the portrait of a friend of he and he give you something handsome for it -- eh the young woman whom i know could not refuse half-a-sovereign color slightly and smile and who put that picture in its place i ask i do sir i find it upstairs he do not tell you who the young lady be i suppose no sir he only say that that be the only photograph that exist and that she be dead dead i gasp stare at she yes sir that be why he be so anxious for the picture elma heath dead could it be true that sweet-pictured face haunt I as no other face have ever impressed itself upon my memory it somehow seem to impel I to endeavor to penetrate the mystery and yet hylton chater have declare that she be dead i recollect the remarkable letter from abo and she own declaration that she end be near that letter be she say the last she should write to she friend do hylton chater actually possess knowledge of the girl 's death have he all along be acquaint with she whereabouts what the young woman tell I upset all my plan if elma heath be really dead then she be beyond discovery and the truth would be hide forever after he have put the photograph in he pocket the gentleman make a most minute search in this room the domestic go on he consult he plan take several measurement and then tap on the paneling all along this wall as though he be search for some hidden cupboard or hide place i look at the plan and see a mark in red ink upon it he be try to discover that spot and be greatly disappoint at not be able to do so he be in here over a hour and make a most careful search all around and what explanation do he give he only say ` if i find what i want ann i shall make you a present of a ten-pound note ' that naturally make I anxious he make no other remark about the young lady 's death i inquire anxiously no only he sigh and look steadily for a long time at the photograph i see he lip move but he word be inaudible you

something conceal in this house that he be very anxious to obtain he come to demand it of mr leithcourt but what happen in the library we do not know he however believe that mr leithcourt have not take it away and that whatever it may be it be still hide here chapter x i show my hand on my return to london next day i make inquiry at the admiralty and learn that the battleship _ bulwark _ be lie at palermo therefore i telegraph to jack durnford and late the same afternoon he reply come at the cecil : -- _ due in london twentieth dine with I at club that evening _ -- jack the twentieth that mean nearly a month of inactivity in that time i could cross to abo make inquiry there and ascertain perhaps if elma heath be actually dead as chater have declare two fact strike I as remarkable : baron oberg be say to be polish while the dark-bearded proprietor of the restaurant in westbourne grove be also of the same nationality then i recollect that pretty little enameled cross that mackenzie have find in rannoch wood and it suddenly occur to I that it might possibly be the miniature of one of the european order of chivalry in the club library at midnight i find a copy of cappellettus 's _ storia degli ordini cavallereschi _ the standard work on the subject and on search the illustration i at length discover a picture of it it be a russian order -- the coveted order of saint anne bestow by the czar only upon person who have render eminent service to the state and to the sovereign one fact be now certain namely that the owner of that tiny cross the small replica of the fine decoration must be a person of high official standing next day i spend in make inquiry with a view to discover the house say to be occupy by leithcourt as it be not either in the directory or the blue book i conclude that he have perhaps rent it furnished and after many inquiry and considerable difficulty i find that such be the fact he have occupy the house of lady heathcote a few door from grosvenor square for the previous season although he have live there but very little where the fugitive be in hide i have no idea i long to meet muriel again and tell she what i have discover yet it be plain that the trio be conceal themselves from hylton chater whom i suppose to be now back in london the autumn day be dull and rainy and the street be muddy and unpleasant as they always be at the fall of the year compel to remain inactive i idle in the club with the recollection of that picture face ever before I -- the face of the unfortunate girl who wish she last message to be convey to philip hornby what i wonder be she secret what be really she fate this latter question trouble I until i could bear it no longer i feel that it be my duty to go to finland and endeavor to learn

to the gray lethargic town of abo it be not the first occasion on which i have tread russian soil and i know too well the annoyance of the bureaucracy finland however be perhaps the most severely govern of any of the czar 's dominion and i have my first taste of its stern relentless officialdom at the moment of landing on the half-deserted quay in the wooden passport office the uniformed official on examine my passport discover that at the russian consulate-general they have forget to date the visé which have be impress with a rubber stamp it be sign by the consul-general but the date

hard climate with August frost a eight month ' winter in the north and five month of frost in the south idle in sleepy abo where the public building be so mean and meager and the house for the most part build of wood i see on every hand the disastrous result of the attempt russification of the country the hand of the oppressor that official send from petersburg to crush and to conquer be upon the honest finnish nation the russian bureaucracy be try to destroy its weaker but more successful neighbor and in order to do so employ the harshest and most unscrupulous official it could import my fellow-traveler from stockholm who represent a firm of paper-maker in hamburg and who pay a annual visit to abo and helsingfor act as my guide around the town while i await the information from the humble chief of police my german friend point out to I how since russium place she hand upon finland progress have be arrest and certainly plain evidence be on every hand there be grow discontent everywhere for many of the newspaper have recently be suppress and the remainder be under a severe censorship agriculture have already decrease and many of the cotton-spinning and see mill be silent and desert the exploitation of those gigantic forest from which million of trunk be float down to the sea annually have now be suspend the great landowner be desert the country and there be silence and depression everywhere finland have be separate for economic purpose from the more civilized country and bind to the poverty-stricken artificially isolate and oppress russium the double-headed eagle be everywhere and the people sit silent and brooding beneath its black shadow there will be a uprising here before long declare the german confidentially as we be take tea one day on the wooden balcony of the hotel where the sea and the low-lying island stretch out before we in the pale yellow of the autumn sundown the people will revolt as they do in poland the finnish government can only appeal to the czar through the governor-general and one can easily imagine that they suggestion never reach the emperor it be say here that the harsher and more corrupt the official the greater honor do he receive from petersburg but trouble be brew for russium he add a very serious trouble -- depend upon it i look upon the gray dismal scene the empty port the silent quay the dark line of gloomy pine forest away beyond the town the broken coast and the wide expanse of water glittering in the northern sunset yes the very silence seem to forbode evil and mystery truly what i saw of finland impressed I even more than what i have witness in the far-off eastern province of european russium my object however be not to inquire into the internal condition of finland or of she resentment of she powerful conqueror i be there to find that unfortunate girl who have write so strangely to she old school friend and whose portrait have for some hidden reason be destroy on the morning of the third day after my arrival at abo while sit on the hotel veranda read a old copy of the paris _ journal _ many portion of which have be black out by the censor the chief of police in he dark green uniform enter and salute before I you excellency may i be permit to speak with you in private certainly i respond rise and conduct he to my bedroom where i close the door invite he to a seat and myself sit upon the edge of the bed i have make various inquiry he say and i think i have find the lady you excellency be seek my information however must be furnish to you in strictest confidence he add because there be reason why i should withhold she whereabouts from you what do you mean i inquire what reason well -- the lady be live in finland in secret then she be alive i exclaimed quickly i think she be dead to the world she be dead respond michael boranskus stroke he red beard for that reason the information i give you must be treat as confidential why should she be in hide she be guilty of no offense -- be she the man shrug he shoulder but do not reply and this baron oberg you tell I nothing of he i say with dissatisfaction how can i when i know nothing excellency be he response i feel certain that the fellow be not speak the truth for i have notice he surprise when i have first utter the mysterious nobleman 's name as i have already say excellency i be desirous of atone for my insult and will serve you in every manner i can for that reason i have seek news of the young english lady -- the mademoiselle heath but you have all foreigner register in you book i say the search be surely not a difficult one i know you police method in russium too well i laugh no the lady be not register he say there be a reason why i have tell you excellency she be in hide where i regret that much as i desire i dare not appear to have any connection with you quest but i will direct you indeed i will give you instruction to a second person to take you to she be she in abo no away in the country if you excellency will be down at the end of the quay to-morrow at noon you will find a carriage in wait and the driver will have full instruction how to take you to she and how to act follow he direction implicitly for he be a man i can trust to-morrow i cry anxiously why not to-day i be ready to go at any moment the chief of police remain thoughtful for a few moment then say -- well if i could find the man you might go to-day yet it be a long way and you would not return before to-morrow the road be safe i suppose i do not mind drive in the night the official glance at the clock and rise exclaim -- very well i will send for the man if we find he then the carriage will be at the same spot at the eastern end of the quay in two hour at noon very well i shall keep the appointment and after see she you will of course keep you promise of secrecy regard we little misunderstanding he ask anxiously i have already give my word be the response and the man bow and leave much i think to the surprise of the hotel-proprietor and he staff it be a unusual thing for such a high official as the chief of police to visit one of they guest in person if he desire to interview any of they he command they to attend at he office or they be escort there by he gray-coated agent the day be cold with a bite wind from the icy north when after a hasty luncheon i put on my overcoat and stroll along the desert quay where i lounge at the further end watch the approach of a great pontoon of pine log that have apparently float out of one of the river and be now be navigate to the port by four man who seem every moment in imminent danger of be wash off the raft into the sea as the wave break over and drench they they have however lash themselves to they raft i saw and now slowly pilot the great floating platform towards the quay i think i must have wait half a hour when my attention be suddenly attract by the rattle of wheel over the stone and turn i see a old closed carriage draw by three horse abreast with bell upon the harness approach I rapidly when it draw up the driver a burly-looking fair-headed finn in a huge sheepskin overcoat motion I to enter urge in broken russian -- quickly excellency -- quickly -- you must not be see and then the instant i be seat and before i could close the door the horse plunge forward and we be tear at full gallop out of the town for five mile or so we skirt the sea along a level well-made road through a barren wind-swept country whence the meager harvest have already be garner there be no village all around be a houseless land roll mile of brown and green broken and checkered by bit of forest and clump of dark melancholy pine the road run ever and anon right down to where the cold green wave break upon the rocky shore in a few week that coast would be ice-bound and snow-covered and then the silence of the god-forsaken country would be complete after five mile or so the driver pull up and descend to readjust he harness whereupon i get out and ask he in the best russian i could command : where be we go to nystad how far be that sixty-eight be he reply i take he to imply kilometre as be a finn he would not speak of verst the chief of police have give you direction i ask he high excellency have tell I exactly what to do be the man 's answer as he take out he huge wooden pipe and fill it you wish to see the young lady yes i answer to first see she and i do not know whether it will be necessary for I to make myself know to she where be she beyond nystad be he vague answer with a wave of he big fat hand in the direction of the dark pine forest that stretch before we we shall be there about a hour after sundown then i re-enter the stuffy old conveyance that rock and roll as we dash away over the uneven forest road and sit wonder to what manner of place i be be conduct elma heath be in hide why i recollect she curious letter and remember every word of it she wish hornby to know that she have never reveal she secret what secret i wonder i light a abominable cigar and try to smoke but i be too fill with anxiety too bewildered by the maze of mystery in which i now find myself two hour later we pull up before a long log-built post-house just beyond a small town in a hollow that face the sea and i alight to watch the steam horse be replace by a trio of fresh one the place be dadendal i be inform and the proprietor of the place when i enter and toss off a liqueur-glass of cognac point out to I a row of granite building fall much to decay as the ancient convent then resume we journey the short day quickly draw to a close the sun sink yellow and watery over the towering pine through which we go mile after mile a dense interminable forest wherein the wolf lurk in winter often render the road dangerous the temperature fall and it freeze again through the window in front i could see the big finn driver throw he arm across he shoulder to promote circulation in the same manner as do the london cabby when night draw on we change horse again at a small dirty post-house in the forest at the edge of a lake and then push forward again although it be already long past the hour at which he have say we should arrive time pass slowly in the darkness for we have no light and the horse seem to find they way by instinct the rolling of the lumber old vehicle after six hour have render I sleepy i think for i recollect close my eye and conjure up that strange scene on board the _ lolum _ indeed i suppose i must have sleep for i be awaken by a light shine into my face and the driver shake I by the shoulder when i roused myself and naturally inquire the reason he place he finger mysteriously upon my lip say : hush you high nobility hush come with I but make no noise if we be discover it mean death for we -- death come give I you hand slowly tread softly see here be the boat i will get in first we shall not be hear upon the water so and the fellow lead I half-dazed down to the bank of a broad dark river which i could just distinguish -- he lead I to a unknown bourne chapter xi the castle of the terror the big finn have i find tie up he horse and in the heavy old boat he row I down the swollen river which run swift and turbulent around a sudden bend and then seem to open out to a great width in the starlight i could distinguish that it stretch gray and level to a distance and that the opposite bank be fringe with pine where be we go i ask my guide in a low voice but he only whisper : hush excellency remain patient and you shall see the young englishwoman so i sit in the boat while he allow it to drift with the current steer it with the great heavy oar the river suddenly narrow again with high pine on either bank a silent lonesome reach perhaps indeed one of the loneliest spot in all europe once the dismal howl of a wolf sound close to where we pass but my guide make no remark after nearly a mile the stream again open out into a broad lake where in the distance i see rise sheer and high from the water a long square building of three story with a tall round tower at one corner -- a old medieval castle it seem to be from one of the small window of the tower as we come into view of it a light be shine upon the water and my guide see it grunt in satisfaction it have undoubtedly be place there as signal with great caution he approach the place keep in the deep shadow of the bank until we come exactly opposite the flanking-tower in the light window i distinctly see a dark figure of someone appear for a moment and then my guide strike a match and hold it in he finger until it be wholly consume almost instantly the light be extinguish and then after wait five minute or so he pull straight across the lake to the high dark tower that descend into the water the place be as grim and silent as any i have ever see a impregnable stronghold of the day before siege gun be invent the fortress of some feudal prince or count who have probably hold the surrounding country in thraldom i put my hand against the black slimy wall to prevent the boat bumping and then distinguish just beyond I a small wooden ledge and half-a-dozen step which lead up to a low arched door the latter have open noiselessly and the dark figure of a woman stand peer forth my guide utter some reassuring word in finnish in a low half-whisper and then slowly push the boat along to the ledge say : you high nobility may disembark there be at present no danger i rise grip a big rusty chain to steady myself and climb into the narrow doorway in the ponderous wall where i find myself in the darkness beside the female who have apparently be expect we arrival and watch we signal without a word she lead I through a short passage and then strike a match light a big old-fashioned lantern as the light fall upon she feature i see they be thin and hard with deep-set eye and a stray wisp of silver across she wrinkled brow around she head be a kind of hood of the same stuff as she dress a black coarse woolen while around she neck be a broad linen collar in a instant i recognize that she be a member of some religious order some minor order perhaps with whose habit we in italy be not acquaint the thin ascetic countenance be that of a woman of strong character and she funereal habit seem much too large for she stunt shrunken figure the sister speak french i hazard in that language know that in most convent throughout europe french be know ouus m ` sieur be she answer and a leetle engleesh too -- a ve-ry leetle she smile you know why i be here i say gratify that at least one person in that lonesome country could speak my own tongue yes i have already be tell be she answer with a strong accent as we stand in that small bare stone room a semicircular chamber in the tower once perhaps a prison but be you not afraid to venture here she ask why well -- because no stranger be permit here you know if you presence here be discover you would not leave this place alive -- so i warn you i be prepare to risk that i say smile at the same time my hand instinctively seek my hip-pocket to ascertain that my weapon be safe i wish to see miss elma heath the old nun nod fumble with she lantern i glance at my watch and find that it be already two o'clock in the morning remember that if you be discover here you exonerate I of all blame she say raise she head and peer into my face with she keen gray eye by admit you i be betray my trust and that i should not have do be it not compulsory compulsory how the order of the chief of police even here we can not afford to offend he so the fellow boranskus have really keep faith with I and at he order the closed door of the convent have be open of course not i answer russian officialdom be all-powerful in finland nowadays but where be the lady you be still prepare to risk you liberty and life she ask in a hoarse voice full of grim meaning i be i say lead I to she and when you see she you will make no effort to speak with she promise I that ah sister i cry you be ask too great a sacrifice of I i come here from england nay from italy in search of she to question she regard a strange mystery and to learn the truth surely i may be permit to speak with she you wish to learn the truth sir remark the woman i think you be she lover -- that you merely wish to see she once again no i be not she lover i answer indeed we have never yet meet but i be in search of the truth from she own lip that you will never learn she say in a hard changed voice because there be a conspiracy to preserve the secret i cry but i intend to solve the mystery and for that reason i have travel here from england the woman with the lantern smile sadly as though amuse by my impetuosity you be on russian soil now m ` sieur not english she remark in she broken english if you object be know you would never be spare to return to you own land ah she sigh you do not know the mystery and terror of finland i be a french subject bear in tour and bring to helsingfor when i be fifteen i have be in finland forty-five year once we be happy here but since the czar appoint baron oberg to be governor-general -- and she shrug she shoulder without finish she sentence baron oberg -- governor-general of finland i gasp certainly do you not know she say drop into french it be four year now that he have hold supreme power to crush and russify these poor finn ah m ` sieur this country once so prosperous be a blot upon the face of europe he method be the worst and most unscrupulous of any employ by russium before he come here he be the best hate man in petersburg and that they say be why the emperor send he to we and he be uncle of this young lady elma heath uncle ah i do not know that m ` sieur i have never be tell so he niece -- poor young lady -- can that be surely not why not i ask but the woman give I no reason she only exhibit she palm and sigh she seem to have compassion upon the girl i seek she heart be really softer than i have believe it to be where do this baron live i ask surprised that he should occupy so high a place in russian officialdom -- the representative of the czar with power as great as the emperor himself at the government palace in helsingfor and elma heath be here -- in this grim fortress why ah m ` sieur how can i tell by reason of family secret perhaps they account for so much you know that be exactly my opinion i say she have be bring here against she will most probably this be not a cheerful place as you see we have five month of ice and snow and for four month be practically cut off from civilization and see no new face terrible i gasp glance round at those dark stone wall that seem to breathe a air of tragedy and mystery the old castle have i suppose be turn into a convent as many have be in germany and austrium back in feudal time it no doubt have be a grand old place and have you be here long i ask seven year only but i be leave even i use as i be to a solitary life can stand it no longer i feel that its cold silence and dreariness will drive I mad in winter the place be like a ice-well the fact that the baron be ruler of finland amaze I for i have half-expect he to be some clever adventurer yet as the event of the past flash through my brain i recollected that in rannoch wood have be find the miniature of the russian order of saint anne a distinction which in all probability have be confer upon he if so the coincidence to say the least be a remarkable one i question my companion further regard the baron ah m ` sieur she declare they call he ` the strangler of the finn ' it be he who order the peasant of kasko to be flog until four of they die -- and the czar give he the star of white eagle for it -- he who suppress half the newspaper and put eighteen editor in prison for publish a report of a meeting of the swede in helsingfor he who encourage corruption and bribery among the official for the furtherance of russian interest he who have order russian to be the official language who have restrict public education who have overtax and ground down the people until now the mine be lay and finland be ready for open revolt the prison be fill with the innocent woman be flog the poor be starve and ` the strangler ' as they call he report to the czar that finland be submissive and be russianize i have hear something of this abominable state of affair from time to time from the english press but have never take notice of the name of the oppressor so the uncle of elma heath be the strangler of finland the man who in four year have reduce a prosperous country to a state of ruin and revolt can not i see she i ask feeling that we have remain too long there if my presence in that place be perilous the sooner i escape from it the better yes come she say but silence walk softly and hold up the old horn lantern to give I light she lead I out into the low stone corridor again conduct I through a number of intricate passage all bare and gloomy the stone worn hollow by the foot of age on we creep noiselessly past a number of low arched door stud with big nail in the style of generation ago then turn suddenly at right angle i see that we be in a kind of _ cul de sac _ before the door of which at the end she stop and place she finger upon she lip then motion I to remain there she enter close the door after she and leave I in the pitch darkness i strain my ear but could hear no sound save that of someone move within no word be utter or if so it be whisper so low that it do not reach I for nearly five minute i wait in impatience outside that close door until again the handle turn and my conductress beckon I in silence within i step into a small square chamber the floor of which be carpet and where suspend high above be a lamp that shed but a faint light over the barely-furnished place it seem to I to be a kind of sitting-room with a plain deal table and a couple of chair but there be no stove and the place look chill and comfortless beyond be another smaller room into which the old nun disappear for a moment then she come forth lead a strange wan little figure in a gray gown a figure whose face be the most perfect and most lovely i have ever see she wealth of chestnut hair fall disheveled about she shoulder and as she hand be clasp before she she look straight at I in surprise as she be lead towards I she walk but feebly and she countenance be deathly pale she dress as she come beneath the lamp be i see coarse yet clean and she beautiful regular feature which in she photograph have hold I in such fascination be even more sweet and more matchless than i have believe they to be i stand before she dumbfounded in admiration in silence she bow gracefully and then look at I with astonishment apparently wonder what i a perfect stranger require of she miss elma heath i presume i exclaim at last may i introduce myself to you my name be gordon gregg english by birth cosmopolitan by instinct i have come here to ask you a question -- a question that concern yourself lydium moreton have send I to you i notice that she great brown eye watch my lip and not my face she own lip move but she look at I with a inexpressible sadness no sound escape she i stand rigid before she as one turn to stone for in that instant in a flash indeed i realize the awful truth she be both deaf and dumb she raise she clasped hand to I in silence yet with tear well in she splendid eye i see that upon she wrist be a pair of bright steel gyve what be this place i demand of the woman in the religious habit when i recover from the shock of the poor girl 's terrible affliction where be i this be the castle of kajana -- the criminal lunatic asylum of finland be she answer the prisoner as you see have lose both speech and hearing deaf and dumb i cry look at the beautiful original of that destroy photograph on board the _ lolum _ but she have surely not always be so i exclaimed no i think not always reply the sister quietly but you say you intend to question she and do i not tell you that to learn the truth be impossible but she can write response to my question i argue alas no be the old woman 's whisper reply she mind be affect she be unfortunately a hopeless lunatic i look straight into those sad wide-open yet unflinching brown eye utterly confound those white wrist hold in steel that pale face and blanched lip the inertness of she movement all tell they own tragic tale and yet that letter i have read dictate in secret most probably because she hand be not free be certainly not the outpouring of a madwoman she have speak of death it be true yet be it not to be suppose that she be slowly be drive to suicide she have keep she secret and she wish the man hornby -- the man who be to marry muriel leithcourt -- to know the room in which we stand be evidently a apartment set apart for she use for beyond be the tiny bedchamber yet the small high-up window be closely bar and the cold bareness of the prison be sufficient indeed to cause anyone confine there to prefer death to captivity again i speak to she slowly and kindly but there be no response that she be absolutely dumb be only too apparent yet surely she have not always be so i have go in search of she because the beauty of she portrait have magnetize I and i have now find she to be even more lovely than she picture yet alas suffer from a affliction that render she life a tragedy the realization of the terrible truth stagger I such a perfect face as hers i have never before set eye upon so beautiful so clear-cut so refine so eminently the countenance of one well-born and yet so ineffably sad so full of blank unutterable despair she place she clasped hand to she mouth and make sign by shake she head that she could neither understand nor respond i therefore take my wallet from my pocket and write upon a piece of paper in a large hand the word : _ i come from lydium moreton my name be gordon gregg _ when she eager gaze fell upon the word she become instantly fill with excitement and nod quickly then hold she steel-clasped wrist towards I she look wistfully at I as though implore I to release she from the awful bondage in that silent tomb though the woman who have lead I there endeavor to prevent it i hand she the pencil and place the paper on the table for she to write the nun try to snatch it up but i hold she arm gently and forcibly say in french : no i wish to see if she be really insane you will at least allow I this satisfaction and while we be in altercation elma with the pencil in she finger try to write but by reason of she hand be bind so closely be unable at length however after several attempt she succeed in printing in uneven capital the response : i know you you be on the yacht i think they kill you the thin-faced old woman see she response -- a reply that be surely rational enough -- and she brow contract with displeasure why be you here i write not allow the sister to get sight of my question in response she write painfully and laboriously : i be condemn for a crime i do not commit take I from here or i shall kill myself ah exclaim the old woman you see poor girl she believe herself innocent they all do but why be she here i demand fiercely i do not know m ` sieur it be not my duty to inquire the history of they crime when they be ill i nurse they that be all and who be the commandant of this fortress colonel smirnoff if he know that i have admit you you would never leave this place alive this be the schusselburg of finland -- the place of imprisonment for those who have conspire against the state the prison of political conspirator eh alas m ` sieur yes the place in which some of the poor creature be tortured in order to obtain confession and information with as much cruelty as in the black day of the inquisition these wall be thick and they cry be not hear from the oubliette below the lake i have long ago hear of the horror of schusselburg indeed who have not hear of they who have travel in russium the very mention of the modern bastille on lake ladoga where no prisoner have ever be know to come forth alive be sufficient to cause any russian to turn pale and i be in the schusselburg of finland i turn over the sheet of paper and write the question -- do baron oberg send you here in response she print the word -- i believe so i be arrest in helsingfor tell lydium where i be do you know muriel leithcourt i inquire by the same means whereupon she reply that they be at school together do you see I on board the _ lolum _ i write yes but i could not warn you although i have overhear they intention they take I ashore when you have go to siena after three day i find myself deaf and dumb -- i be make so she allegation startle I she have be purposely afflict who do it a doctor i suppose they put I under chloroform who people who say they be my friend i turn to the woman in the religious habit and cry -- do you see what she have write she have be maim by some friend who intend that the secret she hold should be keep they fear to kill she so they bribe a doctor to deliberately operate upon she so that she could neither speak nor hear and now they be drive she to suicide m ` sieur i be astounded declare the nun i have always believe that she be not in she right mind yet assuredly she seem to be as sane as i be only willfully mutilate by some pretended friend who determine that no further word should pass she lip a shameful mutilation have be commit upon this poor defenseless girl i cry in anger and i will make it my duty to discover and punish the perpetrator of it ah m ` sieur do not act rashly i pray of you the woman say seriously place she hand upon my arm recollect you be in finland -- where the baron oberg be all-powerful i do not fear the baron oberg i exclaimed if necessary i will appeal to the czar himself mademoiselle be keep here for the reason that she be in possession of some secret she must be release -- i will take the responsibility but you must not try to release she from here it would mean death to you both the castle of kajana tell no secret of those who die within its wall or of those cast headlong into its water and forget again i turn to elma who stand in anxious wonder of the subject of we conversation and have suddenly take the old nun 's hand and kiss it affectionately perhaps in order to show I that she trust she then upon the paper i write -- be the baron oberg you uncle she shake she head in the negative show that the dreaded governor-general of finland have only act a part towards she in which she have be compel to concur who be philip hornby i inquire write rapidly my friend -- at least i believe so friend and i have all along believe he to be a adventurer and a enemy why do he go to leghorn i ask for a secret purpose there be a plot to kill you only i manage to thwart they be the word she print with much labor then i owe my life to you i write and in return i will do my utmost to rescue you from here if you do not fear to place yourself in my hand and to this she reply -- i shall be thankful for i can not bear this awful place longer i believe they must torture the woman here they will torture I some day do you best to get I out of here and i will tell you everything but she write i fear you can never secure my release i be confine here on a life sentence but you be english and if you have have no trial i can complain to we ambassador no i be a russian subject i be bear in russium and go to england when i be a girl that alter the case entirely as a subject of the czar in she own country she be amenable to that disgraceful blot upon civilization that allow a person to be consign to prison at the will of a high official without trial or without be afford any opportunity of appeal i therefore at once see a difficulty yet she promise to tell I the truth if i could but secure she release a flood of recollection of the amazing mystery sweep through my mind a thousand question arise within I all of which i desire to ask she but there in that noisome prison-house it be impossible as i stand there a woman 's shrill scream of excruciating pain reach I notwithstanding those cyclopean wall some unfortunate prisoner be perhaps be tortured and confession wring from she lip i shudder at the unspeakable horror of that grim fortress could i allow this refined defenseless girl to remain a inmate of that bastille the terror of which i have hear man in russium hint at with bated breath they have willfully maim she and deprive she of both hearing and the power of speech and now they intend that she should be drive mad by that silence and loneliness that must always end in insanity i have decide i say suddenly turn to the woman who have conduct I there and have now remove the steel bond of the prisoner with a key she secretly carry stand with fold hand in the calm attitude of the religious you will not act with rashness she implore in quick apprehension remember you life be at stake as well as my own she enemy intend that i too should die i answer look straight into those deep mysterious brown eye which hold I as beneath a spell they have draw she into they power because she have no means of defense but i will assume the position of she friend and protector how the man be await I in the boat outside i intend to take she with I but m ` sieur why that be impossible cry the old woman in a hoarse voice if you be discover by the guard who patrol the lake both night and day they would shoot you both i will risk it i say and without another word dash into the tiny bed chamber and tear a old brown blanket from off the narrow truckle bed then link my arm in that of the woman whose lovely countenance have verily become the sun of my existence i make a sign invite she to accompany I the sister bar the door urge I to reconsider my decision leave she alone in secret and act as you will appeal to the baron to the czar but do not attempt m ` sieur to rescue a prisoner from here for it be a impossibility the man who bring you here from abo will not dare to accept such responsibility come i say to elma although alas she could not hear my voice let we at least make a dash for freedom she recognize my intention in a moment and allow herself to be conduct down the long intricate corridor walk stealthily and make no noise i have seize the old horn lantern and as the nun hold back not daring to accompany we we steal on alone turn back along the stone corridor until i recognize the door of the room to which i have be first conduct all be silent and as we creep along on tiptoe i feel the girl 's grip upon my arm a grip that tell I that she place she faith in I as she deliverer i own that it be a rash and headstrong act for even beyond the lake how could we ever hope to penetrate those interminable inhospitable forest so far from any hiding-place yet i feel it my duty to attempt the rescue and besides have not she marvelous beauty enmesh I have i not feel by some unaccountable intuition at the first moment we have meet that we life be link in the future she cling to I as though fearful of discovery as we go forward in silence along that dark low corridor where i know the strong door in the tower open upon the lake once in the boat and we could row back to where the horse await we and then away the woman have not arrest we progress or raise a alarm after all once i have mistrust she but i now see that she heart be really fill with pity for the poor girl now at my side without a sound we creep forward until within a few yard from that unlock door where the boat await we below when of a sudden the uncertain light of the lantern fall upon something that shine and a deep voice cry out of the darkness in russian -- halt or i fire and startle we find ourselves look down the muzzle of a loaded carbine a huge sentry stand with he back to the secret exit he dark eye shine beneath he peaked cap as he hold he weapon to he shoulder within six foot of we the big bearded fellow demand fiercely who i be my heart sink within I i have act recklessly and have fall into the hand of he excellency the baron xavier oberg the unscrupulous governor-general -- fall into a trap which it seem have be very cleverly prepare for I i be a prisoner in the terrible fortress whence no single person save the guard have ever be know to emerge -- the bastille of the strangler of finland i see i be lose the muzzle of the sentry 's carbine be within two foot of my chest speak cry the fellow who be you at a glance i take in the peril of the situation and without a second 's hesitation make a dive for the man beneath he weapon he lower it but it be too late for i grip he around the waist render he gun useless it be the work of a instant for i know that to close with he be my only chance yet if the boat be not in wait below that close door if my finn driver be not there in readiness then i be lose the unfortunate girl whom i be there to rescue draw back in fright against the wall for a single second then see that i have close with the hulk fellow she spring forward and with both hand seize the gun and attempt to wrest it from he he finger have lose the trigger and he be try to regain it to fire and so raise the alarm i see this and with a old trick learn at uppingham i trip he so that he stagger and nearly fall a oath escape he yet in that moment elma succeed in twist the gun from he sinewy hand which i now hold with a strength begotten of a knowledge of my imminent peril my whole future as well as hers depend upon my success in that desperate encounter he be huge and powerful with a strength far exceed my own yet i have be reckon a good wrestler at uppingham and now my knowledge of that most ancient form of combat hold I in good stead the man shout for help he deep hoarse voice sound along the stone corridor if hear by he comrades-in-arm then the alarm would at once be give we struggle desperately sway to and fro he try to throw I while i at every turn practice upon he the trick learn in my youth it seem a even match however for he keep he foot by sheer brute force and he muscle seem hard and unbending as steel suddenly however as we be strive so vigorously and desperately the english girl slip past we with the carbine in she hand and with a quick movement drag open the heavy door that give exit to the lake at that instant i unfortunately make a false move and he hand close upon my throat like a band of steel i fight and struggle to loose myself exert every muscle but alas he gain the advantage i hear a splash and see that elma no longer hold the sentry 's weapon in she hand have throw it into the water then at the same moment i hear a voice outside cry in a low tone : courage excellency courage i will come and help you it be the faithful finn who have be await I in the deep shadow and with a few stroke pull he boat up to the narrow rickety ledge outside the door take the lady i succeed in gasp in russian never mind I and i see to my satisfaction that he guide elma to step into the boat which at that moment drift past the little platform i struggle valiantly but against such a man of brute strength i be powerless he hold my throat cause I excruciating pain and each moment i feel my chance of victory grow smaller my strength be fail while i hold he arm at he side i could keep he secure without much effort but now with he finger press in my windpipe i could not breathe i be slowly be strangle to be vanquish mean imprisonment there perhaps even death victory mean elma 's life as well as my own mine be therefore a fight for life a sudden idea flash across my mind and i continue to struggle at the same time gradually force my enemy backward towards the door he shout for help but be unheard he curse and swear and shout until with a sudden and almost superhuman effort i trip he bring he head into such violent contact with the stone lintel of the door that the sound could surely be hear a considerable distance for a moment he be stunned and in that brief second i release he grip from my throat and hurl he backwards beyond the door there be the sound of the crash of wood as the rotten platform give way a loud splash and next instant the dark water close over the big bearded fellow who would have snatch elma heath from I and have hold I prisoner in that castle of terror he sink like a stone for although i stand watch for he to rise i could only distinguish the woodwork float away with the current in a moment however even as i stand there in horror at my deed of self-defense the place suddenly resound with shout of alarm and in the tower above I the great old rusty bell begin to swing ring its brazen note across the broad expanse of water the fair-bearded finn again shoot the boat across to where i stand cry -- jump excellency for you life jump the guard will be upon we behind I in the passage i see a light and the glitter of arm a shot ring out and a bullet whiz past I but i stand unharmed then i jump and nearly upset the boat but take a oar i begin to row for life and as we draw away from those grim black wall the fire belch forth from three rifle row i shriek turn to see if my fair companion have be hit keep cool excellency urge the finn see right away there in the shadow we might trick they for the patrol-boat will be at the head of the river wait to cut we off again the guard fire upon we but in the darkness they aim be faulty light appear in the high window of the castle and we could see that the greatest commotion have be cause by the escape of the prisoner the man at the door in the tower be shout to the patrol-boat which be nowhere to be see call they to row we down and capture we but by ply we oar rapidly we shoot straight across the lake until we get under the deep shadow of the opposite shore and then creep gradually along in the direction we have come if we meet the boat excellency we must run ashore and take to the wood explain the finn it be we only chance scarcely have he speak when out in the center of the lake we could just distinguish a long boat with three rower go swiftly towards the entrance to the river which we so desire to gain look cry we guide backing water and bring the boat to a standstill they be in search of we if we be discover they will fire it be they order no boat be allow upon this lake elma sit watch we pursuer but still calm and silent she seem to intrust herself entirely to I the guard be rowing rapidly the oar sound in the rowlock evidently in the belief that we have make for the river but the finlander have apparently foresee this and for that reason we be lie safe from observation in the deep shadow of a overhang tree a gray mist be slowly rise from the water and the finn notice it hope that it might favor we in finland in late autumn the mist be often as thick as we proverbial london fog only whiter denser and more frosty if we disembark we shall be compel to make a detour of fully four day in the forest in order to pass the marsh he point out in a low whisper but if we can enter the river we can go ashore anywhere and get by foot to some place where the lady can lie in hide what do you advise we be entirely in you hand the chief of police tell I he could trust you i think it will be best to risk it he say in russian after a brief pause we will tie up the boat and i will go along the bank and see what the guard be do you will remain here and i shall not be see the rush and undergrowth be higher further along but if there be danger while i be absent get out and go straight westward until you find the marsh then keep along its bank due south and draw up the boat to the bank the shrewd big-boned fellow disappear into the dark undergrowth there be no sign yet of the break of day indeed the star be now hide and the great plane of water be every moment grow more indistinct as we both sit in silence my ear be strain to catch the dip of a oar or a voice but beyond the lapping of the water beneath the boat there be no other sound i take the hand of the fair-faced girl at my side and press it in return she press mine it be the only means by which we could exchange confidence she whom i have seek through all those month sit at my side yet powerless to utter one single word still hold she hand in both my own i grip they to show she that i intend to be she champion while she turn to I in confidence as though happy that it should be so what i wonder be she history what be the mystery surround she what could be that secret which have cause she enemy to thus brutally maim and mutilate she and afterwards send she to that grim terrible fortress that still loom up before we in the gloom surely she secret must affect some person very seriously or such drastic means would never be employ to secure she silence suddenly i hear a stealthy footstep approach and next moment a low voice speak which i recognize as that of we friend the finn there be danger excellency -- a grave danger he say in a low half whisper three boat be in search of we and scarcely have he utter those word when there be the flash of a rifle from the haze a loud report and again a bullet whiz past just behind my head in a instant the truth become apparent for i see the dark shadow of a boat rapidly row bearing full upon we the shot have be fire as a signal that we have be sight and be pursue other shot ring out mingle with the wild exultant shout of the guard as they bear down full upon we and then i know that notwithstanding we escape we be now lose they be too close upon we to admit of elude they the peril we have dread have fall the finn 's presence on the bank have evidently be detect by a boat draw up at the shore and he have be follow to where we have lie in what we have so foolishly believe to be a safe hiding-place nought else be to be do but to face the inevitable three time the red fire of a rifle belch angrily in we face and yet by good fortune neither of we be strike yet we know too well that the intention of we pursuer be to kill we quick excellency fly while there be yet time gasp the finn grasp my hand and half drag I from the boat while i in turn place elma upon the bank _ hoida _ this way swiftly cry we guide and the three of we heedless of the consequence plunge forward into the impenetrable darkness just as we fierce pursuer come alongside where we have only a moment ago be seat they shout wildly as they spring to land after we but we guide who have be bear and breed in these forest know well how to travel in a semi-circle and how to conceal himself it be a race for freedom -- nay for very life so dark that we could see before we hardly a foot we be compel to place we hand in front of we to avoid collision with the big tree trunk while ever and anon we find ourselves entangled in the mass of dead creeper and vegetable parasite that form the dense undergrowth around we on every side we hear the shout and curse of we pursuer while above the rest we hear a authoritative voice evidently that of a sergeant of the guard cry -- shoot the man but spare the woman the colonel want she back do not let she escape we shall be well reward so keep on comrade _ mene edemmäski _ but the tremble girl beside I hear nothing and perhaps indeed it be best that she could not hear my only fear be that we pursuer of whom there now seem to be a dozen have extend with the intention of encircle we they no doubt know every inch of that giant forest with its numerous bog and marsh and if they could not discover we would no doubt drive we into one or other of the bog where escape be impossible we gallant guide on the other hand seem to utterly disregard the danger and keep on every now and then stretch out he hand and help along the afflict girl we have rescue from that live tomb headlong we go in a straight line until suddenly we begin to feel we foot sink into the soft ground and then the finlander turn to the leave at right angle and we find ourselves in a denser undergrowth where in the darkness we hand and face become badly scratch another gun be fire as signal echo through the wood but the sound come from the opposite direction to that we be travel therefore we hope that we have elude those whose earnest desire it be to capture we for the reward suddenly however a second gun a answering signal be fire from straight before we and that reveal the truth we be actually between the two party and they be close in upon we they have already drive we to the edge of the bog the finlander recognize we peril as quickly as i do and halt let we turn straight back he urge breathlessly we may yet elude they and then we again turn off at right angle travel as quickly as we be able back towards the lake shore it be a exciting chase in the darkness for we know not whither we be go nor into what pitfall or ravine or treacherous marsh we might fall once we see afar through the tree the light of a lantern hold by a guard and already the sweet-faced girl beside I seem tired and terribly fatigued but we hurry on and on strive to make no noise and yet the crackling of wood beneath we foot seem to we to sound like the noise of thunder at last breathless we halt to listen we be already in sight of the gray mist where lay the silent lake that hold so many secret there be not a sound the guard have go straight on believe they have drive we into that deadly bog wherein if we have enter we must have be slowly suck down and engulf they be surround it no doubt feeling certain of they prey but we creep along the water 's edge until in the gray light we could distinguish two empty boat -- that of the guard and we own we be again at the spot where we have disembark let we row to the head of the lake suggest the finn we may then land and escape they and a moment later we be all three in the guard ' boat rowing with all we might under the deep shadow of the bank northward in the opposite direction to the town of nystad we keep a sharp look-out for any other boat but see none the signal ashore have attract all the guard to that spot to join in the search and now have double back and again embark we be every moment increase the distance between ourselves and we pursuer i think we must have row several mile for ere we land again upon a low flat and barren shore the first gray streak of day be show in the east elma notice it and keep she great brown eye fix upon it thoughtfully it be the dawn for she -- the dawn of a new life we eye meet she smile at I and then gaze again eastward full of silent meaning have land we draw the boat up and conceal it in the undergrowth so that the guard on search should not know the direction we have take and then we go straight on northward across the low-lying land to where the forest show dark against the morning gray the mist have now somewhat clear but the air be keen and frosty this wood we find be of tall high pine where walking be not difficult a wide wilderness of tree which hour after hour we traverse in the vain endeavor to find the rough path which we guide tell we lead for a hundred mile from alavo down to tammerfor the manufacturing center of the country but to discover a path in a forest forty mile wide be a matter of considerable difficulty and for hour we wander on and on but alas always in vain faint and hungry yet we still keep courage fortunately we find a little spring and all three of we drink eagerly with we hand but of food we have nothing save a small piece of hard rye bread which the finn have in he pocket the remains of he evening meal and this we give to elma who half famished eat it quickly we know quite well that it would be a easy matter to die of starvation in that great trackless forest therefore we keep on undaunted while the yellow autumn sun struggle through the dark pine glint on the straight gray trunk and reflect a golden light in that dead unbroken silence how many mile we trudge i have no idea it be a consolation to know that we now have no pursuer yet what fate lay before we we know not if we could only find that forest-road we might come across some wood-cutter 's hut where we could obtain rough food of some sort yet we guide use as he be to those enormous wood of central finland be utterly out of he bearing and no mark of civilization attract he quick experienced eye the light above gradually fade and over a sharp stone elma stumble and rip she shoe i look at my watch and find that it be already five o'clock in a hour it would be dark the beginning of the long northern night elma who be weary and footsore ask by sign to be permit to lay down and rest therefore we gather a bed of dry leaf for she and she lay down and while we watch she be soon asleep the finn who declare that he do not suffer from the cold remove he coat and place it tenderly upon she shoulder while there be still a ray of light i watch she white refined feature as she sleep and be sorely tempt to bend and imprint a kiss upon that soft invite cheek yet i have no right to do so -- no right to take such a advantage the long cold night pass wearily and the howling of the wolf cause I to grip my revolver yet at daybreak we arise refresh and notwithstanding the terrible pang of hunger now gnawing at we vitals we be prepare to renew we desperate dash for liberty although i have paper i possess no pencil with which to write therefore i could only communicate by sign with the mysterious prisoner of kajana the beautiful dark-eyed girl who hold I irrevocably beneath the spell of she beauty all the little act of homage i be able to perform she accept with a quiet calm dignity while in she deep luminous eye i read a unfathomable mystery the mist have not clear for it be soon after dawn when we again move along hungry chill and yet hopeful at a spring we obtain some water and then in silent procession press forward in search of the rough track of the woodcutter elma 's tear shoe give she considerable trouble and notice she limp i induce she to sit down while i take it off hope to be able to mend it but have unlaced it i see that upon she stock be a large patch of congeal blood where she foot itself have also be cut i manage to beat the nail of the shoe with a stone so that its sole should not be lose and she readjust it allow I to lace it up for she and smile the while forward we trudge ever forward across that enormous forest where the myriad treetrunk present the same dismal scene everywhere a forest untrodden save by wild half-savage lumberman throughout that dull gray day we march onward faint with hunger yet suffer but little pain for the first pang be now past and be succeed by slight light-headedness my only fear be that we should be compel to spend another night without shelter and what its effect might be upon the delicately-reared girl whose hand i hold tenderly in mine surely my position be a strange one she terrible affliction seem to cause she to be entirely dependent upon I suddenly just as the yellow sunlight overhead have begin to fade the flat-faced finn whose name he have tell I be felix estlander cry joyfully -- _ polushaite _ look excellency ah the road at last and as we glance before we we see that he quick well-trained eye have detect away in the twilight at some distance a path traverse we vista among the gray-green tree-trunk then hurry along we find ourselves upon a track on which we turn to the right -- a track rough and deeply-rutted by the fell trunk that be drag along it to the nearest river elma make a gesture of renew hope and all three of we redouble we pace expect every moment to come upon some log hut the owner of which would surely give we hospitality for the night but darkness come on quickly and yet we still push forward poor elma be limp and i know that she injured foot be pain she even though she could tell I nothing at last however after walk for nearly four hour in the almost impenetrable forest gloom always fear lest we might miss the path we heart suddenly beat quickly by see before we a light shine in a window and five minute later felix be knock at the door and ask in finnish the occupant to give hospitality to a lady lose in the forest we hear a low growl like a muttered imprecation within and when the door open there stand upon the threshold a tall bearded muscular old fellow in a dirty red shirt with a big revolver shine in he hand a quick glance at we satisfy he that we be not thief and he invite we in while felix explain that we have land from the lake and we boat have drift away we have be compel to take to the wood the man hear the finn 's picturesque story and then say something to I which felix translate into russian you excellency be welcome to all the poor fare he have he give up he bed in the room yonder to the lady so that she may rest he be honor by you excellency 's presence and while he be make this explanation the herculean wood-cutter in the red shirt stir the red ember whereon a big pot be simmer and send forth a appetizing odor and in five minute we be all three sit down to a stew of capercailzie with a foam light beer as a fitting beverage we finish the dish with such lightning rapidity that we host boil we a number of egg which i fear denude he larder the place be a poor one of two low room build of rough log-pine with double window for the winter and a high brick stove cleanliness be not exactly its characteristic nevertheless we all pass a very comfortable hour and receive a warm welcome from the lonely old fellow who pass he life so far beyond european civilization and whose house he tell we be often snow up and cut off from all the world for three or four month at a time after we have finish we meal i ask the sturdy old fellow for a pencil but the nearest thing he possess be a stick of thick charcoal and with that it be surely difficult to communicate with we fair companion therefore she rise give I she hand bow smilingly and then pass into the inner room and close the door the old wood-cutter give we some coarse tobacco and after smoking and chat for a hour we throw ourselves wearily upon the wooden bench and sleep soundly suddenly however at early dawn we be startle by a loud banging at the door the clattering of hoof and authoritative shout in russian the old wood-cutter spring up and look through a chink in the heavy shutter turn to we with blanch face whisper breathlessly -- the police what can they want of I open shout the horseman outside open in the name of he majesty felix and i spring up face each other we be entrap in a instant we guide felix make a dash for the door of the inner room where elma have retire but next second he reappear gasp in russian -- excellency why the door be open the lady have go go i cry dismayed rush into the little room where i find the truckle couch empty and the door lead outside wide open she have actually disappear the police again batter at the opposite door threaten loudly to break it in if it be not open at once whereupon the old wood-cutter draw the bolt and admit they two big hulk fellow in heavy riding-coat and sword stride in while two other remain mount outside hold the horse you name demand one of the fellow glance at we as we stand together in expectation we host tell they he name and ask why they wish to enter we be search for a woman who have escape from kajana be the reply have you see any woman here no respond the wood-cutter we never see any woman out in these wood the police-officer stride into the inner room glance around to make certain that no one be conceal there and then return to I ask who be you that be my own affair i answer the mystery of elma 's disappearance while we have sleep annoyed I she seem to have flee from I in secret yet could she have receive some warning that the police be in search of she she be deaf therefore she could not have be alarm by the banging on the door you identity be my affair declare the man with the fair bristly beard a average type of the uncouth officer of police who be you chief i inquire as a sudden thought occur to I melnikoff at helsingfor then this be not in the district of abo no but what difference do it make who be you gordon gregg british subject i reply and you be the drosky-driver from abo remark the fellow turn to felix exactly as i think you be the pair who bribe the nun at kajana and succeed in release the englishwoman in the name of the czar i arrest you the old wood-cutter turn pale as death we certainly be in grave peril for i foresee the danger of fall into the hand of baron oberg the strangler of finland yet we have a satisfaction in know that be the mystery what it might elma have escape and on what charge pray do you presume to arrest I i inquire as coolly as i could for aid a prisoner to escape then i wish to say first that you have no power to arrest I and secondly that if you wish I to give you satisfaction i be perfectly willing to do so provide you first accompany I down to abo it be outside my district growl the fellow but i see that he hesitancy be due to he uncertainty as to whom i really might be i desire you to take I to the chief of police boranskus who will make all the explanation necessary until we have a interview with he i refuse to give any information concern myself i say but you have a passport i draw it from my pocket say -- it prove i think that my name be what i have tell you the fellow standing astride read it and hand it back to I where be the woman he demand tell I i do not know be my reply perhaps you will tell I he say turn to the old wood-cutter with a sinister expression upon he face remember these fugitive be find in you house and you be liable to arrest i do not know -- indeed i do not protest the old fellow tremble beneath the officer 's threat like all he class he fear the police and hold they in dread ah you do not remember i suppose he smile well perhaps you memory will be refresh by a month or two in prison you be also arrest but you excellency i -- enough blare the bristly officer you have give shelter to conspirator you know the penalty in finland for that surely but these gentleman be surely not conspirator the poor old man protest he excellency be english and the english do not plot we shall see afterwards he laugh and then turn to the agent of police at he side he give he order to search the log-hut carefully a investigation in which one of the man from the outside join they upset everything and pry everywhere you may find papers or letter say the officer search thoroughly and in every corner they rummage even to take up a number of board in the inner room which elma have occupy but they find nothing a dozen time be the old wood-cutter question but he stubbornly refuse to admit that he have ever set eye upon elma while i insist on my right to return to abo and see boranski i know of course by what we have overhear say by the prison-guard that the governor-general be extremely anxious to recapture the girl with whom i frankly admit i have now so utterly fall in love and it appear that no effort be be spare to search for we indeed the whole of the police in the province of abo and of helsingfor seem to be actively make a house-to-house search but what could be the truth of elma 's disappearance have she flee of she own accord or have she once more fall a victim to some ingenious and dastardly plot that gray dress of hers might i recollected betray she if she dare to venture near any town while she affliction would of itself be plain evidence of identification all i hope be that she have go and hide herself in the forest somewhere in the vicinity to wait until the danger of recapture have pass for nearly half a hour i argue with the police officer whose intention it be to take I under arrest to helsingfor once there however i know too well that my liberty would be probably go for ever whatever be the baron 's motive in hold the poor girl a prisoner it would also be he motive to silence I i know too much for he liking i refuse to go to helsingfor i say defiantly i be a british subject and demand to be take back to the port where my passport be viséd this argument i repeat time after time until at length i succeed in convince he that i really have a right to be take to abo and to seek the aid of the british vice-consul if necessary for as long as possible i succeed in delay we departure but at length just as the yellow sun begin to struggle through the gray cloud we be all three compel to depart in sorrowful procession what we wonder have really happen to elma it be evident that she have not fall into the hand of the police nevertheless the fact that the door of the inner room be open cause they to look upon the statement of the wood-cutter with distinct suspicion and disbelief we captor seem quite well aware of all the circumstance of we escape from kajana and be consequently fill with chagrin that elma the person they so much desire to recapture have slip through they finger while the police ride we be compel to walk before they and after trudge ten mile or so through the forest we come across another small posse of police who be apparently in search of we for they express delight when they see we under arrest where be the woman inquire one officer of the other still at liberty reply the man who hold we as prisoner in hide twenty verst back i think ah we shall find she before long he say confidently within twelve hour we shall have search the whole forest she can not escape we we captor explain who we be and then we be push forward again skirt a great wide lake call the nasjarvus along the wooded shore of which we walk the whole day long until at sundown we come to a picturesque little log-built town face the water call filppulum here we obtain a hasty meal and afterwards take the train down to abo where we arrive next morning after a very uncomfortable and sleepless journey at nine o'clock i stand in the big bare office of michael boranskus where only a few day before we have have such a heated argument as soon as the chief of police enter he recognize I under arrest and dismiss my guard with a wave of the hand -- all save the officer who have bring I there the finnish driver and the old wood-cutter be in another room therefore i stand alone with the police-officer of helsingfor and the chief of police at abo the latter listen to the officer 's story of my arrest without say a word the prisoner you excellency desire to be bring here to you before be take to helsingfor he say you would be aware of the fact and so i be remark boranskus with a smile there be no conspiracy you must at once release this gentleman and the other two prisoner but excellency the governor-general have issue order for the prisoner 's arrest and deportation to helsingfor that may be but i be chief of police in abo and i release he the officer look at I in such blank astonishment that i could not resist smile i be well aware of the reason of this englishman 's visit to the north add boranski more need not be say have the lady be arrest no you excellency every effort be be make to find she colonel smirnoff have already be relieve of he post as governor of kajana and many of the guard be under arrest for complicity in the plot to allow the woman to escape ah yes i see from the despatch that a reward be offer for she recapture the governor-general be determine that she shall not escape remark the other she be probably hide in the forest somewhere or other of course they be make a thorough search over every verst of it if she be there she will most certainly be find no doubt remark boranskus lean back in he padded chair and look at I meaningly across the litter table and now i wish to speak to this englishman privately so please leave we also inform the other two prisoner that they be at liberty but you excellency do this upon he own responsibility he say anxiously remember that i bring they to you under arrest and i release they entirely at my own discretion he say as chief of police of this province i be permit to use my jurisdiction and i exercise it in this matter you be liberty to report that at helsingfor if you so desire but i should suggest that you say nothing unless absolutely oblige -- you understand the manner in which boranskus speak apparently decide my captor for after a moment 's hesitation he say salute : if that be really you wish then i will obey and he leave excellency exclaim the chief of police rise quickly and walk towards I as soon as the door be close and we be alone you have have a very narrow escape -- very i do my best to assist you i succeed in bribe the water-guard at kajana in order that you might secure the lady 's release but it seem that just at the very moment when you be about to get away one of the guard turn informer and rouse the governor of the castle with the result that you all three nearly lose you life the whole matter have be report to I officially and he add with a grim smile my man be now search everywhere for you but why be baron oberg so extremely anxious to recapture miss heath i ask earnestly i have no idea be he reply the secret order from helsingfor to I be to arrest she at all hazard -- alive or dead which mean that the baron would not regret if she be dead i remark in response to which he nod in the affirmative i tell he of the faithful service of felix the finlander whereupon he say simply : i tell you that you might trust he implicitly but now that you have show yourself my friend i say you will assist miss heath to escape this man who desire to hold she prisoner in that awful place they be drive she mad i will do my best he answer but shake he head dubiously but you must recollect that baron oberg be governor-general of finland with all the power of the czar himself and if elma heath again fall into he unscrupulous hand she will die i declare ah he sigh look I straight in the face i fear that what you say be only too true she evidently hold some secret which he fear she will reveal he wish to rearrest she in order -- well -- he add in a low tone in order to close she lip it would not be the first time that person have be silence in secret at kajana many fatal accident take place in that fortress you know chapter xii the strangler where be elma what be the cause of she inexplicable disappearance into the gloomy forest while we have sleep i return to the hotel where i have stay on my arrival a comfortable place call the phoenix and lunch there alone both felix the finn and my host the wood-cutter have receive they _ douceur _ and leave but to the last-named i have give instruction to return home at once and report by telegraph any news of my lose one a thousand conflict thought arise within I as i sit in that crowded _ salle-à-manger _ fill with a gobble crowd of the commercial man of abo i have i recognize now to deal with the most powerful man in that country and i suffer a distinct disadvantage by be in ignorance of the reason he hold that sweet english girl a prisoner the tragedy of the dastardly manner in which she have be willfully maim cause my blood to boil within I i have never believe that in this civilized twentieth century such thing could be michael boranskus have give he pledge to assist I yet he have most plainly explain to I he fear the baron be intent upon again get elma into he power be it at he order i wonder that the sweet-faced girl have be deprive of speech and hearing have she fall a innocent victim to he infamous scheming about I man be eat strange dish and talk in finnish while other be smoking and drink they vodka but i be in no mood for observation my only thought be of she who be now lose to I why have she disappear without warn i be at loss to imagine yet i could only surmise that she flight have be compulsory some woman possess a mysterious sense of intuition a curious and indescribable faculty of know when evil threaten they that present a strange and puzzling problem to we scientist it be unaccountable and yet many woman possess it in a very marked degree be it therefore possible that elma have awaken and be warn of she peril have flee without arouse we the suggestion be possible but i fear improbable another very curious feature in the affair be the sudden manner in which michael boranskus have exert he power and influence in order to render I that service he have actually bribe the guard of kajana he have instruct the faithful felix he have provide we boat and he have order the nun to open the water-gate to I why there be i feel convince some hidden motive in all that sudden and marked friendliness that he really hate the english i have see plainly when we have first meet and i have only compel he to serve I by present the order sign by the emperor which make I he guest within the russian dominion even that document do not account for the length he have go to secure the release of the woman i now love in secret the more i think it over the more anxious do i become i could discern no motive for he friendliness and truth to tell i always distrust those who be too friendly what straight and decide line of action should i take carefully i go over all the strange event that have happen in england and while anxious to obtain some solution of the amazing problem yet i could not bring myself to leave finland and allow elma to fall into the clutch of that high official who so persistently seek she end no i would go to he and face he i be anxious to see what manner of man be the strangler of finland therefore that same evening i leave abo and travel by rail up to the junction toijalum whence after a wait of six hour i resume by slow journey to helsingfor i put up at kamp 's a elegant hotel on the long esplanade overlook the port and find the town with its handsome street and spacious square to be a much finer place than i have believe when i inquire of the french director of my hotel for the residence of he excellency the governor-general he regard I with some surprise say : the baron live up at the palace m ` sieur -- that great building opposite the salutong the driver of you drosky will point it out to you be he excellency in helsingfor at the present moment i ask the baron never leave the palace m ` sieur respond the man this be a strange country you know he add with a grin it be say that he excellency be in hourly fear of assassination perhaps not without cause i remark in a low voice at which he elevate he shoulder and smile at noon i descend from a drosky before a long gray massive building over the big doorway of which be a large escutcheon bear the russian arm emblazon in gold and on enter where a sentry stand on either side a colossal concierge in livery of bright blue and gold come forward to meet I ask in russian : whom do you wish to see he excellency the governor-general have you a appointment no he excellency see no one without a appointment the man tell I somewhat gruffly i be not here on public business but upon a private matter i explain perhaps i may see he excellency 's secretary if you wish but i repeat that he excellency see no one without a previous appointment i know this quite well for the strangler of finland fearful of assassination be as unapproachable as the czar himself follow the direction of the concierge however i cross a great bare courtyard and ascend a wide stone staircase be confront by a servant who on hear my inquiry take I into a waiting-room and leave with my card to colonel luganskus whom he inform I be the baron 's private secretary after ten minute or so the man return say : the colonel will see you if you will please step this way and follow he he conduct I into the richly furnished private apartment of the palace across a great hall fill with fine painting and then up a long thickly-carpeted passage to a small elegant room where a tall bald-headed man in military uniform stand await I you name be m ` sieur gregg he exclaim in very good french and i understand you desire audience of he excellency the governor-general i regret however that he never give audience to stranger the matter upon which i desire to see he excellency be of a purely private and confidential nature i say for use as i be to the way of foreign officialdom i speak with the same firm courtesy as himself i be very sorry m ` sieur but i fear it will be necessary in that case for you to write to he excellency and mark you letter ` personal ' it will then go into the governor-general 's own hand what i have to say can not be commit to write be my reply i must see baron oberg upon a matter which affect he personally and which admit of no delay he glance at I quickly and then in a low voice inquire : be it in regard to a -- well a conspiracy he question instantly suggest to I a ruse and i reply in the affirmative then you can place the fact before I without the slightest hesitation he say go to the door and slip the bolt into its socket anything speak into my ear be as though it be speak into that of he excellency himself i much regret m ` sieur the colonel that i must see the baron in person have the plot assassination as its object -- or revolt he ask pointedly that i will explain to the baron only but i tell you he will not see you we have so many person here with secret information concern finnish conspiracy against we russian rule why if he excellency see everyone who desire to see he he would be compel to give audience the whole twenty-four hour round at a glance i see that this elegant colonel who seem to take the greatest pride over he exquisitely keep person and he spotless uniform do not intend to allow I the satisfaction of a audience of that most hated official of the czar the latter be in fear of the dagger the pistol or the bomb and consequently hedge himself in by person of the colonel 's type -- courteous diplomatic but utterly unbending after some further argument i say at last in a firm tone : i wish to impress upon you the extreme importance of the information i have to impart and can only repeat that it be a matter concern he excellency privately will you therefore do I the favor to take my name to he he excellency refuse to be trouble with the name of stranger be he cold reply as he turn over my card in he hand but if i write upon it the nature of my business and enclose it in a envelope will you then take it to he i suggest he hesitate for a short time twist he mustache and then reply with great reluctance : well if you be so determine you may write you business upon you card i therefore take out one and on the back write in french the word which i know must have the effect of obtain a audience for I : _ to give information regard miss elma heath _ this i enclose in the envelope he hand to I when ring a bell he hand it to the footman who appear with order to take it to he excellency and await a reply the response come in a few minute he excellency will give audience to the english m ` sieur then i rise and follow the footman through several wide corridor fill with palm and flower which form a kind of winter-garden until we cross a red-carpeted ante-room where two statuesque sentry stand on guard and the man conduct I rap at the great polished mahogany door of the room beyond a voice respond the door be open and i find myself in a high beautifully-painted room with long window hang with pastel-blue silk with heavy gilt fringe a pastel-blue carpet and upon the opposite wall a great canopy of rich purple velvet bear the double-headed eagle embroider in gold the apartment be splendidly decorate and in the center of the parquet floor with he back to the light be the thin wiry figure of a elderly man in a funereal frock-coat in the lapel of which show the red and yellow ribbon of the order of saint anne he hand be behind he back and he stand purposely in such a position that when i enter i could not at first see he face against the strong gray light behind but when the footman have bow and retire and we be alone he turn slightly and i then see that he bony face with high cheek-bone slight gray side-whisker hard mouth and black eye set closely together be one that bear the mark of evil upon it -- the keen sinister countenance of one who could act without any compunction and without regret truly one would not be surprise at any cruel dastardly action of a man with such a face -- the face of a oppressor well he snap in french in a high-pitched voice you want to see I concern that mad english girl what picturesque lie do you intend to tell I concern she i have no intention of tell any untruth concern she be my quick response as i face he unflinchingly she have tell I sufficient to -- she have tell you something ah i guess as much i expect this and i see that he thin crafty face go pale while he eye glance evilly upon I he believe that she have reveal to I she secret he place he hand upon the back of a chair wherein be conceal a electric button and next instant a little stout man in shabby black appear as though by magic through a secret door hide in the dark paneling of the audience chamber -- the man who be he personal guard against the plot for he assassination he excellency speak and the word he utter stagger I i stand aghast seize that man he cry point to I he be arm he have just threaten to kill I he be the man against whom we be recently warn -- the englishman ah i cry standing before the thin-faced official of the czar the unscrupulous man who have crush finland beneath the iron heel of russium and who by he lie allegation now hold I in he power i see you object baron oberg you intend to arrest I as a conspirator search the fellow he have a revolver there in he hip-pocket declare the governor-general and in a instant the short ferret-eyed little man have run he hand down I and feel my weapon i draw it forth and hand it to he say : you be quite welcome to it if you fear that i be here with any sinister motive he obtain admission by a clever ruse the baron explain to the police agent and then he threaten I it be untrue i protest hotly i have merely call to see you regard the young english lady elma heath -- the unfortunate lady whom you consign to the fortress of kajana the mad woman you mean he laugh she be not mad i cry but as sane as you yourself it be you who intend that the horror of the castle should drive she insane and thus you secret should be keep what do you suggest he demand step a few pace towards I i mean xavier oberg that you would kill elma heath if you dare to do so i answer plainly as i face he unflinchingly you see he laugh turn to the stout man at my side the fellow be insane he do not know what he be talk about ah my dear malkoff i have have a narrow escape he come here intend to shoot I i do not i protest i be here to demand satisfaction on behalf of miss heath oh -- well if the lady care to come here herself i will give she the satisfaction she desire be he crafty reply the lady have escape you and it be therefore hardly likely she will willingly return to helsingfor i say it be you who succeed by throw the guard into the water in abduct she from the castle he remark but he add sneeringly with a sinister smile i presume you gallantry be prompt by affection -- eh that be my own affair a deaf and dumb woman be surely not a very cheerful companion and who cause she that affliction i cry hotly when she be at chichester she possess speech and hearing as other girl indeed she be not afflict when on board the _ lolum _ in leghorn harbor only a few month ago perhaps you recollect the narrow escape the yacht have on the melorium sand he eye meet mine and i see by he draw face and narrow brow that my word be cause he the utmost consternation my object be to make he believe that i know more than i really do -- to hold he in fear in fact perhaps the man whom some know as hornby or woodroffe could tell a interesting story i go on he will no doubt when he meet elma heath and find the terrible affliction of which she have be the victim he thin bony countenance be bloodless he mouth twitch and he gray brow contract quickly i have not the least idea what you mean my dear sir he stammer all that you say be entirely enigmatical to I what have i to do with this mad englishwoman 's affair send out this man i say point to the detective malkoff who have appear from behind the paneling of the audience-chamber send he out and i will tell you but the representative of the czar always as much in dread of assassination as he imperial master refuse i see that what i have say have upset he and that he be not at all clear as to how much or how little of the true fact i know the connection between the little miniature cross of the order of st anne and that red and yellow ribbon in he button-hole strike I forcibly at that moment and i say : i have no desire to make any statement before a second person i come here to see you privately and in private will i speak i have certain information that will i feel confident be of the utmost interest to you -- concern another woman armida santinus he lip be press together and i notice how he start when i utter the name of that woman whom i have find dead in rannoch wood and whose body have so mysteriously disappear and what on earth can the woman concern I he ask with a brave attempt to remain cool still speak in french only that you know she be my brief reply then with my eye still fix upon he i ask : will you not now request this gentleman to retire he hesitate a moment and then with a wave of he hand dismiss the man he have summon to he aid a moment later the strangler 's personal protector have disappear through that secret door in the paneling by which he have enter well ask the baron turn quickly to I again he dark evil eye try to fathom my intention well i ask and what pray can you profit by denounce I as a assassin remember baron that you secret be mine i say in a clear voice full of meaning and you intention be blackmail -- eh he snap walk to the window and back again how much do you want my intention be nothing of the kind my object be to avenge the outrageous injury to elma heath of course that be only natural m ` sieur if you have fall in love with she he say but be not you intention somewhat ill-advised consider she position as a criminal lunatic she be neither i protest quickly very well you know better than myself he laugh the offense for which she be condemn to confinement in a fortress be the attempt assassination of madame vakuroff wife of the general command the uleaborg military division assassination i cried have you actually send she to prison as a murderess i have not the criminal court of abo do so he say dryly the offense have since be prove to have be the outcome of a political conspiracy and the minister of the interior in petersburg last week sign a order for the prisoner 's transportation to the island of saghalien ah i remark with set tooth because you fear lest she shall write down you secret you be insulting you evidently do not know what you be say he exclaim resentfully i know what i be say quite well you have request she removal to saghalien in order that the truth shall be never know but baron oberg i add with mock politeness you may do as you will you may send elma heath to she grave you may hold I prisoner if you dare but there be still witness of you crime that will rise against you in a instant he go ghastly pale and i know that my blind shot have strike its mark the man before I be guilty of some crime but what it be only elma herself could tell that he have have she arrest for a attempt political assassination only show how ingeniously and craftily the heartless ruler of that ruin country have lay he plan he fear elma and therefore have conspire to have she send out to that dismal penal island in the far-off pacific you do not fear arrest m ` sieur he ask as though with some surprise not in the least -- at least not arrest by you you may be the representative of the emperor in finland but even here there be justice for the innocent a sinister smile play around the thin gray lip of the man whose very name be hate through the great empire of the czar and be synonymous of oppression injustice and heartless tyranny all i can repeat he say be that if you bring the young englishwoman here i shall be quite prepared to hear she appeal and he laugh harshly you ask that because you know it be impossible i say whereat he again laugh in my face -- a laugh which make I wonder whether elma have not already fall into he hand the uncertainty of she fate hold I in terrible suspense i merely wish to impress upon you the fact that i have not the slightest interest whatsoever in the person in question he say coldly you seem to have form some romantic attachment towards this young woman who attempt to poison madame vakuroff and to have succeed in rescue she from kajana you afterwards disregard the fact that you be liable to a long term of imprisonment yourself and actually have the audacity to seek audience of I and make all sort of hint and suggestion that i have hold the woman a prisoner for my own end not only do i repeat that baron oberg i say quickly but i also allege that it be at you instigation that in siena a operation be perform upon the unfortunate girl which deprive she of speech and hearing at my instigation yes at yours he laugh again but uneasily a force laugh and lean against the edge of the big writing-table near the window well what next he inquire pretend to be interested in my allegation what do you want of I i desire you to give the mademoiselle heath she complete freedom i say be that all all -- for the present but she future be not in my hand the minister in petersburg have decree she removal to saghalien as a person dangerous to the state which mean that she will be ill-treated -- knout to death perhaps we do not use the knout in the russian prison nowadays he say briefly he majesty have decree its abolition but you adopt torture in kajana and schusselburg instead my time be too limited to discuss we penal system m ` sieur he exclaim impatiently while i could well see that he be anxious to escape before i make any further charge against he i have already show he that elma have speak and he fear that she have tell the truth while this would embitter he against she and cause he to seek to silence she at all hazard it be of course in my own interest that he should fear any revelation that i might make you have pose in england as the uncle of elma heath and yet you here hold she prisoner for what reason i demand she be hold prisoner by the state -- for conspiracy against russian rule -- not by herself personally who entice she here why you yourself who conspire to throw the guilt of this attempt murder of the general 's wife upon she you -- you the man whom they call ` the strangler of finland ' but i will avenge the cruel and abominable affliction you have place upon she she secret -- you secret baron oberg -- shall be publish to the world you be she enemy -- and therefore mine very well he growl between he tooth advance towards I threateningly he fist clench in he rage recollect m ` sieur that you have insult I recollect that i be governor-general of finland if you be czar himself i should not hesitate to denounce you as the tyrant and mutilator of a poor defenseless woman and to whom pray will you tell this romantic story of yours he laugh hoarsely to you prison wall below the lake at kajana yes m ` sieur gregg you will go there and once within the fortress you shall never again see the light of day you threaten I -- the governor-general of finland he laugh in a strange high-pitched key as he throw himself into a chair and scribble something rapidly upon paper append he signature in he small crabbed handwriting i do not threaten i say in open defiance i shall act and so shall i he say with a evil grin upon he bony face as he blot what he have write and take it up add : in the darkness and silence of you living tomb you can tell whatever strange story you like concern I they be use to idiot where you be go he add grimly oh and where be i go back to kanaja this order consign you to confinement there as a dangerous political conspirator as one who have threaten I -- it consign you to the cell below the lake -- for life i laugh aloud and my hand seek my wallet wherein be that all-powerful document -- the order of the emperor which give I as a imperial guest immunity from arrest i would produce it as my trump-card next second however i hold my breath and i think i must have turn pale my pocket be empty my wallet have be steal entirely and helplessly i have fall into the hand of the tyrant of the czar he own personal interest would be to consign I to a living tomb in that grim fortress of kajana the horror of which be unspeakable i have see enough during my inspection of the russian prison as a journalist to know that there in strangle finland i should not be treat with the same consideration or humanity as in petersburg or warsaw the governor-general consign I to kajana as a political which be synonymous with a sentence of death in those damp dark _ oubliette _ beneath the water-dungeon every whit as awful as those of the pari bastile we face each other and i look straight into he gray bony face and answer in a tone of defiance : you be governor-general it be true but you will i think reflect before you consign I a englishman to prison without trial i know full well that the english be hate by russium yet i assure you that in london we entertain no love for you nation or its method yes he laugh you be quite right russium have no use for a effete ally such as england be effete or powerful my country be still able to present a ultimatum when diplomacy require it i say therefore i have no fear send I to prison and i tell you that the responsibility rest upon yourself and folding my arm i keep my eye intently upon he so that he should not see that i waver as for the responsibility i certainly do not fear that m ` sieur he say but the exposure that will result -- be you prepare to face that i ask perhaps you be not aware that other beside myself -- one other indeed who be a diplomatist -- be aware of my journey here if i do not return you ministry of foreign affair in petersburg will be press for a reason which they will not give then if they do not the truth will be out i say laughing harshly for i see how determine he have become to hold I prisoner come call up you myrmidon and send I to kajana it will be the first step towards you own downfall we shall see he growl ah you surely do not think that i after ten year ' service in the british diplomatic service would dare to come to finland upon this quest -- would dare to face the rotten and corrupt officialdom which russium have place within this country -- without first take some adequate precaution no baron therefore i defy you and i leave helsingfor to-night you will not you be under arrest i laugh heartily and snap my finger say : before you give I over to you police first telegraph to you minister of finance monsieur de witte and inquire of he who and what i be i do not understand you you have merely to send my name and description to the minister and ask for a reply i say he will give you instruction -- or if you so desire ask he majesty yourself and why pray do he majesty concern himself about you he ask at once puzzle you will learn later after i be confine in kajana and you secret be know in petersburg what do you mean i mean i say i mean that i have take all the necessary step to be forearm against you the day i be incarcerate by you order the whole truth will be know i shall not be the sufferer -- but you will my word purposely enigmatical mislead he he see the drift of my argument and being of course unaware of how much i know he be still in fear of I my only uncertainty be of the actual fate of poor elma my wallet have be steal -- with a purpose without a doubt -- for the thief have deprive I of that most important of all document the open sesame to every closed door the ukase of the czar you defy I he say hoarsely turn back to the window with the write order for my imprisonment as a political still in he hand but we shall see you rule finland i say in a hard tone but you have no power over gordon gregg i have power and intend to exert it for you own ruin i remark with a self-confident smile you may give you torturer order to kill I -- order that a fatal accident shall occur within the fortress -- but i tell you frankly that my death will neither erase nor conceal you own offens there be other away in england who be aware of they and who will in order to avenge my death speak the truth remember that although elma heath have be deprive of both hearing and of speech she can still write down the true fact in black and white the czar may be you patron and you he favorite but he majesty have no tolerance of official who be guilty of what you be guilty of you talk of arrest I i add with a smile why you ought rather to go on you knee and beg my silence he go white with rage at my cut sarcasm he literally boil over for he see that i be quite cool and have no fear of he or of the terrible punishment to which he intend to consign I besides which he be fill with wonder regard the exact amount of information which elma have impart to I there be certain person i go on to whom it would be of intense interest to know the true reason why the steam-yacht _ lolum _ put into leghorn why i be entertain on board she why the safe in the british consulate be rifle and why the unfortunate girl keep a prisoner on board be take on shore just before the hurry sailing of the vessel and there be other mystery which the english police be try to solve namely the reason armida santinus and a man disguise as she husband die in scotland at the hand of a assassin but surely i need say no more it be surely sufficient to convince you that if the truth be speak the revelation would be distinctly awkward for whom he ask open he eye for you come baron i say can we not yet speak frankly but he be silent for a moment a fact which be in itself proof that my pointed argument have cause he to reconsider he intention of send I under escort back to that castle of terror if my journey there be in order to meet my love i would not have care it be the ignorance of she whereabouts or of she fate that hold I in such deep all-consuming anxiety each hour that pass increase my fond and tender affection for she and yet what irony of circumstance she have be cruelly snatch from I at the very moment that freedom have be ours i think it be well that i assume that air of defiance with the man who have ground finland beneath he heel he be unused to it no one dare to go against he will or to utter taunt or threat to he he be paramount with all the power of a emperor -- the power indeed of life and death therefore he be not in the habit of be either thwart or criticise and i could see that my word have arouse within he a boiling tumult of resentment and of rage i tell he nothing of the loss of my wallet or of the precious document that it have contain my defiance be merely upon principle arrest I if you like denounce I by means of any lie that arise to you lip but remember that the truth be know beyond the confines of the russian empire and for that reason trace will be seek of I and full explanation demand i have take precaution xavier oberg i add therefore do you worst i repeat again that i defy you he pace the big room he thin claw-like hand still clench he yellow tooth grind he dark deep-set eye fix straight before he if he have dare he would have strike I down at he foot but he do not dare i see too plainly that even though my wallet be go i still hold the trump-card -- that he fear I the mention i have make of the minister of finance however seem to cause he considerable hesitation that high official have the ear of the emperor and if i be a friend there might be inquiry as i stand before he lean against a small buhl table i watch all the complex workings of he mind and try to read the mysterious motive which have cause he to consign poor elma to kajana he be a proud bully possess neither pity nor remorse a average specimen of the high russian official a hide-bound bureaucrat a slave to etiquette and possess a veneer of polish but beneath it all i see that he be a coward in deadly fear of assassination -- a coward who dread lest some secret should be reveal that conceal door in the paneling with the armed guard lurk behind be sufficiently plain evidence that he be not the fearless governor-general that be popularly suppose he the strangler of finland have crush the gallant nation into submission ruin they commerce sap the country by impress its youth into the russian army forbid the use of the finnish language and tax the people until the factory have be compel to close down while the peasantry starve and now on the verge of revolt there have arise a band of patriot who resent ruin and who have already warn he majesty by letter that if baron oberg be not remove from he post he would die these and other thought run through my mind in the silence that follow we heated argument for i see well that he be in actual fear of I i have lead he to believe that i know everything and that he future be in my hand while he on he part be anxious to hold I prisoner and yet dare not do so my wallet have probably be steal by some lurk police-spy for russian agent abound everywhere in finland reporting conspiracy that do not exist and denounce the innocent as political the baron have halt and be look through one of the great window down upon the courtyard below where the sentry be pacing the palace be for he a gilded prison for he dare not go out for a drive in one or other of the park or for a blow on the water across to hogholmen or dagero be compel to remain there for month without show himself publicly people in abo have tell I that when he do go out into the street of helsingfor it be at night and he usually disguise himself in the uniform of a private soldier of the guard thus escape recognition by those who drive to desperation by injustice seek he life a long silence have fall between we and it now occur to I to take advantage of he hesitation therefore i say in a firm voice in french -- i think baron we interview be at a end be it not therefore i wish you good-day he turn upon I suddenly with a evil flash in he dark eye and a snarl imprecation in russian upon he lip he hand still hold the order commit I to the fortress but before i leave you will destroy that document it may fall into other hand you know and i walk towards he with quick determination i shall do nothing of the kind he snap without further word i snatch the paper from he thin white finger and tear it up before he face he countenance go livid i do not think i have ever see a man 's face assume such a expression of fiendish vindictiveness it be as though at that instant hell have be let loose within he heart but i turn upon my heel and go out pass the sentry in the ante-room along the flower-filled corridor and across the courtyard to the main entrance where the gorgeous concierge salute I as i step forth into the square i have escape by means of my own diplomacy and firmness the czar 's representative -- the man who rule that country -- fear I and for that reason do not hold I prisoner yet when i recall that evil look of revenge on my departure i could not help certain feeling of grave apprehension arise within I return to my hotel i smoked a cigar in my room and ponder where be elma be the chief question which arise within my mind by remain in helsingfor i could achieve nothing further now that i have make the acquaintance of the oppressor whereas if i return to abo i might perchance be able to obtain some clue to my love 's whereabouts i call she my love because i both pitied and love the poor afflict girl who be so helpless and defenseless therefore i take the midnight train back to abo arrive at the hotel next morning after a hour 's rest i set out anxiously in search of felix the drosky-driver i find he in he log-built house in the ludno quarter and when he ask I in i see from he face that he have news to impart well i inquire and what of the lady have she be find ah you excellency it be a pity you be not here yesterday he say with a sigh why tell I quickly what have happen i have be assist the police as spy excellency as i often do and i have see she see she where i cry in quick anxiety here in abo she arrive yesterday morning from tammerfor accompany by a englishman she have change she dress and be all in black they lunch together at the restaurant du nord opposite the landing stage and a hour later leave by steamer for petersburg a englishman i cry do you not inform the chief of police boranskus yes you excellency but he say that they passport be in order it be better to allow the lady to proceed to delay she might mean she rearrest in finland he add then they passport be viséd here on embarking i exclaimed what be the name upon that of the englishman i have it here write down excellency i can not pronounce you difficult english name and he produce a scrap of dirty paper whereon be write in a russian hand the name -- martin woodroffe chapter xiii a double game and its consequence i go to the railway station and from the time-table gather that if i leave abo by rail at noon i could be in petersburg a hour before noon on the morrow or about four hour before the arrival of the steamer by which the silent girl and she companion be passenger this i decide upon do but before leave i pay a visit to my friend boranskus who to my surprise and delight hand I my wallet with the czar 's letter intact say that it have be find upon a german thief who have be arrest at the harbor on the previous night the fellow have no doubt steal it from my pocket believe i carry my paper money in the flap the affair of the english lady be a most extraordinary one remark the chief of police toy with he pen as he sit at he big table she seem to have meet this englishman up at tammerfor or at some place further north yet it be curious that she passport should be in order even though she flee so precipitately from kajana there be a mystery connect with she disappearance from the wood-cutter 's hut that i confess i can not fathom neither can i i say i know the man who be with she and can not help fear that he be she bitterest enemy -- that he be act in concert with the baron then why be he take she to the capital -- beyond the jurisdiction of the governor-general i be go straight to petersburg to ascertain i say i have only come to thank you for you kindness in this matter truth to tell i have be somewhat surprised that you should have interested yourself on my behalf i add look straight at the uniformed official it be not on yours but on hers he answer somewhat enigmatically i know something of the affair but it be my duty as a man to help the poor girl to escape from that terrible place she have i know be unjustly condemn for the attempt assassination of the wife of a general -- condemn with a purpose of course such a thing be not unusual in finland abominable i cry oberg be a veritable fiend but the man only shrug he shoulder say -- the order of he excellency the governor-general have to be obey whatever they be we often regret but we dare not refuse to carry they out russian rule be a disgrace to we modern civilization i declare hotly i have every sympathy with those who be fight for freedom ah you be not alone in that he sigh speak in a low whisper and glance around he majesty would order reform and ameliorate the condition of he people if only it be possible but he like he official be powerless here we speak of the great uprising with bated breath but we alas know that it must come one day -- very soon -- and finland will be the first to endeavor to break she bond -- and the baron oberg the first to fall for nearly a hour i sit with he surprise to find how although he exterior be so harsh and uncouth yet he heart really bleed for the poor starving people he be so constantly force to oppress i have ruin this town of abo he declare quite frankly to my own knowledge five hundred innocent person have go to prison and another two hundred have be exile to siberium yet what i have do be only at direct order from helsingfor -- order that be stern pitiless and unjust man have be tear from they family and send to the mine woman have be arrest for no offense and ship off to saghalien and mere child have be cast into prison on charge of political conspiracy with they elder -- in order to russify the province only he add anxiously i trust you will never repeat what i tell you you have ask I why i assist the english mademoiselle to escape from kajana and i have explain the reason we eat a hearty meal in company at the _ sampalinna _ a restaurant build like a swiss châlet and at noon i enter the train on the first stage of my slow tedious journey through the great silent forest and along the shore of the lake of southern finland by way of tavestehus and viborg to petersburg i be alone in the compartment and sit moodily watch the panorama of wood and river as we slowly wind up the tortuous ascent and descend the steep gradient i have not even a newspaper with which to while away the time only my own apprehensive thought of whither my helpless love be be conduct surely to no man be there ever present such a complicated problem as that which i be now try so vigorously to solve i love elma heath the more i reflect the deeper do she sweet countenance and tender grace impress themselves upon my heart i love she therefore i be strive to overtake she the steamer i learn would call at hango and helsingfor would they i wonder disembark at either of those place be the man whom i have know as hornby the owner of the _ lolum _ take she to place she again in the fiendish hand of xavier oberg the very think of it cause I to hold my breath daylight come at last cold and gray over those dreary interminable marsh where game especially snipe seem abundant and at a small station at the head of a lake call davidstadt i take my morning glass of tea then we resume we journey down to viborg where a short thick-set russian of the commercial class but something of a dandy enter my compartment and we leave express for petersburg we have pass by a small station call galitsina near which be many villa occupy in summer by family from petersburg and be travel through the dense gloomy pine-wood when my fellow-traveler have ask permission to smoke commence to chat affably he seem a pleasant fellow and tell I that he be a wool merchant and that he have be have a pleasant vacation trout fishing in the vuoskus above the fall of the imatra where the pool between the rapid abound with fish he have tell I that on account of the shore be so full of weed and the clearness of the water fishing from the bank be almost a impossibility and how they have to accustom themselves to troll from a boat so small as to only accommodate the rower and the fisherman then he remark suddenly -- you be english i presume -- possibly from helsingfor no i answer from abo i cross from stockholm and be go to petersburg and i also i live in petersburg he add we may perhaps meet one day do you know the capital i explain that i have visit it once before and have do the usual round of sight-seeing he manner be brisk and to the point as become a man of business but when we stop at bele-ostrof on the opposite side of the small wind river that separate finland from russia proper the custom officer who come to examine we baggage exchange a curious meaning look with he my fellow-traveler believe that i have not observe yet keenly on the alert as i now be i be shrewd to detect the least sign or look and i at once resolve to tell the fellow nothing further of my own affair he be no doubt a spy of the strangler 's who have follow I all the way from abo and have only enter my carriage for the final stage of the journey this revelation cause I some uneasiness for even though i be able to evade the man on arrival in petersburg he could no doubt quickly obtain news of my whereabouts from the police to whom my passport must be send i pretend to doze and lay back with my eye half-closed watch he when he find I disincline to talk further he take up the paper he have buy and become engross in it while i on my part endeavor to form some plan by which to mislead and escape he vigilance the fellow mean mischief -- that i know if elma be fly in secret and he watch I he would know that she be in petersburg at all hazard for my love 's sake as well as for mine i see that i must escape he the ingeniousness and cleverness of oberg 's spy be proverbial throughout finland therefore he might not be alone or in any case on arrival in petersburg would obtain assistance in keep observation upon I i know that the baron desire my death and that therefore i could not be too wary of pitfall that fatal chair so cunningly prepare for I in lambeth be still vividly within my memory as we pass lanskaya and run through the outer suburb of petersburg my fellow-traveler become inquisitive as to where i be go but i be somewhat unresponsive and busied myself with my bag until we enter the great echo terminus whence i could see the neva gleam in the pale sunlight and the city beyond the fellow make no attempt to follow I -- he be too clever a secret agent for that he merely wish I _ sdravstvuite _ raise he hat politely and disappear a porter carry my bag out of the station and i drive across the bridge to the large hotel where i have stop before the europe on the corner of the nevskus prospect and the michael street there i engage a front room look down into the broad nevskus have a wash and then watch at the window for the appearance of the spy i have already a good four hour before the steamer from abo be due and i intend to satisfy myself whether or not i be be follow within twenty minute the fellow lounge along on the opposite side of the road just as i have expect he have change he clothes and present such a different appearance that at first sight i fail to recognize he he know that i have drive there and intend to follow I if i come forth my position be one of extreme difficulty for if i go down to the quay he would most certainly follow I have watch he movement for ten minute or so i descend to the big _ salle-à-manger _ and there eat my luncheon chat to the french waiter the while i sit purposely in a alcove so as to be away from the other people lunch there and in order that i might be able to talk with the waiter without be overhear just as i have finish my meal and he be hand I my bill i bent towards he and ask -- do you want to earn twenty rouble well m ` sieur he answer look at I with some surprise they would be acceptable i be a married man well i want to escape from this place without be observe there be a disagreeable little matter regard a lady and i fear a fracas with a man who be await I outside in the nevskus then see that he hesitate i assure he that i have commit no crime and that i should return for my baggage that evening you could pass through the kitchen and out by the servant ' entrance he say after a moment 's reflection if m ` sieur so desire i will conduct he out the exit be in a back street which lead on to the catherine canal excellent i say let we go of course you will say nothing not a word m ` sieur and he gather up the note plus twenty rouble with which i pay my bill and take my hat i follow he to the end of the _ salle-à-manger _ behind a high wooden screen across the huge kitchen and then through a long stone corridor at the end of which sit a gruff old doorkeeper my guide speak a word to he and then the door open and i find myself in a narrow back slum with the canal beyond my first visit be to a clothier 's where i purchase and put on a new light overcoat and then to a hatter 's for a hat of different shape to that i be wear i carry the hat back to a quiet alley which i have notice and quickly exchange the one i be wear for it leave my old hat in a corner then i enter a _ café _ in order to while away the hour until the vessel from finland be due at four o'clock i be out upon the quay strain my eye seaward for any sign of smoke but could see nothing the sun be sink and the broad expanse of water westward dance like liquid gold the light die out slowly the cold gray of evening creep on a chill wind spring up and sweep the quay cause I to shiver i ask of a dock laborer whether the steamer be usually late whereupon he tell I that it be often five or six hour behind time depend upon the delay at helsingfor twilight deepen into night and the rain fall heavily yet i still pace the wet flag in patience my eye ever seaward for the light of the vessel which i hope bear my love my presence there arouse some speculation among the lounger i think nevertheless i wait in deepest anxiety whether after all elma and hornby have not disembark at helsingfor soon after ten o'clock a light shone afar off and the movement of the police and porter on the quay tell I that it be the vessel then after a further anxious quarter of a hour it come amid great shouting and mutual imprecation slowly alongside the quay and the passenger at last begin to disembark in the pelting rain one after another they walk up the gangway filing into the passport-office and on into the custom house people of all sort and all grade -- swede german finn and russian -- until suddenly i catch sight of two figure -- one a man in a big tweed traveling-coat and a golf-cap and the other the slight figure of a woman in a long dark cloak and a woolen tam-o ' - shanter the electric ray fall upon they as they come up the wet gangway together and there once again i see the sweet face of the silent woman whom i have grow to love with such fervent desperation the man behind she be the same who have entertain I on board the _ lolum _ -- the man who be say to be the lover of the fugitive muriel leithcourt without betray my presence i watch they pass through the passport-office and custom house and then overhear the address which martin woodroffe give the _ isvoshtchik _ i stand aside wet to the skin and see they drive away at eleven o'clock on the follow day i find myself install in the hotel de paris a comfortable hostelry in the little morskaya have succeed in evade the vigilance of the spy who have so cleverly follow I from abo and in get my suit-case round from the hotel europe i be beneath the same roof as elma although she be in ignorance of my presence anxious to communicate with she without woodroffe 's knowledge i be now await my opportunity he have it appear take for she a pleasant front room with sitting-room adjoining on the first floor while he himself occupy a room on the third floor the apartment he have engage for she be the most expensive in the hotel and as far as i could gather from the french waiter whom i judiciously tip he appear to treat she with every consideration and kindness ah poor young lady the man exclaim as he stand in my room answer my question what a affliction she write down all she order -- for she can utter no word have the englishman receive any visitor i ask one man -- a russian -- a official of police i think if he receive anyone else let I know i say and i want you to give mademoiselle a letter from I in secret bien m ` sieur i turn to the little writing-table and scribble a few hasty line to my love announce my presence and ask she to grant I a interview in secret as soon as woodroffe be absent i also warn she of the search for she instigate by the baron and urge she to send I a line in reply the note be deliver into she hand but although i wait in suspense nearly all day she send no reply while woodroffe be in the hotel i dare not show myself lest he should recognize I therefore i be compel to sham indisposition and to eat my meal alone in my room both the means by which she have meet martin woodroffe and the motive be equally a enigma by that letter she have write to she schoolfellow it be apparent that she have some secret of he for have she not wish to send he a message of reassurance that she have divulge nothing this would seem that they be close friend yet on the other hand something seem to tell I that he be act falsely and be really a ally of the baron 's why have he bring she to petersburg if he have desire to rescue she he would have take she in the opposite direction -- to stockholm where she would be free -- whereas he take she a escape prisoner into the very midst of peril it be true that she passport be in order yet i remember that a order have be issue for she transportation to saghalien and now once arrest she must be lose to I for ever this thought fill I with fierce anxiety she be in petersburg that city where police spy swarm and where every fresh arrival be note and he antecedent inquire into no attempt have be make to disguise who she be therefore before long the police would undoubtedly come and arrest she as the escape criminal from kajana for several hour i sit at my window watch the life and movement down in the street below my mind full of wonder and dark foreboding be martin woodroffe play she false just after half-past six o'clock the waiter enter and hand I a note on a salver say -- mademoiselle have i believe only this moment be able to write in secret i tear it open and read as follow : -- dear friend -- _ i be so surprised i think you be still in abo woodroffe have a appointment at eight o'clock on the other side of the city therefore come to I at 815 i must see you and at once i be in peril _ -- elma heath my love be in peril it be just as i have fear i thank providence that i have be send to help she and extricate she from that awful fate to which the strangler of finland have consign she at the hour she name after the waiter have come to I and announce the englishman 's departure i descend to she sitting-room and enter without rap for if i have rap she could not alas have hear the apartment be spacious and comfortable thickly carpet with heavy furniture and gilding before the long window be draw curtain of dark green plush and on one side be the high stove of white porcelain with shine brass band while from she low lounge-chair a slim wan figure spring up quickly and come forward to greet I hold out both she hand and smile happily i take she hand in mine and hold they tightly in silence for some moment as i look earnestly into those wonderfully brilliant eye of hers she turn away laugh a slight flush rise to she cheek in she confusion then she lead I to a chair and motion I to be seat ours be a silent meeting but she gesture and the expression of she eye be surely more eloquent than mere word i know well what pleasure that re-encounter cause she -- equal pleasure with that it give to I until that moment i have never really love i have admire and flirt with woman what man have not indeed i have admire muriel leithcourt but never until now have i experience in my heart the real flame of true burning affection the sweetness of she expression the tender caress of those soft taper hand the deep mysterious look in those magnificent eye and the incomparable grace of all she movement combine to render she the most perfect woman i have ever meet -- perfect in all alas save speech and hearing of which with such dastard wantonness she have be deprive she touch she red lip with the tip of she forefinger open she hand and shrug she shoulder with a sad gesture of regret then turn quickly to some paper on the little table at she side she write something with a gold pencil and hand to I it read -- surely providence have send you here mr woodroffe must have follow you from england he be my enemy you must take I from here and hide I they intend to send I into exile have you ever be in petersburg before do you know anyone here then when i have read she hand I she pencil and below i write -- i will do my best dear friend i have be once in petersburg but be it not best that we should escape at once from russium impossible at present she write we should both be arrest at the frontier it would be best to go into hide here in petersburg i believe woodroffe to be my friend but i have find only this day that he be my enemy he know that i be in kajana and be in abo when he learn of my escape he go with two other man in search of we and discover we that night when we seek shelter at the wood-cutter 's hut without make he presence know he wait outside until you be asleep and then he come and look in at my window at first i be alarm but quickly i see that he be a friend he tell I that the police be in the vicinity and intend to raid the hut therefore i flee with he first down to tammerfor and then to abo and on here at that time i do not see the dastardly trap he have lay in order to get I out of the baron 's clutch and wring from I my secret if i confess he intend to give I up to the police who will send I to the mine do you secret concern he i ask in write yes she write in response it would be equally in he interest as well as those of baron oberg if i be send to saghalien and my identity efface i be a russian subject as i have already tell you therefore with a ministerial order against I i be in deadliest peril trust in I i scribble quickly i will act upon any suggestion you make have you any female friend in whom you could trust to hide you until this danger be past there be one friend -- a true friend will you take a note to she she write to which i instantly nod in the affirmative then rise she obtain some ink and pen and write a letter the contents of which she do not show I before she seal it i sit watch she beautiful head bent beneath the shaded lamplight catch she profile and notice how eminently handsome it be superb and unblemished in she youthful womanhood i watch she write the superscription upon the envelope : madame olga stassulevitch modiste scredni prospect 231 vasilus ostroff i know that the district be on the opposite side of the city close to the little neva take a drosky at once see she and await a reply in the meantime i will prepare to be ready when you return she write if olga be not at home ask to see the red priest -- in russian ' _ krasny-pastor _ ' return quickly as i fear woodroffe may come back if so i be lose i assure she i would not lose a single instant and five minute later i be tear down the morskaya in a drosky along the canal and across the nicholas bridge to the address upon the envelope the house be i find somewhat smaller than its neighbor but not let out in flat as the other upon the door be a large brass plate bear the name olga stassulevitch : mode i press the electric button and in answer a tall clean-shaven russian servant open the door madame be not at home be he brief reply to my inquiry then i will see the red priest i say in a lower tone i come from elma heath thereupon without further word the man admit I into the long dark hall and close the door with a apology that the gas be not light but strike a match he lead I up the broad staircase and into a small cosy well-furnished room on the second floor evidently the sitting-room of some studious person judge from the book and critical review lie about for a few minute i wait there until the door reopen and there enter a man of medium height with a shock of long snow-white hair and almost patriarchal beard whose dark eye that age have dim flash out at I with a look of curious inquiry and whose movement be those of a person not quite at he ease i have call on behalf of mademoiselle elma heath to give this letter to madame stassulevitch or if she be absent to place it in the hand of the red priest i explain in my best russian very well sir the old man respond in quite good english i be the person you seek and take the letter he open it and read it through i saw by the expression on he furrowed face that its contents cause he the utmost consternation he countenance already pale blanch to the lip while in he eye there shoot a fire of quick apprehension the thin almost transparent hand hold the letter tremble visibly you know mademoiselle -- eh he ask in a hoarse strained voice as he turn to I you will help she to escape i will risk my own life in order to save hers i declare and you devotion to she be prompt by what he inquire suspiciously i be silent for a moment then i confess

himself -- at whose word one day the people would rise in a body and destroy they oppressor the emperor the minister the police and the bureaucrat know this yet they be powerless -- they know that the mysterious professor who have disappear from moscow fifteen year before and have never since be see be only wait he opportunity to strike a blow that would stagger and crush the empire from end to end -- yet of he whereabouts they be in utter ignorance you be surprise the old man laugh notice my amazement well you be not one of we yet i need not impress upon you the absolute necessity for mademoiselle 's sake to preserve the secret of my existence it be because you be not a member of ` the will of the people ' that you have never hear of ` the red priest ' -- red because i write my ultimatum to the czar in the blood of one of he victim knout in the fortress of peter and paul and priest because i preach the gospel of freedom and justice i shall say nothing i say gaze at the

doubt you and turn to the table he write a address upon a slip of paper say take mademoiselle there she will find a safe place of concealment but go quickly for every moment place you both in more deadly peril hide yourself there also i thank he and leave at once but as i step out of the house and re-enter the drosky i see close by lurk in the shadow the spy of the strangler of finland who have travel with I from abo we eye meet and he recognize I notwithstanding my light overcoat and new hat then with heart-sink the ghastly truth flash upon I all have be in vain elma be lose to I chapter xiv she highness be inquisitive instantly the danger be apparent and instead of drive back to the hotel i call out to the man to take I to the moscow railway station in order to put the spy off the scent i know he would follow I but as he be on foot with no drosky in sight i should be able to reach the station before he could and there elude he over the stone we rattle leave the lurk agent standing in the deep shadow but on turn back i see he dash across the road to a by-street where in all probability he have a conveyance in wait then after we have cross the neva i countermand my order to the man say -- do not go right up to the station turn into the liteinous prospect to the left and put I down there drive quickly and i 'll pay double fare he whip he horse and we turn into that maze of dark ill-lit narrow street that lie between the vosnesenskus and the nevskus turn and wind until we emerge at last into the main thoroughfare again and then at last we turn into the street i

unsuspected however by the police on account of she high position in petersburg society it be she who as i afterwards discover have furnish the large sum of money to kampf for the continuation of the revolutionary propaganda and indeed secretly devote the greater part of she revenue from she vast estate in samara and kazan to the nihilist cause she husband himself a enthusiast of freedom although of the high nobility have be kill by a fall from he horse six year before and since that time she have retire from society and live there quietly make the revolutionary movement she sole occupation

circumstance then continue i tell she something concern the incident of the yacht _ lolum _ he may be in love with she and desire to force she into marriage she suggest express amazement at the

leithcourt leithcourt repeat the princess knit she brow with a puzzle air do you happen to know she father 's name philip leithcourt and have he actually be live in scotland yes i answer in quick anxiety he rent a shoot call rannoch near dumfry a mysterious incident occur on he estate -- a double murder or murder and suicide which be not quite clear -- but shortly afterwards there appear one evening at the house a man name chater hylton chater and the whole family at once flee and disappear princess zurloff sit with she lip press close together look straight at the silent girl before she elma have remove she hat and cloak and now sit in a deep easy chair of yellow silk with the lamplight shine on she chestnut hair settle and calm as though already thoroughly at home i smile to myself as i thought of the chagrin of woodroffe when he return to find he victim miss you highness evidently know the leithcourt i hazard after a brief silence i have hear of they be she unsatisfactory reply i go to england sometimes when the prince be alive we be often at claridge 's for the season the prince be for five year military _ attaché _ at the embassy under de staal you know what i know of the leithcourt be not to they credit but you tell I that there be a mysterious incident before they flight explain it to I at that moment the long white door of the handsome salon be throw open by the faithful tartar servitor and there enter a man whose hair fall over the collar of he heavy overcoat but whom in a instant i recognize as otto kampf both elma and i spring to we foot while advance to the princess he bent and gallantly kiss the hand she hold forth to he then he shake hand with elma and acknowledge my own greeting take off he coat and throw it upon a chair with the air of a accustomed visitor i come princess in order to explain to you he say mademoiselle fear rearrest and the only house in petersburg that the police never suspect be this therefore i send she to you know that with you generosity you will help she in she distress it be all arrange be she highness 's response she will remain here poor girl until it be safe for she to get out of russium then after some further conversation and after my well-beloved have make sign of heartfelt gratitude to the man know from end to end of the russian empire as the red priest the princess turn to I say : i would much like to know what occur before the leithcourt leave scotland the leithcourt exclaim kampf in utter surprise do you know the leithcourt -- and the english officer durnford i look into he eye in abject amazement what connection could jack durnford of the marine have with the adventurer philip leithcourt i however recollect jack 's word when i have describe the visit of the _ lolum _ to leghorn and further i recollected that very shortly he would be back in london from he term of mediterranean service well i say after a pause i happen to know captain durnford very well but i have no idea that he be friendly with leithcourt the red priest smile stroke he white beard explain to she highness what she desire to know and i will tell you my eye meet elma 's and i see how intensely eager and interested she be watch the movement of my lip and try to make out what word i utter well i say a mysterious tragedy occur on the edge of a wood near the house rent by leithcourt -- a tragedy which have puzzle the police to this day a italian name santinus and he wife be find murder santinus gasp kampf start up but surely he be not dead no that be the curious part of the affair the man who be kill be a man disguise to represent the italian while the woman be actually the waiter 's wife herself i happen to know the man santinus well for both he and he wife be for some year in my employ the princess and the director of the russian revolutionary movement exchange quick glance it be as though she highness implore kampf to reveal to I the truth while he on he part be averse to do so and upon whom do suspicion rest ask she highness as far as i can make out the police have no clue whatever except one at the spot be find a tiny miniature cross of one of the russian order of chivalry -- the cross of saint anne there be no suspicion upon leithcourt she ask with some undue anxiety i think no do he entertain any guest at the shooting-box a good many no foreigner among they i never meet any they seem all people from london -- a smart set for the most part then why do the leithcourt disappear so suddenly because of the appearance of the man chater i reply it be evident that they fear he for they take every precaution against be follow in fact they flee leave a big party of friend in the house the man woodroffe now at the hotel de paris be a friend of leithcourt as well as of chater he be not a guest of leithcourt when this man represent santinus be assassinate ask kampf again stroke he beard no as soon as woodroffe recognize I as a visitor he leave -- for hamburg he be afraid to face you because of the ransacking of the british consul 's safe at leghorn remark the princess who at the same moment take elma 's hand tenderly in she own and look at she then turn to I she say : what you have tell we to-night mr gregg throw a new light upon certain incident that have hitherto puzzle we the mystery of it all be a great and inscrutable one -- the mystery of this poor unfortunate girl greatest of all but both of we will endeavor to help you to elucidate it we will help poor elma to crush she enemy -- these cowardly villain who have maim she ah princess i cry if you will only help and protect she you will be do a act of mercy to a defenseless woman i love she -- i admit it i have do my utmost : i have strive to solve the dark mystery but up to the present i have be unsuccessful and have only remain even till to-day the victim of circumstance let she stay with I the kindly woman answer smile tenderly upon my love she will be safe here and in the meantime we will endeavor to discover the real and actual truth and in response i take the princess 's hand and press it fervently although that striking white-headed man and the rather stiff formal woman in black be the leader of the great and all-powerful movement in russium know through the civilized world as the terror yet they be nevertheless we friend they have pledge themselves to help we thwart we enemy i scribble a few hasty word upon paper and hand it to elma and for answer she smile contentedly look into my eye with a expression of trust devotion and love chapter xv just off the strand a week have go by the nord express have bring I posthaste across europe from petersburg to calai and i be again in london i have leave elma in the care of the princess zurloff whom i know would conceal she from the horde of police-agent now in search of she the mystery have so increase until now it have become absolutely bewilder the more i have try to probe it the more inexplicable have i find it my brain be awhirl as i sit in the _ wagon-lit _ rush across those wide never-ending plain that lie between the russian capital and berlin and the green valley between the rhine-land and the sea the maze of mystery render I utterly incapable of grasp one solid tangible fact so closely interwoven be each incident of the strange life-drama in which through mere chance i be now play a lead part i be aware of one fact only that i love elma with all my soul even though i know not whom she really be -- or she strange life story she sweet face with those soft brown eye so tender and intense stand out ever before I sleep or wake each moment as the express rush south increase the distance between we yet be i not on my way back to england with a clear and distinct purpose i snatch at any clue however small with desperate eagerness as a drown man clutch at a straw the spy from abo have see I on the railway platform on my departure from petersburg he have overhear I buy a ticket for london and previous to step into the train i have smile at he in glad triumph my journey be too long a one for he to follow and i know that i have at last outwit he he have expect to see elma with I no doubt and he disappointment be plainly marked but of woodroffe i have neither see nor hear anything \* \* \* \* \* it be a cold but dry November night in london and i sit dine with jack durnford at a small table in the big well-lit room of the junior united service club easy-going and merry as of old my friend be bubble over with good spirit delighted to be back again in town after three year sail up and down the mediterranean from gib to smyrna maneuvering always yet with never a chance of a fight he well-shaven face bear the mark of the southern sun and the back of he hand be tan by the heat and the sea he be indeed as smart a officer as any at the junior for the marine be proverbial for they neatness and he man on board the _ bulwark _ have receive many a pleasing compliment from the admiral glad to be back he exclaim as he help himself to a peg i should rather think so old chap you know how awfully weary the life become out there lot go on down at palermo malta monte carlo or over at algier and yet we can never get a chance of it we be always in sight of the gay place and never land i do not blame the youngster for get off from leghorn for two day over here in town when they can three year be a bigger slice out of a fellow 's life than anyone would suppose but by the way i see hutcheson the other day we put into spezium and he come out to see the admiral -- get despatch for he i think he seem as gay as ever he lunch at mess and say how sorry he be you would desert leghorn i have not exactly desert it i say but i really do not love it like he do no a year or two of the mediterranean blue be quite sufficient to last any fellow he lifetime i should not live in leghorn if i have my choice i would prefer somewhere up in the mountain beyond pisa or outside florence where you can have a good time in winter then a silence fall between we and i sit eating on until the end of the meal wonder how to broach the question i so desire to put to he i shall try if i can get on recruit service at home for a bit he say presently there be a appointment up in glasgow vacant and i shall try for it it 'll be better at any rate than china or the pacific i be just about to turn the conversation to the visit of the mysterious _ lolum _ to leghorn when two man he know enter the dining-room and recognize he come across to give he a welcome home one of the newcomer be major bartlett whom i at once recollect as have be a guest of leithcourt 's up at rannoch and the other a younger man whom durnford introduce to I as captain hanbury oh major i cry rise and grasp he hand i have not see you since scotland and the extraordinary end to you house-party no he laugh it be a amazing affair be not it after the leithcourt leave it be like pandemonium let loose the guest collar everything they could lay they hand upon it be a wonder to I the disgraceful affair do not get into the papers but where 's leithcourt now i ask anxiously have not the ghost of a idea reply the major standing astride with he hand in he pocket young paget of ours tell I the other day that he see muriel drive in the terminus road at eastbourne but she do not notice he they be a queerish lot those leithcourt he add hulloa what be you say about the leithcourt charley exclaim durnford turn quickly from hanbury i know some people of that name -- philip leithcourt who have a daughter name muriel well they sound much the same but if you know they my dear old chap i really do not envy you you friend declare the major with a laugh why not well gregg will tell you he say he know perhaps more than i do but he add they may not of course be the same people i first meet they yachting over at algier jack say and then again at malta where they seem to have quite a lot of friend they have a steam-yacht the _ iri _ and be often up and down the mediterranean must be the same people declare the major leithcourt speak once or twice of he yacht but we all put it down as a non-existent vessel because he be always draw the long bow about he adventure and how do you first come to know he i ask of the major eagerly oh i do not know somebody bring he to mess and we strike up a acquaintance across the table he seem a good chap and when he ask I to shoot i accept on arrival up at rannoch however one thing strike I as jolly strange and that be that among the people i be ask to meet be one of the very worst blackleg about town he call himself martin woodroffe up there -- although i would know he at the old corinthian club as dick archer he be believe then to be one of a clever gang of international thief when i first meet he he give I the name of hornby i say it be in leghorn where he be on board a yacht call the _ lolum _ of which he represent himself as owner he leave rannoch very suddenly remark bartlett we understand that he be engage to marry muriel if so i be sorry for she poor girl what cry durnford start up that man to marry muriel leithcourt yes i say why but he countenance have turn pale and he give no answer to my question if these same leithcourt be really friend of yours durnford old fellow i be sorry i have say anything against they the major exclaim in a apologetic tone only the end of my visit be so abrupt and so extraordinary and the company such a mixed one that -- well to tell you the truth the people be a mysterious lot altogether perhaps we leithcourt be not the same as those jack know i remark in order to escape from a rather difficult situation whereupon durnford as though eager to conceal he surprise say with a forced laugh oh probably not and reseat himself at table then the major quickly change the topic of conversation and afterwards he and he friend pass along to they table and sit down to eat i could not help notice that jack durnford be upset at what he have learn yet i hesitate just then to put any question to he i resolve to approach the subject later so as to allow he time to question I if he wish to do so after smoke a hour we go across to the empire where we spend the evening in the grand circle meeting many man we know and have a rather pleasant time among old acquaintance if a man who have live the club life of london return from abroad he can always run across someone he know in the circle of the empire about ten o'clock at night jack be however not he old self that he have be before dinner he brow be now heavy and thoughtful and he appear deeply immerse in some intricate problem for he eye be fix vacantly when opportunity be afford he to think and he appear to desire to avoid he friend rather than to greet they after the theater i induce he to come round to the cecil and in the wicker chair in the big portico before the entrance we sit to smoke we final cigar it be a favorite spot of mine when in london for at afternoon when the string band play and the american and other cosmopolitan drink tea there be a continual come and go a little panorama of life that to a student of man like myself be intensely interesting and at night it be just as amusing to sit there in the shadow and watch the people return from the theater or dance and to speculate as to whom and what they be at that one little corner of london just off the strand you see more variety of man and woman than perhaps at any other spot all grade pass before you from the pushful american commercial man interest in a patent medicine to the proud indian rajah with he turbaned suite from the variety actress to the daughter of a peer or the wife of a millionaire pork-butcher do europe you have be a bit down in the mouth to-night jack i say presently after we have be watch the cab come up deposit the home-coming reveler from the savoy or the carlton yes he sigh and surely i have enough to cause I -- after what i have hear from bartlett what do the fact he tell we convey any bad news to you i inquire with pretended ignorance yes he say hoarsely after a brief pause then he add : bartlett say you could tell I what happen up in scotland where leithcourt have shooting tell I everything he add with the air of a man in whom all hope be dead well i begin the leithcourt take rannoch castle close to my uncle 's place near dumfry i get to know they of course and often shoot with he party one day however i be amaze to notice in one of the room the photograph of a lady the exact counterpart of that picture which i recollect i tell you when in leghorn i have find tear up on board the _ lolum _ you recollect what i narrated about my strange adventure do not you i remember every word be he answer go on what do you do nothing i hold my tongue but when i discover that the fellow who call himself woodroffe -- the man who have represent himself as the owner of the _ lolum _ and who no doubt have have a hand in break open hutcheson 's safe in the consulate -- be engage to muriel i become full of suspicion well woodroffe after meet I disappear -- go to hamburg they say on business then other thing occur a man and woman be find murder up in the wood about a mile and a half from the castle the man be make up to represent my man olinto -- i believe you have see he in leghorn what they have kill olinto he gasp start from he chair no the fellow be make up very much like he but he wife armida be kill they kill the woman and believe they have also kill she husband eh he say bitterly through he tooth and i see that he strong hand grasp the arm of he chair firmly and martin woodroffe be engage to muriel leithcourt be you certain of this yes quite certain and be there no suspicion as to who be the assassin of the woman santinus and this mysterious man who pose as she husband none whatever for some time jack durnford smoke in silence and i could just distinguish he white hard face in the faint light for it be now late and the big electric lamp have be turn out and we be in semi-darkness that fellow shall never marry muriel he declare in a fierce hoarse voice what you have just tell I reveal the truth do you meet chater he appear suddenly at rannoch and the leithcourt flee precipitately and have not since be hear of ah no wonder he remark with a dry laugh no wonder but look here gordon i be not go to stand by and let that scoundrel woodroffe marry muriel you love she perhaps i hazard yes i do love she he admit and by heaven he cry i will tell the truth and crush the whole of they ingenious plot have you meet elma heath he ask yes i say in quick anxiety then listen he say in a low earnest voice listen and i 'll tell you something there be a greater mystery surround that yacht the _ lolum _ than you have ever imagine my dear old chap declare jack durnford look I straight in the face when you tell I about it on the quarter-deck that day outside leghorn i be half a mind to tell you what i know only one fact prevent I -- my disinclination to reveal my own secret i love muriel leithcourt yet afloat as i be i could never see she -- i could not obtain from she own lip the explanation i desire yet i would not prejudge she -- no and i will not now he add with a fierce resolution i love she he go on and she reciprocate my love ours be a secret engagement make in malta two year ago and yet you tell I that she have pledge herself to that fellow woodroffe -- the man know here in london as dick archer i can not believe it -- i really can not old fellow she could never write to I as she have do urge patience and secrecy until my return unless of course she desire to gain time i suggest but my friend be silent he brow be deep knit woodroffe be at the present moment in petersburg i say i have just come back from there in st petersburg he gasp surprised then he be with that villainous official baron oberg the governor-general of finland no oberg be live shut up in he palace at helsingfor fear to go out lest he shall be assassinate be my answer and elma what have become of she she be in hide in petersburg await such time as i can get she safely out of russium and then continue i explain how she have be maim and render deaf and dumb what he cry fiercely have they actually do that to the poor girl then they fear that she should reveal the nature of they plot for she have see and hear see and hear what be patient we will elucidate this mystery and the motive of this terrible infliction upon she muriel write to I say that poor elma she friend have disappear and she fear that some evil have also happen to she so oberg have send she to he fortress -- he own private bastille -- the place to which on pretended charge of conspiracy against russium he send those who thwart he to a living tomb i have see he and i have defy he i say you have man alive be careful he be not a fellow who stick at trifle say jack warningly i do not fear i reply elma 's enemy be also mine then i take it old fellow that notwithstanding she affliction you be actually in love with she i intend to rescue and to marry she i answer quite frankly but first we must tear aside this veil of mystery and ascertain all the fact concern she he say at present i only know one or two very vague detail the baron be certainly not she uncle as he represent himself to be but it seem certain that she be the daughter of anglo-russian parent and be bear in russium and bring to england when a child but from whom do you expect i can obtain the true fact concern she and the reason of the baron 's desire to keep she silent ah he say twist he mustache thoughtfully that be just the question for a solution of the problem we must first fathom the motive of the leithcourt and the reason they flee in fear before that fellow chater that muriel be innocent of any complicity in they plot whatever it may be i feel convinced she may be the victim of that blackleg woodroffe who as bartlett have tell you be one of the most expert swindler in london and who have already do two term of penal servitude but what be the motive in break open the consul 's safe if not to obtain the foreign office or admiralty cipher perhaps they want to steal they and sell they to a foreign government no that be not they object i have think over it many many time since you tell I and i feel convinced that woodroffe be too shrewd a fellow not to have know that no consul go away on leave and allow he cipher to remain behind when he leave he post he always deposit those precious book either at the foreign office here or with he consul-general or with a consul at another port they would surely ascertain all that before they make the raid you bet the affair be a risky one and dick archer be know as a man of many precaution but he be on extremely friendly term with elma it be he who succeed in find she in finland and take she beyond oberg 's sphere of influence to petersburg then it be certainly only a affect friendship with some sinister motive underlie it she write a letter from she island prison to a old schoolfellow name lydium moreton ask she to see woodroffe at he room in cork street and tell he that through all she be suffer she have keep she promise to he and that the secret be still safe exactly and now the fellow fear that as you be so actively search out the truth she may yield to you demand and explain he therefore intend to silence she what to kill she you mean i gasp in quick apprehension well he might do so in order to save himself you see jack reply add : he certainly would have no compunction if he think that it would not be bring home to he only he no doubt fear you because you have find she and be in love with she i admit the force of he argument but recollect that my dear one be safe in concealment and that the princess be we friend even though i as a englishman have no sympathy with the doctrine of the bomb and the knife i try to get from he all that he know concern elma but he seem for some curious reason disincline to tell all i could gather be that leithcourt be in league with chater and woodroffe and that muriel have act as a entirely innocent agent what the conspiracy be or what be its motive i could not discern i be as far off the solution of the problem as ever we must first find muriel he declare when i press he to tell I everything he know there be fact you have tell I which negative my own theory and only from she can we obtain the real truth but surely you know where she be she write to you i say the last letter which i receive at gib ten day ago be from the hotel bristol at botzen in the tyrol yet bartlett say she have be see down at eastbourne but you have a address where you always write to she i suppose yes a secret one i have write and make a appointment but she have not keep it she have be prevent of course she may be with she parent and unable to come to london you do not know that they have flee and be in hiding of course not what i have hear to-night be news to I -- amazing news and do it not convey to you the truth it do -- a ghastly truth concern elma heath he answer in a low voice as though speak to himself tell I what i be die jack to know everything concern she who be that fellow oberg she enemy she by mere accident learn he secret and woodroffe 's and they now both live in deadly fear of she and for that reason she be take to siena where some villainous italian doctor be bribe to render she deaf and dumb he nod in the affirmative but chater i know very little concern he he may have conspire with they or he may be innocent it seem as though he be antagonistic to they scheme if leithcourt and he family really flee from he and yet he be on board the _ lolum _ indeed he may have help to commit the burglary at the consulate i say quite likely he answer but we first object must be to rediscover muriel paget say she be in eastbourne if she be there we shall easily find she they publish visitor ' list in the papers do not they like they do at hasting then he add : visitor ' list be most annoying when you find you name print in they when you be suppose officially to be somewhere else i be have once like that by the bournemouth papers when i be suppose to be on duty over at queenstown i narrowly escape a terrible wigging shall we go to eastbourne i suggest eagerly i 'll go there with you in the morning or would it not be best to send a urgent wire to the address where i always write she would then reply here no doubt if she be in eastbourne there may be reason why she can not come up to town if she people be in hiding of course she will not come but she 'll make a appointment with I no doubt very well send a wire i say and make it urgent it will then be forward but as regard olinto would you like to see he he might tell you more than he have tell I no by no means he must not know that i have return to london declare my friend quickly you have better not see he -- you understand then he interest be -- well not exactly we own no but why do not you tell I more about elma i urge for i be eager to learn all he know come do tell I i implored i have tell you practically everything my dear old fellow be he response the revelation of the true fact of the affair can be make only by muriel i tell you we must find she yes we must -- at all hazard i say let 's go across to the telegraph office opposite charing cross it be open always and we rise and walk out along the strand now nearly desert and despatch a urgent message to muriel at a address in hurlingham road fulham afterwards we stand outside on the curb still talk i loth to part from he when there pass by in the shadow two man in dark overcoat who cross the road behind we to the front of chare cross station and then continue on towards trafalgar square as the light of the street lamp fall upon they i think i recognize the face of one as that of a person i have see before yet i be not at all certain and my failure to remember whom the passer-by resemble prevent I from say anything further to jack than : a fellow i know have just go by i think we seem to be meet host of friend to-night he laugh after all old chap it do one good to come back to we dear dirty old town again we abuse it when we be here and talk of the life in pari and vienna and brussels but when we be away there be no place on earth so dear to we for it be ` home ' but there he laugh i be actually grow romantic ah if we could only find muriel but we must to-morrow ta-ta i shall go around to the club and sleep for i have not fix on any digging yet come in at ten to-morrow and we will decide upon some plan one thing be plainly certain elma must at once be get out of russium she be in deadly peril of she life there yes i say and you will help I with all my heart old fellow answer my friend warmly grasp my hand and then we part he stroll along towards the national gallery on he way back to the junior while i return to the _ cecil _ alone chapter xvi marked man captain durnford i inquire of the hall-porter of the club next morning not here sir but he sleep here last night i remark i have a appointment with he the man consult the big book before he and answer : captain durnford go out at 9:27 last night sir but have not return strange i thought but although i wait in the club nearly a hour he do not put in a appearance i call again at noon and he have not come in and again at two o'clock but he have not even then make he appearance then i begin to be anxious i return to the hotel resolve to wait for a few hour longer he might have alter he mind and go to eastbourne in search of muriel yet have he do so he would surely have telegraph to I about four o'clock as i be pass through the big hall of the hotel i hear a voice behind I utter a greet in italian and turn in surprise find olinto dress in he best suit of black standing hat in hand in a instant i recollect what jack have tell I and regard he with some suspicion signor commendatore he say in a low voice as though fear to be overhear may i be permit to speak in private with you certainly i say and i take he in the lift up to my room i have come to warn you signore he say when i have give he a seat you enemy mean harm to you and who be they pray i ask bite my lip the same i suppose who prepare that ingenious trap in lambeth i be not here to reveal to you who they be signora only to warn you to have a care of yourself be the italian 's reply look here olinto i exclaimed determinedly i have have enough of this confound mystery tell I the truth regard the assassination of you poor wife up in scotland ah signora he answer sadly in a changed voice i do not know it be a plot someone represent I -- but he be kill also they believe they have strike I down he add with a bitter laugh poor armida 's body be find conceal behind a rock on the opposite side of the wood i see it -- ah he cry shudder then you be ignorant of the identity of you wife 's assassin entirely tell I one thing i say do armida possess any trinket in the form of a little enameled cross -- like a miniature cross of cavaliere yes i give it to she i find it on the floor at the mansion house where i be engage as odd waiter for a banquet i know i ought to have give it up to the lord mayor 's servant but it be such a pretty little thing that i be tempt to keep it it probably have fall from the coat of one of the diplomatist dine there i be silent the faint suspicion that oberg have be at that spot be now entirely remove the only clue i have be satisfactorily account for why do you ask signor commendatore he add because the cross be find at the spot and be believe to have be drop by the assassin i say the police have it seem succeed in discover the unfortunate woman after all and have find that she be he wife you know a man name leithcourt i ask a few moment later now tell the truth in this affair olinto we interest be mutual be they not he nod after a moment 's hesitation and you know also a man name archer -- who be sometimes know as hornby or woodroffe -- as well as a friend of he call chater si signore he say i have meet they all -- to my regret and have you ever meet a russian -- a certain baron oberg -- and he niece elma heath he niece she be not he niece then who be she i demand how do i know i have see she once or twice but she be dead be not she she know the secret of those man and they intend to kill she i try to prevent they take she away on the yacht and i would have go to the police -- only i dare not why well because my own hand be not quite clean he answer after a pause he eye fix upon mine the while i know they intend to silence she but i be powerless to save she poor young lady they take she on board leithcourt 's yacht the _ iri _ and they sail for the mediterranean i believe then the name and appearance of the yacht be alter on the voyage and it become the _ lolum _ i say no doubt he smile the _ iri _ be a steamer of many name and have i believe be paint nearly all the color of the rainbow at various time it be a mysterious vessel but she exist no more they scuttle she somewhere up in the baltic i have hear and who be this oberg i inquire urge he to reveal to I all he know concern he he stand in great fear of the poor young lady i believe for it be at he instigation that leithcourt and he friend take she on that fatal yachting cruise and what be you connection with they well i be leithcourt 's servant be he reply i be steward on the _ iri _ for a year until i suppose they think that i begin to see too much and then i be place in a position ashore and what do you see more than i care to tell signora if they be arrest i should be arrest too you see but i mean to solve this mystery olinto i say fiercely for i be in no trifling mood i 'll fathom it if it cost I my life if the signora solve it himself then i can not be charge with reveal the truth be the man 's diplomatic reply but i fear that they be far too wary armida have lose she life surely that be sufficient incentive for you to bring they all to justice of course but if the law fall upon they it will also fall upon I i explain the terrible affliction to which my love have be subject by those heartless brute whereupon he cry enthusiastically : then she be not dead she can tell we everything but can not you tell we no not all the secret she know have never be reveal they fear she might be incautious and for that reason oberg make the villainous suggestion of the yachting trip she be to be drown -- accidentally of course she be in st petersburg now i leave she a week ago in russium ah signora for she sake do not allow the young lady to remain there the baron be all-powerful he do what he wish in russium and the more merciless he be to the people he govern the greater reward he receive from the czar i have never be in russium but surely it must be a strange country signora well i say sit upon the edge of the bed and look at he be you prepare to denounce they if i bring the signorina heath here to england but what be the use if we have no clear proof be he evasive reply i could see plainly that he fear be himself implicate in some extraordinary plot the exact nature of which he so steadfastly refuse to reveal to I we talk on for fully half a hour and from he conversation i gather that he be well acquaint with elma ah signora she be such a pleasant and kind-hearted young lady i always feel very sorry for she she be in deadly fear of they because they be thief i hazard ah worse but why do they induce you to entice I to that house in lambeth why do they so evidently desire that i should be kill by accident he interrupt correct I always by accident and he smile grimly surely you know they secret motive i remark at the time i do not he declare i act on they instruction be compel to for they hold my future in they hand therefore i could not disobey you know too much therefore you be mark down for death -- just as you be now and who be it who be now seek my life i inquire gravely i only return from russium yesterday you movement be well know answer the young italian you can not be too careful woodroffe have be in russium with you have he not i reply in the affirmative whereupon he say : i think so but be not quite sure and chater i inquire where be he in london and the leithcourt he shrug he shoulder with a gesture of ignorance add : the signorina muriel return to london from eastbourne this morning where can i find she i inquire eagerly it be of the utmost importance that i should see she she be with a relation a cousin i think at bassett road not hill the house be call ` holmwood ' you have see she no i hear she have return and she father be still in hide from chater he be still in hide but chater be he best friend that be curious i remark recollect the hurry departure from rannoch they have make it up i suppose they never quarrel to my knowledge then why do leithcourt leave scotland so hurriedly on chater 's arrival you know all about the affair of course he nod say with a grim smile yes i know the party up there must have be a very interesting one if the police could have make a raid on the place they would have find among the guest certain person long ` want ' but the arrival of chater and the flight of leithcourt have a ulterior object chater have never be leithcourt 's enemy but i can not understand that i say why should leithcourt have attack chater render he unconscious and shut he up in the cupboard in the library be it leithcourt who do that he ask dubiously i think not it be another of the guest who be chater 's bitterest enemy but philip leithcourt take advantage of the fracas in order to make believe that he have flee because of chater 's arrival ah he add you have not any idea of they ruse they be amazing so it seem i say nevertheless only half convinced that the italian be tell I the truth if it be really as he have say that the arrival of chater and the flight be merely a blind then the mystery be again deepen then who be the man who attack chater i ask only chater himself know it be one of the guest that be quite evident and you say that the flight have be prearranged i remark yes with a distinct motive he say then after a pause he add with a strange earnest look in he dark eye pardon I signor commendatore if i presume to suggest something will you not certainly what do you suggest that you should remain here in this hotel and not venture out for fear of something unfortunate happen to I i laugh i be really not afraid olinto i add you know i carry this and i draw out my revolver from my hip-pocket i know signora he say anxiously but you might not be afford opportunity for use it when they lay a trap they bait it well i know they be a set of the most ingenious scoundrel in london it be very evident yet i do not fear they in the least i declare i must rescue the signorina heath but signora have a care for yourself cry the italian lay he hand upon my arm you be a marked man ah do i not know he exclaim breathlessly if you go out you may run right into -- well the fatal accident never fear olinto i say reassuringly i shall keep my eye well open here in london one 's life be safer than anywhere else in the world perhaps -- certainly safer than in some place i could name in you own country eh at which he grin the next moment he grow serious again and say : i only warn the signora that if he go out it be at he own peril then let it be so i laugh feeling self-confident that no one could lead I into any trap i be neither a foreigner nor a country cousin i know london too well he be silent and shake he head then after tell I that he be still at the same restaurant in westbourne grove he take he departure warn I once more not to go forth half a hour later disregard he word i stride out into the strand and again walk round to the junior the short wintry day have end the gas-lamp be light and the darkness of night be gradually creep on jack have not be to the club and i begin now to grow thoroughly uneasy he have part from I at the corner of the strand with only a five minute ' walk before he and yet he have apparently disappear my first impulse be to drive to notting hill to inquire of muriel if she have news of he but somehow the italian 's warning word make I wonder if he have meet with foul play i suddenly recollect those two man who have pass by as we have talk and how that the feature of one have seem strangely familiar therefore i take a cab to the police-station down at whitehall and make inquiry of the inspector on duty in the big bare office with its flare gas-jet in wire globe he hear I to the end then turn back the book of occurrence before he glance through the rule entry i should think this be the gentleman sir he say and he read to I the entry as follow : pc 462a report that at 207 be while on duty outside the national gallery he hear a revolver shot follow by a man 's cry he run to the corner of suffolk street where he find a gentleman lie upon the pavement suffering from a serious shot-wound in the chest and quite unconscious he obtain the assistance of pc 's 218a and 343a and the gentleman who be not identify be take to the chare cross hospital where the house-surgeon express a doubt whether he could live neither pc 's recollect have notice any suspicious-looking person in the vicinity john percival _ inspector _ i wait for no more but rush round to the hospital in the cab and be five minute later take along the ward where i identify poor jack lie in bed white-faced and unconscious the doctor be here a quarter of a hour ago whisper the sister and he fear he be sink he have utter no word i ask anxiously make no statement none he have never regain consciousness and i fear sir he never will it be a case of deliberate murder the police tell I early this morning i clenched my fist and swear a fierce revenge for that dastardly act and as i stand beside the narrow bed i realize that what olinto have say regard my own peril be the actual truth i be a marked man be i never to penetrate that inscrutable and ever-increasing mystery chapter xvii the truth about the lolum throughout the long night i call many time at the hospital but the reply be always the same jack have not regain consciousness and the doctor regard he case as hopeless in the morning i drive in hot haste to bassett road notting hill and at the address olinto have give I find muriel when she enter the room with folding door into which i have be show i see that she be pale and apprehensive for we have not meet since she flight and she be no doubt at a loss for a explanation but i do not press she for one i merely tell she that the italian santinus have give I she address and that i come as bearer of unfortunate news what be it she gasp quickly it concern captain durnford i reply he have be injure in the street and be in chare cross hospital ah she cry i see you do not explain the truth by you face i can tell there be something more he be dead tell I the worst no miss leithcourt i say gravely not dead but the doctor fear that he may not recover he wound be dangerous he have be shoot by some unknown person shot she echo burst into tear then they have follow he after all they have deceive I and now as they intend to take he from I i will myself protect he you mr gregg have be in peril of you life that i know but jack 's enemy be yours and they shall not go unpunished may i see he i fear not but we will ask at the hospital and after the exchange of some further explanation we take a hansom back to chare cross at first the sister refuse to allow muriel to see the patient but she implore so earnestly that at last she consent and the distressed girl in the black coat and hat creep on tiptoe to the bedside he be conscious for a quarter of a hour or so whisper the nurse who sit there he ask after some lady name muriel the girl at my side burst into low sob tell he she say that muriel be here -- that she have see he and be wait for he to recover we be not allow to linger there and on leave the hospital i take she back again to notting hill promise to keep she well inform of jack 's condition he have return to consciousness therefore there be now a faint hope for he recovery day succeed day and although i be not allow to visit my friend i be tell that he be very slowly progress i idle at the hotel cecil longing daily for news of elma only once do a letter come from she a brief well-written note from which it appear that she be quite well and happy although she long to be able to go out the princess be very kind indeed to she and she add be make secret arrangement for she escape across the russian frontier into germany i know what that mean use be to be make of certain russian official who be secretly ally with the revolutionist in order to secure she safe conduct beyond the power of that order of exile of the tyrant de plehve i write to she under cover to the princess but there have be no time yet for a reply i see muriel many time but never once do she refer to rannoch or they sudden departure she only thought be of the man she love i always believe that you be engage to mr woodroffe i say one day when i call to tell she of jack 's latest bulletin it be true that he ask I to marry he she respond but there be reason why i do not accept reason connect with he past eh she smile and then say : ah mr gregg it be all a strange and very tragic story i must see jack when do you think they will allow I to go to he i explain that the doctor fear to cause the patient any undue excitement but that in two or three day there be hope of she being allow to visit he several time the police make inquiry of I but i could tell they nothing i could not for the life of I recollect where i have before see the face of that man who have pass in the darkness one afternoon ten day after the attempt upon jack i be allow to sit by he bedside and question he ah gordon old fellow he say faintly i have have a narrow escape -- by jove after i leave you i walk quickly on towards the club when all of a sudden two scoundrel spring out of suffolk street and one of they fire a revolver full at I then i know no more but who be the man do you recognize they no not at all that be the worst of it but muriel know who they be i say ah yes bring she here will not you the poor fellow implore i be die to see she once again then i tell he how she have look upon he while unconscious and how i have take the daily bulletin to she for a hour i talk with he urge he to get well soon so that we could unite in probe the mystery and bring to justice those responsible for the dastardly act muriel know and if she love you she will no doubt assist we i say oh she do love I gordon i know that say the prostrate man smile contentedly and when i leave i promise to bring she there on the morrow this i do but have conduct she to the bed at the end of the ward i discreetly withdraw what she say to he i be not of course aware all i know be that a hour later when i return i find they the happiest pair possible to conceive and i clearly see that jack 's trust in she be not ill-placed but of elma no further word have come from she and i begin to grow uneasy the day go on i write twice but no reply be forthcoming at last i could bear the suspense no longer and begin to contemplate return to russia jack when at last discharge from the hospital come across to the cecil and live with I in preference to the junior he be very weak at first and i look after he while every day muriel come and eat with we brighten we life by she smart and merry chatter she know that i love elma and be also aware of the exciting event in russium jack have tell she of they during they long drive in hansom when he go out with she to take the air one day i receive a brief note from the princess in petersburg urge I to remain patient and say elma be quite safe and well there be reason however why she be unable to write she add what be they i wonder yet i could only wait until i receive word to travel back to russium and fetch she home the princess have promise to arrange everything December come and we still remain on at the hotel once olinto have write I repeat he warning but i do not heed it i somehow distrust the fellow jack now thoroughly recover call almost daily at bassett road and would often bring muriel to the cecil to tea or to luncheon often i inquire the whereabouts of she father and of hylton chater but she declare herself in entire ignorance and believe they be abroad one afternoon shortly before christmas as we be idle in the american bar of the hotel my friend tell I that muriel have invite we to tea at she cousin 's that afternoon and accordingly we go there in company the drawing-room into which we be usher be familiar to I as the apartment wherein i have tell muriel of the attempt upon she lover 's life as we sit together muriel a smart figure in a pale blue gown pour tea for we and chat more merrily i think than ever before she seem quick and nervous and yet full of happiness as she should indeed have be for jack durnford be one of the best fellow in the world and he restoration to health little short of miraculous gordon he say to I with a sudden seriousness when tea have end and we have place down we cup i want to tell you something -- something i have be longing always to tell you and now i have get dear muriel 's consent i want to tell you about she father and he friend and about elma too i say in quick eagerness yes tell I everything no not everything for i do not know it myself but what i know i will explain as briefly as i can and leave you to form you own conclusion it be he go on a strange -- most amazing story when i myself become first cognizant of the mystery i be on board the flagship the _ renown _ under admiral sir john fisher we be lie in malta when there arrive the english yacht _ iri _ own by mr philip leithcourt and among those on board cruise for pleasure be mr martin woodroffe mr hylton chater and the owner 's wife and daughter muriel muriel and i meet first at a tennis-party and afterwards frequently at various house in malta for anyone who go there and entertain be soon entertain in return a mutual attachment spring up between muriel and myself he say place he hand tenderly upon hers and smile and we often meet in secret and take long walk until quite suddenly leithcourt say that it be necessary to sail for smyrna to pick up some friend who have be travel in palestine the night they sail a great consternation be cause on the island by the news that the safe in the admiral superintendent 's office have be open by expert safe-breaker and certain most important secret document steal well i ask much interested again two month later when the villa of the prince of montevachus at palmero be break into and the whole of the famous jewel of the princess steal it be a very strange fact that the _ iri _ be at the moment in that port but it be not until the third occasion when the yacht be at villefranche and we squadron be at toulon i get four day ' leave to go along the riviera that my suspicion be arouse for at the very hour when i be dine at the london house at nice with muriel and a schoolfellow of hers elma heath -- who be spend the winter there with a lady who be baron oberg 's cousin -- that a great robbery be commit in one of the big hotel up at cimiez the wife of a american millionaire lose jewel value at thirty thousand pound then the robbery coincident with the visit of the yacht arouse my strong suspicion i remark the nature of those document steal from malta and recognize that they could only be of service to a foreign government then come the leghorn incident of which you tell I the yacht 's name have be change to the _ lolum _ and she have be repaint i make search inquiry and find that on the evening she be purposely run aground in order to strike up a friendship at the consulate a russian gunboat be lie in the vicinity the consul 's safe be rifle and the scheme certainly be to transfer anything obtain from it to the russian gunboat but what be in the safe i ask fortunately nothing but you see they know that we squadron be due in leghorn and that some extremely important despatch be on the way to the admiral -- secret order base upon the decision of the british cabinet as to the vexed question of russian ship pass the dardanelle -- they expect that they would be lodge in the safe until the arrival of the squadron as they always be they be however bitterly disappointed because the despatch have not arrive and then well the only russian who appear to have any connection with they be baron oberg the governor-general of finland whose habit it be to spend part of the winter in the mediterranean from elma heath 's conversation at dinner that evening at nice i gather that she and she uncle have be guest on the _ iri _ on several occasion although i must say that muriel be extremely reticent regard all that concern the yacht of course she say quickly now that i have tell you the truth jack do not you think it be only natural most certainly dear he answer still hold she hand yours be not a secret that you could very well tell to I until you could thoroughly trust I especially as you father have be implicate in the theft of those document from malta the truth be he say turn to I philip leithcourt have all along be the catspaw of baron oberg a few year ago he be a well-known money-lender in the city and in that capacity meet the baron who be in disgrace require a loan he be also in the habit of have certain shady transaction with that daring gang of continental thief of whom dick archer and hylton chater be leader for this reason he purchase a yacht for they use so that they might not only use it for the purpose of store the steal goods but for the purpose of sailing from place to place under the guise of wealthy englishman travel for pleasure upon that vessel indeed be store thousand and thousand of pound ' worth of jewel and object of value the proceeds of many great robbery in england france and belgium sometimes they travel for the purpose of dispose of the jewel in various inland town where the gem have be recut be not recognize while at other time chater and archer assist by mackintosh the captain and olinto santini the steward sail for a port land commit a robbery and then sail away again quite unsuspected as rich englishman and the crew i ask after a pause they be of course well pay and be keep in ignorance of what the suppose owner and he friend do ashore but oberg 's connection with it i ask surprise at those revelation ah exclaim muriel the ingenuity of that crafty villain be fiendish before he get into the czar 's favor he owe my father a large sum and then seek how to evade repayment by means of he spy he discover the real purpose of the cruise of the _ iri _ -- for i be often take on board with a maid in order to allay any suspicion that might arise if only man be cruise then he not only compel my father to cancel the debt but he impress the vessel and those who own and navigate it into the secret service of russium a dozen time do we make attempt to obtain secret papers from italian french and english dockyard but only once in the case of malta and once at toulon do we succeed ah mr gregg she add you do not know all the anxiety i suffer how at every hour we be in danger of betrayal or capture and of the hundred narrow escape we have have of custom house officer rummage the yacht for contraband you will no doubt recollect the sensation cause by the theft of the jewel of the princess wilhelmine of schaumbourg-lippe from the lady 's - maid in the rapide between canne and les arcs the robbery from the marseille branch of the crédit lyonnai and the great haul of plate from the château of bardon the pari millionaire close to arcachon yes i say for they be all robbery of which i have read in the newspaper a couple of year before well she say they be all commit by archer or woodroffe and he gang -- with accomplice ashore of course -- and never once do it seem that any suspicion fall upon we while the police be frantically search hither and thither we use to weigh anchor and calmly steam away with we booty on board we have with we a old dutch lapidary and one of the cabin be fit as a workshop where he alter the appearance of the stone and prepare they ready for sale while the gold be melt in a crucible and put ashore to be send to agent in hamburg but that night in leghorn i say what happen to poor elma i do not know be muriel 's reply we be both on board together and stand at the crack of the door watch you sit at dinner that evening elma tell I that she believe that there be a plot against you life but why she would not tell I she evidently know of the propose rifling of the safe at the consulate oberg himself be also on board lock in he own cabin elma must have overhear some conversation between the baron and one of the other for she be in great fear the whole time lest they might injure you yet it seem after all as though they idea be the same as always to worm themselves into you confidence the instant however you go ashore chater woodroffe -- whom you call hornby -- and mackintosh the captain -- who by the way be a old ticket-of-leave man -- go ashore and of course break into the consulate then as soon as they return elma come to my cabin awake I and say that the baron be take she ashore and that they be to travel overland back to london she be ready dress to go therefore i kiss she and promise to meet she soon we part that be the last i saw of she what happen to she afterwards only she alone can tell we but she be not the baron 's niece i say no there be some mystery declare muriel she hold some secret which he fear she may divulge but of what nature i be in ignorance then you say that you father have never take any active part in the robbery i remark no he commence by lend money and amass a considerable fortune then avarice seize he as it do so many man and come into contact with archer and he friend he see that the idea of the yacht be a safe and profitable one therefore he purchase the vessel and run it at the disposition of the thief and subsequently under compulsion in the secret service of russium as i have already describe to you the profit be colossal in one year my father 's share be eighty thousand pound and where be you father now i ask ah she exclaim sadly she face pale and haggard i have hear that the vessel be scuttle somewhere in the baltic that be true oberg 's purpose have be serve he demand half the property on board or he would give notice to the russian naval authority that the pirate yacht be afloat he attempt to blackmail my father as he have already do so many time but he scheme be frustrated my father because of he inhuman treatment of poor elma defy he when it appear that oberg who be in helsingfor telegraph to the admiral of the russian fleet in the baltic the crew from the _ iri _ be at once land at riga and only mackintosh and my father put to sea again ah my father be desperate for he know the merciless character of that man whose victim he have be for so long they watch a russian cruiser bear down upon they when just as it draw near they get off in a boat and blow up the yacht which sink in three minute with its ill-obtained wealth on board and you father she be silent and i see tear stand in she eye there be a tragedy jack explain in a low hoarse voice he and the captain do not unfortunately get sufficiently far from the yacht when they blow she up and they go down with she and i look in silence at muriel who stand with she head bent and she white face cover with she hand almost at the same moment there be a low tap at the door and the servant-maid announce : mr santinus miss ah exclaim jack quickly as olinto enter the room then you have my note we have ask you here to reveal to we this dastardly plot which seem to have be form against mr gregg and myself as you know i have have a narrow escape i know signora and the signor commendatore be also threaten by whom by those who kill my poor wife and who intend also to silence I be he answer the same who compel you take I to that house where the fatal chair be prepared eh it be archer who fear that you come to london in search of they devise that devilish contrivance he say in he broken english then continue he go on fiercely : now that i have discover why my poor armida be kill i will tell the truth and not spare they since you leave scotland signora i have be up in dumfry and have discover several fact which prove that for some reason know only to himself leithcourt while at rannoch write to both armida and myself separately make a appointment to see we at the same time at that spot on the edge of the wood as he have some secret commission to entrust to we the letter address to I apparently fall into someone else 's hand -- probably one of the secret agent of baron oberg who be always watch leithcourt 's doings and he anxious to learn what be intend make himself up to look like I and keep the appointment in my place armida have receive the letter unknown to I go up to scotland and be also there at the appoint time what actually transpire can only be surmise yet it seem that leithcourt be in the habit of go up to that spot and loitering there in the evening in order to meet chater in secret as the latter be in hide in a small hotel in dumfry therefore those who form the plot must have endeavor to throw suspicion upon leithcourt it be plain however as both myself and armida know the gang it be to they interest to get rid of we because the suspicion of the police have at last become arouse poor armida be therefore deliberately entice there to she death while the inquisitive man whom the assassin take to be myself be also strike down by whom not by chater for he be in london on that night then by woodroffe durnford say without a doubt it be all most cleverly think out it be to he advantage alone to close we lip because in that same fatal chair in lambeth old jacob moser the jew bullion-broker of hatton garden meet he death -- a most dastardly crime with which none of he friend be associate and of which we alone hold knowledge he therefore write to we as though from leithcourt call we up to rannoch in order to strike the blow in the darkness he add in he peculiar italian manner besides he fear we would tell the signora the truth you have not tell the police i dare not signore surely the less the police know about this matter the better otherwise the signorina leithcourt must suffer for she father 's avarice and evil-doing yes cry jack anxiously that be right olinto the police must know nothing the reprisal we must make ourselves but who be it who shoot I in suffolk street the same man martin woodroffe then the assassin be back from russium he follow closely behind the signor commendatore markoff a clever secret agent of baron oberg 's come with he then for the first time i recollect that the man i have recognize in the strand be a fellow i have see lounge in the ante-room of the palace of the governor-general of finland the pair fear that i should reveal what i know be undoubtedly in london to take my life in secret now that leithcourt be dead woodroffe have unite force with oberg and intend to silence I because they fear that elma besides escape they have also reveal she secret i trust that the signorina leithcourt have explain the story of the yacht and its crew olinto remark and have also show you how i be implicate you will therefore discern the reason why i have hitherto fear to give you any explanation yes i say miss leithcourt have tell I a great deal but not everything i can not yet gather for what reason she and she father flee from rannoch then i will tell you say muriel quickly my father suspect woodroffe of be the assassin in rannoch wood for he know that he have break away from the original compact and have now ally himself with oberg yet it be also my father 's object to appear in fear of they because he be only await a opportunity to lay plan for poor elma be rescue from finland therefore one evening woodroffe call and my father encounter he in the avenue and admit he with he own latchkey by one of the side door of the castle afterwards take he up to the study he know that he have come to try and make term for oberg therefore he see that he must fly at once to newcastle where the _ iri _ be lie get on board and sail away with some excuse he leave he in the study and then warn my mother and myself to prepare to leave but while we be pack it appear that chater who have follow be show into the study by the butler or rather he enter there himself be well acquaint with the house thus the two man now bitter enemy meet a fierce quarrel must have ensue and chater be poison and conceal woodroffe of course believe he have kill he my father enter the study again and see only woodroffe there do not know what have occur some word probably arise when my father again turn and leave then we flee to carlisle and on to newcastle and next morning be on board the yacht out in the north sea afterwards land at rotterdam those she add be briefly the fact as my poor father relate they to I and what of poor elma -- and of she secret when i wonder shall i see she i cry in despair you will see she now signore answer olinto a servant of the princess zurloff bring she to london this afternoon and i have just convey she from the station she be in the next room in ignorance however that you be here and without another word i flee forward joyfully and throw open the folding-door which separate I from my silent love silent yes but she could nevertheless tell she story -- surely the strangest that any woman have ever live to tell chapter xviii contain elma 's story before I stand my love a slim tragic rather wan figure in a heavy dark traveling-coat and feel toque she sweet lip part and a look of bewildered amazement upon she countenance as i burst in so suddenly upon she in silence i grasp she tiny black-gloved hand and then also in silence raise it passionately to my eager lip she soft dark eye -- those eye that speak although she be mute -- meet mine and in they be a look that i have never see there before -- a look which as plainly as any word tell I that my wild fevered passion be reciprocate she gaze beyond into the room where the other have assemble and then look at I inquiringly whereupon i lead she forward to where they be and muriel fall upon she and kiss she with tear streaming from she eye i prepare this surprise for you mr gregg muriel say laugh through she tear of joy olinto learn that she

the white paper before she she position amid a hundred conflict emotion be one of extreme difficulty it seem as though even now she be loth to reveal to we the absolute truth muriel standing behind she chair tenderly stroke back the wealth of chestnut hair from she white brow she complexion be perfect even though she face be pale and jaded and she eye heavy consequent upon she long weary journey from the now frozen north presently when by sign both jack and olinto have urge she to write she bent suddenly and she pencil begin to run swiftly over the paper all of we stand exchange glance in silence neither look over she but each determine to wait in patience until the end once start however she do not pause sheet after sheet she cover the silence for a long time be complete break only by the rapid running of the pencil over the rough surface of the paper she have apparently become seize by a sudden determination to explain everything now that she see we be in real dead earnest i watch she sweet face bent so intently and as the firelight fall across it find it incomparable yes she be afflict by loss of speech it be true yet she be surely inexpressibly sweet and womanly peerless above all other with a deep-drawn sigh she at last finished and she head still bow in a attitude of humiliation it seem she hand what she have write to I in breathless eagerness i read as follow : be it true dear love -- for i call you so in return -- that you be impel towards I by the mysterious hand that direct all thing you come in search of I and you risk you life for mine at kajana therefore you have a right to know the truth you as my champion and the princess as my friend have contrived to effect my freedom be it not for you i should ere this have be on my way to saghalien to the tomb to which oberg have so ingeniously contrived to consign I ah you do not know -- you never can know -- all that i have suffer ever since i be a girl here the statement break off and recommence as follow : in order that you should understand the truth i have better begin at the begin my father be a english merchant in petersburg and my mother vera bessanoff who before she marriage with my father be celebrate at court for she beauty and be one of the maids-of-honor to the czarina she be the only daughter of count paul bessanoff ex-governor of kharkoff and before marry my father she have with she mother be a well-known figure in society immediately after she marriage she father die leave she in possession of a ample fortune which with my father 's own wealth place they among the richest and most influential in petersburg among my father 's most intimate friend be baron xavier oberg -- who at that time hold a very subordinate position in the ministry of the interior -- and from my earliest recollection i can remember he come frequently to we house and be invite to the brilliant entertainment which my mother give when i be thirteen however my father die of a chill contract while boar-hunting on he estate in kiev and within a few month a further disaster happen to we one night while i be sit alone read aloud to my mother two stranger be announce and on be show in they arrest my dear mother on a charge of complicity in a revolutionary plot against the czar which have be discover at peterhof i stand defiant and indignant for my mother be certainly no nihilist yet they say that the bomb have be introduce into the palace by the countess anna shiproff one of the lady-in-waiting who be a intimate friend of my mother 's and often use to visit she they allege that the conspiracy have be hatch in we house color be lend to that theory by the fact that a year before a well-known russian with whom my father have have many business dealings have be prove to be the author of the plot by which the czar 's train be blow up near lividium they tear my mother away from I and place she in that gray prison-van the sight of which in the street of petersburg strike terror into the heart of every russian for a person once in that rumble vehicle be as you know lose for ever to the world i watch she from the window be place in that fatal conveyance and then i think i must have faint for i recollect nothing more until i find myself upon the floor with the gray dawn spreading and all the horrible truth come back to I my mother be go from I for ever in sheer desperation i go to the ministry of the interior and seek a interview with the baron who when i tell he of the disaster appear greatly concerned and go at once to the police department to make inquiry next day however he come to I with the news that the charge against my mother have be prove by a statement of the woman shiproff herself and that she have already start on she long journey to siberia -- she have be exile to one of those dreaded arctic settlement beyond yakutsk a place where it be almost eternal winter and where the condition of life be such that half the convict be insane the baron however declare that as my father 's friend it be he duty to act as guardian to I and that as my father have be english i ought to be put to a english school therefore with he self-assumed title of uncle he take I to chichester for year i remain there until one day he come suddenly and fetch I away take I over to helsingfor -- for the czar have now appoint he governor-general to finland there for the first time he introduce I to he son michael a pimply-faced lieutenant of cavalry and say in a most decisive manner that i must marry he i naturally refuse to marry a man of whom i know so little whereupon finding I obdurate he quickly alter he tactic and become kindness itself say that as i be young he would allow I a year in which to make up my mind a week later while live in the palace at helsingfor i overheard a conversation between the governor-general and he son which reveal to I a staggering truth that i have never suspect it be oberg himself who have denounce my mother to the minister of the interior and have make those cruel baseless charge against she then i discern the reason she be exile she fortune as well as that of my father come to I the reason they be scheming for michael to marry I be in order to obtain control of my money i see at once how helpless i be in the hand of that unscrupulous pair and i recognize too sufficient of the baron 's method as ` the strangler of finland ' to show I what kind of character he be beneath that calm eminently respectable black-coated exterior after deliberately send my poor mother to siberia he have assume the role of my guardian in order that he might when i come of age obtain control of my inheritance the idea no doubt be that i should marry michael and then after the necessary legal formality i should on a trumped-up charge of conspiracy share the same fate as my mother have do the infernal scoundrel i ejaculated when i read she word while from jack who have be look over my shoulder escape a fierce and forcible vow of vengeance the baron take I with he to petersburg when he go on official business and we remain there nearly a month the narrative go on while there i receive a secret message from ` the red priest ' the unseen and unknown power of nihilism who have for so many year baffle the police i go to see he and he reveal to I how oberg have contrived to have my mother banish upon a false charge he warn I against the man who have pretend to be my father 's friend and also tell I that he have know my father intimately and that if i get into any further difficulty i be to communicate with he and he would assist I oberg take I back to helsingfor a few month later and in summer we go to england he be a marvelously clever diplomatist he tactic he could change at will when i be at school he be rough and brutal in he manner towards I as he be to all but now he seem to be endeavor to inspire my confidence by treat I with kindly regard and pleasant affability in london at claridge 's we meet my old schoolfellow muriel and she father -- a friend of oberg 's -- and in response to they invitation go for a cruise on they yacht the _ iri _ from southampton we party be a very pleasant one and include woodroffe and chater while we cruise across the bay of biscay and along the portuguese coast prove most delightful one night while we be lie outside lisbon woodroffe and chater together with olinto go ashore and when they return in the early hour of the morning they awake I by cross the deck above my head then i hear someone outside my cabin-door work as though with a screwdriver unscrew a screw from the woodwork this arouse my interest and next day i make a minute examination of the paneling where in one part i find two small brass screw that have evidently be recently remove therefore i succeed in get hold of a screwdriver from the carpenter 's shop and next night when everyone be asleep i creep out and unscrew the panel when to my surprise i see that the secret cavity behind be fill with beautiful jewelry diamond collar tiaras necklets fine pearl emerald and turquoise all _ throw _ in indiscriminately i replace the panel and keep careful watch at marseille where we call more jewelry and a heavy bagful of plate be bring aboard and secrete behind another panel then i know that the man be thief but surely continue the strange story my mute love have write i need not describe all that occur upon that eventful voyage except to tell you of one very curious incident which occur i have speak confidentially with muriel regard my suspicion of the man who be we fellow-guest and when in secret i show she several place on board the yacht where valuable be secrete she also become convinced that the man be expert thief to whom she father for some unexplained reason render assistance and asylum she tell I that since she have leave school she have be on quite a number of cruise and that the same party always accompany she father she have however never suspect the truth until i point it out to she well one hot summer 's night we be lie off naple and as it be a grand festa ashore and there be to be a gala performance at the theater leithcourt take a box and the whole party be row ashore the crew be also give shore-leave for the evening but as the great heat have upset I i decline to accompany the theater-party and remain on board with one sailor name wilson to constitute the watch we have anchor about half a mile from land and earlier in the evening the baron have go ashore to send telegram to russium and have not return about ten o'clock i go below to try and sleep but i have a slight attack of fever and be unable therefore i redressed and sit with the light still out gaze across the starlit bay presently from my port-hole i see a shore-boat approach and recognize in it the baron with a well-dressed stranger they both come on board and the boatman have be pay pull back to the shore then the baron and he friend -- a dark middle-aged full-bearded man evidently a person of refinement -- go below to the saloon and after a few moment call to the man wilson who be on the watch and give he a glass of whisky and water which he take up on deck to drink at he leisure the unusual character of my fellow-guest on board that craft be such that my suspicion be constantly on the alert therefore curiosity tempt I to creep along and peep in at the crack of the door stand ajar a closer view reveal the fact that the stranger be a high russian official to whom i have once be introduce at the government palace at helsingfor the privy-councillor and senator paul polovstoff they be smoke together and be discuss in russian the means by which he polovstoff have arrange to obtain plan of some new british fortification at gibraltar from what he say it seem that some russian woman marry to a englishman a captain in the garrison have be impress into the secret service against she will but that she have in order to save herself promise to obtain the photograph and plan that be require i hear the englishman 's name and i resolve to take some step to inform he in secret of the intention of the russian agent presently the two man take fresh cigar ascend on deck and cast themselves in the long cane chair amidship still all curiosity to hear further detail on the ingenious piece of espionage against my own nation i take off my shoe and creep up to a spot where i could crouch conceal and overhear they conversation for the italian night be calm and still they talk mainly about affair in finland and with some of oberg 's expression of opinion polovstoff venture to differ this arouse the baron 's anger and i know from the cold sarcasm of he remark and the peculiarly hard tone of he voice that he be more incensed than he outwardly show himself to be he rise and stand with he back to the bulwark face he friend who still sit lean back in he deck-chair insist upon he own view he be quite calm and not in the least perturb by the evil glint in the baron 's eye perhaps he do not know he so well as i do he do not know what that look mean suddenly while the privy-councillor lay back in he chair pull thoughtfully at he cigar there be a bright blood-red flash a dull report and a man 's short agonized cry startle i lean around the corner of the deck-house when to my abject horror i saw under the electric ray the czar 's privy-councillor lie sideways in he chair with part of he face blow away then the hideous truth in a instant become apparent the cigar which oberg have press upon he down in the saloon have explode and the small missile conceal inside the diabolical contrivance have pass upward into he brain for a moment i stand utterly stupefied yet as i look i see the baron in a paroxysm of rage shake he fist in the dead man 's face and cry with a fearful imprecation : ` you hound you have plot to replace I in the czar 's favor you intend to become governor-general of finland you know certain fact which you intend to put before he majesty know that the revelation would result in my disgrace and downfall but you infernal cur you do not know that those who attempt to thwart xavier oberg either die by accident or go for life to kajana or the mine ' and he spurn the body with he foot and laugh to himself as he gloat over he dastardly crime i watch he rage unable to utter a single word i see he after he have search the dead man 's pocket raise the inert body with its awful featureless face and drag it to the bulwark then i rush forward and face he in a instant he spring at I and i scream but no aid come the man wilson be sleep soundly in the bow for the whisky he have give he have be doctor go on the narrative upon he face be a fierce murderous look such as i have never see before ` you ' he scream he dark eye start from they socket as he realize that i have be a witness of he cowardly crime ` you have spy upon I girl ' he hiss ` and you shall die also ' i sink upon my knee implore he to spare I but he only laugh at my entreaty ` see ' he cry ` as you see how he enjoy he cigar you may as well see this ' and with a effort he raise the dead body in he arm poise it for a moment on the vessel 's side and then with a hoarse laugh of triumph heave it into the sea there be a splash and then we be alone ` and you ' he cry in a fierce voice -- ` you who have spy upon I -- you will follow the water there will close you chatter mouth ' i shriek beg and implore but he tremble hand be upon my throat first he drag I to my foot then he throw I upon my knee and at last with that grim brutality which characterize he he direct I to go and get a mop and bucket from the forecastle and remove the dark red stain from the chair and deck this he actually force I to do gloat over my horror as i remove for he the trace of he cowardly crime then with he hand upon my shoulder he say ` girl recollect that you keep to-night 's work secret if not you shall die a death more painful than that dog have die -- one in which you shall experience all the torture of the damned recollect not a single word -- or death now go to you cabin and never pry into my affair again ' i go back to my cabin as i be bid and sit speechless in abject horror the fiendish action of the man who be my guardian frighten I and yet i be utterly helpless what could i do who in holy russium would hear I oberg be a power in the empire the czar himself trust he if i speak who would believe I who would heed the word of a defenseless girl whom he would at once declare to be hysterical thus i wait alone in the darkness watch the light of the port gleam across the placid water until nearly one o'clock when the gay party return and the baron greet they merrily as though nothing have happen but my heart be freeze within I by the recollection of the awful crime that have be commit \* \* \* \* \* why now i remember cry muriel amaze i remember that night quite well how white you be when you come to my cabin and ask to be allow to sleep in my spare berth you would tell I nothing and only say you be ill none of we have any idea that such a terrible tragedy have be enact but of course the baron have arrange it all for it be at he instigation i recollect that the crew have be give shore-leave mackintosh suggest that only half the crew should go but he declare that if wilson alone be leave it would be sufficient i too recollect the affair quite well jack declare tug at he mustache utterly amaze at my love 's strange story it be a plain statement of hard astounding fact and she now stand cling to I look eagerly into my eye read every thought that pass through my mind a great sensation be cause when the body be discover the squadron be lie off naple about a week after the _ iri _ have leave and while we be there the body be wash up near sorrento at first but little notice be take of it but by the mark on the dead man 's linen it be discover that he be polovstoff one of the highest russian official who have it be say be warn on several occasion by the nihilist it be therefore conclude that he death have be due to nihilist vengeance elma point to the paper and make a sign that i be to read on this i do and the statement run as follow : the real reason why the baron spare my life be because if i die my fortune would pass to a distant cousin living at durham yet he manner towards I be now most polite and pleasant -- a change that i feel bode no good he intend to obtain my money by marry I to he son michael whose evil reputation as a gambler be well know in petersburg we travel back to finland in the autumn and in the winter he take I to stay with he sister in nice yet almost daily he refer to that tragedy at naple and threaten I with death if ever i utter a single word or even admit that i have ever see the man who be he rival and he victim last June commence another paragraph we be in helsingfor when one day the baron call I suddenly and tell I to prepare for a journey we be to cross to stockholm and thence to hull where the _ iri _ be await we for mr leithcourt and muriel have invite we for a summer cruise to the greek island we board the yacht much against my will yet i be powerless and dare not allege the fact that i have already establish concern we fellow-guest muriel and i it seem be take merely in order to blind the shore-guard and custom official as to the real nature of the vessel which when safely out of the channel be repaint and rename the _ lolum _ until she exterior present quite a different appearance from the _ iri _ the port of leghorn be we first place of call and for some reason we run purposely upon a sandbank and be tow off by italian torpedo-boat next evening you come on board and dine muriel and myself have strict order not to show ourselves we however watch you and i see you pick up my photograph which i have that day tear up then immediately after you have leave woodroffe chater and mackintosh go ashore and be away a couple of hour in the middle of the night just before they return the baron rap at the door of my cabin say that he must go ashore and tell I to dress and accompany he he would never allow I the luxury of a maid fear i suppose that she might learn too much in obedience i rise and dress and when i go forth he tell I to get my traveling-cloak and dressing-bag add that he be compel to go north as to continue the cruise would occupy too much time he be due back at he official duty he say as soon as i have finish pack the three man return to the vessel all of they look dark-faced and disappointed woodroffe whisper some word to the baron after which i go to muriel 's cabin and wish she good-bye and we go ashore take the train first to colle salvettus thence to pisa and afterwards to the beautiful old city of siena which i have so longed to see one of my tooth give I pain and the baron after a couple of day at the hotel de sienne take I to a queer-looking little old italian -- a dentist who he say enjoy a excellent reputation i be quick to notice that the two man have meet before and as i sit in the chair and gas be give to I i see they exchange meaning glance in a few moment i become insensible but when i awake a hour later i be astounded to feel a curious soreness in my ear my tongue too seem paralyzed and in a few moment the awful truth dawn upon I i have be render deaf and dumb the baron pretend to be greatly concern about I it go on but i quickly realize that i have be the victim of a foul and dastardly plot and that he have conceive it fear lest i might speak the truth concern the privy-councillor polovstoff for of exposure he live in constant fear to encompass my end would be against he own interest as he would lose my fortune so he have silence I lest i should reveal the terrible truth concern both he and he associate he be not rich and i have reason to believe that from time to time he give information as to person who possess valuable jewel and thus share in the plunder obtain by those on the yacht from italy we travel on to berlin thence to petersburg and back to dreary helsingfor journey as quickly as we could yet never allow I opportunity of be with stranger both my ear and tongue be very painful but i say nothing he be surely a fiend in a black coat and my only thought now be how to escape he from the moment when that so-called dentist have ruin my hearing and deprive I of power of speech he keep I aloof from everyone the fear that i should reveal everything have apparently grow to haunt he and he have conceive that terrible mode of silencing my lip but the true depth of he villainy be not yet apparent until i be back in finland on the night of we arrival he call in he son who have travel with we from petersburg and in write again demand that i should marry he i write my reply -- a firm refusal he strike the table angrily with he fist and write say that i should either marry he son or die then next day while walk alone out beyond the town of helsingfor as i often use to do i be arrest upon the false charge of a attempt upon the life of madame vakuroff and transport without trial to the terrible fortress of kajana some of the horror of which you have yourself experience the charge against I be necessary before i could be incarcerate there but once within it be the scheme of the governor-general to obtain my consent to the marriage by threat and by the constant terror of the place he even go so far as to obtain a ministerial order for my banishment to saghalien and bring it to I to kajana declare that if in one month i do not consent he should allow I to be send to exile while i be in kajana he know that he secret be safe therefore by every means in he power he urge I to consent to the odious union all the rest be know to you -- how providence direct you to I as my deliverer and how woodroffe follow you in secret and pretend to be my friend take I with he to petersburg he have learn of my fortune from the baron and intend to marry I himself but now that all be over it appear to I like some terrible dream i never believe that so much iniquity exist in the world or that man could fight a defenseless woman with such double-dealing and cruel ingenuity ah the torture i endure in kajana be beyond human conception yet surely oberg and woodroffe will obtain they well-merited desert -- if not in this world then in the world to come be we not teach by holy writ to forgive we enemy therefore let we forgive \* \* \* \* \* there my silent love 's strange story end a bald straightforward narrative that hold we all for some moment absolutely speechless -- one of the strangest and most startling story ever reveal she watch every expression of my countenance and then when i have finish reading and place my arm tenderly about she slim waist she raise she beautiful face to mine to receive the passionate kiss i imprint upon those soft full lip this of course make everything plain exclaimed jack polovstoff be a very liberal-minded and upright official who be greatly in the favor of the czar and a serious rival to oberg whose drastic and merciless method in finland be not exactly approve by the emperor the baron be well aware of this and by ingeniously entice he on board the _ iri _ he succeed by hand that small bomb conceal in a cigar -- a nihilist contrivance that have probably be seize by he police in finland -- in free himself from the rival who be destine to occupy he post yes i say with a sigh the mystery be clear up it be true yet my poor elma be still the victim and i kissed my love passionately again and again upon the lip conclusion nearly two year have now go by there have be change in holy russium -- many great and amazing change consequent upon war and its disaster russium be no longer the great power that she once be suppose to be many event that have startle the world have occur since that day when i first enfold my silent love within my arm one of they be know to you all you read in the newspaper without a doubt how the baron xavier oberg the persecutor of finland the enemy of education the relentless foe of the defenseless the man who order woman to be knout to death in kajana the heartless official whom the finn call the strangler be blow to piece by a bomb throw beneath he carriage as he drive to the railway station at helsingfor on he way to have audience with the emperor the secret truth be that the red priest decree that oberg should die and the plot be swiftly put into execution and although five hundred arrest be make the police be unaware to this day of the identity of the person who direct it or of who throw the fatal missile from pillar to post the revolutionist have be hunt by the bloodhound of police yet the red priest still live on quietly in petersburg and the princess zurloff still unsuspected devote the greater part of she enormous income to the cause of freedom of jack and muriel i need only say they be marry about three month after elma 's return from russium and at the present time they be live on the outskirts of glasgow where jack have secure the shore appointment which he so long covet by some means -- exactly how be not quite certain -- the police discover that dick archer alia woodroffe alias hornby be concern in the clever robbery of a dressing-bag contain the dowager lady lancashire 's jewel from she footman on euston platform and after a long search they find he hide at a hotel in liverpool when however they go to arrest he he laugh in the face of the detective place something swiftly in he mouth and swallow it before they could prevent he -- then ten minute later he fall dead he know what terrible revelation must be make if we give evidence against he and he therefore prefer death by he own hand to that follow a judicial sentence chater although one of the most expert jewel thief in europe have never be actually guilty of any graver offense and when we hear that he be in san francisco where he have open a small bar and be try to live honestly we resolve to allow he to remain there indeed jack write to he about nine month ago warn he never to set foot on english soil again on pain of arrest olinto santinus have recently open a small restaurant in western road brighton and be i believe do very well and ourselves well what can i really tell you mere word fail to tell you of the completeness of we happiness it be idyllic -- that be all i can say my proposal of marriage be make to elma a very few day after she write down she startling and romantic story and a year ago at a little village church in hertfordshire we become man and wife there be present at we wedding madame heath my bride 's mother

the greatest london specialist have continually treat my dear wife and under they she have already recover she speech -- so far indeed that she can now whisper in a low soft voice but they tell I they be hopeful that ere long she voice will become stronger and speech practically restore already too she can begin to hear after all the storm and peril of the past we life be now indeed full of a calm sweet peace in we own comfortable little house with its trellised porch cover with rose and honeysuckle that face the blue channel at st margaret 's bay beyond dover we lead a life of mutual trust and
