convinced and determine to test the truth of this statement take a ramrod he drive it into the corn this produce a answering scream from below and a moment later a woolly head and black body be disclose further search be make and a hundred and fifty slave be discover pack as close as herring in a barrel some be in iron one be sew up in a sail cloth and all have be cruelly treat soon the iron be knock off and the poor slave set free to they great wonder and delight sir samuel arrive at gondokoro on the 15th of April 1871 already two year of he time have expire in addition to check the slave trade he have be commission to introduce a system of regular commerce he set to work at once to show the people the benefit of agricultural pursuit he get he follower to plant seed and soon they be happy enough watch for the green shoot to appear but before long they begin to suffer from want of food the tribe round about have be set against they by the slave hunter and would supply they with nothing so that baker in the midst of plenty seem likely to perish of starvation however he soon adopt energetic measure to prevent that have take official possession of the land in the name of the khedive he seize a sufficient number of animal for he requirement the head man of the tribe and he follower be soon buzz about he ear like a swarm of wasp but see he be not to be frighten by they threat they show themselves ready enough in the future to supply he with cattle in return for payment he own soldier be nearly as troublesome as the native they be lazy and mutinous the sentry go to sleep the scout be unreliable they be full of complaint whilst round about he be the native ready to steal maim and murder whenever they could get a opportunity he life be daily in danger and so as not to be take unawares he organise a band of forty follower for he personal service on these man he could always rely they be proud of the confidence place in they and be ready to go anywhere and do anything by a strange perversity they be nickname the forty thief though they be amongst the very few who be honest what with sickness and fighting and loss encounter on the way up the river baker 's force be now reduce to about five hundred man in place of the twelve hundred whom he have once review at gondokoro still he do not despair of accomplish with god 's help the mission on which he have be send in January 1872 with he wife and only two hundred and twelve officer and man he start south on a journey of three or four hundred mile into the region where the slave trade be carry on with the greatest activity he have arrange with one of the chief to supply he with two thousand porter to carry the goods of the expedition but when the time come not a single man be forthcoming so he soldier have to be they own carrier for a time at a later date he be enable to hire five hundred man to assist he to transport he goods and present each with a cow as a reward for he service all take the cow readily enough but sixty-seven of the carrier do not appear at the time appoint the other be extremely desirous of go to look after they but baker know they way full well think it better to lose the service of the sixty-seven man rather than to allow this for he feel sure if they once return to search for they companion there would be no chance of see a single one of they again after many peril he reach the territory of kabbu rega on the victorium nile the king be apparently friendly at first but on several occasion the war drum sound and although no violence be actually offer yet sir samuel think it well to be on he guard he therefore set he man to work to build a strong fort they cut thick log of wood and plant they firmly in the ground prepared fireproof room for the ammunition and be in the course of a few day ready in case of emergency these preparation have be make none too soon -lrb- illustration : burn the king 's divan and hut -rrb- a few day later a very strange thing happen the king send sir samuel a present of some jar of cider this he give to he troops a little while afterwards one of he officer rush in to say the man have be poison it be really so the man who have drunk of the cider be lie about in terrible pain and apparently die at once sir samuel give they mustard and water and other emetic and they be soon better but he know that trouble be at hand next morning he be stand at the entrance to the fort with one of he man when a chorus of yell burst upon he ear he tell he bugler to sound the alarm and be walk towards the house to get a rifle when the man beside he fall shoot through the heart the fort be surround by thousand of native who keep up a continuous fire and the bush near at hand be full of sharp-shooter but the fort be strong and its defender fight bravely the wood be gradually clear of sharp-shooter and the native ere long break and flee then sir samuel send a detachment out of the fort and set fire to the king 's divan and to the surround hut to teach the people a lesson for they treachery but the place be full of foe a poison spear be throw at sir samuel and every day he remain he force be in danger of destruction so he determine to go on to king riongo whom he hope would be more friendly it be wonderful that the party ever get there first of all it be find that they would probably be a week without provision but happily lady baker have put by some supplies and great be the rejoice when she forethought become known then it be discover that the country through which they have to pass be full of conceal foe from the long grass and bush spear be constantly hurl at they and not a few of the man be mortally wound sir samuel see several lance pass close to he wife 's head and he narrowly escape be hit on various occasion but at last riongo 's territory be reach the king be friendly and for a time they be in comparative safety by April 1873 baker have return to gondokoro and he mission end it be to a great extent the story of a failure so far as its main purpose be concern owe to the opposition of the man who be make a profit by deal in slave and who whilst appear to be friendly stir up the native to attack he but failure though it be he have do all that man could do and the expedition stand out as one of the most glorious effort which have be make against overwhelming odds to put a end to the slave trade two work man hero the story of case and chew the large gasholder which be often a source of wonder to youthful mind as they rise and fall be the place in which gas be store for the use of we city by day when they be generally receive more gas than they be give out they rise and again at night when less be be pump into they than be go out for consumption in the street and house they fall the gasholder be place in a tank of water so that there be no waste of gas as the huge iron holder fill or empty now it be in one of these gasholder that a few year ago two man do a deed that will live here be the brief story the holder be be repair the gas have be remove and air have be pump into it instead of gas so that man could work inside and the holder have rise about fifty foot two man be work inside the holder one a foreman and the other a labourer name case the latter in a diver 's helmet they be stand on a plank float on the water fresh air be be pump down to case who so long as he keep on the helmet be perfectly safe all at once the foreman find he be begin to feel faint so he tell the labourer they would go up to the top for fresh air but he have not the strength to carry out he purpose the raft be pull to the ladder by which they be to get out but he be unable to ascend and fall down in a faint condition then the labourer regardless of the danger he be run unscrewed he helmet into which fresh air be be pump and place it quite near he fall comrade enable he to get some of the air the foreman try in vain to get case to put on the helmet and he own strength be too slight to force he to do so indeed he be in such a state of weakness that he fall on the raft and know no more till he once again find himself in a place of safety now let we see how the foreman be rescue be effect and at what cost the man at the top of the holder have by this time become aware that something be wrong below and two man chew and smith by name at once volunteer to go down below they reach the plank get a rope round the foreman 's body when they too begin to feel the effect of the gas and ascend the ladder whilst the foreman be be hoist up by means of the rope smith reach the top in a faint condition chew never arrive there at all for just as he get within a few foot of safety he become insensible and fall down into the water below and be drowned meantime case have become jam in between the plank and one of the stay and so when at length they remove he life have pass away such deed be so often do by we work man that they think nothing about it they do not know that they be hero -- that be the best of it it be a fact to be thankful for that everywhere throughout the land beneath the rough jacket of we artisan and labourer beat heart as true and fearless as those which have storm the fort or brave the danger of the battlefield the commander of the thin red line the story of sir colin campbell it be the 21st of October 1808 colin campbell not yet sixteen have join the army as ensign and the battle of vimiera be about to begin it be he baptism of fire colin be in the rear company he captain come for he and take the lad 's hand walk with he up and down in front of the lead company for several minute whilst the enemy 's gun be commence to fire then he tell the youngster to go back to he place it be the greatest kindness that could have be show to I at such a time and through life i have feel grateful for it write colin campbell in later life of this incident soon after the regiment to which he belong form part of the army that retreat to corunna when we troops suffer such terrible hardship colin campbell have a rough time of it then the sole of he boot be wear to piece and so long a time do he wear they without a change that the upper stick firmly to he leg and though the boot be soak in hot water the skin come away when they be take off after the battle of corunna -- when the british bring to bay turn and defeat they foe -- it be colin 's regiment that have the honor of digging the grave in which they heroic commander sir john moore be bury battle after battle follow ere the french troops be drive out of spain and colin campbell young as he be fight like a veteran at barossa he bravery bring he into special notice and at the san sebastian he lead a storm party and be twice wound in do so first of all he be shoot through the right thigh but though a storm of bullet be fly about and man fall thick around he he be up again and press onward only to be again shoot down for he gallant conduct on this occasion he be specially mention in the despatch that the general command the force send to the duke of wellington a few week later the troops move on and fight at the battle of bidassoa colin campbell be leave in the hospital to recover from he wound but so little be it to he liking to stay in the rear that he escape from the hospital and manage not only to fight at bidassoa but to get wound again he be of course reprove by he colonel but who could be seriously angry with a youngster for such conduct so when he be send back to england to get heal of he wound he be make a captain at the early age of twenty-one among the first thing that colin campbell do when he receive he captain 's pay be to make he father a allowance of # 30 or # 40 a year and later on it be a immense satisfaction for he to be able to provide both for he father and sister in the chinese war of 1842 he be in command of the 98th regiment the tremendous heat of the country during the summer terribly thin the rank of he force and he lose over 400 man in eighteen month he himself be strike down by sunstroke and fever but owe probably to he temperate and careful habit he soon recover after the chinese war colin campbell be busy in indium and at chillianwallah be wound in the arm it be in this battle he narrowly escape with he life the day after the fight when he be be assist to take off he uniform he find that a small pistol which have be put in he pocket without he knowledge be break he watch smash and he side bruise a bullet have strike he unperceived in the heat of the battle and he life save by its force have be arrest by the handle of the pistol in 1849 colin campbell be make a kcb -lrb- knight commander of the bath -rrb- so we must henceforth speak of he as sir colin march 1853 see sir colin campbell in england but though he have pass he sixtieth year most of which have be spend in he country 's service he rest be not of long duration as in 1854 he go out to the crimea in command of the highland brigade consist of the 42nd 79th and 93rd regiment sir colin be proud of the splendid troops he command and at the battle of the alma they cover themselves with glory the 42nd -lrb- the black watch -rrb- be the first of the three regiment across the river alma whilst ascend the height on the russian side of the river sir colin 's horse be twice wound the second shot kill it but he be soon mount on another horse lead he man to victory the guard and highlander strive in friendly emulation who should be first in the russian redoubt but sir colin well ahead of he own man be first in the battery shouting : -- we 'll hae nane but highland bonnet here and he troops rush in after he like lion the terrific charge of these fierce highlander combine with they dress strike terror into the heart of the russian who say that they think they have come to fight man but do not bargain for demon in petticoat now man sir colin have say before the engagement you be go into battle remember this : whoever be wound -- i do not care what he rank be -- must lie where he fall till the bandsman come to attend to he be steady keep silent fire low now man the army will watch we make I proud of the highland brigade at the conclusion of that well-fought day the commander-in-chief lord raglan send for sir colin he eye be full he lip quiver and he be unable to speak but he give campbell a hearty handshake and a look which speak volume that be a joyful day for sir colin my man behave nobly he write i never see troops march to battle with greater _ sing froid _ and order than these three highland regiment the alma have be fight on 20th September 1854 and on the 25th October be fight the battle of balaclava memorable for the thin red line it look at one time as if the heavy mass of russian cavalry must entirely crush sir colin 's highlander and they commander ride down the line of he troops say : remember there be no retreat from here man you must die where you stand ay ay sir colin we 'll do that come the ready response now it be usual in prepare to receive a cavalry charge for soldier to be form in a hollow square but on this occasion sir colin range he man two deep in a _ thin red line _ which have become memorable in the annals of the british army the russian cavalry be advance but instead of the mass which be expect to make the attack only about 400 come on sir colin 's man fierce and eager for the onset would have dash from behind the hillock where they be station but for the stern voice command they to stand firm in they rank the russian hardly wait for they fire startle by the red-coated britisher rise up at the word of they leader they break and flee and the man of the 93rd who but a little before have make up they mind to die where they stand saw as in a dream they enemy scatter and break and the cloud of horseman which have threaten to engulf and annihilate they make no effort to snatch the victory which seem within they grasp before the crimean war be over sir colin resign he command and return to england as a protest against a affront he have receive honor by the queen with a command to attend she at windsor he be ask by she majesty to return to the crimea and the veteran assent at once declare he would serve under a corporal if she wish it the russian war be soon conclude and sir colin think that at length he have finish soldier but it be not to be in the summer of 1857 the indian mutiny break out and on 11th July he be ask how soon he could start for indium the old soldier of sixty-five reply that he could go the same evening and on the very next day Sunday he be on he way to take command of the british army in indium as the mutiny be allude to briefly in the story of havelock i will only state that sir colin 's vigorous cautious skilful policy ere long bring this fearful rebellion to a close for he able conduct of the war he be warmly thank by the queen and at its conclusion be raise to the peerage under the title of lord clyde colin campbell be a admirable soldier firm in discipline set a good example ever thoughtful for the comfort and well-being of he man share in all the hardship and peril they pass through it be therefore not surprising that he man love he not that he be by any mean a perfect man he have a temper -- a very hasty and passionate temper too and one that trouble he a good deal but he be on the watch for that to see it do not get the better of he here be a entry from he diary of 5th march 1846 show something of the character of the man anniversary of barossa a old story thirty year ago thank god for all he goodness to I ' although i have suffer much from ill health and in many way i be still as active as any man in the regiment and quite as able as the youngest to go through fatigue let we just glance at the way this victor in a hundred fight regard the approach of death he prepare for he end with a humility as worthy of example as he deed in the army have be mind this he say to he old friend general eyre i die at peace with all the world he frequently ask mrs eyre to pray with he and to read the bible aloud oh for the pure air of heaven he once exclaim that i might be lay at rest and peace on the lap of the almighty he suffer a good deal in he last illness and at time would jump up as if he hear the bugle and exclaim : -- i be ready and so when he pass away on the 14th August 1863 in he seventy-first year lament by the queen the army and the people he be quite ready to meet that last enemy death whom he have face so often on the field of battle a sailor bold and true story of lord cochrane all who forgetful of self have strive to render they country free and glorious be true hero of those who have be ready to lay down they life for the welfare of great britain the number be legion from they let we select one as a type of thousand of brave man who have help to make britain mistress of the ocean thoma cochrane son of lord dundonald take to the sea as a duck take to the water when he first go on board ship the lieutenant care neither that he be lord cochrane nor that he be relate to the captain of the ship he do not spare he one jot but make he do all kind of work just as if he have be plain tom smith and so it come to pass that he get a thorough training and be a smart youth be soon promote cochrane have the good fortune on one occasion to meet lord nelson who in course of conversation say to he never mind maneuver always go at they this advice he certainly follow throughout he life and he begin pretty early too for be in command of a sloop of 158 ton call the _ speedy _ with fourteen small gun and fifty-one man he happen to come across a good-sized spanish vessel with thirty-two big gun and over 300 man the spaniard of course be go to seize on the little english ship and so to speak gobble it up but cochrane instead of wait to be attack make for the spaniard and after receive the fire of all she gun without deliver a shot get right under the side of the _ gamo _ -lrb- so the vessel be call -rrb- and batter into she with might and main the spaniard do not relish this and be go to board the tiny english craft but again they be forestall for cochrane with all he man take the _ gamo _ by storm kill some and frighten other and ere long a marvellous sight be witness at minorca the great _ gamo _ be bring by the _ speedy _ into the harbor with over 263 man on board hale and hearty whilst cochrane never have a fifth of that number ship after ship he take till he name become a terror to the spaniard and french for he be so audacious that no matter how big be the vessel he come across nor how small he own he go at they as nelson have tell he to do and many a stately prize bring he home as the result of he daring and bravery one of the most gallant deed he do be in connection with the defense of rosa time have change since the event related above and great britain be now help spain in she struggle against france when he get to rosa the place be within a ace of surrender the french have pound the defence into a deplorable condition fort trinidad a important position be about to be assault the wall have be well-nigh beat down by the fire of the enemy cochrane however with a immense quantity of sandbag palisade and barrel make it pretty secure but he do a cleverer thing even than this there be a piece of steep rock up which the besieger would have to climb this he cover with grease so as to make it difficult to get a foothold and plank with barb hook be place ready to catch those who be rash enough to seek they aid the assault be deliver -- up the rock come the french and -- down they tumble in dozen and hundred those who catch hold of the plank be hooked and to crown all a heavy fire be pour into they by the british during the siege the spanish flag be shoot away whilst a heavy cannonade be go on but cochrane though the bullet be whistle about in every direction calmly step down into the ditch and rescue the flag -lrb- illustration : lord cochrane rescue the flag -rrb- when he be not fight he country 's battle at sea he be besiege parliament to bring about reform in the navy this naturally bring he a good many enemy amongst rich and powerful people who be make plenty of money out of the government and do nothing for it so when these person have a chance of bring a charge of conspiracy against he they be right glad of the opportunity and in the end cochrane be send to prison some there be who believe in he honor and uprightness he wife be in all he trial a very tower of strength to he the elector of westminster who have send he to parliament never cease to have faith in he truth and honor and re-elect he when still in prison yet for all this it be between forty and fifty year before he innocence be completely prove in 1847 however he be restore to he honor by she majesty the queen and in 1854 he be make a rear admiral of england a rough diamond that be polish the story of john cassell i be summat ruff afore i go to lunnon say john cassell he have call to see he friend thoma whittaker who be stay at nottingham and john be announce as the manchester carpenter he be dress on the occasion in a suit of clothes which a quaker friend have give he but cassell be tall and thin and the quaker short and stout they do not altogether fit the trousers be too short and the hat too big accordingly john 's leg come a long way through the trousers and he head go a good way in at the top it be something like take a tin saucepan with the bottom out and use it as a scabbard for a broad sword remark one who know he he have on a old overcoat and a basket of tool be throw over he shoulder with which to earn he food in case temperance lecture fail when john remark that he be summat ruff the gentleman at whose house mr whittaker be stay nearly have a fit and after he have at length recover he gravity he ejaculate well i would have give a guinea to have see you before you do go yet john cassell be a diamond -- though at that time the roughest specimen one could come across from the pit 's mouth to the isle of dog he idea be clear cut he have confidence in himself he mean to make a name in the world -- and he _ do _ john cassell be bear in manchester in 1817 he father the bread-winner of the family have the misfortune to meet with a injury which entirely disable he and from the effect of which he die when john be quite young he mother work hard for she own and she son 's support and have little time leave to look very particularly to the education of she boy he however grow up strong and hardy it be true that when he ought to have be at school he be often at play or see something of the world its sight and festivity on he own account true also that he tumble into the river and nearly end he career at a very early age still he survive he river catastrophe and though he gain little book learning possess such a good and retentive memory and be so observant that he mind become store with vivid impression of the scene and surroundings of he youth which he relate with great effect in after-life he have of course to begin work at a early age first of all he go into a cotton factory and later to a velveteen factory then have a taste for carpentering he take to it as a trade though he be at best but a rough unskilled workman tramp about the country and do odd job wherever he could get they one day john cassell be work at the manchester exchange when he be persuade to go and hear dr grindrod lecture on temperance the lecture seem to have bite itself into john 's mind for a little later on in July 1835 after hear mr swindlehurst lecture he sign the pledge that be the unsuspected turning-point of carpenter john 's life after this he attend meeting and take a active part on the platform and become know as the boy lecturer though he be dress in fustian and wear a workman 's apron he speak effectively and he word go to the heart of he hearer he originality of style too pleased the audience of work people whom he address in 1836 john cassell make he first move towards london he work he way to town and lecture on the road he carry a bell and with that bring together he audience at time he be very roughly handle by the crowd yet this have no effect upon he except to make he the more determine he clothes become threadbare he boot wear out he general appearance dilapidated but he get help from a few good people who see the hero beneath he rag he be three week accomplish the journey and when he arrive in london spend the first day in search of work which he fail to obtain in the evening see that a temperance meeting be to be hold in a hall off the westminster road he go to it and ask to be allow to speak some of those on the platform view with distrust the gaunt shabby travel-stained applicant but he would take no denial and soon win cheer from the audience when he stop short after a brief address someone shout go on how can a chap go on when he have nothing to say come the ready reply that night he have no money in he pocket to pay for a bed so he walk the street of london through the weary hour till dawn of day other temperance meeting he address for he heart and mind be full of that subject after one of the meeting a gentleman question he as to he means and find the strait he be in ask if he be not dishearten no reply john it be true i carry all my wealth in my little wallet and have only a few penny in my pocket but i have faith in god i shall yet succeed strike by he manifest sincerity the gentleman introduce he next day to a friend who take a warm interest in the temperance cause which wouldst thou prefer carpentering or try to persuade thy fellow-man to give up drinking and to become teetotaler he ask without hesitation john cassell reply : -- the work of teetotalism then thou shalt have a opportunity and i will stand thy friend john cassell now go forth as a disciple of the temperance cause remember he experience on the way to london he furnish himself with a watchman 's rattle with which he use to call together the people of the village he visit a temperance paper thus

derby john accept the invitation forthwith much to he friend 's chagrin who be bother to know what to do with he for he be under the impression that some member of the family where he expect to lodge would not give a very hearty welcome to this rough fellow this be mr whittaker 's narrative of the sequel : -- we walk together to derby that day at the meeting he speak a little and pleased the people when the meeting be over he say : -- ` can not i sleep with you ' ` well ' i say ' i have no objection but you know _ i _ be only a lodger ' however go with I he _ would _ and _ do _ that be the man when john make up he mind to do a thing he do it and to that feature in he character no doubt much of he future success may be attribute the gentleman at whose house he meet I at nottingham

the problem which many have try to solve none more successfully than john cassell at a meeting in exeter hall he suddenly put a new view before he audience i have it he exclaim the remedy be education educate the work man and woman and you have a remedy for the cry evil of the country give the people mental food and they will not thirst after the abominable drink which be poisoning they he have

multiply by the hundred thousand he never forget that he have be a work man and one of the first publication he start be call _ the work man 's friend _ it be not necessary to say more though john cassell die comparatively young -- he be only forty-eight when he death take place in 1865 -- he have do a grand life 's work and the soundness of he judgment be show by the fact that work which he plan retain they hold upon the people to this day john cassell have he ambition but they be of a very simple kind i start in life with one ambition he say and that be to have a clean shirt every day of my life this i have accomplish now for some year but i have a second ambition and that be to be a map and represent the people 's cause then i shall be public property and you may do what you like

southwark street london be a oak board on which be fix a number of brass tablet bear the name of man who be entitle to a place on this roll of honor from amongst these let we take one and tell briefly what befall he it will serve as a sample of the danger which beset the fireman daily in the pursuit of he duty joseph andrew ford so run the official record lose he life at a fire which occur at 98 gray 's inn road at about 2 be on the 7th of October 1871 ford be on duty with the fire escape station at bedford row and he be call to the fire a few minute before 2 be and proceed there with the utmost speed before he reach the fire three person have be rescue by the police who take they down from the second-floor window by means of a builder 's ladder and on he arrival there be seven person in the third floor six in the left-hand window and one in the right-hand window he pitch he escape to the left-hand window and with great difficulty and much exertion and skill succeed in get the six person out safely -lrb- the woman in the right-hand window be in the meanwhile rescue by the next escape that arrive in charge of fireman w attwood -rrb- and ford be in the act of come down himself when he become envelop in flame and smoke which burst out of the first-floor window and after some struggle in the wire net he fall to the pavement ford be evidently come down the shoot when he axe handle or some of he accoutrements become entangled in the wire net so that to clear himself he have to break through and while struggle to do so he get so severely burn that he recovery be hopeless it be a work of no ordinary skill and difficulty to save so many person in the few moment available for the purpose and when it be mention that some of they be very old and cripple it be no exaggeration to say that it would be impossible to praise too highly ford 's conduct on this occasion which have result so disastrously to himself he be thirty-one year of age when he meet he death and he leave a wife and two child to mourn he loss that be all the official record say -- simple calm straightforward -- like joseph ford 's conduct on that night i suppose that next morning two pair of bright little eye be on the watch for joseph ford and perchance four pattering foot run to the door when the knock come and that two little mind dimly realize that father have be call to a far-off country where some day they would see he and it may be that a brave woman into whose life the sunlight have shine be stricken with grief and bow down but all i know for certain be that joseph ford die in the performance of he duty he do a brave night 's work six live save from the angry flame -- old and cripple some of the terror-stricken folk be -- and he take they down so carefully so tenderly and land they all safely below he work be over he have save every life he could and glad of heart if weary of limb he turn with a thankful mind to do just the simplest thing in the world -- viz to descend the escape he have be down so many time before he be young and strong safety be only thirty foot or so below and the people be wait to welcome and cheer the victor only thirty foot between he and safety yet the man be fairly roasted in the escape man have be burn at the stake and tortured and limb have be stretch on the rack and people have be maim by thumbscrew and bootscrew and put inside iron figure with nail that tear and pierce all this have they suffer in pursuit of duty or at the bidding of conscience and of such and of brave joseph ford there come to we across the age -- a say speak long ago to the effect that he that loseth he life shall save it : and we need to remember that say in such case as that of fireman ford a blind helper of the blind the story of elizabeth gilbert a fine handsome child with flash black eye thus be elizabeth gilbert describe at she birth in 1826 but at the age of three a attack of scarlet fever deprive she of eyesight and thenceforth for upward of fifty year the beautiful thing in the world be see by she no more she parent be most anxious that she should take part in all that be go on in the household in order that she should feel she misfortune as little as possible so she live in the midst of the family circle sharing in they sport they meal and they entertainment and be treat just as one of the other yet with a special care and devotion by she father dr gilbert whose heart go out in deep love towards he little sightless daughter bessie be fond of romp game and prefer by far get a few knock and bump to be help or guide by other when she be at play she be by nature passionate yet she gradually subdue this fail she be a general favorite and when any petition have to be ask of father it be always bessie who be put forward to do it as the child know how good be she chance of be successful in she mission she be educate just like other girl except that she lesson be read to she she make great progress and be a very apt pupil in french german and other subject but arithmetic she cordially dislike imagine for a instant the drudgery of work a long division sum with leaden type and raise figure think of all the difficulty of place the figure and the chance of do the sum wrong and then it will not cause surprise that the blind girl could never enjoy arithmetic although in mental calculation she show herself later on to be very clever when she be about ten year old the duchess of kent and the princess victorium visit oxford where bessie then live with she parent on she return home bessie exclaim : oh mamma i have _ see _ the duchess of kent and she have on a brown silk dress indeed the child have such a vivid imagination that she see mentally the scene and people describe to she and so though no glimmer of light from the sun reach she the child be not dull or unhappy she listen to the bird with delight and know they song she love flower and like people to describe they to she and she be fond of make expedition to the field and meadow but as bessie grow up she begin to feel some of the sadness and loneliness natural to she lot she sister could no longer be constantly with she as in the nursery day and though she make no complaint nor speak of it to those around she yet she feel it none the less keenly by this time she father have become bishop of chichester when bessie be twenty-seven year old a idea be suggest which be the means of give she a object in life and afford she a opportunity of do a great work for the blind it be she sister mary who first speak about it have see with sorrow how change the once happy blind sister have become and longing to lighten she burden bessie listen to the fact which be set before she of the need that exist for some one to give a help hand to the blind in london she make many inquiry into the condition of the sightless and then think out a scheme for help they some of she friend consider it a great mistake for she to undertake such a mission do not work yourself to death say one of she acquaintance work to death she reply with a happy laugh i be work to life but if a few be oppose she parent brother sister and the majority of those she love be in hearty sympathy so in may 1854 bessie commence she life work seven blind man be give employment at they own home in london material be supply to they at cost price they manufacture they and receive the full price that the article be sell for this of course entail a loss but bessie have be leave a legacy by she godmother which give she a income of she own and a large portion of this she continue to devote throughout she life to help the blind a cellar be rent in new turnstile street holborn at a charge of eighteenpence a week a manager name levy be engage at a salary of half a crown a week and a commission on sale he be a blind man himself and a blind carpenter be engage to assist in make the storehouse presentable it be a small beginning certainly but it be not long ere levy 's wages be largely increase and trade begin to grow in response to miss gilbert 's effort from the cellar in holborn a move be make to a better room cost half a crown a week and then within little more than a year from the commencement a house and shop be take at a rent of # 26 a year the increase in expense as the scheme develop render it necessary to ask for public assistance by the bishop 's advice a committee be form and money collect by 1856 miss gilbert think she work far enough advance to bring it under the notice of she majesty who have ask for and receive full particulars send a very kind letter of encouragement with a donation of # 50 this gracious acknowledgment of the work in which miss gilbert be engage not only give sincere pleasure to the blind lady herself but help on she scheme immensely and the queen do more than contribute money : order for work be send from windsor castle osborne and balmoral and the blind people delighted in say that they be make broom for the queen the benefit to the blind be not confine to what miss gilbert be do herself but general interest in they welfare be excite in all part of the kingdom naturally many difficulty have to be encounter blind people apply for work who wish for alms instead and arrangement necessary for carry out so large a scheme entail a good deal of labor on miss gilbert 's part yet she be very happy in she mission which attract numerous friend occupy position of eminence miss gilbert herself give # 2000 to the association as a endowment fund and other contribute liberally too one day a strange old lady come to see she and leave with she # 500 in bank note she do not even give she name and a further gift of # 500 be receive the same year from a gentleman who feel interested in the work up to the close of she life which end in 1885 elizabeth gilbert continue to take a active interest in the affair of the association notwithstanding she own weak and fail health she labor on win the love and gratitude of the blind and accomplish a great work of which any one might feel justly proud a great traveller in the air some anecdote of jame glaisher for many year past man of science have be engage in ascend far up amongst the cloud for the purpose of find out as much as possible about the various current of air the electrical state of the atmosphere the different kind of cloud sound temperature and such matter one of the most eminent balloonist of modern time mr jame glaisher be many time in danger of lose he life whilst in pursuit of knowledge mile above the earth he first ascent be make from wolverhampton on the 17th of July 1862 it be very stormy at the time of start before he and mr coxwell get fairly off they very nearly come to grief for the balloon do not rise properly but drag the car along near the ground so that if they have come against any chimney or high building they would probably have be kill however fortunately they get clear and be soon high up above the cloud with a beautiful blue sky and the air so pleasantly warm that they need no extra clothing as be usually the case when in the upper region of the atmosphere when they be about four mile high mr glaisher find the beating of he heart become very distinct he hand and lip turn to a dark bluish color and he could hardly read the instrument between four and five mile high he feel a kind of sea sickness mr coxwell begin to think they might be get too near the wash for safety and they therefore come down quickly and reach the earth with such force that the scientific instrument be nearly all break in they descent they pass through a cloud 8000 foot -lrb- or over a mile and a half -rrb- thick on the 5th of September 1862 mr glaisher and mr coxwell make one of the most remarkable ascent in the history of balloon it nearly prove fatal to both up to the time they reach the fifth mile mr glaisher feel pretty well what happen afterwards be best describe by himself when at the height of 26000 foot i could not see the fine column of the mercury in the tube then the fine division on the scale of the instrument become invisible at that time i ask mr coxwell to help I to read the instrument as i experience a difficulty in see they in consequence of the rotary motion of the balloon which have continue without cease since the earth be leave the valve line have become twisted and he have to leave the car and to mount into the ring above to adjust it at that time i have no suspicion of other than temporary inconvenience in see shortly afterwards i lay my arm upon the table possess of its full vigor but directly after be desirous of use it i find it powerless it must have lose its power momentarily i then try to move the other arm but find it powerless also i next try to shake myself and succeed in shake my body i seem to have no leg i could only shake my body i then look at the barometer and whilst i be do so my head fall on my left shoulder i struggle and shake my body again but could not move my arm i get my head upright but for a instant only when it fall on my right shoulder and then i fall backwards my back rest against the side of the car and my head on its edge in that position my eye be direct towards mr coxwell in the ring when i shake my body i seem to have full power over the muscle of the back and considerable power over those of the neck but none over my limbsus dimly see mr coxwell in the ring and endeavor to speak but could not do so when in a instant black darkness come over I and the optic nerve lose power suddenly i be still conscious with as active a brain as whilst write this i think i have be seize with asphyxia and that i should experience no more as death would come unless we speedily descend other thought be actively enter my mind when i suddenly become unconscious as though go to sleep i could not tell anything about the sense of hear the perfect stillness of the region six mile from the earth -- and at that time we be between six and seven mile high -- be such that no sound reach the ear my last observation be make at 29000 foot whilst powerless i hear the word ` temperature ' and ` observation ' and i know mr coxwell be in the car speak to I and endeavor to rouse I and therefore consciousness and hearing have return i then hear he speak more emphatically but i could not speak or move then i hear he say ` do try now do ' then i see the instrument dimly next mr coxwell and very shortly i see clearly i rise in my seat and look round as though wake from sleep and say to mr coxwell ' i have be insensible ' he say ` yes and i too very nearly ' mr coxwell inform I that he have lose the use of he hand which be black and i pour brandy over they when mr coxwell see that mr glaisher be insensible he try to go to he but could not and he then feel insensibility come over he he become anxious to open the valve but have lose the use of he hand he could not and ultimately he do so by seize the cord with he tooth and dip he head two or three time during the journey they get to a height of 36000 or 37000 foot -- about seven mile -- that be to say two mile higher than mount everest the loftiest mountain in the world the year follow mr glaisher have a narrow escape from drown he and mr coxwell start from the crystal palace at a little past one o'clock on the 18th of April 1863 and in a hour and thirteen minute after start be 24000 foot high then they think it would be just as well to see where they be so they open the valve to let out the gas and come down a mile in three minute when at a quarter to three they be still 10000 foot high mr coxwell catch sight of beachy head and exclaim : what be that on look over the car mr glaisher find that they seem to be overhang the sea not a moment be to be lose they both cling on to the valve-line rend the balloon in two place down down down at a tremendous speed they go the earth appear to be come up to they with awful swiftness and a minute or two later with a resounding crash they strike the ground at newhaven close to the sea the balloon have be so damage that it do not drag along and though most of the instrument be smash they life be save much valuable scientific information have be obtain by mr glaisher and by those who like he have make perilous journey into cloudland the soldier with the magic

emperor of china to put down a rebellion of the taiping of so dangerous a character that it threaten to overturn the monarchy gordon have only about 3000 man chiefly chinese and notwithstanding the fact that when he take over the force it have just be demoralise by defeat he soon prove himself more than a match for the rebel horde from one victory to another he lead he man on and city fall in quick succession before he he name ere long begin to have the weight of a army in the mind of the rebel major gordon in fact have make a great mark in the chinese empire on the 30th April gordon be before the city of taitsan where three month before the same army which be now under he command have be defeat three time he man rush into the breach which the big gun have make twice they be hurl back but for a third time gordon urge they on and they confidence in he leadership be such that they go readily and this time after a swift sharp conflict the city be win european be fight both with he and with the rebel in the breach at taitsan he come across two of the man he formerly have under he command one be shoot during the assault the other cry out mr gordon mr gordon you will not let I be kill take he down to the river and shoot he say gordon aloud aside he whisper put he in my boat let the doctor attend he and send he down to shanghai he be stern and resolute enough where it be necessary but underneath all be a heart full of love and pity during this war the only weapon gordon carry be a cane and man grow to regard this stick as a kind of magic wand and gordon as a man whom nothing could harm on one occasion when he be wound he refuse to retire till he be forcibly carry off the field by the doctor 's order after he have put a end to the rebellion the emperor of china want to give he a large sum of money but gordon whose only object in fighting be to benefit the people refuse it and leave china as poor as he have enter it he have various distinction confer upon he by the emperor and the english people give he the title of chinese gordon a gold medal be present to he by the emperor gordon obliterate the inscription send it anonymously to the coventry relief fund of this incident he write at a later period : never shall i forget what i get when i score out the inscription on the gold medal how i have be repay a millionfold there be now not one thing i value in the world its honor they be false its knicknack they be perishable and useless whilst i live i value god 's blessing -- health and if you have that as far as this world go you be rich he return to england and settle down at gravesend living quite simply and work in he spare moment amongst the poor to the boy he be a hero indeed that be but natural see he not only teach they to read and write and try to get they situation but treat they as he friend in he sitting-room be a map of the world with pin stick in it mark the probable position of the ship in which he king -lrb- as he call he boy -rrb- be to be find in various part of the world thus as they move from place to place he follow they in he thought and be able to point out they whereabouts to inquire friend it be no wonder then that the urchin scrawl upon the wall of the town cg be a jolly good feller god bless the kernel he visit the hospital and workhouse and all the money he receive he expend on the poor for he believe that have give he heart to god he have no right to keep anything for himself he comfort the sick and die he teach in the ragged and Sunday school he live on the plainest food himself thus endure hardness he even give up he garden turn it into a kind of allotment for the needy he have one object in life -- to do good he view be utterly unworldly and oppose to those generally hold but they be in the main right in 1874 gordon go to egypt and at the request of the khedive undertake the position of governor-general of the soudan in the hope of be able to put down the slave trade he be beset with difficulty and wear to a shadow by incessant work and ceaseless anxiety but he would not give up in all he trial he feel the presence of god as he watch he man haul the boat up the rapid he _ pray they up _ as he use to do the troops when they waver in the breach in china once he man fail in they attack on a offend tribe and believe they have be mislead by the sheik want to punish he but gordon see the other side of the man 's character -- he be a brave patriotic man he say and i shall let he go here be he hope with terrific exertion he write in two or three year ' time i may with god 's administration make a good province -- with a good army and a fair revenue and peace and a increase trade -- also have suppress slave raid he feel it be a weary work before he for he add : then i will come home and go to bed and never get up till noon every day and never walk more than a mile no wonder he be worn and tired for he move about the soudan like a whirlwind he travel on camelback thousand of mile in four month ' time he have put down a dangerous rebellion that would have take the egyptian as many year -- if indeed they could ever have do it at all this be the kind of way in which he win he victory on one occasion with a few troops he arrive at a place call dara that great slave trader suleiman who have give sir samuel baker so much trouble be there at the head of 6000 man gordon ride into the place nearly alone and tell the commander to come and talk with he utterly take aback the man do as he be request and afterwards promise obedience it be true he do not keep he promise but after fight several battle suleiman be at length take prisoner by gordon 's lieutenant and so many be the crime and cruelty that he have commit that he be condemn to death and thus the slave of africa become rid of one of they worst oppressor -lrb- illustration : gordon statue in trafalgar square -rrb- the work begin by baker be continue with great success by gordon he estimate that in nine month he liberate 2000 slave the suffering these poor creature have go through be appalling some of they when set free have be four or five day without water in the terrible heat of that hot country every caravan route show sign of the horrible trade by the bone of those who have fall and die from exhaustion unable to keep they rank in the gang so great be the effect which the thought and sight of these suffering produce on gordon that he write in march 1879 : i declare if i could stop this traffic i would willingly be shoot this night later on he be to give he life for these people but the hour be not yet when gordon be in abyssinium king john take he prisoner bring before he majesty gordon fairly take away the breath of the monarch by go up to he place he own chair beside the king 's and tell he that he would only talk to he as a equal do you know gordon pasha say the king that i could kill you on the spot if i like i be perfectly aware of it reply gordon calmly so do it if it be you royal pleasure what ready to be kill ask the king incredulously certainly i be always ready to die answer the pasha and so far from fear you put I to death you would confer a favor on I by so do upon this he majesty give up the idea of frightening he at the end of 1879 gordon be free from the soudan for the second time in 1876 he have leave it as he think for good but as it turn out it be only for a few week ' holiday in england and then back to quell the rebellion even now it be destine that he should soon return once again and finally but during the breathing time that now come to he so far from lead a easy life or never get up till noon he be in all part of the world from china to the cape from ireland to indium still on the old mission of endeavor to do a little good wherever he be leopold ii king of the belgian who have a profound regard for gordon greatly desire that he should go out to the congo and in January 1884 he be just prepare to start in he majesty 's service when on the 17th of that month a telegram from lord wolseley arrive ask he to return to england at six o'clock next morning he be in london and the same day have receive instruction from the government he be on he way for the last time to khartoum the egyptian garrison of the soudan town be sore beset by the legion which be gather beneath the banner of the mahdus who flush with victory be threaten a eruption into lower egypt itself to extricate these garrison without bloodsh if possible be gordon 's object it be a forlorn hope still if any one man could accomplish it charle gordon be that man but ere long it be find even beyond he power for after send off a portion of the khartoum population in safety down the river the mahdus 's legion close in upon he and khartoum be in a state of siege for nearly a year he hold the city against all the force of the enemy and meantime great britain be stir with a vehement desire to save the life of this devoted man in the autumn of 1884 a force under the command of lord wolseley be send out to relieve khartoum whilst the british troops be slowly force they way up the river and across the desert khartoum be endure a death agony by January 1885 the city have be reduce to starvation donkey dog rat everything indeed in the way of flesh have be consume even boot leather the strap of native bedstead and mimosa gum do not come amiss to the sorely-tried garrison famine have produce lack of discipline on the part of some of the troops and gordon foresee well what the end must be though without a fear for himself you can read for yourself from the reproduction of the last page of he diary write on the 14th December 1884 he own estimate of the length of time he could hold out and though he manage to keep back the enemy for another month yet on the 26th January 1885 whilst yet sir charle wilson and the british troops be fight they way up the river nile to he relief khartoum fall in the early dawn of that day the mahdus assault the town in overwhelming force -- whether help by treachery be not exactly know and before he well-fed well-trained host the feeble worn-out garrison give way the wall be scale the city take and the hero who have win the affection of many nation fall amidst the people he have come to save -lrb- illustration : reduce facsimile of the last page of gordon 's diary at khartoum -rrb- it be on the whole a happy and fitting end the mind can not conceive gordon rusting out and the man live so much in the presence of god that death be a welcome visitor like lawrence he write i have try to do my duty and england confess that right nobly he have do it let those who wish to testify they love and veneration for this great man remember the gordon home for boy at chobham which be found to perpetuate he name it be situate in the midst of surrey and here be to be find over two hundred boy rescue from the street of we great city the brace life they lead in they country home soon bring the color to they cheek and the training they receive fit they for become useful citizen and valuable servant of the state most of they join the army and the gordon boy be now to be find serve the queen in every land valiant and true the story of sir richard grenville one of the most glorious of the many battle of the british navy be fight on the 10th and 11th September 1591 by vice-admiral sir richard grenville in he ship _ the revenge _ against a great fleet of spanish vessel the fight be describe by the gallant sir walter raleigh from whose account -lrb- publish in November 1591 -rrb- the fact give in the follow narrative be take if the story seem somewhat out of place amongst nineteenth century record it be nevertheless such a unique display of stubborn heroism under fire that i have not hesitate to include it on the 10th of September 1591 -lrb- 31st August old style -rrb- lord thoma howard with six of she majesty 's ship five victual ship a barque and two or three pinnace be at anchor near flore one of the westerly island of the azore when captain middleton bring the news that the spanish fleet be approach he have no sooner deliver he message than the spaniard come in sight the few ship at lord howard 's command be in a very unready state for fight many of the seaman be ill some of the ship ' company be procure ballast other get in water be so unprepared for the contest and so greatly outnumber the british ship weigh they anchor and set sail the last ship to get under weigh be _ the revenge _ as sir richard wait for the man leave on the island who would have otherwise be capture the master of the ship want he to cut he mainsail and cast about and to trust to the sailing of he ship but sir richard utterly refuse to turn from the enemy say that he would rather choose to die than dishonor himself he country and she majesty 's ship and inform he company that he would pass through the two squadron in spite of they he might possibly have be able to carry out he plan but the huge _ san philip _ a immense vessel of 1500 ton come towards he as he be engage other ship of the fleet becalm he sail and then board he whilst thus entangled with the _ san philip _ four other ship also board _ the revenge _ the fight thus begin at three of the clocke in the after noone say sir walter raleigh continue verie terrible all that evening before long the _ san philip _ have receive the fire of _ the revenge _ at close quarter shift herself with all diligence utterly mislike she first entertainment the spanish ship have a great number of soldier on board in some case two hundred in other five and in some even eight hundred whilst on _ the revenge _ there be in all only one hundred and ninety person of whom ninety be sick after discharge they gun the spanish ship endeavor to board _ the revenge _ but notwithstanding the multitude of they armed man they be repulse again and again and drive back either into they ship or into the sea after the battle have last well into the night many of the british be slay or wound whilst two spanish ship have be sink a hour before midnight sir richard grenville be shoot in the body and a little later be wound in the head whilst the doctor who be attend he be kill the company on board _ the revenge _ be gradually get less and less the spanish ship meanwhile as they receive a sufficient evidence of _ the revenge 's _ power of destruction drop off and they place be take by other and thus it happen that ere the morning fifteen ship have be engage and all be so little pleased with the entertainment provide that they be far more willing to listen to proposal for a honorable arrangement than to make any more assault as lord tennyson write : -- and the sun go down and the star come out far over the summer sea but never a moment cease the fight of the one and the fifty-three ship after ship the whole night long they high-built galleon come ship after ship the whole night long with she battle-thunder and flame ship after ship the whole night long draw back with she dead and she shame for some be sink and many be shatter would and so could fight we no more -- god of battle be ever a battle like this in the world before _ the revenge _ have by this time spend she last barrel of gunpowder all she pike be break forty of she best man slay and most of the remainder wound for she brave defender there be now no hope -- no powder no weapon the mast all beaten overboard all she tackle cut asunder she deck batter nothing leave overhead for flight or below for defense sir richard finding himself in this condition after fifteen hour ' hard fighting and have receive about eight hundred shot from great gun besides various assault from the enemy and see moreover no way by which he might prevent he ship fall into the hand of the spanish command the master gunner whom he know be a most resolute man to split and sink the ship he do this that thereby nothing might remain of glory or victory to the spaniard : see that in so many hour ' fight and with so great a navy they be not able to take she though they have fifteen hour in which to do so and moreover have 15000 man and fifty-three ship of war against he single vessel of five hundred ton he endeavor to persuade he man to yield themselves to god and to the mercy of none else that as they have repulse so many enemy they should not shorten the honor of they nation by prolong they life by a few hour or day the captain and master could not however see the matter in this light and besought sir richard to have a care of they declare that the spaniard would be ready to treat with they and that as there be a number of gallant man yet live whose wound be not mortal they might do they country and prince acceptable service hereafter they also point out that as _ the revenge _ have six foot of water in the hold and three shot under water but weakly stop she must need sink in the first heavy sea which indeed happen a few day later but sir richard refuse to be guide by such counsel whilst however the dispute be go on the master of _ the revenge _ open communication with the spaniard and conclude a arrangement fully honorable to the british by which it be agree that those on board _ the revenge _ should be send to england in due course those of the better sort to pay a reasonable ransom and meantime no one be to be imprison the commander of the spanish fleet agree to this readily not only because -lrb- know the disposition of he adversary -rrb- he fear further loss to he own side by prolong the fight but because he greatly admire the valor of sir richard grenville and desire to save he life the master gunner finding sir richard and himself alone in they way of think would have slay himself rather than fall into the hand of the enemy but be forcibly prevent from carry out he intention and lock in he cabin be send for by don alfonso bassan the spanish commander sir richard make no objection to go answer that he might do as he please with he body for he esteem it not as he be be carry out of the ship he swoon and revive again desire the company to pray for he though the spaniard treat sir richard with every care and consideration he die the second or third day after the fight deeply lament both by the enemy and by he own man here die i richard grenville say he with a joyful and quiet mind for that i have end my life as a true soldier ought to do that have fight for he country queen religion and honor whereby my soul most joyfully departeth out of this body and shall always leave behind it a everlasting fame of a valiant and true soldier that have do he duty as he be bind to do the reason the other british ship do not take part in the contest be that it be altogether hopeless and that have the admiral order it the entire fleet would probably have fall into the hand of the spaniard see that they so greatly outnumber the british ship six small ship ill supply with fight man against fifty-three bigger one fill with soldier be too great a disparity of force to give even a hope of victory and although lord howard would himself have go into battle even against such odds as that yet the other commander be greatly oppose to so rash a enterprise and the master of he own ship say he would rather jump into the sea than conduct she majesty 's ship and the rest to be a prey to the enemy hence it be that _ the revenge _ fight alone on that September day the entire spanish fleet and have give we one of the most glorious page in the annals of we national history one who leave all the story of bishop hannington fancy hannington of all person in the world turn missionary and go out to preach the gospel to the black it be well-nigh incredible at first thought that such a light-hearted rollicking jovial fellow could have give up _ everything _ for such a work as that he have plenty of money host of friend wife child any amount of useful work to do at home -- everything in fact that can make life worth live what could possibly make such a man as that go into the wild of africa to be torment tortured and slay by savage i will try and show briefly how it come about at school hannington be the veriest pickle and be nickname mad jim on one occasion he light a bonfire in he dormitory he pelt the german master with reject examination papers and in a single day be cane over a dozen time yet he fight the bully and keep he word he be brave honest and manly and be a great favorite when about fifteen year old he be put into he father 's business at

hannington preserve he reputation for fun and love of adventure at oxford he take part in practical joke innumerable at martinhoe cliff-climbing and adventurous scramble occupy some little of he time one day he go with two companion to explore a cave call the eye adjoining this they discover a narrow hole lead to a further cave which be below high-water mark into this with great exertion jim manage to squeeze himself it be quite dark inside and whilst he be describe it to he companion they suddenly notice that the tide be fast come in and implore he to get out of he perilous position at once easier say than do the difficulty he have find in get in be a trifle compare with the passage out he try head first then foot first and whilst he friend tug he squeeze it be of no use the sea have almost reach he and drown seem certain then quite hopeless of escape he bid he companion good-bye all at once it occur to he to try take off he clothes this make just the difference require and with a tremendous effort he get out of he prison-house in the very nick of time a little later come a important entry in he diary : -- open a correspondence with I to-day which i speak of as delightful it lead to my conversion thereafter follow a change in hannington 's life -- he pray more it seem that about this time a college friend begin to think much of he and to pray earnestly for he and finally write to he a serious simple earnest letter which have much effect on hannington the letter be unanswered for over a year but come at a time when the man of twenty-five be begin to find that there be better thing to be do in life than cliff-climbing in the country or give pleasant party at oxford it work its purpose and form the first step towards the new life have spend some time in study hannington go up for he ordination examination he do very well the first day the second he be ill and could do nothing the third the same and when he be dismiss by the bishop he be in a state akin to despair the next examination be better but he be nervous and find he mind at time a hopeless blank he pass but not in such a way as he desire at the examination for priest 's order he come out at the top of the list the first portion of he life as a curate do not seem to point to he make any mark upon he devonshire flock he audience be sleepy and pay little attention to he sermon one day he

central africa from this time he become draw towards mission work in that district it be not however till the year 1882 that he finally enter into arrangement with the church missionary society to go to africa they high estimation of he capacity may be gather from the fact that he be appoint as leader of the expedition which be be send out it be a horrible wrench at last to leave wife and child my most bitter trial he write -- a agony that still cleave to I -- be say good-bye to the little one thank god the pain be all on one side ` come back soon papa ' they cry he wife have resolutely make up she mind to give he to god and be brave to the last when at length the ship leave england i watch and watch the retreat tow-boat he continue until i could see it no longer and then hurry down below

and after visit palestine to confirm the church there he arrive in frere town on the west coast of africa in January 1885 and spend several month of useful work in organise by July 1885 he be ready to

comfort by 28th psalm a man who conquer disappointment the story of sir henry havelock he be nickname phlo -- short for philosopher -- even when at school havelock and a few companion at charterhouse meet together for devotion and of course come in for a large amount of jeer from some of the other boy but it be useless to call he methodist and hypocrite he have learn from he mother the value of bible read and possess sufficient character to care little what he companion say he know the right and do it -- thus early he be a philosopher in a small way it have be intend that havelock should follow the law as a profession and he be study with this end in view when he father stop the necessary supplies of money and he have to turn to some other occupation for a living he have always have a lean towards a military life and by he brother 's aid obtain a commission as second lieutenant in 1815 be then twenty year old unlike colin campbell who be in the thick of the fight within a few month of join he regiment it be some year before havelock have a chance of distinguish himself but meantime he set to work to study military history and tactic both ancient and modern not content with this he learn persian and hindostanee and thus when he go to india in 1823 he be equip as few young man of he day be havelock 's faith strong though it be have to undergo a time of severe trial doubt arise in he mind and make he miserable while they last but on board ship he come across lieut gardner to whom with other he be give lesson in language and as a result of he intercourse with this man he

religious meeting to which the soldier be invite at these not only do he preach the gospel of christ but he make a point of tell the man the blessing of temperance and it be by he influence that later on a society be form in the regiment and various attraction be place before the man to keep they from intemperance now come the chance of active service for which he have be longing a expedition be plan against the burmese and havelock be one of the member but a great disappointment be in store for he the ship in which he sail be delay and do not arrive at rangoon till the town be take still though there be no glory to be gain there be much good work to be do in look after he man 's comfort and well-being and this he do to the utmost of he power he also hold simple service such as the man could appreciate in one of the buddhist temple though there be not a great deal of fight to do there be great loss of man through disease and havelock himself be ere long so ill that he be tell a voyage to england be the only thing to save he life this however he object to and after a stay at bombay he be sufficiently restore to rejoin he regiment during this war a night attack be make by the enemy on a outpost and the man order to repulse it be not ready when summon then call out havelock 's saint say the commander-in-chief they be always sober and can be depend upon and havelock himself be always ready and surely enough havelock 's saint be among the enemy in double quick time and soon give they as much steel and lead as they have any wish for every inch a soldier and every inch a christian -- that be a exact description of this man even the day he get marry to hannah marshman the missionary 's daughter he show that he be a soldier before all else for have be suddenly summon to attend a military court of inquiry at twelve o'clock on he wedding day he get marry at a earlier hour than he have previously arrange take a quick boat to calcutta return to he bride when he business of the day be finish time pass on and the leader of the saint be still but a junior lieutenant though he have be seventeen year in the army thrice be he hope of promotion raise and thrice doom to disappointment still he murmur not i have only two wish he would say i pray that in life and death i may glorify god and that my wife and child may be provide for heavy trial befel he death lay its hand on he little boy ettrick and another child be so burnt in a fire that happen at they bungalow that he die also whilst he beloved wife narrowly escape the same fate yet he bear all this with patience stern commander though he be he man love he so much that they want to give he a month of they pay to assist he in the loss of means occasion by the fire though they offer be refuse yet havelock could not but be thankful for the kind feeling which prompt it at length after over twenty year ' service he become a captain in the afghan war havelock be with general sale at jellalabad at the time that dr brydon bring the news of the massacre of we man by the afghan and during the anxious time that follow he be able to render good service in the field and at the council table he fight

troops be fast shut up around they a vast multitude of mutineer but now near at hand be sir colin campbell with the army of relief it be difficult nay almost impossible to get a trusty messenger through that multitude of fierce and bloodthirsty foe and yet it be of the utmost importance that sir colin should have some one to tell he what be pass within the residency and show he the best route by which he troops could approach if any man try to get through and fail death -- or perhaps worse still horrible torture -- be he certain fate but there be one man who determine to do it or die in the attempt he name be kavanagh it be so dangerous a matter that when sir jame outram hear of he proposal he declare he would not have ask one of he officer to attempt the passage but in the end he accept the offer and kavanagh prepare for the journey dress himself as a native soldier and cover he face and hand with lampblack he be so altered in appearance that even he friend fail to recognize he thus disguise and accompany by a native spy name kunoujee lal to guide he he set out the night fortunately be dark and favor they design the first thing they do be to ford the goomtee a river about a hundred yard wide and four or five foot deep take off they garment they wade across but whilst in the water kavanagh 's courage reach a low ebb and he wish himself back again however they get to the opposite bank in safety and crouch up a ditch find a grove of tree where they dress kavanagh 's confidence have now return and he feel so sure of he disguise that he even exchange a few word with a matchlock-man whom they meet after go on for about half a mile they reach the iron bridge over the river and here they be challenge by a native officer kavanagh keep judiciously in the shade whilst the guide advance and answer the question put to he satisfactorily and they be allow to proceed a little further they pass through a number of sepoy but these let they go by without inquiry have have the good fortune to get unperceived past a sentry who be closely question a native they come into the principal street of lucknow jostle against the armed rebel who would have kill they in a moment have they suspicion be arouse but no mishap occur and after be challenge by a watchman they at last find themselves to they great relief out in the open country they be now in the best of spirit and go along for a few mile in a state of great gladness then come a rude shock they have take the wrong direction and be return into the midst of the rebel it be a awful awakening for kavanagh suppose the spy after all be play he false it seem a extraordinary mistake to have make happily it be stupidity not treason that have cause the disastrous loss of time and the guide be full of sorrow for he error there be nothing now to be do but to return as quickly as possible but they be for a while in a awkward fix as they could get no one to direct they a man whom they ask declare he be too old to guide they another on be command to lead they run off shout and alarm the village it be now midnight so there be no time to be lose they make for the canal into which kavanagh fall several time for he shoe be wet and slippery and he be footsore and weary by this time the shoe he wear have rub the skin off he toe and cut into the flesh above the heel about two o'clock in the morning they come across a picket of sepoy and think it safer not to try and avoid they go up and ask the way have answer the inquiry put to they without exciting suspicion they be direct aright they now make for sir colin 's camp which the spy tell he be situate at a village call bunnee about eighteen mile from lucknow the moon have rise by this time and they could now see they way clearly about three o'clock a villager observe they approach call out a sepoy guard of twenty-five man who ask they all kind of question kunoujee lal now get frighten for the first time and throw away the letter he have receive for fear of be take but kavanagh keep he in he turban at last they satisfy the guard that they be poor man travel to the village of umroolum to inform a friend of the death of he brother and they be direct on they perilous road hardly have they get through one difficulty than they be into another for now they find themselves in a swamp where they wade for two hour up to they waist in water this might have prove the worst accident of all for in force he way through the weed nearly all the black be wash off kavanagh 's hand have they after this be see by the enemy there would have be little chance of either of they reach the british line alive much against the spy 's advice kavanagh now insist on a quarter of a hour 's rest for he be about wear out after this they pass between two of the enemy 's picket who happily for they have no sentry throw out and reach a grove of tree here he ask kunoujee lal to see if there be any one who could tell they where they be before they have go far however they hear with joy the english challenge who go there they have reach a british cavalry outpost and kavanagh 's eye fill with tear as he shake the officer 's hand they take he into a tent give he some dry clothes and refreshment and he thank god for have preserve he through the peril of that awful night all through the british camp spread the tale of kavanagh 's brave deed and the enthusiasm of officer and man alike know no bound the information he be able to give prove of the greatest assistance and a little later he have the honor of conduct sir jame outram and sir henry havelock into the presence of sir colin campbell and witness the meeting of these three great commander when the army of relief force its way into lucknow kavanagh be always near the commander-in-chief and when at length they draw near to the besiege he be one of the first at the residency and as he approach a loud cheer burst forth from he old associate it be kavanagh they shout he be the first to relieve we

with the sofa have be close it be no easy task to perform the man have to cut they way through a dense jungle this be heavy and tiring work and owe to the fact that for a month past they have be oblige to exist on a small quantity of rice they be not in the best condition to undertake such labor however so as to get the road finish as quickly as possible they work from sunrise to sunset even the night slide not bring they rest and peace for the rain descend in such a manner as to add to the discomfort of they situation on the 4th of November the force arrive at the sell or roquelle river the stream be eighty yard wide there be no bridge over it but only a creeper rope tie across from bank to bank the river be very full and a swift current be run two hundred yard below the noise of fall sound a warning note and it be know that alligator infested the district no wonder then that the native be terrify at the idea of attempt to swim across yet the river lay between captain lendy 's force and the food and rest it need so though owe to the privation the man have endure they vital power be at a low ebb yet with starvation stare they in the face they must make the passage --

for he to get along alone and with bangura to support he quickly become exhaust after shout for help he and he companion disappear from view beneath the water at once two other man go to bangura 's assistance give smith a opportunity of look to he own safety but it seem a hopeless struggle worn by they previous exertion the man be unable to give any permanent help to bangura and be in they turn

predicament four man be struggle in the seething water in deadly danger too brave and resolute to leave they comrade-in-arm too feeble to procure he safety they be wear out they strength in futile though heroic effort whilst the object of they solicitude be at he last gasp at this moment they brave commander come to the rescue and at once change the aspect of affair diving into the stream he soon reach the drown man and the other release from they burden be now able to give they undivided attention to self-preservation the supreme moment have arrive would captain lendy 's effort end as the other have do if so it be probable that all would have find a watery grave in the roquelle for exhaust though they be the three other man be far too fond of they commander to have leave he to perish alone it be for a time a stern fight with death but lendy be cool calm resourceful yard by yard the distance between the further shore be lessen notwithstanding the race of the water toward the fall foot by foot he draw nearer to safety though the man lay like a log in the grasp of he rescuer unable to assist in the struggle that be go on at length the shadow of death be dissipate for the gallant soldier manage to land he burden on the further shore which the other have already reach the end of the stern combat with the water be particularly gratifying as several man have previously lose they life in cross the same river the silver medal of the royal geographical society be award to captain lendy and a bronze medal give to he brave follower but alas lendy do not live to receive

people come to the missionary and tell he they be determine that he must go but moffat be not to be awed by the threat of the warrior he tell they that they might kill he but he should certainly not be drive away then the chief and he follower give up the contest and retire full of wonder and admiration at he dauntless determination once whilst moffat be away on a visit to a neighbouring tribe he wife be arouse in the night by the report that a hostile tribe have invade they territory and be close upon they so mr moffat have to prepare for flight but ere she have finish she preparation the

a little later he say kiss I hardy hardy knelt down and nelson say now i be satisfied thank god i have do my duty after that it become difficult for he to speak but he several time repeat the word

break the naval power of france and spain and deliver great britain from all fear of attack by the great napoleon a woman who succeed by failure the story of harriet newell this be rather a exceptional chapter : for it tell of a very little life judge by length of day a very sad life judge by some of its incident a very futile life consider by what it actually accomplish -- but a very wonderful life regard in the light of the result which follow harriet attwood be bear in massachusett america in the year 1793 even in she girlhood she look forward to assist in make the gospel know in distant land long before any movement spring up in america for send out female missionary to the heathen the day dream of this little girl be to devote herself to the mission cause not that she dream away she life in longing and neglect she every-day duty she be remarkable for she intelligence and dutiful conduct and from the age of ten feel deep religious conviction and be constant in she daily prayer and bible read she life be brighten by she belief and she ever keep in view what she believe to be she mission in life what can i do she write that the light of the gospel may shine upon the heathen they be perish for lack of knowledge while i enjoy the glorious privilege of a christian land the means of accomplish she desire soon come a young missionary name newell who be go out to indium ask she to become he wife she decision be not take without earnest prayer and have she parent oppose she wish she would have be prepare to give they up but gain they consent she accept mr newell 's offer she be fully aware that the difficulty in the way would be very great for up to that time no female missionary have go from america to the mission field at first she friend try in every way to dissuade she from leave home and as they term it throw herself away on the heathen but she simplicity of belief and earnestness of purpose soon change they thought on the subject and when early in the year 1812 mr and mr newell sail for calcutta many come together to wish they god-speed on they perilous journey on he arrival in calcutta mr newell in accordance with the regulation of the east indium company at that time report himself at the police office and to he sorrow find that the company would not allow any missionary to work in they dominion here be a disappointing beginning for these earnest young people at first it seem quite probable they would not even be allow to land and though permission be after a time obtain yet in six week they be tell they must go elsewhere as they would not be permit to settle a few day later however the prospect brighten we have obtain leave write mr newell to go to the isle of france -lrb- mauritius -rrb- we hear that the english governor there favor mission that a large field of usefulness be there open -- 18000 inhabitant ignorant of jesus be not this the station that providence have design for we a door be open wide shall we not enter and help the glorious work but it be by she influence alone that she be permit to engage in the work she heart long for on the journey to mauritius rapid consumption set in and day by day she become weaker although she feel at first a natural disappointment that she would not be allow to labor in the mission field she be able to look upward in she hour of trial and to say : tell my friend i never regret leave my native land for the cause of christ god have call I away before we have enter on the work of the mission but the case of david afford I comfort i have it in my heart to do what i can for the heathen and i hope god will accept I on the 30th November 1812 at the early age of nineteen harriet newell pass away might not many a one justly ask be not she life a failure and the answer base on the experience and result of what she life and death accomplish be no -- emphatically no for she example produce a wave of religious life and missionary enthusiasm in america the like of which have hardly ever be know the very fact of this whole-hearted girl give up she life for the cause of christ and the pathos of she untimely end do more to touch the heart of multitude than perhaps the most apparently successful accomplishment of she mission would have do a martyr of the south sea the morning and evening of bishop patteson 's life john coleridge patteson be bear in April 1827 he be bless with a upright and good father and a loving and gentle mother and thus he early training be calculate to make he the earnest christian man he afterwards become here be a extract from a letter write from school at the age of nine which show that he have fault and failing to overcome just like all other boy : -- my dear papa i be very sorry for have tell so many falsehood which uncle frank have tell mama of i be very sorry for have do so many bad thing -- i mean falsehood -- and i heartily beg you pardon and uncle frank say that he think if i stay in a month 's time mr cornish will be able to trust I again he tell I that if i ever tell another falsehood he should that instant march I into the school and ask mr cornish to strip and birch I but i will not catch the birching and he do not he be so frank so ready to see he own fault that he be always a favorite uncle frank remark of he at this same time : he win one 's heart in a moment perhaps one ought to call he a queen 's missionary for she majesty save he from a serious accident in a rather remarkable manner in 1838 when the queen be drive in she carriage the crowd be so dense that patteson then at school at eton become entangled in the wheel of the carriage and would have be throw underneath and run over have it not be for the young queen 's quick perception see the danger she give she hand to the boy who readily seize it and be thus able to get on he foot again and avoid the threaten peril he be a boy who when he have do wrong always blame himself -- not any one else thus when he be twelve have spend a good deal of he time one term at eton enjoy cricket and boat he find he tutor be not at all satisfy with he progress i be ashamed to say he remark in write home that i can offer not the slightest excuse : my conduct on this occasion have be very bad i expect a severe reproof from you and pray do not send I any money but from this time i be determine i will not lose a moment in 1841 come the first indication of what he future career might be bishop selwyn of new zealand be preach and the boy say of the sermon : it be beautiful when he talk of he go out to find a church and then to die neglect and forget how deep have be the influence on he mind of he mother 's example may be gather from the letter he write at the time of she death in 1842 when he be fifteen year old : it be a very dreadful loss for we all but we have be teach by that dear mother who have now be take from we that it be not fit to grieve for those who die in the lord ` for they rest from they labor ' she say once ' i wonder i wish to leave you my dearest john and the child and this sweet place but yet i do wish it ' so lovely be she faith in 1854 bishop selwyn return to england during the time that have elapse since he previous visit patteson have be ordain the bishop stay with he father a few day and during that time the feeling which the boy of fourteen have experience be revive in the man of twenty-seven and with he father 's consent john coleridge patteson enter upon he life work sailing with bishop selwyn for the south sea in march 1855 there he labor with such energy and success that in 1861 he be consecrate bishop many thousand of mile be traverse by he in the mission ship _ the southern cross _ visit the numerous island of the pacific know as polynesium or melanesium of the danger that abound he know ample to try he courage on arrive at erromanga -lrb- the scene of william ' martyrdom -rrb- on one occasion he find that mr gordon the missionary and he wife have recently both be treacherously slay by the native at another island as he return to the boat he see one of the native draw a bow with the apparent intention of shoot he and then unbend it at the entreaty of he comrade but remark the bishop in record this we must try to effect more frequent landing and thus full of faith he labor on tell the people of these scatter island which besprinkle the southern ocean like star in the milky way of the love of christ he be still ready to condemn himself just as he do in he early day from norfolk island in 1870 he write to he sister when he be hold a ordination : at such time as these when one be specially engage in solemn work there be much heart search and i can not tell you how my conscience accuse I of such systematic selfishness during many long year -- i mean i see how i be all along make self the center and neglect all kind of duty -- social and other -- in consequence he be much grieve by the account which reach he of the terrible war which be be fight between france and germany in 1870 what can i say he write to my melanesian about it do these nation believe in the gospel of peace and goodwill be the sermon on the mount a reality or not yet he have trouble closer at home than this even the trading ship be come in number to the island and carry off the native either by guile or by force to fijus and other place where labourer be wanted notwithstanding the anxiety which beset he on this account the good bishop continue to work as hard as ever and very happy he be about he people on christmas eve 1870 he write : seven new communicant to-morrow morning and all thing god be praise happy and peaceful about we he write of the large family of 145 melanesian native he have around he at another time he speak of he sleep on a table with some twelve or more fellow about he and people come and go all day long both in and out of school hour in August 1871 he baptise 248 person twenty-five of they adult all in a little more than a month and he rejoice in the thought that a bless change be go on in the heart of these people he have never experience such cheer success before and though he friend be endeavor to persuade he to take rest and change for he health 's sake he determine to labor on while there be so much need for he exertion and such bless result follow the desire to believe on the part of some of he people be very touching one of they say to he : i do not know how to pray properly but i and my wife say ` god make we heart light -- take away the darkness we believe that you love we because you send jesus to become a man and die for we but we can not understand it all make we fit to be baptise ' some of course be not so enlighten as that after the kidnapping trader have be harry the island one of the chief say that if the bishop would only bring a man-of-war and get he vengeance on he adversary he would be exalt like he father above there be indeed serious cause for the anger of the native one of they related how he have be out to a vessel with he companion and a white man have come down into the canoe and presently upset it seize he by the belt happily this break and he swim under the side of the canoe and finally get on shore but the other three be kill -- they head be cut off and take on board and they body throw to the shark the assailant be men-stealer who kill ruthlessly that they might present head to the chief five native from the same island be also kill or carry off and thus when the bishop visit they they be in a state of sullen wrath on the 20th of September 1871 bishop patteson come to nukapu the island be difficult of approach at low water and the little ship _ the southern cross _ could not get close in so the bishop go off to the shore in a boat and get into one of the canoe leave he four pupil to await he return they see he land and he be then lose to sight about half a hour later the native in the canoe without the least warning begin shoot they arrow at the poor fellow in the boat and ere it could be take out of bowshot one of they be pierce with six arrow and two of the other be also wound they be full of fear about the bishop and notwithstanding the danger determine to seek for he they have no arm except one pistol which the mate possess as they make they way towards shore a canoe drift out and lie in it wrap in a native mat be the body of bishop patteson a sweet calm smile be on he face a palm leaf be fasten upon he breast and upon the body be five wound -- the exact number of the native who have be kidnap or kill so the good bishop die for the misdeed of other the native but follow they tradition in exact blood for blood and they poor dark mind could not distinguish between the good and the bad white man two of those who be with the bishop in the boat and have receive arrow wound die within a week after much suffer one of they mr atkin writing of the occurrence on the day of the martyrdom say : -- it would be selfish to wish he back he have go to he rest die as he live in the master 's service it seem a shocking way to die but i can say from experience it be far more to hear of than to suffer there be no sign of fear or pain on he face just the look that he use to have when asleep patient and a little wearied what he mission will do without he god only know who have take he away three day after in celebrate the holy communion mr atkin stumble in he speech and then he and he companion know the poison in he system be work stephen and i he say be go to follow the bishop do not grieve about it it be very good because god would have it so because he only look after we and he understand about we and now he will to take we too and _ it be well _ kg and coster some anecdote about lord shaftesbury and where shall we write to ask one of the costermonger address you letter to I at grosvenor square reply lord shaftesbury and it will probably reach I but if after my name you put ` kg and coster ' there will be no doubt that i shall get it this conversation take place at the conclusion of a meeting which have be hold by the costermonger they have meet to talk about they grievance and lord shaftesbury have attend the gathering and promise to help they tell they to write to he if they require further assistance the noble knight of the garter be not only interested in the costermonger themselves but in they animal too at one time the coster have use they donkey and pony shamefully have overwork and underfeed they but gradually they be make to see how much better it be to treat they animal well with a good Sunday rest and proper treatment the donkey would go thirty mile a day comfortably without it they could not do more than half so as lord shaftesbury have be kind to the coster and take such interest in they pursuit they invite he to a special meeting at which they present he with a splendid donkey over a thousand coster with they friend be there when the donkey profusely decorate with ribbon be lead to the platform lord shaftesbury vacate the chair and make way for the new arrival and then put he arm round the animal 's neck return thanks in a short speech in which he say : -- when i have pass away from this life i desire to have no more say of I than that i have do my duty as the poor donkey have do he -- with patience and unmurmuring resignation the donkey be then lead down the step of the platform and lord shaftesbury remark i hope the reporter of the press will state that the donkey have vacate the chair the place be take by lord shaftesbury let we turn for a moment to the beginning of he life and see how it be that lord shaftesbury be induce to devote himself so heartily to the good of the poor and oppressed marium mill he old nurse have not a little to do with this she be one of those simple-minded humble christian who all unknowingly plant in many mind the good seed which grow up and bring forth much fruit -lrb- illustration : lord shaftesbury inspect the coster ' donkey -rrb- she be very fond of the little boy and would tell he the sweet story of old in so attractive a manner that a deep impression be make upon he heart the prayer she teach he in childhood he not only use in he youth but even in old age the word be often upon he lip when he be a schoolboy at harrow come the turn point in he life he see four or five drunken man carry a coffin contain the remains of a companion and such be they state of intoxication that they drop it and then break out into foul language the effect this have upon the youth be so great that he resolve to devote he life to help the poor and friendless there be plenty of work for he to do child in factory and mine require to be protect from the cruelty to which they be subject chimney sweep need to be guard from the danger to which they be expose the hour of labor in factory be excessive thief require to be show a way of escape from they wretched life ragged school and other institution need support these and numerous other matter keep lord shaftesbury hard at work during the entire of he long life and by he help many wise alteration be make in the law of the country do what be right and trust to providence for the rest be he motto and he stick to it always lord shaftesbury bring before parliament a scheme for assist young thief to emigrate and the grown-up burglar and vagabond see how much in earnest he be invite he to a meeting to this he go without a moment 's hesitation the door be guard by a detachment of thief who watch to see that none but those of they class go in lord shaftesbury be in the chair and the meeting commence with prayer there be present over two hundred burglar and criminal of the worst kind besides a great number of other bad character first of all the chairman give a address then some of the thief follow tell quite plainly and simply how they spend they life when lord shaftesbury urge they to give up they old life of sin one of they say we must steal or we shall die the city missionary who be present urge they to pray as god could help they but say one of the man my lord and gentleman of the jury -lrb- -rrb- prayer be very good but it will not fill a empty stomach it be indeed a difficult problem how best to aid the poor fellow but lord shaftesbury solve it as a result of the conference three hundred thief go abroad to canada to begin life anew or be put into the way of earn a honest live one of the subject which occupy a great deal of lord shaftesbury 's attention be the condition of the young in coal mine and factory at that date child begin to work in mine at the age of four or five and large number of girl and boy be labor in the pit by the time they be eight for twelve or fourteen hour a day these poor little toiler have to sit in the mine open and shut trap door as the coal be push along in barrow all alone with no one to speak to sit in a damp stifle atmosphere the poor child have to stay day after day and if they go to sleep they get well beat rat and mouse be they only companion and Sunday be the only day on which they be gladden by the daylight it be a shocking state of existence nor do it grow better as the child get older then they have to drag heavy load along the floor of the mine when the passage be narrow the boy and girl have a girdle fasten round they waist a chain be fix to this and pass between they leg and hook to the carriage then crawl on hand and knee through the filth and mire they pull these truck as cattle would drag they whilst they back be bruise and wound by knock against the low roof girl and woman be make to carry heavy weight of coal child stand ankle deep in water pump hour after hour and they work be sometimes prolong for thirty-six hour continuously so that it be no wonder the child die early that they suffer much from disease and lead cheerless wretched life against such cruelty lord shaftesbury be constantly war and he warfare be not in vain quite as badly off be the little chimney sweep boy be kidnap and sell to cruel master who force they to climb high chimney fill with soot and smoke if they refuse a fire be perhaps light below and they would thus be force to ascend the consequence be that many terrible accident happen result in the death of these poor little fellow whilst number die early from disease lord shaftesbury rouse the country to a sense of the wrong that be be do to the chimney sweep and bill be pass in parliament for they protection not only child but man and woman also need to be defend from wrong and overwork lord shaftesbury visit the factory to see how the labourer be actually treat and this be one of the thing that come under he notice a young woman whilst work in a mill at stockport be catch by the machinery and badly injure when the accident happen she have not complete she week 's work so eighteenpence be deduct from she wages horrify at such treatment lord shaftesbury bring a action against the owner of the factory and obtain # 100 for the woman for shorter hour and better treatment of factory hand the earl struggle in and out of parliament and though the battle be long and fierce it end in victory such labor take up much time and bring many expense to the good earl it bring he too plenty of enemy for most of he life be devote to strive to make the rich and selfish do justice to the poor and downcast he not only give he time but he money too and oftentimes though the eldest son of a earl and later a earl himself he hardly know where to turn for the means to keep he scheme go one day a lady call on he and tell a piteous tale of a polish refugee ask he for help lord shaftesbury have to confess he have no money he could give then he suddenly remember he have five pound in the library : he fetch the bank note which form he nest egg and present it to she one of lord shaftesbury 's greatest work be the promotion of ragged school to these school establish in the poorest neighborhood of the metropolis come the street arab the poor and abandon and receive kindness and teaching which comfort and civilised they the outcast who sleep in doorway under arch and in all kind of horrible and unhealthy place be the object of this good man 's care and way be find of benefit and start afresh hundred of lad who would otherwise have become thief or vagabond in the great city when he be over eighty year old he be still strive for the good of other so much be he heart in the work that he remark on one occasion : when i feel age creep on I and know i must soon die -- i hope it be not wrong to say it -- but i can not bear to leave the world with all the misery in it the dawn come for he in October 1885 when in he eighty-fifth year this veteran leader be call to he rest for convenience i have speak of he throughout as lord shaftesbury but it may be well to mention that till he be fifty year old he be know as lord ashley through the death of he father he become earl of shaftesbury in 1851 a statesman who have no enemy the story of wh smith it be always well to remember that the man who serve he country as a good citizen as a soldier as a statesman or in any other walk of life deserve we admiration as much as the missionary or the minister of the gospel -- each and all such be servant of the great king by far the greater portion of we life be spend at the desk or the counter in the office shop or field so that it be of the first importance we should keep the strictest watch on we action in we work as well as in we leisure moment one of the most successful man in commerce and politics of the century be mr wh smith strange to say the desire of he early day be entirely oppose to business life at the age of sixteen he greatly desire to proceed to one of the university and prepare for become a clergyman but he parent be oppose to such a step he give up the idea in deference to they wish it be a great disappointment to he to do this -- yet he be able to write it be my duty to acknowledge a overrule and direct providence in all the very minutest thing by be in whatever state i be therewith content my conclusion be then that i be at present pursue the path of duty however imperfectly wherever it may lead or what it may become i know not thus do william henry smith see the door of the church close upon he with no vain regret but in a spirit of submission to he father 's wish write of these day many year later when as a minister of the crown he be in attendance upon she majesty at balmoral he say : i think my life be aimless purposeless and i want something else to do but event compel I to what promise to be a dull life and a useless one : the result be that few man have have more interesting work to do in he earlier year wh smith make a list of subject for daily prayer embrace repentance faith love grace to help gratitude power to pray constant direction in all thing a right understanding of the bible deliverance from beset sin constancy in god 's service relative and friend missionary pardon for all ignorance and sin in prayer etc etc and it be one of the characteristic of he nature that he feel prayer both in youth and age to be _ a necessity _ it be a busy life in which smith be launch at the commencement of he career he father have already lay the foundation of the newsagency business which be now of world-wide fame every week-day morning summer and winter throughout the year sunshine or rain fog or snow father and son leave they home for the business house in the strand at four o'clock sometimes indeed the younger man be at he post as early as three o'clock in the morning and from the time he arrive at the place of business there be constant work to be do it be difficult and anxious work too and the constant strain tell upon the young man 's health the collection and distribution of newspaper which form then the chief part of the business of wh smith & son be one that need the closest attention and the most untiring energy first on the road be old mr smith 's motto and he carry it out smith 's cart be in attendance at all the great newspaper office ready to carry off print sheet to the strand house for sorting and packing and thence they speed swiftly through the street in the early morning to catch the first train for the country occasionally _ the time _ which be the last print journal do not arrive at the station till the final moment the whistle would have sound the door would have all be lock the guard would have give he warning signal when in would come at hurricane speed smith 's cart bear its load of thunderer ready hand would seize the papers and the last packet would perchance be throw in as the train be already steam out of the station a great deal of the forwarding of newspaper be in those day do by coach to catch these with the later papers smith have light cart with fast horse if the coach have start smith 's cart would pursue for many mile till they catch up the coach at one of they stop place at the death of william iv smith make gigantic effort to distribute the papers early and he get they into the country many hour before the ordinary mail would have take they he even hire a special ship to carry over the papers to ireland so that they reach belfast on the same day by such mean the fame of smith grow rapidly and the business vastly increase when mr wh smith become a partner in 1846 at the age of twenty-one it be value at over # 80000 but wear and tear and the anxiety of business life have make old mr smith often quick-tempered and difficult to please and the come of mr wh into the business be hail with pleasure by the workman : he be so full of tact and sympathy and sometimes when he father have raise a storm of ill-feeling by some hasty expression he be able to bring peace and calm by he pleasant and genial manner yet he be every inch a man of business and even more clear-headed and far-seeing than the senior partner he father it be he who commence the railway bookstall business every one know the familiar look of smith 's bookstall with they energetic clerk and they army of push newsboy and perchance think they be bear with the railway and have grow up with they but such be not the case it be not till about 1850 that mr wh smith secure the entire bookstall rights on the london and north-western railway much against he father 's advice the vast improvement in the selection of book and the service of papers however induce other company to desire to have a similar arrangement till the chief portion of all the english railway come to be girdle by smith 's bookstall from this date the business advance with giant stride manager and clerk have to be engage the latter in large number here the genius of smith as a judge of character be abundantly show he come to a determination almost at a glance and seldom err in he judgment in 1868 he be return to parliament and in 1874 mr disraelus select he for a place in he ministry a year later he be make first lord of the admiralty how serviceable he have be in the former post may be judge by the remark make by sir stafford northcote when he lose smith 's assistance on he promotion to the higher position : i be trouble to know what to do without my right hand i do not think he make a slip in the whole three year write to he wife when he be appoint first lord of the admiralty mr smith say : my patent have come to-day and i have take my seat at the board who address I as ` sir ' in every sentence it be strange and make I shy at first and i have to do what i hardly like -- to send for they not to go to they but i be tell they expect I as they chief to require respect he often write to he wife whilst the debate be go on in the house of common here i be sit listen to arthur balfor who be answer mr j morley he write and i have ear for he and thought for my dear one at home remember I in you prayer be a request he often make to he wife and child in 1886 the rt hon w h smith become leader of the house of common and have thus reach one of the highest position any englishman can occupy old morality be the nickname by which he be know and this term be one of great honor no man ever gain higher respect from all party and no man be ever more fully trust by the people at large thus though mr smith never enter the church and perchance miss a bishopric yet he be a good citizen of the world and a humble christian devote he best energy to the service of he queen and country greater than a archbishop anecdote about the rev charle simeon as to simeon write macaulay if you know what he authority and influence be and how they extend from cambridge to the most remote corner of england you would allow that he real sway over the church be far greater than that of any primate there be little recorded of simeon 's early life to indicate the character of the future leader of man for to jump over half a dozen chair in succession and snuff a candle with he foot be a ordinary schoolboy accomplishment yet there be one incident which show he could be in earnest in religious matter even at that date whilst he be at eton in 1776 a national fast-day be appoint on account of the war with america which be then in progress simeon feeling that if any one have displeased god more than other it be certainly he spend the day in prayer and fasting so great be the ridicule however which follow that he give up he serious thought for the time though it be related that he keep a alms-box into which he put money whenever he conscience accuse he of wrong-do it be rather a favorite habit of he to punish himself by fine for bad behavior later on in life when he find it difficult to rise early in the morning he resolve to give the servant half a crown every time he play the part of the sluggard one morning he find himself reasoning in he own mind whilst enjoy a warm comfortable bed that after all half-crown be very acceptable to the poor woman who receive they but he make up he mind to put a end once and for all to such suggestion from the tempter and resolve accordingly that if he get up late again he would throw a guinea into the cam he do it too the next time he rise late he walk down to the river and throw a hard-earned guinea into the water it be worth while nevertheless for he never have to punish himself again for the same fault the turn point in he life come soon after he arrival at cambridge the provost send he a message to say that he would be require to partake of the holy communion at mid-term then about three week distant the thought of so solemn a occasion weigh heavily on he mind he at once set about read devotional manual and sorrowed earnestly for he past sin so heavy indeed lay the burden of sin upon he that he envy the very dog wish that he could change place with they for three month this state of feeling continue but in passion week the thought come to he that god have provide a offering for he on whose head he could lay he sin just as the jewish high priest lay the sin of the people on the head of the scapegoat he see dimly at first that he sin could be and be intend to be transfer to christ and he determine to lay they upon the savior and be rid of they on Wednesday hope dawn in he heart on Thursday it increase on Friday and Saturday it grow and develop and on easter day 1778 he awake with the word on he lip : -- jesus christ be rise to-day hallelujah and better still write once and for ever in he heart in he twentieth year he have experience that deep conviction know as conversion like every true convert simeon have find the way himself now endeavor to help other to realize the same bless hope he intimate friend be tell of the new joy that have come to he : he instruct the woman who work at the college and when he go home induce he relative to commence family prayer though the light have dawn upon he he be nevertheless full of fault he dress showily go to race spend he sunday carelessly but gradually these habit be overcome and he grow in holiness become watchful of he conduct pray more fervently live nearer to christ in 1782 simeon be ordain deacon in ely cathedral and shortly after become honorary curate to mr atkinson vicar of st edward 's church near king 's college he be already a marked man on account of he earnest life he visit the parishioner as mr atkinson 's substitute and be soon receive with pleasure by they the church become so full that the people could hardly find room it be related that even the clerk 's desk be invade and that when mr atkinson return after a holiday the clerk meet he with the follow strange welcome : -- oh sir i be so glad you be come : now we shall have some room on the very first Sunday he take duty he show the metal of which he be make for in go home after service he hear voice high in dispute in one of the house he pass straightway he go in reprove the couple who be at strife and kneel down to pray peace be restore and simeon 's character for earnestness be confirm now come a eventful period in this good man 's life the minister of trinity church cambridge have die simeon be appoint by the bishop the parishioner however desire to have as minister the curate and as it be impossible to gratify they wish they make matter as unpleasant as possible for simeon the pew door be nearly all keep lock so that the space leave for the congregation be much reduce on the first Sunday there be practically no congregation but later on people could not resist he influence and the church begin to fill to provide place for those who come simeon have seat place in various part of the build the churchwarden however throw they out into the church-yard it be a uncomfortable beginning but simeon persevere he begin a course of Sunday evening lecture to which the people flock in crowd but the churchwarden lock the church door and carry off the key besides being rude and unmannerly that

first Sunday one boy alone come and next Sunday not a solitary lad make he appearance so miss wintz in whose house she be stay offer a kitchen as more homely and tea and cake as a attraction soon the

special attention have thus do all that a commander could do to ensure the success of the day he ride back to the high ground from which he could command a full view of the battle and with a face calm and serene wait for the french attack it be this serenity which have so great a effect on he troops they know they great commander and have confidence in he and this aid they during that eventful day

the valley they watch each other in stern anticipation as the church bell call worshipper together for prayer at about half-past eleven napoleon 's troops advance to the attack and from this time till six or seven o'clock a series of terrific charge continue to be make by the french resist and defeat by the steady bravery of the british and german the duke be often in the thick of the fight and in so great danger that he staff advise he for the good of the army to withdraw to a somewhat safer position pass one of the square of grenadier a shell fall among they and the duke wait to see the result several soldier be blow to piece by the bursting of the shell but wellington seem quite unmoved either by the terrible sight or he own danger all day long the duke be cool as if he have be ride among he man in hyde park wherever he go a murmur of silence stand to you front be hear and at he presence man grow steady as on parade again and again commander tell he of the fearful havoc make in the rank of they brigade and ask either for support or to be allow to withdraw they man they generally receive this answer it be impossible you must hold the ground to the last man when ask by some of he staff what they should do if he fall he give the same answer my plan be simply to stand my ground here to the last man the duke seem to bear a charmed life every member of he staff but one be during the day either kill or wound whilst he escape unhurt wherever the danger seem greatest there be the duke to be find inspirit he man restrain they or put fresh heart into they hard pound this gentleman he remark to a battalion on which the french shell be fall with destructive fury but we will try who can pound the longest wait a little longer my lad be the duke 's reply to the murmur which reach he from some of he troops who have suffer heavily from the french fire and be anxious to charge and you shall have you wish once when the fire be concentrate on the spot where he be with he staff he tell they to separate a little so as to afford a less conspicuous mark for the enemy at another time when some german troops hesitate to advance against the french the duke put himself at they head when napoleon 's old guard be advance up the hill the only sight they could see be the duke and a few mount officer till a voice be hear up guard and at they and the best man in the whole french army the pick of the bravest of the brave fall back before the onset of the british guard at about eight o'clock the duke give the joyful signal for a advance all along the line for nearly nine hour the british have be storm at with shot and shell have be charge again and again and have stand firm though impatient now they receive the signal with a fierce delight and dash forward against the enemy with a fury which nothing could resist the duke be amongst the first to advance and speak joyously to the man as he ride along the bullet be whistle around he and one of he staff venture to point out to he the terrible danger he be run never mind say the duke let they fire away : the battle 's win and my life be of no consequence now about 15000 man out of wellington 's army be kill or wound on the day of this great battle but europe be save the duke who appear so calm and unmoved in battle thus write just afterwards when the excitement of the conflict be over : my heart be break at the terrible loss i have sustain in my old friend and companion and my poor soldier believe I nothing except a battle lose can be half so melancholy as a battle win a prince of preacher the story of john wesley i do intend to be more particularly careful of the soul of this child that thou hast so mercifully provide for than ever i have be that i may do my endeavor to instil into he mind the principle of thy true religion and virtue lord give I grace to do it sincerely and prudently and bless my attempt with good success thus write susanna wesley of she son john the child have be nearly burn to death when he be about six year old in a fire that break out at the rectory of epworth where john and charle wesley and a large family be bear mr wesley devoted herself to the training of she child teach they to cry softly even when they be a year old and conquer they will even earlier than that she one great object be so to prepare she little one for the journey of life that they might be god 's child both in this world and the next to that end she devote all she endeavor be it wonderful that with she example before they eye and she fervent prayer to help they the wesley make a mark upon the world john wesley -- the brand pluck out of the burning as he term himself -- when a boy be remarkable for he piety at eight he father admit he to the holy communion he have thus early learn the lesson of self-control for he mother tell we that have smallpox at this age he bear he disease bravely like a man and indeed like a christian without any complaint though he seem angry at the smallpox when they be sore as we guess by he look sourly at they at the age of ten john wesley go to charterhouse school for a long time after he get there he have little to live on but dry bread as the elder boy have a habit of take the little boy ' meat but so far from this hurt he he say in after life that he think it be good for he health although he be not at school remarkable for the piety he have show earlier yet he never give up read he bible daily and say he prayer morning and evening at the age of twenty-two he begin to think of enter the ministry and write to he parent about it he also commence to regulate the whole tone of he life i set apart he write a hour or two a day for religious retirement i communicate every week i watch against all sin whether in word or deed i begin

kingdom for the purpose of preach the gospel which continue for over half a century in that time it be say that he travel 225000 mile and preach more than 40000 sermon -- a average of more than two for every day of the year as to the number who flock to hear some of he address they can best be realize by those who have attend a international football match when 20000 person be actually assemble in one field or at a review when a like number of people be together it seem impossible to realize that one voice could reach such a multitude yet it be a fact that some of john wesley 's open-air congregation consist of over 20000 person those be the early day of methodism when whitefield and wesley be preach the gospel and give it a new meaning to the multitude here be wesley 's record of one day 's work : may 1747 Sunday 10 -- i preach at astbury at five and at seven proclaim at congleton cross jesus christ we wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption it rain most of the time that i be speak but that do not hinder abundance of people from quietly attend between twelve and one i preach near macclesfield and in the evening at woodly-green he address be so fervent that they act at time like a electric shock some would drop down as if thunderstruck other would cry aloud whilst other again would have convulsion people do not understand such a state of thing bishop butler author of the _ analogy of religion _ be ill pleased at a style of preach so different from that to which the people of the day be accustomed and tell wesley so but the mission of john wesley be to rouse the mass this he do though at great peril to he own life for he preach often produce strong opposition thus in June 1743 at wednesbury the mob assemble at the house where he be stay and shout bring out the minister we will have the minister but wesley be not a bit frightend he ask that they captain might be bring in to he and after a little talk the man who come in like a lion go out like a lamb then wesley go out to the angry crowd and standing on a chair ask what do you want with I we want you to go with we to the justice cry some that i will with all my heart he reply then he speak a few word to they and the people shout : the gentleman be a honest gentleman and we will spill we blood in he defense but they change they mind later on for they meet a walsall crowd on they way who attack wesley savagely and those who have be loud in they promise to protect he -- flee leave to the mercy of the rable he be drag to walsall one man hit he in the mouth with such force that the blood stream from the wound another strike he on the breast a third seize he and try to pull he down be you willing cry wesley to hear I no no they answer knock out he brain down with he kill he at once what evil ask wesley have i do which of you all have i wrong by word or deed then he begin to pray and one of the ringleader say to he : -- sir i will spend my life for you follow I and no one shall hurt a hair of you head other take he part also -- one fortunately be a prizefighter wesley thus describe the finish of this remarkable adventure : -- a little before ten o'clock god bring I safe to wednesbury have lose only one flap of my waistcoat and a little skin from one of my hand from the begin to the end i find the same presence of mind as if i have be sit in my own study but i take no think from one moment to another only once it come into my mind that if they should throw I into the river it would spoil the papers that be in my pocket for myself i do not doubt but i should swim across have but a thin coat and a light pair of shoe at pensford the rabble make a bull savage and then try to make it attack he congregation at whitechapel they drive cow among the listener and throw stone one of which hit wesley between the eye but after he have wipe away the blood he go on with he address tell the people that god have not give we the spirit of fear at st ive in cornwall there be a great uproar but wesley go amongst the mob and bring the chief mischiefmaker out strange to say the preacher receive but one blow and then he reason the case out with the agitator and the man undertake to quiet he companion thus wesley go fearlessly from place to place he visit ireland forty-two time as well as scotland and wale when he be eighty-four he cross over to the channel island in stormy weather and there high and low rich and poor receive the word gladly he always go on horseback till quite late in life when he friend persuade he to have a chaise no weather could stop he from keep he engagement in 1743 he set out from epworth to grimsby but be tell at the ferry he could not cross the trent owing to the storm but he be determine he grimsby congregation should not be disappointed and he so work on the boatman 's feeling that they take he over even at the risk of they life at bristol in 1772 he be tell that highwayman be on the road and have rob all the coach that pass some just previously but wesley feel no uneasiness know as he write that god would take care of we and he do so for before we come to the spot all the highwayman be take and so we go

trade unless god have raise you up for this very thing write wesley you will be wear out by the opposition of man and devil but if god be for you who can be against you go on in the name of god and in the power of he might till even american slavery the vilest that ever see the sun shall vanish away before it wesley die at the ripe age of eighty-eight in the year 1791 he have save no money so have none to leave behind but he be one of those poor person who make many rich amongst he few small gift and bequest be # 6 to be divide among the six poor man name by the assistant who shall carry my
