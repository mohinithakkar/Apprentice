dark-plumaged bird rise suddenly in terror from my side while the dead slumber peacefully while cypress branch droop low o'er my head while all around I weep or lie in deep repose my burning eye rest on the great white cloud gigantic winding-sheet unroll they slow length across the face of heaven how many night and year and age have i journey thus a witness of the universal birth and of a like decay innumerable be the generation i have garner with my scythe like god i be eternal the nurse of earth i cradle it each night upon a bed both soft and warm the same recur feast the same unending

a jerk and the well-aimed missile strike the bird squarely send it straight into the moat below he spring after it unmindful of the bramble and ferret around the bush with the litheness of a young dog the pigeon hang with broken wing in the branch of a privet hedge the persistence of its life irritated the boy he begin to strangle it and its convulsion make he heart beat quicker and fill he with a wild tumultuous voluptuousness the last throb of its heart make he feel like faint at supper that night he father declare that at he age a boy should begin to hunt and he arise and bring forth a old writing-book which contain in question and answer everything pertain to the pastime in it a master show a suppose pupil how to train dog and falcon lay trap recognize a stag by its fumet and a fox or a wolf by footprint he also teach the best way of discover they track how to start they where they refuge be usually to be find what wind be the most favourable and further enumerate the various cry and the rule of the quarry when julian be able to recite all these thing by heart he father make up a pack of hound for he there be twenty-four greyhound of barbary speedier than gazelle but liable to get out of temper seventeen couple of breton dog great barker with broad chest and russet coat fleck with white for wild-boar hunting and perilous doubling there be forty boarhound as hairy as bear

german gerfalcon and pilgrim falcon capture on the cliff edge the cold sea in distant land they be house in a thatched shed and be chained to the perch in the order of size in front of they be a little grass-plot where from time to time they be allow to disport themselves bag-nets bait trap and all sort of snare be manufacture often they would take out pointer who would set almost immediately then the whippers-in advance step by step would cautiously spread a huge net over they motionless body at the command the dog would bark and arouse the quail and the lady of the neighborhood with they husband child and hand-maid would fall upon they and capture they with ease at other time they use a drum to start hare and frequently fox fall into the ditch prepare for they while wolf catch they paw in the trap but julian scorn these convenient contrivance he prefer to hunt away from the crowd alone with he steed and he falcon it be almost always a large snow-white scythian bird he leather hood be ornament with a plume and on he blue foot be bell and he perch firmly on he master 's arm while they gallop across the plain then julian would suddenly untie he tether and let he fly and the bold bird would dart through the air like a arrow one might perceive two spot circle around unite and then disappear in the blue height presently the falcon would return with a mutilate bird and perch again on he master 's gauntlet with tremble wing julian loved to sound he trumpet and follow he dog over hill and stream into the wood and when the stag begin to moan under they tooth he would kill it deftly and delight in the fury of the brute which would devour the piece spread out on the warm hide on foggy day he would hide in the marsh to watch for wild goose otter and wild duck at daybreak three equerry wait for he at the foot of the step and though the old monk lean out of the dormer-window and make sign to he to return julian would not look around he heed neither the broiling sun the rain nor the storm he drink spring water and eat wild berry and when he be tire he lay down under a tree and he would come home at night cover with earth and blood with thistle in he hair and smell of wild beast he grow to be like they and when he mother kiss he he respond coldly to she caress and seem to be think of deep and serious thing he kill bear with a knife bull with a hatchet and wild boar with a spear and once with nothing but a stick he defend himself against some wolf which be gnawing corpse at the foot of a gibbet \* \* \* \* \* one winter morning he set out before daybreak with a bow sling across he shoulder and a quiver of arrow attach to the pummel of he saddle the hoof of he steed beat the ground with regularity and he two beagle trot close behind the wind be blow hard and icicle cling to he cloak a part of the horizon clear and he behold some rabbit play around they burrow in a instant the two dog be upon they and seize as many as they could they break they back in the twinkling of a eye soon he come to a forest a woodcock paralyse by the cold perch on a branch with its head hide under its wing julian with a lunge of he sword cut off its foot and without stop to pick it up ride away three hour later he find himself on the top of a mountain so high that the sky seem almost black in front of he a long flat rock hang over a precipice and at the end two wild goat stand gaze down into the abyss as he have no arrow -lrb- for he have leave he steed behind -rrb- he think he would climb down to where they stand and with bare foot and bent back he at last reach the first goat and thrust he dagger below its rib but the second animal in its terror leap into the precipice julian throw himself forward to strike it but he right foot slip and he fall face downward and with outstretched arm over the body of the first goat after he return to the plain he follow a stream border by willow from time to time some crane fly low pass over he head he kill they with he whip never miss a bird he behold in the distance the gleam of a lake which appear to be of lead and in the middle of it be a animal he have never see before a beaver with a black muzzle notwithstanding the distance that separate they a arrow end its life and julian only regret that he be not able to carry the skin home with he then he enter a avenue of tall tree the top of which form a triumphal arch to the entrance of a forest a deer spring out of the thicket and a badger crawl out of its hole a stag appear in the road and a peacock spread its fan-shaped tail on the grass -- and after he have slay they all other deer other stag other badger other peacock and jay blackbird fox porcupine polecat and lynx appear in fact a host of beast that grow more and more numerous with every step he take tremble and with a look of appeal in they eye they gather around julian but he do not stop slaying they and so intent be he on stretch he bow draw he sword and whipping out he knife that he have little thought for aught else he know that he be hunting in some country since a indefinite time through the very fact of he existence as everything seem to occur with the ease one experience in dream but presently a extraordinary sight make he pause he behold a valley shape like a circus and fill with stag which huddle together be warm one another with the vapor of they breath that mingle with the early mist for a few minute he almost choke with pleasure at the prospect of so great a carnage then he spring from he horse roll up he sleeve and begin to aim when the first arrow whiz through the air the stag turn they head simultaneously they huddle closer utter plaintive cry and a great agitation seize the whole herd the edge of the valley be too high to admit of flight and the animal run around the enclosure in they effort to escape julian aim stretch he bow and he arrow fall as fast and thick as raindrop in a shower madden with terror the stag fight and rear and climb on top of one another they antler and body form a move mountain which tumble to piece whenever it displace itself finally the last one expire they body lay stretch out on the sand with foam gush from the nostril and the bowels protrude the heaving of they belly grow less and less noticeable and presently all be still night come and behind the tree through the branch the sky appear like a sheet of blood julian lean against a tree and gaze with dilated eye at the enormous slaughter he be now unable to comprehend how he have accomplish it on the opposite side of the valley he suddenly behold a large stag with a doe and they fawn the buck be black and of enormous size he have a white beard and carry sixteen antler he mate be the color of dead leaf and she browse upon the grass while the fawn cling to she udder follow she step by step again the bow be stretch and instantly the fawn drop dead and see this its mother raise she head and utter a poignant almost human wail of agony exasperate julian thrust he knife into she chest and fell she to the ground the great stag have watch everything and suddenly he spring forward julian aim he last arrow at the beast it strike he between he antler and stick there the stag do not appear to notice it leap over the body he be come nearer and nearer with the intention julian thought of charge at he and rip he open and he recoil with inexpressible horror but presently the huge animal halted and with eye aflame and the solemn air of a patriarch and a judge repeat thrice while a bell toll in the distance : accursed accursed accurse some day ferocious soul thou wilt murder thy father and thy mother then he sink on he knee gently close he lid and expire at first julian be stunned and then a sudden lassitude and a immense sadness come over he hold he head between he hand he weep for a long time he steed have wander away he dog have forsake he the solitude seem to threaten he with unknown peril impel by a sense of sickening terror he run across the field and choose a path at random find himself almost immediately at the gate of the castle that night he could not rest for by the flickering light of the hang lamp he behold again the huge black stag he fight against the obsession of the prediction and keep repeat : no no no i can not slay they and then he think : still suppose i desire to -- and he fear that the devil might inspire he with this desire during three month he distract mother pray at he bedside and he father pace the hall of the castle in anguish he consult the most celebrated physician who prescribe quantity of medicine julian 's illness they declare be due to some injurious wind or to amorous desire but in reply to they question the young man only shake he head after a time he strength return and he be able to take a walk in the courtyard support by he father and the old monk but after he have completely recover he refuse to hunt he father hope to please he present he with a large saracen sabre it be place on a panoply that hang on a pillar and a ladder be require to reach it julian climb up to it one day but the heavy weapon slip from he grasp and in fall graze he father and tear he cloak julian believe he have kill he fall in a swoon after that he carefully avoid weapon the sight of a naked sword make he grow pale and this weakness cause great distress to he family in the end the old monk order he in the name of god and of he forefather once more to indulge in the sport 's of a nobleman the equerry divert themselves every day with javelin and julian soon excel in the practice he be able to send a javelin into bottle to break the tooth of the weather-cock on the castle and to strike door-nail at a distance of one hundred foot one summer evening at the hour when dusk render object indistinct he be in the arbor in the garden and think he see two white wing in the background hover around the espalier not for a moment do he doubt that it be a stork and so he throw he javelin at it a heart-rending scream pierce the air he have strike he mother whose cap and long stream remain nail to the wall julian flee from home and never return chapter ii the crime he join a horde of adventurer who be pass through the place he learn what it be to suffer hunger thirst sickness and filth he grow accustomed to the din of battle and to the sight of die man the wind tan he skin he limb become

julian news of he parent she lean out of the bed to listen to they but after glance at each other the old people ask she whether he ever refer to they and if he still love they oh yes she say then they exclaim : we be he parent and they sit themselves down for they be very tired but there be nothing to show the young wife that she husband be they son they prove it by describe to she the

they laud he happiness in have such a beautiful wife and do not tire of look at she and kiss she the luxuriousness of the apartment astonish they and the old man after examine the wall inquire why they bear the coat-of-arm of the emperor of occitanium he be my father she reply and he marvel and remember the prediction of the gipsy while he wife meditate upon the word the hermit have speak to she the glory of they son be undoubtedly only the dawn of eternal splendor and the old people remain awed while the light from the candelabrum on the table fall on they in the heyday of youth both have be extremely handsome the mother have not lose she hair and band of snowy whiteness frame she cheek and the father with he stalwart figure and long beard look like a carve image julian 's wife prevail upon they not to wait for he she put they in she bed and close the curtain and they both fall asleep the day break and outdoors the little bird begin to chirp meanwhile julian have leave the castle grounds and walk nervously through the forest enjoy the velvety softness of the grass and the balminess of the air the shadow of the tree fall on the earth here and there the moonlight fleck the glade and julian fear to advance because he mistake the silvery light for water and the tranquil surface of the pool for grass a great stillness reign everywhere and he fail to see any of the beast that only a moment ago be prowl around the castle as he walk on the wood grow thicker and the darkness more impenetrable warm wind fill with enervate perfume caress he he sink into mass of dead leaf and after a while he lean against a oak-tree to rest and catch he breath suddenly a body blacker than the surround darkness spring from behind the tree it be a wild boar julian do not have time to stretch he bow and he bewail the fact as if it be some great misfortune presently have leave the wood he behold a wolf slink along a hedge he aim a arrow at he the wolf pause turn he head and quietly continue on he way he trot along always keep at the same distance pause now and then to look around and resume he flight as soon as a arrow be aim in he direction in this way julian traverse a apparently endless plain then sand-hill and at last find himself on a plateau that dominate a great stretch of land large flat stone be intersperse among crumble vault bone and skeleton cover the ground and here and there some mouldy cross stand desolate but presently shape move in the darkness of the tomb and from they come pant wild-eyed hyena they approach he and smell he grin hideously and disclose they gum he whip out he sword but they scatter in every direction and continue they swift limp gallop disappear in a cloud of dust some time afterwards in a ravine he encounter a wild bull with threatening horn paw the sand with he hoof julian thrust he lance between he dewlap but he weapon snap as if the beast be make of bronze then he close he eye in anticipation of he death when he open they again the bull have vanish then he soul collapse with shame some supernatural power destroy he strength and he set out for home through the forest the wood be a tangle of creep plant that he have to cut with he sword and while he be thus engage a weasel slide between he foot a panther jump over he shoulder and a serpent wound itself around the ash-tree among its leaf be a monstrous jackdaw that watch julian intently and here and there between the branch appear great fiery spark as if the sky be rain all its star upon the forest but the spark be the eye of wild-cats owl squirrel monkey and parrot julian aim he arrow at they but the feathered weapon light on the leaf of the tree and look like white butterfly he throw stone at they but the missile do not strike and fall to the ground then he curse himself and howl imprecation and in he rage he could have strike himself then all the beast he have pursue appear and form a narrow circle around he some sit on they hindquarter while other stand at full height and julian remain among they transfix with terror and absolutely unable to move by a supreme effort of he will-power he take a step forward those that perch in the tree open they wing those that tread the earth move they limb and all accompany he the hyena stride in front of he the wolf and the wild boar bring up the rear on he right the bull swing its head and on he leave the serpent crawl through the grass while the panther arch its back advance with velvety footfall and long stride julian walk as slowly as possible so as not to irritate they while in the depth of bush he could distinguish porcupine fox viper jackal and bear he begin to run the brute follow he the serpent hiss the malodorous beast froth at the mouth the wild boar rub he tusk against he heel and the wolf scratch the palm of he hand with the hair of he snout the monkey pinch he and make face the weasel toll over he foot a bear knock he cap off with its huge paw and the panther disdainfully drop a arrow it be about to put in its mouth irony seem to incite they sly action as they watch he out of the corner of they eye they seem to meditate a plan of revenge and julian who be deafen by the buzz of the insect bruise by the wing and tail of the bird choke by the stench of animal breath walk with outstretch arm and close lid like a blind man without even the strength to beg for mercy the crowing of a cock vibrate in the air other cock respond it be day and julian recognize the top of he palace rise above the orange-tree then on the edge of a field he behold some red partridge flutter around a stubble-field he unfasten he cloak and throw it over they like a net when he lift it he find only a bird that have be dead a long time and be decay this disappointment irritated he more than all the other the thirst for carnage stir afresh within he animal fail he he desire to slaughter man he climb the three terrace and open the door with a blow of he fist but at the foot of the staircase the memory of he beloved wife soften he heart no doubt she be asleep and he would go up and surprise she have remove he sandal he unlock the door softly and enter the stain window dim the pale light of dawn julian stumble over some garment 's lie on the floor and a little further on he knock against a table cover with dish she must have eat he think so he advance cautiously towards the bed which be conceal by the darkness in the back of the room when he reach the edge he lean over the pillow where the two head be rest close together and stoop to kiss he wife he mouth encounter a man 's beard he fall back think he have become crazed then he approach the bed again and he search finger discover some hair which seem to be very long in order to convince himself that he be mistaken he once more pass he hand slowly over the pillow but this time he be sure that it be a beard and that a man be there a man lie beside he wife fly into a ungovernable passion he spring upon they with he draw dagger foam stamp and howl like a wild beast after a while he stop the corpse pierce through the heart have not even move he listen attentively to the two death-rattle they be almost alike and as they grow fainter another voice come from far away seem to continue they uncertain at first this plaintive voice come nearer and nearer grow louder and louder and presently he recognize with a feeling of abject terror the bellowing of the great black stag and as he turn around he think he see the spectre of he wife standing at the threshold with a light in she hand the sound of the murder have arouse she in one glance she understand what have happen and flee in horror let the candle drop from she hand julian pick it up he father and mother lay before he stretch on they back with gaping wound in they breast and they face the expression of which be full of tender dignity seem to hide what might be a eternal secret splash and blotch of blood be on they white skin on the bed-clothes on the floor and on a ivory christ which hang in the alcove the scarlet reflection of the stain window which just then be strike by the sun light up the bloody spot and appear to scatter they around the whole room julian walk toward the corpse repeat to himself and try to believe that he be mistake that it be not possible that there be often inexplicable likeness at last he bent over to look closely at the old man and he see between the half-closed lid a dead pupil that scorch he like fire then he go over to the other side of the bed where the other corpse lay but the face be partly hide by band of white hair julian slip he finger beneath they and raise the head hold it at arm 's length to study its feature while with he other hand he lift the torch drop of blood ooze from the mattress and fall one by one upon the floor at the close of the day he appear before he wife and in a changed voice command she first not to answer he not to approach he not even to look at he and to obey under the penalty of eternal damnation every one of he order which be irrevocable the funeral be to be hold in accordance with the write instruction he have leave on a chair in the death-chamber he leave she he castle he vassal all he worldly goods without keep even he clothes or he sandal which would be find at the top of the stair she have obey the will of god in bring about he crime and accordingly she must pray for he soul since henceforth he should cease to exist the dead be bury sumptuously in the chapel of a monastery which it take three day to reach from the castle a monk wear a hood that cover he head follow the procession alone for nobody dare to speak to he and during the mass he lay flat on the floor with he face downward and he arm stretch out at he side after the burial he be see to take the road lead into the mountain he look back several time and finally pass out of sight chapter iii the reparation he leave the country and beg he daily bread on he way he stretch out he hand to the horseman he meet in the road and humbly approach the harvester in the field or else remain motionless in front of the gate of castle and he face be so sad that he be never turn away obey a spirit of humility he relate he history to all man and they would flee from he and cross themselves in village through which he have pass before the good people bolt the door threaten he and throw stone at he as soon as they recognize he the more charitable one place a bowl on the window-sill and close the shutter in order to avoid see he repel and shun by everyone he avoid he fellow-men and nourished himself with root and plant stray fruit and shell which he gather along the shore often at the bend of a hill he could perceive a mass of crowded roof stone spire bridge tower and narrow street from which arise a continual murmur of activity the desire to mingle with man impel he to enter the city but the gross and beastly expression of they face the noise of they industry and the indifference of they remark chill he very heart on holiday when the cathedral bell ring out at daybreak and fill the people 's heart with gladness he watch the inhabitant come out of they dwelling the dancer in the public square the fountain of ale the damask hanging spread before the house of prince and then when night come he would peer through the window at the long table where family gather and where grandparent hold little child on they knee then sob would rise in he throat and he would turn away and go back to he haunt he gaze with yearning at the colt in the pasture the bird in they nest the insect on the flower but they all flee from he at he approach and hide or fly away so he seek solitude but the wind bring to he ear sound resemble death-rattle the tear of the dew remind he of heavier drop and every evening the sun would spread blood in the sky and every night in he dream he live over he parricide he make himself a hair-cloth line with iron spike on he knee he ascend every hill that be crown with a chapel but the unrelenting thought spoil the splendor of the tabernacle and tortured he in the midst of he penance he do not rebel against god who have inflict he action but he despair at the thought that he have commit it he have such a horror of himself that he take all sort of risk he rescue paralytic from fire and child from wave but the ocean scorn he and the flame spare he time do not allay he torment which become so intolerable that he resolve to die one day while he be stoop over a fountain to judge of its depth a old man appear on the other side he wear a white beard and he appearance be so lamentable that julian could not keep back he tear the old man also be weep without recognize he julian remembered confusedly a face that resemble he he utter a cry for it be he father who stand before he and he give up all thought of take he own life thus weight down by he recollection he travel through many country and arrive at a river which be dangerous because of its violence and the slime that cover its shore since a long time nobody have venture to cross it the bow of a old boat whose stern be bury in the mud show among the reed julian on examine it closely find a pair of oar and hit upon the idea of devote he life to the service of he fellow-men he begin by establish on the bank of the river a sort of road which would enable people to approach the edge of the stream he break he nail in he effort to lift enormous stone which he press against the pit of he stomach in order to transport they from one point to another he slip in the mud he sink into it and several time be on the very brink of death then he take to repair the boat with debris of vessel and afterwards build himself a hut with putty and trunk of tree when it become know that a ferry have be establish passenger flock to it they hail he from the opposite side by wave flag and julian would jump into the boat and row over the craft be very heavy and the people load it with all sort of baggage and beast of burden who rear with fright thereby add greatly to the confusion he ask nothing for he trouble some give he left-over victuals which they take from they sack or worn-out garment which they could no longer use the brutal one hurl curse at he and when he rebuke they gently they reply with insult and he be content to bless they a little table a stool a bed make of dead leaf and three earthen bowl be all he possess two hole in the wall serve as window on one side as far as the eye could see stretch barren waste stud here and there with pool of water and in front of he flow the greenish water of the wide river in the spring a putrid odour arise from the damp sod then fierce gale lift cloud of dust that blow everywhere even settle in the water and in one 's mouth a little later swarm of mosquito appear whose buzz and sting continued night and day after that come frightful frost which communicate a stone-like rigidity to everything and inspire one with a insane desire for meat month pass when julian never see a human be he often close he lid and endeavor to recall he youth -- he behold the courtyard of a castle with greyhound stretch out on a terrace a armoury fill with valet and under a bower of vine a youth with blond curl sit between a old man wrap in fur and a lady with a high cap presently the corpse rise before he and then he would throw himself face downward on he cot and sob : oh poor father poor mother poor mother and would drop into a fitful slumber in which the terrible vision recur one night he think that some one be call to he in he sleep he listen intently but could hear nothing save the roaring of the water but the same voice repeat : julian it proceed from the opposite shore fact which appear extraordinary to he consider the breadth of the river the voice call a third time : julian and the high-pitched tone sound like the ringing of a church-bell have light he lantern he step out of he cabin a frightful storm rage the darkness be complete and be illuminate here and there only by the white wave leap and tumble after a moment 's hesitation he untie the rope the water presently grow smooth and the boat glide easily to the opposite shore where a man be wait he be wrap in a tear piece of linen he face be like a chalk mask and he eye be redder than glowing coal when julian hold up he lantern he notice that the stranger be cover with hideous sore but notwithstanding this there be in he attitude something like the majesty of a king as soon as he step into the boat it sink deep into the water bear downward by he weight then it rise again and julian begin to row with each stroke of the oar the force of the wave raise the bow of the boat the water which be blacker than ink run furiously along the side it form abyss and then mountain over which the boat glide then it fall into yawning depths where buffet by the wind it whirl around and around julian lean far forward and brace himself with he foot bent backwards so as to bring he whole strength into play hail-stone cut he hand the rain run down he back the velocity of the wind suffocate he he stop rowing and let the boat drift with the tide but realize that a important matter be at stake a command which could not be disregard he pick up the oar again and the rattle of the thole mingle with the clamouring of the storm the little lantern burn in front of he sometimes bird flutter past it and obscure the light but he could distinguish the eye of the leper who stand at the stern as motionless as a column and the trip last a long long time when they reach the hut julian close the door and see the man sit down on the stool the species of shroud that be wrap around he have fall below he loin and he shoulder and chest and lean arm be hide under blotch of scaly pustule enormous wrinkle cross he forehead like a skeleton he have a hole instead of a nose and from he bluish lip come breath which be fetid and as thick as mist i be hungry he say julian set before he what he have a piece of pork and some crust of coarse bread after he have devour they the table the bowl and the handle of the knife bear the same scale that cover he body then he say : i thirst julian fetch he jug of water and when he lift it he smell a aroma that dilate he nostril and fill he heart with gladness it be wine what a boon but the leper stretch out he arm and empty the jug at one draught then he say : i be cold julian ignite a bundle of fern that lay in the middle of the hut the leper approach the fire and rest on he heel begin to warm himself he whole frame shake and he be fail visibly he eye grow dull he sore begin to break and in a faint voice he whisper : thy bed julian help he gently to it and even lay the sail of he boat over he to keep he warm the leper toss and moan the corner of he mouth be draw up over he tooth a accelerate death-rattle shake he chest and with each one of he aspiration he stomach touch he spine at last he close he eye i feel as if ice be in my bone lay thyself beside I he command julian take off he garment and then as naked as on the day he be bear he get into the bed against he thigh he could feel the skin of the leper and it be colder than a serpent and as rough as a file he try to encourage the leper but he only whisper : oh i be about to die come closer to I and warm I not with thy hand no with thy whole body so julian stretch himself out upon the leper lay on he lip to lip chest to chest then the leper clasp he close and presently he eye shine like star he hair lengthen into sunbeam the breath of he nostril have the scent of rose a cloud of incense rise from the hearth and the water begin to murmur harmoniously a abundance of bliss a superhuman joy fill the soul of the swoon julian while he who clasp he to he breast grow and grow until he head and he foot touch the opposite wall of the cabin the roof fly up in the air disclose the heaven and julian ascend into infinity face to face with we lord jesus christ who bear he straight to heaven and this be the story of saint julian the hospitaller as it be give on the stained-glass

bring out she sewing and virginium amuse herself by braid reed félicité weave lavender blossom while paul be bore and wish to go home sometimes they cross the toucque in a boat and start to hunt for seashell the outgoing tide expose starfish and sea-urchin and the child try to catch the flake of foam which the wind blow away the sleepy wave lap the sand unfurled themselves along the shore that extend as far as the eye could see but where land begin it be limit by the downs which separate it from the swamp a large meadow shape like a hippodrome when they go home that way trouville on the slope of a hill below grow larger and larger as they advance and with all its house of unequal height seem to spread out before they in a sort of giddy confusion when the heat be too oppressive they remain in they room the dazzling sunlight cast bar of light between the shutter not a sound in the village not a soul on the sidewalk this silence intensify the tranquillity of everything in the distance the hammer of some calker pound the hull of a ship and the sultry breeze bring they a odour of tar the principal diversion consist in watch the return of the fishing-smack as soon as they pass the beacon they begin to ply to windward the sail be lower to one third of the mast and with they foresail swell up like balloon they glide over the wave and anchor in the middle of the harbor then they creep up alongside of the dock and the sailor throw the quiver fish over the side of the boat a line of cart be wait for they and woman with white cap spring forward to receive the basket and embrace they men-folk one day one of they speak to félicité who after a little while return to the house gleefully she have find one of she sister and presently nastasie barette wife of léroux

say good-bye to they all for he be glad to go to live in a house where he would have boy companion madame aubain resign herself to the separation from she son because it be unavoidable virginium brood less and less over it félicité regret the noise he make but soon a new occupation divert she mind begin from christmas she accompany the little girl to she catechism lesson every day chapter iii death after she have make a curtsey at the threshold she would walk up the aisle between the double line of chair open madame aubain 's pew sit down and look around girl and boy the former on the right the latter on the left-hand side of the church fill the stall of the choir the priest stand beside the reading-desk on one stain window of the side-aisle the holy ghost hover over the virgin on another one mary knelt before the child jesus and behind the altar a wooden group represent saint michael fell the dragon the priest first read a condensed lesson of sacred history félicité evoke paradise the flood the tower of babel the blaze city the die nation the shattered idol and out of this she develop a great respect for the almighty and a great fear of he wrath then when she listen to the passion she weep why have they crucify he who love little child nourish the people make the blind see and who out of humility have wish to be bear among the poor in a stable the sowing the harvest the wine-press all those familiar thing which the scripture mention form a part of she life the word of god sanctify they and she love the lamb with increase tenderness for the sake of the lamb and the dove because of the holy ghost she find it hard however to think of the latter as a person for be it not a bird a flame and sometimes only a breath perhaps it be its light that at night hover over swamp its breath that propel the cloud its voice that render church-bell harmonious and félicité worship devoutly while enjoy the coolness and the stillness of the church as for the dogma she could not understand it and do not even try the priest discourse the child recite and she go to sleep only to awaken with a start when they be leave the church and they wooden shoe clatter on the stone pavement in this way she learn she catechism she religious education have be neglect in she youth and thenceforth she imitate all virginium 's religious practise fast when she do and go to confession with she at the corpus-christi day they both decorate a altar she worry in advance over virginium 's first communion she fuss about the shoe the rosary the book and the glove with what nervousness she help the mother dress the child during the entire ceremony she feel anguished monsieur bourai hide part of the choir from view but directly in front of she the flock of maiden wear white wreath over they lowered veil form a snow-white field and she recognize she darling by the slenderness of she neck and she devout attitude the bell tinkle all the head bent and there be a silence then at the peal of the organ the singer and the worshipper strike up the agnus dei the boy ' procession begin behind they come the girl with clasped hand they advance step by step to the light altar knelt at the first step receive one by one the host and return to they seat in the same order when virginium 's turn come félicité lean forward to watch she and through that imagination which spring from true affection she at once become the child whose face and dress become hers whose heart beat in she bosom and when virginium open she mouth and close she lid she do likewise and come very near faint the follow day she present herself early at the church so as to receive communion from the curé she take it with the proper feeling but do not experience the same delight as on the previous day madame aubain wish to make a accomplished girl of she daughter and as guyot could not teach english nor music she decide to send she to the ursuline at honfleur the child make no objection but félicité sigh and think madame be heartless then she think that perhaps she mistress be right as these thing be beyond she sphere finally one day a old _ fiacre _ stop in front of the door and a nun step out félicité put virginium 's luggage on top of the carriage give the coachman some instruction and smuggle six jar of jam a dozen pear and a bunch of violet under the seat at the last minute virginium have a fit of sob she embrace she mother again and again while the latter kiss she on she forehead and say : now be brave be brave the step be pull up and the _ fiacre _ rumble off then madame aubain have a faint spell and that evening all she friend include the two lormeaus madame lechaptois the lady rochefeuille messieurs de houppeville and bourais call on she and tender they sympathy at first the separation prove very painful to she but she daughter write she three time a week and the other day she herself write to virginium then she walk in the garden read a little and in this way manage to fill out the emptiness of the hour each morning out of habit félicité enter virginium 's room and gaze at the wall she miss comb she hair lace she shoe tuck she in she bed and the bright face and little hand when they use to go out for a walk in order to occupy herself she try to make lace but she clumsy finger break the thread she have no heart for anything lose she sleep and waste away as she put it in order to have some distraction she ask leave to receive the visit of she nephew victor he would come on Sunday after church with ruddy cheek and bared chest bring with he the scent of the country she would set the table and they would sit down opposite each other and eat they dinner she eat as little as possible herself to avoid any extra expense but would stuff he so with food that he would finally go to sleep at the first stroke of vespers she would wake he up brush he trousers tie he cravat and walk to church with he lean on he arm with maternal pride he parent always tell he to get something out of she either a package of brown sugar or soap or brandy and sometimes even money he bring she he clothes to mend and she accept the task gladly because it mean another visit from he in August he father take he on a coasting-vessel it be vacation time and the arrival of the child console félicité but paul be capricious and virginium be grow too old to be thee-and-thou have a fact which seem to produce a sort of embarrassment in they relation victor go successively to morlaix to dunkirk and to brighton whenever he return from a trip he would bring she a present the first time it be a box of shell the second a coffee-cup the third a big doll of ginger-bread he be grow handsome have a good figure a tiny moustache kind eye and a little leather cap that sit jauntily on the back of he head he amuse he aunt by tell she story mingle with nautical expression one Monday the 14th of July 1819 -lrb- she never forget the date -rrb- victor announce that he have be engage on merchant-vessel and that in two day he would take the steamer at honfleur and join he sailer which be go to start from havre very soon perhaps he might be away two year the prospect of he departure fill félicité with despair and in order to bid he farewell on Wednesday night after madame 's dinner she put on she patten and trudge the four mile that separate pont-l'evêque from honfleur when she reach the calvary instead of turn to the right she turn to the left and lose herself in coal-yard she have to retrace she step some people she speak to advise she to hasten she walk helplessly around the harbor fill with vessel and knock against hawser presently the ground slope abruptly light flitter to and fro and she think all at once that she have go mad when she see some horse in the sky other on the edge of the dock neigh at the sight of the ocean a derrick pull they up in the air and dump they into a boat where passenger be bustling about among barrel of cider basket of cheese and bag of meal chicken cackle the captain swear and a cabin-boy rest on the railing apparently indifferent to he surroundings félicité who do not recognize he keep shout : victor he suddenly raise he eye but while she be prepare to rush up to he they withdraw the gangplank the packet tow by singing woman glide out of the harbor she hull squeak and the heavy wave beat up against she side the sail have turn and nobody be visible -- and on the ocean silver by the light of the moon the vessel form a black spot that grow dimmer and dimmer and finally disappear when félicité pass the calvary again she feel as if she must entrust that which be dearest to she to the lord and for a long while she pray with uplifted eye and a face wet with tear the city be sleep some custom official be take the air and the water keep pour through the hole of the dam with a deafening roar the town clock strike two the parlor of the convent would not open until morning and surely a delay would annoy madame so in spite of she desire to see the other child she go home the maid of the inn be just arise when she reach pont-l'evêque so the poor boy would be on the ocean for month he previous trip have not alarm she one can come back from england and brittany but america the colony the island be all lose in a uncertain region at the very end of the world from that time on félicité think solely of she nephew on warm day she fear he would suffer from thirst and when it storm she be afraid he would be strike by lightning when she harken to the wind that rattle in the chimney and dislodge the tile on the roof she imagine that he be be buffet by the same storm perch on top of a shatter mast with he whole body bent backward and cover with sea-foam or -- these be recollection of the engraved geography -- he be be devour by savage or capture in a forest by ape or die on some lonely coast she never mention she anxiety however madame aubain worry about she daughter the sister think that virginium be affectionate but delicate the slightest emotion enervate she she have to give up she piano lesson she mother insist upon regular letter from the convent one morning when the postman fail to come she grow impatient and begin to pace to and fro from she chair to the window it be really extraordinary no news since four day in order to console she mistress by she own example félicité say : why madame i have not have any news since six month -- from whom -- the servant reply gently : why -- from my nephew oh yes you nephew and shrug she shoulder madame aubain continue to pace the floor as if to say : i do not think of it -- besides i do not care a cabin-boy a pauper -- but my daughter -- what a difference just think of it -- félicité although she have be rear roughly

be to be the same the chemist inform she that victor 's vessel have reach havana he have read the information in a newspaper félicité imagine that havana be a place where people do nothing but smoke and that victor walk around among negro in a cloud of tobacco could a person in case of need return by land how far be it from pont-l'evêque in order to learn these thing she question monsieur bourai he reach for he map and begin some explanation concern longitude and smile with superiority at félicité 's bewilderment at last he take he pencil and point out a imperceptible black point in the scallop of a oval blotch add : there it be she bent over the map the maze of color line hurt she eye without enlighten she and when bourais ask she what puzzle she she request he to show she the house victor live in bourai throw up he hand sneeze and then laugh uproariously such ignorance delight he soul but félicité fail to understand the cause of he mirth she whose intelligence be so limited that
