owe to the fantastic idea of chivalry entertain by jame iv and he refusal to avail himself of the natural advantage of he position be by far the most disastrous of any recount in the history of the northern war the whole strength of the kingdom both lowland and highland be assemble and the contest be one of the sternest and most desperate upon record for several hour the issue seem doubtful on the leave the scot obtain a decide advantage on the right wing they be break and overthrow and at last the whole weight of the battle be bring into the center where king jame and the earl of surrey command in person the determine valor of jame imprudent as it be have the effect of rouse to a pitch of desperation the courage of the meanest soldier and the ground become soft and slippery from blood they pull off they boot and shoe and secure a firmer footing by fight in they hose it be own say abercromby that both party do wonder but none on either side perform more than the king himself he be again tell that by come to handy blow he could do no more than another man whereas by keep the post due to he station he might be worth many thousand yet he would not only fight in person but also on foot for he no sooner see that body of the english give way which be defeat by the earl of huntley but he alight from he horse and command he guard of nobleman and gentleman to do the like and follow he he have at first abundance of success but at length the lord thoma howard and sir edward stanley who have defeat they opposite come in with the lord dacre 's horse and surround the king 's battalion on all side the scot be so distressed that for they last defense they cast themselves into a ring and be resolve to die nobly with they sovereign who scorn to ask quarter be altogether cut off so say the english writer and i be apt to believe that they be in the right the battle be maintain with desperate fury until nightfall at the close accord to mr tytler surrey be uncertain of the result of the battle : the remains of the enemy 's center still hold the field home with he borderer still hover on the left and the commander wisely allow neither pursuit nor plunder but draw off he man and keep a strict watch during the night when the morning break the scottish artillery be see stand desert on the side of the hill they defender have disappear and the earl order thanks to be give for a victory which be no longer doubtful yet even after all this a body of the scot appear unbroken upon a hill and be about to charge the lord-admiral when they be compel to leave they position by a discharge of the english ordnance the loss of the scot in this fatal battle amount to about ten thousand man of these a great proportion be of high rank the remainder be compose of the gentry the farmer and land yeomanry who disdain to fly when they sovereign and he noble lay stretch in heap around they besides king jame there fall at flodden the archbishop of st andrew 's thirteen earl two bishop two abbot fifteen lord and chief of clan and five peer ' eldest son besides la motte the french ambassador and the secretary of the king the same historian add -- the name of the gentry who fall be too numerous for recapitulation since there be few family of note in scotland which do not lose one relative or another whilst some house have to weep the death of all it be from this cause that the sensation of sorrow and national lamentation occasion by the defeat be peculiarly poignant and lasting -- so that to this day few scotsman can hear the name of flodden without a shudder of gloomy regret the loss to edinburgh on this occasion be peculiarly great all the magistrate and able-bodied citizen have follow they king to flodden whence very few of they return the office of provost or chief magistrate of the capital be at that time a object of ambition and be confer only upon person of high rank and station there seem to be some uncertainty whether the holder of this dignity at the time of the battle of flodden be sir alexander lauder ancestor of the fountainhall family who be elect in 1511 or that great historical personage archibald earl of angus better know as archibald bell-the-cat who be choose in 1513 the year of the battle both of they be at flodden the name of sir alexander lauder appear upon the list of the slay angus be one of the survivor but he son george master of angus fall fight gallantly by the side of king jame the city record of edinburgh which commence about this period be not clear upon the point and i be rather incline to think that the earl of angus be elect to supply the place of lauder but although the actual magistrate be absent they have formally nominate deputy in they stead i find on refer to the city record that george of tour have be appoint to officiate in the absence of the provost and that four other person be select to discharge the office of baily until the magistrate should return it be impossible to describe the consternation which pervade the whole of scotland when the intelligence of the defeat become know in edinburgh it be excessive mr arnot in the history of that city say -- the news of they overthrow in the field of flodden reach edinburgh on the day after the battle and overwhelm the inhabitant with grief and confusion the street be crowd with woman seek intelligence about they friend clamour and weep those who officiate in absence of the magistrate prove themselves worthy of the trust they issue a proclamation order all the inhabitant to assemble in military array for defense of the city on the toll of the bell and command ` that all woman and especially stranger do repair to they work and not be see upon the street _ clamorand and cryand _ and that woman of the better sort do repair to the church and offer up prayer at the state hour for we sovereign lord and he army and the townsman who be with the army ' indeed the council record bear ample evidence of the emergency of that occasion throughout the earlier page the word flowdoun frequently occur on the margin in reference to various hurry order for arm and defense and there can be no doubt that have the english force attempt to follow up they victory and attack the scottish capital the citizen would have resist to the last but it soon become apparent that the loss sustain by the english be so severe that surrey be in no condition to avail himself of the opportunity and in fact shortly afterwards he be compel to disband he army the reference to the city banner contain in the follow poem may require a word of explanation it be a standard still hold in great honor and reverence by the burgher of edinburgh have be present to they by jame the third in return for they loyal service in 1482 this banner along with that of the earl marischal still conspicuous in the library of the faculty of advocate be honourably bring back from flodden and certainly never could have be display in a more memorable field maitland say with reference to this very interesting relic of antiquity -- as a perpetual remembrance of the loyalty and bravery of the edinburgher on the aforesaid occasion the king grant they a banner or standard with a power to display the same in defense of they king country and they own rights this flag be keep by the convener of the trade at whose appearance therewith it be say that not only the artificer of edinburgh be oblige to repair to it but all the artisan or craftsman within scotland be bind to follow it and fight under the convener of edinburgh as aforesaid no event in scottish history ever take a more lasting hold of the public mind than the woeful fight of flodden and even now the song and tradition which be current on the border recall the memory of a contest unsullied by disgrace though terminate in disaster and defeat edinburgh after flodden i news of battle -- news of battle hark ` tis ring down the street : and the archway and the pavement bear the clang of hurry foot news of battle who have bring it news of triumph who should bring tiding from we noble army greeting from we gallant king all last night we watch the beacon blaze on the hill afar each one bearing as it kindle message of the open war all night long the northern streamer shoot across the tremble sky : fearful light that never beckon save when king or hero die ii news of battle who have bring it all be throng to the gate warder -- warder open quickly man -- be this a time to wait and the heavy gate be open : then a murmur long and loud and a cry of fear and wonder burst from out the bend crowd for they see in battered harness only one hard-stricken man and he weary steed be wound and he cheek be pale and wan spearless hang a bloody banner in he weak and drooping hand -- god can that be randolph murray captain of the city band iii round he crush the people cry tell we all -- oh tell we true where be they who go to battle randolph murray swear to you where be they we brother -- child have they meet the english foe why art thou alone unfollowed be it weal or be it woe like a corpse the grisly warrior look from out he helm of steel but no word he speak in answer only with he armèd heel chide he weary steed and onward up the city street they ride father sister mother child shriek pray by he side by the god that make thee randolph tell we what mischance have come then he lift he riven banner and the asker 's voice be dumb iv the elder of the city have meet within they hall -- the man whom good king jame have charge to watch the tower and wall you hand be weak with age he say you heart be stout and true so bide ye in the maiden town while other fight for you my trumpet from the border-side shall send a blast so clear that all who wait within the gate that stir sound may hear or if it be the will of heaven that back i never come and if instead of scottish shout ye hear the english drum -- then let the warning bell ring out then gird you to the fray then man the wall like burgher stout and fight while fight you may ' t be better that in fiery flame the roof should thunder down than that the foot of foreign foe should trample in the town v then in come randolph murray -- he step be slow and weak and as he doff he dinted helm the tear run down he cheek : they fall upon he corslet and on he mailèd hand as he gaze around he wistfully lean sorely on he brand and none who then behold he but straight be smote with fear for a bolder and a sterner man have never couch a spear they know so sad a messenger some ghastly news must bring : and all of they be father and they son be with the king vi and up then rise the provost -- a brave old man be he of ancient name and knightly fame and chivalrous degree he rule we city like a lord who brook no equal here and ever for the townsman 's rights stand up ` gainst prince and peer and he have see the scottish host march from the borough-muir with music-storm and clamorous shout and all the din that thunder out when youth 's of victory sure but yet a dearer thought have he for with a father 's pride he see he last remaining son go forth by randolph 's side with casque on head and spur on heel all keen to do and dare and proudly do that gallant boy dunedin 's banner bear oh woeful now be the old man 's look and he speak right heavily -- now randolph tell thy tiding however sharp they be woe be write on thy visage death be look from thy face : speak though it be of overthrow -- it can not be disgrace vii right bitter be the agony that wring the soldier proud : thrice do he strive to answer and thrice he groan aloud then he give the riven banner to the old man 's shake hand say -- that be all i bring ye from the bravest of the land ay ye may look upon it -- it be guard well and long by you brother and you child by the valiant and the strong one by one they fall around it as the archer lay they low grimly die still unconquered with they face to the foe ay ye well may look upon it -- there be more than honor there else be sure i have not bring it from the field of dark despair never yet be royal banner steep in such a costly dye it have lain upon a bosom where no other shroud shall lie sir i charge you keep it holy keep it as a sacred thing for the stain you see upon it be the life-blood of you king viii woe woe and lamentation what a piteous cry be there widow maiden mother child shriek sob in despair through the street the death-word rush spread terror sweeping on -- jesu christ we king have fall -- o great god king jame be go holy mother mary shield we thou who erst do lose thy son o the blackest day for scotland that she ever know before o we king -- the good the noble shall we see he never more woe to we and woe to scotland o we son we son and man surely some have ` scap the southron surely some will come again till the oak that fall last winter shall uprear its shattered stem -- wife and mother of dunedin -- ye may look in vain for they ix but within the council chamber all be silent as the grave whilst the tempest of they sorrow shake the bosom of the brave well indeed might they be shake with the weight of such a blow : he be go -- they prince they idol whom they love and worship so like a knell of death and judgment ring from heaven by angel hand fall the word of desolation on the elder of the land hoary head be bow and tremble withered hand be clasp and wring : god have leave the old and feeble he have ta'en away the young x then the provost he uprose and he lip be ashen white but a flush be on he brow and he eye be full of light thou hast speak randolph murray like a soldier stout and true thou hast do a deed of daring have be perill but by few for thou hast not shame to face we nor to speak thy ghastly tale standing -- thou a knight and captain -- here alive within thy mail now as my god shall judge I i hold it braver do than hadst thou tarry in thy place and die above my son thou needst not tell it : he be dead god help we all this day but speak -- how fight the citizen within the furious fray for by the might of mary ' t be something still to tell that no scottish foot go backward when the royal lion fall xi no one fail he he be keep royal state and semblance still knight and noble lie around he cold on flodden 's fatal hill of the brave and gallant-hearted whom ye send with prayer away not a single man depart from he monarch yesterday have you see they o my master when the night begin to fall and the english spearman gather round a grim and ghastly wall as the wolf in winter circle round the leaguer on the heath so the greedy foe glare upward pant still for blood and death but a rampart rise before they which the boldest dare not scale every stone a scottish body every step a corpse in mail and behind it lay we monarch clench still he shivered sword : by he side montrose and athole at he foot a southern lord all so thick they lay together when the star light up the sky that i know not who be stricken or who yet remain to die few there be when surrey halted and he wearied host withdraw none but die man around I when the english trumpet blow then i stooped and take the banner as ye see it from he breast and i close we hero 's eyelid and i leave he to he rest in the mountain growl the thunder as i leap the woeful wall and the heavy cloud be settle over flodden like a pall xii so he end and the other care not any answer then sit silent dumb with sorrow sit anguish-struck like man who have see the roar torrent sweep they happy home away and yet linger by the margin stare idly on the spray but without the maddening tumult wax ever more and more and the crowd of wail woman gather round the council door every dusky spire be ring with a dull and hollow knell and the miserere 's singing to the toll of the bell through the street the burgher hurry spread terror as they go and the rampart 's throng with watcher for the come of the foe from each mountain-top a pillar stream into the torpid air bearing token from the border that the english host be there all without be flight and terror all within be woe and fear -- god protect thee maiden city for thy latest hour be near xiii no not yet thou high dunedin shalt thou totter to thy fall though thy bravest and thy strongest be not there to man the wall no not yet the ancient spirit of we father have not go take it to thee as a buckler better far than steel or stone oh remember those who perish for thy birthright at the time when to be a scot be treason and to side with wallace crime have they not a voice among we whilst they hallowed dust be here hear ye not a summons sound from each bury warrior 's bier up -- they say -- and keep the freedom which we win you long ago : up and keep we grave unsullied from the insult of the foe up and if ye can not save they come to we in blood and fire : midst the crash of fall turret let the last of scot expire xiv still the bell be toll fiercely and the cry come louder in mother wail for they child sister for they slaughter kin all be terror and disorder till the provost rise up calm as though he have not taste of the fell and bitter cup all so stately from he sorrow rise the old undaunted chief that you have not deem to see he he be more than common grief rouse ye sir he say we may not longer mourn for what be do : if we king be take from we we be leave to guard he son we have swear to keep the city from the foe whate'er they be and the oath that we have take never shall be break by I death be nearer to we brethren than it seem to those who die fight yesterday at flodden by they lord and master 's side let we meet it then in patience not in terror or in fear though we heart be bleed yonder let we soul be steadfast here up and rouse ye time be fleeting and we yet have much to do up and haste ye through the city stir the burgher stout and true gather all we scattered people fling the banner out once more -- randolph murray do thou bear it as it erst be bear before : never scottish heart will leave it when they see they monarch 's gore xv let they cease that dismal knell it be time enough to ring when the fortress-strength of scotland stoop to ruin like its king let the bell be keep for warn not for terror or alarm when they next be hear to thunder let each man and striple arm bid the woman leave they wail -- do they think that woeful strain from the bloody heap of flodden can redeem they dearest slay bid they cease -- or rather hasten to the church every one there to pray to mary mother and to she anointed son that the thunderbolt above we may not fall in ruin yet that in fire and blood and rapine scotland 's glory may not set let they pray -- for never woman stand in need of such a prayer england 's yeomen shall not find they cling to the altar there no if we be doom to perish man and maiden let we fall and a common gulf of ruin open wide to whelm we all never shall the ruthless spoiler lay he hot insulting hand on the sister of we hero whilst we bear a torch or brand up and rouse ye then my brother but when next ye hear the bell sound forth the sullen summons that may be we funeral knell once more let we meet together once more see each other 's face then like man that need not tremble go to we appoint place god we father will not fail we in that last tremendous hour -- if all other bulwark crumble he will be we strength and tower : though the rampart rock beneath we and the wall go crash down though the roar of conflagration bellow o'er the sink town there be yet one place of shelter where the foeman can not come where the summons never sound of the trumpet or the drum there again we 'll meet we child who on flodden 's trampled sod for they king and for they country render up they soul to god there shall we find rest and refuge with we dear depart brave and the ash of the city be we universal grave the execution of montrose the most poetical chronicler would find it impossible to render the incident of montrose 's brilliant career more picturesque than the reality among the devoted champion who during the wildest and most stormy period of we history maintain the cause of church and king the great marquis undoubtedly be entitle to the foremost place even party malevolence by no means extinct at the present day have be unable to detract from the eulogy pronounce upon he by the famous cardinal de retz the friend of condé and turenne when he thus sum up he character : -- montrose a scottish nobleman head of the house of grahame -- the only man in the world that have ever realize to I the idea of certain hero whom we now discover nowhere but in the life of plutarch -- have sustain in he own country the cause of the king he master with a greatness of soul that have not find its equal in we age but the success of the victorious leader and patriot be almost throw into the shade by the noble magnanimity and christian heroism of the man in the hour of defeat and death without wish in any degree to revive a controversy long maintain by writer of opposite political and polemical opinion it may fairly be state that scottish history do not present we with a tragedy of parallel interest that the execution of montrose be the natural nay the inevitable consequence of he capture may be freely admit even by the fiercest partisan of the cause for which he stake he life in those time neither party be dispose to lenity and montrose be far too conspicuous a character and too dangerous a man to be forgive but the ignominious and savage treatment which he receive at the hand of those whose station and descent should at least have teach they to respect misfortune have leave a indelible stain upon the memory of the covenant chief and more especially upon that of argyle the perfect serenity of the man in the hour of trial and death the courage and magnanimity which he display to the last have be dwell upon with admiration by writer of every class he hear he sentence deliver without any apparent emotion and afterwards tell the magistrate who wait upon he in prison that he be much indebted to the parliament for the great honor they have decree he add that he be prouder to have he head place upon the top of the prison than if they have decree a golden statue to be erect to he in the market-place or that he picture should be hang in the king 's bedchamber he say he thank they for they care to preserve the remembrance of he loyalty by transmit such monument to the different part of the kingdom and only wish that he have flesh enough to have send a piece to every city in christendom as a token of he unshaken love and fidelity to he king and country on the night before he execution he inscribe the follow line with a diamond on the window of he jail : -- let they bestow on every airth a limb then open all my vein that i may swim to thee my maker in that crimson lake then place my parboiled head upon a stake -- scatter my ash -- strew they in the air : lord since thou know ` st where all these atom be i be hopeful thou ` lt recover once my dust and confident thou ` lt raise I with the just after the restoration the dust _ be _ recover the scatter remnant collect and the bone of the hero convey to they final resting-place by a numerous assemblage of gentleman of he family and name there be no ingredient of fiction in the historical incident record in the follow ballad the indignity that be heap upon montrose during he procession through edinburgh he appearance before the estate and he last passage to the scaffold as well as he undaunted bearing have all be speak to by eyewitness of the scene a graphic and vivid sketch of the whole will be find in mr mark napier 's volume _ the life and time of montrose _ -- a work as chivalrous in its tone as the _ chronicle _ of froissart and abound in original and most interesting material but in order to satisfy all scruple the authority for each fact be give in the shape of note the ballad may be consider as a narrative of the transaction relate by a aged highlander who have follow montrose throughout he campaign to he grandson shortly before the battle of killiecrankie the execution of montrose i come hither evan cameron come stand beside my knee -- i hear the river roar down towards the wintry sea there be shout on the mountain side there be war within the blast -- old face look upon I old form go troop past i hear the pibroch wail amidst the din of fight and my dim spirit wake again upon the verge of night ii 'twas i that lead the highland host through wild lochaber 's snow what time the plaided clan come down to battle with montrose i have tell thee how the southron fall beneath the broad claymore and how we smite the campbell clan by inverlochy 's shore i have tell thee how we sweep dundee and tame the lindsay 's pride but never have i tell thee yet how the great marquis die iii a traitor sell he to he foe o deed of deathless shame i charge thee boy if e'er thou meet with one of assynt 's name -- be it upon the mountain 's side or yet within the glen stand he in martial gear alone or back by armèd man -- face he as thou wouldst face the man who wrong thy sire 's renown remember of what blood thou art and strike the caitiff down iv they bring he to the watergate hard bind with hempen span as though they hold a lion there and not a ` fenceless man they set he high upon a cart -- the hangman ride below -- they draw he hand behind he back and bare he noble brow then as a hound be slip from leash they cheer the common throng and blow the note with yell and shout and bid he pass along v it would have make a brave man 's heart grow sad and sick that day to watch the keen malignant eye bent down on that array there stand the whig west-country lord in balcony and bow there sit they gaunt and withered dame and they daughter all a-row and every open window be full as full might be with black-robed covenanting carle that goodly sport to see vi but when he come though pale and wan he look so great and high so noble be he manly front so calm he steadfast eye -- the rabble rout forebore to shout and each man hold he breath for well they know the hero 's soul be face to face with death and then a mournful shudder through all the people creep and some that come to scoff at he now turn would aside and weep vii but onward -- always onward in silence and in gloom the dreary pageant labor till it reach would the house of doom : then first a woman 's voice be hear in jeer and laughter loud and a angry cry and a hiss arise from the heart of the toss crowd : then as the græme look upward he meet the ugly smile of he who sell he king for gold -- the master-fiend argyle viii the marquis gaze a moment and nothing do he say but the cheek of argyle grow ghastly pale and he turn he eye away the paint harlot by he side she shake through every limb for a roar like thunder sweep the street and hand be clench at he and a saxon soldier cry aloud back coward from thy place for seven long year thou hast not dare to look he in the face ix have i be there with sword in hand and fifty cameron by that day through high dunedin 's street have peal the slogan cry not all they troops of trample horse nor might of mailèd man -- not all the rebel of the south have bear we backwards then once more he foot on highland heath have tread as free as air or i and all who bear my name be lay around he there x it might not be they place he next within the solemn hall where once the scottish king be thron amidst they noble all but there be dust of vulgar foot on that polluted floor and perjure traitor fill the place where good man sate before with savage glee come warristoun to read the murderous doom and then uprise the great montrose in the middle of the room xi now by my faith as belted knight and by the name i bear and by the bright saint andrew 's cross that wave above we there -- yea by a greater mightier oath -- and oh that such should be -- by that dark stream of royal blood that lie ` twixt you and I -- i have not seek in battle-field a wreath of such renown nor dare i hope on my die day to win the martyr 's crown xii there be a chamber far away where sleep the good and brave but a better place ye have name for I than by my father 's grave for truth and right ` gainst treason 's might this hand have always strive and ye raise it up for a witness still in the eye of earth and heaven then nail my head on yonder tower -- give every town a limb -- and god who make shall gather they : i go from you to he xiii the morning dawn full darkly the rain come flash down and the jagged streak of the levin-bolt light up the gloomy town : the heaven be thunder out they wrath the fatal hour be come yet ever sound sullenly the trumpet and the drum there be madness on the earth below and anger in the sky and young and old and rich and poor come forth to see he die xiv ah god that ghastly gibbet how dismal ' t be to see the great tall spectral skeleton the ladder and the tree hark hark it be the clash of arm -- the bell begin to toll -- he be come he be come god 's mercy on he soul one last long peal of thunder -- the cloud be clear away and the glorious sun once more look down amidst the dazzling day xv he be come he be come like a bridegroom from he room come the hero from he prison to the scaffold and the doom there be glory on he forehead there be lustre in he eye and he never walk to battle more proudly than to die : there be color in he visage though the cheek of all be wan and they marvel as they see he pass that great and goodly man xvi he mount up the scaffold and he turn he to the crowd but they dare not trust the people so he might not speak aloud but he look upon the heaven and they be clear and blue and in the liquid ether the eye of god shone through : yet a black and murky battlement lay rest on the hill as though the thunder sleep within -- all else be calm and still xvii the grim geneva minister with anxious scowl draw near as you have see the raven flock around the die deer he would not deign they word nor sign but alone he bent the knee and veil he face for christ 's dear grace beneath the gallows-tree then radiant and serene he rise and cast he cloak away : for he have ta'en he latest look of earth and sun and day xviii a beam of light fall o'er he like a glory round the shriven and he climb the lofty ladder as it be the path to heaven then come a flash from out the cloud and a stunning thunder roll and no man dare to look aloft for fear be on every soul there be another heavy sound a hush and then a groan and darkness sweep across the sky -- the work of death be do note to the execution of montrose _ a traitor sell he to he foe _ -- p 36 the contemporary historian of the earl of sutherland record that -lrb- after the defeat of invercarron -rrb- montrose and kinnoul ` wander up the river kyle the whole ensue night and the next day and the

kirk the heart in fair melrose and woeful man be we that day -- god grant they soul repose the burial march of dundee it be very much to be regret that no competent person have as yet undertake the task of compile a full and authentic biography of lord viscount dundee he memory have consequently be leave at the mercy of misrepresentation and malignity and the pen of romance have be freely employ to portray as a bloody assassin one of the most accomplished man and gallant soldier of he age it be the misfortune of claverhouse to have live in so troublous a age and country the religious difference of scotland be then at they greatest height and there be hardly any act of atrocity and rebellion which have not be commit by the insurgent the royal authority be openly and publicly disown in the western district : the archbishop of st andrew 's after more than one hairbreadth escape be waylay and barbarously murder by a armed gang of fanatic on magus muir and he daughter be wound and maltreat while intercede for the old man 's life the country be infested by bandit who take every possible opportunity of shoot down and massacre any of the straggling soldiery : the clergy be attack and drive from they house so that throughout a considerable portion of scotland there be no security either for property or for life it be now the fashion to praise and magnify the covenanter as the most innocent and persecute of man but those who be so ready with they sympathy rarely take the pain to satisfy themselves by reference to the annals of the time of the true character of those man whom they blindly venerate as martyr they forget in they zeal for religious freedom that even the purest and holiest of cause may be sully and disgrace by the deed of its upholder and that a wild and frantic profession of faith be not always a test of genuine piety it be not in the slightest degree necessary to discuss whether the royal prerogative be at that time arbitrarily use or whether the religious freedom of the nation be unduly curtail both point may be and indeed be admit -- for it be impossible to vindicate the policy of the measure adopt by the two last monarch of the house of stuart but neither admission will clear the covenanter from the stain of deliberate cruelty after the battle of philiphaugh the royalist prisoner be butcher in cold blood under the superintendence of a clerical emissary who stand by rub he hand and exclaim -- the wark gang bonnily on be i to transcribe from the pamphlet before I the list of the murder which be perpetrate by the country people on the soldiery officer and gentleman of loyal principle during the reign of charle ii i believe that no candid person would be surprise at the severe retaliation which be make it must be remember that the country be then under military law and that the strongest order have be issue by the government to the officer in command of the troops to use every means in they power for the effectual repression of the disturbance the necessity of such order will become apparent when we reflect that besides the open action at aird 's moss and drumclog the city of glasgow be attack and the royal force compel for a time to fall back upon stirl under such circumstance it be no wonder if the soldiery be severe in they reprisal innocent blood may no doubt have be shed and in some case even wantonly for when rebellion have grow into civil war and the ordinary course of the law be put in abeyance it be always impossible to restrain military license but it be most unfair to lay the whole odium of such act upon those who be in command and to dishonor the fair name of gentleman by attribute to they personally the commission of deed of which they be absolutely ignorant to this day the peasantry of the western district of scotland entertain the idea that claverhouse be a sort of fiend in human shape tall muscular and hideous in aspect secure by infernal spell from the chance of perish by any ordinary weapon and mount upon a huge black horse the especial gift of beelzebub on this charger it be suppose that he could ride up precipice as easily as he could traverse the level ground -- that he be constantly accompany by a body of desperado vulgarly know by such euphonious title as hell 's tam and the de'il 's jock and that he whole time be occupy day and night in hunting covenanter upon the hill almost every rebel who be take in arm and shot be suppose to have meet he death from the individual pistol of claverhouse and the tale which from time to time have be write by such ingenious person as the late mr gait and the ettrick shepherd have quietly be assume as fact and add to the store of we traditionary knowledge it be in vain to hint that the chief commander of the force in scotland could have find little leisure even have they possess the taste for pursue single insurgent such suggestion be a insult to martyrology and many a parish of the west would be indignant be it aver that the tenant of its gray stone have suffer by a meaner hand when we look at the portrait of claverhouse and survey the calm melancholy and beautiful feature of the devoted soldier it appear almost incredible that he should ever have suffer under such a overwhelming load of misrepresentation but when -- discard modern historian who in too many instance do not seem to entertain the slightest scruple in deal with the memory of the dead -- we turn to the writings of he contemporary who know the man he character appear in a very different light they describe he as one who be stainless in he honor pure in he faith wise in council resolute in action and utterly free from that selfishness which disgrace the scottish statesman of the time no one dare question he loyalty for he seal that confession with he blood and it be universally admit that with he fall the last hope of the reinstatement of the house of stuart i may perhaps be permit here in the absence of a better chronicler to mention a few particulars of he life which i believe be comparatively unknown john graham of claverhouse be a cadet of the family of fintrie connect by intermarriage with the blood-royal of scotland after complete he study at the university of st andrew 's he enter as be the national custom for gentleman of good birth and limited means into foreign service serve some time in france as a volunteer and afterwards go to holland he very soon receive a commission as a cornet in a regiment of horse-guard from the prince of orange nephew of charle ii and jame vii and who afterwards marry the princess mary he manner at that time be thus describe : -- he be then ane esquire under the title of john graham of claverhouse but the vivacity of he part and the delicacy and justice of he understanding and judgment joyne with a certain vigor of mind and activity of body distinguish he in such a manner from all other of he rank that though he live in a superior character yet he acquire the love and esteem of all he equal as well as of those who have the advantage of he in dignity and estate by one of those singular accident which we occasionally meet with in history graham afterwards destine to become he most formidable opponent save the life of the prince of orange at the battle of st neff the prince 's horse have be kill and he himself be in the grasp of the enemy when the young cornet ride to he rescue free he from he assailant and mount he on he own steed for this service he receive a captain 's commission and the promise of the first regiment that should fall vacant but even in early life william of orange be not famous for keep he promise some year afterwards a vacancy in one of the scottish regiment in the prince 's service occur and claverhouse rely upon the previous assurance prefer he claim it be disregard and mr collier afterwards earl of portmore be appoint over he head it would seem that graham have suspect some foul play on the part of this gentleman for shortly after they accidentally meet and have a angry altercation this circumstance have come to the ear of the prince he send for captain graham and administer a sharp rebuke i give the remainder of this incident in the word of the old writer because it must be consider a very remarkable one as illustrate the fiery spirit and dauntless independence of claverhouse the captain answer that he be indeed in the wrong since it be more he highness 's business to have resent that quarrel than he because mr collier have less injured he in disappointing he of the regiment than he have do he highness in make he break he word ` then ' reply the prince in a angry tone ' i make you full reparation for i bestow on you what be more valuable than a regiment when i give you you right arm ' the captain subjoin that since he highness have the goodness to give he he liberty he resolve to employ himself elsewhere for he would not longer serve a prince that have break he word the captain have thus throw up he commission be prepare in haste for he voyage when a messenger arrive from the prince with two hundred guinea for the horse on which he have save he life the captain send the horse but order the gold to be distribute among the groom of the prince 's stable it be say however that he highness have the generosity to write to the king and the duke recommend he as a fine gentleman and a brave officer fit for any office civil or military on he arrival in britain he be well receive by the court and immediately appoint to a high military command in scotland it would be beyond the scope of the present paper to enter minutely into the detail of he service during the stormy period when scotland be certainly misgovern and when there be little unity but much disorder in the land in whatever point of view we regard the history of those time the aspect be a mournful one indeed church and state never be a popular cry in scotland and the peculiar religious tendency which have be exhibit by a large portion of the nation at the time of the reformation render the return of tranquillity hopeless until the hierarchy be displaced and a humbler form of church government more suit to the feeling of the people substitute in its stead three year after the accession of jame vii claverhouse be raise to the peerage by the title of lord viscount dundee he be major-general and second in command of the royal force when the prince of orange land and earnestly entreat king jame to be allow to march against he offer to stake he head on the successful result of the enterprize there be little doubt from the great popularity of lord dundee with the army that have such consent be give william would have find more than a match in he old officer but the king seem absolutely infatuated and refuse to allow a drop of blood to be shed in he quarrel though the great bulk of the population of england be clearly and enthusiastically in he favor one of the most gifted of we modern poet the honorable george sydney smythe have beautifully illustrate this event then out spake gallant claverhouse and he soul thrill wild and high and he show the king he subject and he pray he not to fly o never yet be captain so dauntless as dundee he have swear to chase the hollander back to he zuyder-zee but though jame quit he kingdom the stern loyalty of dundee be nothing move alone and without escort he traverse england and present himself at the convention of estate then assemble at edinburgh for the purpose of receive the message from the prince of orange the meeting be a very strange one many of the nobility and former member of the scottish parliament absolutely decline attend it some on the ground that it be not a legal assembly have be summon by the prince of orange and other because in such a total disruption of order they judge it safest to abstain from take any prominent part this give a immense ascendency to the revolution party who further proceed to strengthen they position by invite to edinburgh large body of the armed population of the west after defend for several day the cause of he master with as much eloquence as vigor dundee finding that the majority of the convention be resolve to offer the crown of scotland to the prince and have moreover receive sure information that some of the wild fanatic whig with daniel ker of kersland at they head have form a plot for he assassination quit edinburgh with about fifty horseman and after a short interview -- celebrate by sir walter scott in one of he grandest ballad -- with the duke of gordon at the castle rock direct he step towards the north after a short stay at he house of duddope during which he receive by order of the council who be thoroughly alarm at he absence a summons through a lyon herald to return to edinburgh under pain of high treason he pass into the gordon country where he be join by the earl of dunfermline with a small party of about sixty horse he retreat be timeous for general mackay who command for the prince of orange have despatch a strong force with instruction to make he prisoner from this time until the day of he death he allow himself no repose imitate the example and inherit the enthusiasm of he great predecessor montrose he invoke the loyalty of the clan to assist he in the struggle for legitimacy -- and he do not appeal to they in vain he name be a spell to rouse the ardent spirit of the mountaineer and not the great marquis himself in the height of he renown be more sincerely welcome and more fondly love than ian dhu nan cath -- dark john of the battle -- the name by which lord dundee be still remember in highland song in the mean time the convention terrify at they danger and dread a highland inroad have despatch mackay a military officer of great experience with a considerable body of troops to quell the threaten insurrection he be encounter by dundee and compel to evacuate the high country and fall back upon the lowland where he subsequently receive reinforcement and again march northward the highland host be assemble at blair though not in great force when the news of mackay 's advance arrive and a council of the chief and officer be summon to determine whether it would be most advisable to fall back upon the glen and wild fastness of the highland or to meet the enemy at once though with a force far inferior to he most of the old officer who have be train in the foreign war be of the former opinion -- allege that it be neither prudent nor cautious to risk a engagement against a army of disciplined man that exceed theirs in number by more than a half but both glengarry and locheill to the great satisfaction of the general maintain the contrary view and argue that neither hunger nor fatigue be so likely to depress the highlander as a retreat when the enemy be in view the account of the discussion be so interesting and so characteristic of dundee that i shall take leave to quote its termination in the word of drummond of balhaldy : a advice so hardy and resolute could not miss to please the generous dundee he look seem to heighten with a air of delight and satisfaction all the while locheill be speak he tell he council that they have hear he sentiment from the mouth of a person who have form he judgment upon infallible proof draw from a long experience and a intimate acquaintance with the person and subject he speak of not one in the company offer to contradict they general it be unanimously agree to fight when the news of this vigorous resolution spread through the army nothing be hear but acclamation of joy which exceedingly please they gallant general but before the council break up locheill beg to be hear for a few word ` my lord ' say he ' i have just now declare in the presence of this honorable company that i be resolve to give a implicit obedience to all you lordship 's command but i humbly beg leave in name of these gentleman to give the word of command for this one time it be the voice of you council and they order be that you do not engage personally you lordship 's business be to have a eye on all part and to issue out you command as you shall think proper it be ours to execute they with promptitude and courage on you lordship depend the fate not only of this little brave army but also of we king and country if you lordship deny we this reasonable demand for my own part i declare that neither i nor any i be concern in shall draw a sword on this important occasion whatever construction shall be put upon the matter ' locheill be second in this by the whole council but dundee begged leave to be hear in he turn ` gentleman ' say he ` as i be absolutely convinced and have have repeat proof of you zeal for the king 's service and of you affection to I as he general and you friend so i be fully sensible that my engaging personally this day may be of some loss if i shall chance to be kill but i beg leave of you however to allow I to give one _ shear-darg _ -lrb- that be one harvest-day 's work -rrb- to the king my master that i may have a opportunity of convince the brave clan that i can hazard my life in that service as freely as the meanest of they ye know they temper gentleman and if they do not think i have personal courage enough they will not esteem I hereafter nor obey my command with cheerfulness allow I this single favor and i here promise upon my honor never again to risk my person while i have that of command you ' the council find he inflexible break up and the army march directly towards the pass of killiecrankie those who have visit that romantic spot need not be remind of its peculiar feature for these once see must dwell for ever in the memory the lower part of the pass be a stupendous mountain-chasm scoop out by the water of the garry which here descend in a succession of roar cataract and pool the old road which run almost parallel to the river and close upon its edge be extremely narrow and wind its way beneath a wall of enormous crag surmount by a natural forest of birch oak and pine a army coop up in that gloomy ravine would have as little chance of escape from the onset of a enterprising partisan corps as have the bavarian troops when attack by the tyrolese in the steep defile of the inn general mackay however have make he arrangement with consummate tact and skill and have calculate he time so well that he be enable to clear the pass before the highlander could reach it from the other side advance upward the passage become gradually broader until just below the house of urrard there be a considerable width of meadow-land it be here that mackay take up he position and array he troops on observe that the height above be occupy by the army of dundee the force of the latter scarcely amount to one-third of those of he antagonist which be draw up in line without any reserve he be therefore compel in make he disposition to leave considerable gap in he own line which give mackay a further advantage the right of dundee 's army be form of the m ` lean glengarry and clanranald regiment along with some irish levy in the center be dundee himself at the head of a small and ill-equipped body of cavalry compose of lowland gentleman and they follower and about forty of he old trooper the cameron and skyeman under the command of locheill and sir donald macdonald of sleat be station on the leave during the time occupy by these disposition a brisk cannonade be open by mackay 's artillery which materially increase the impatience of the highlander to come to close quarter at last the word be give to advance and the whole line rush forward with the terrific impetuosity peculiar to a charge of the clan they receive the fire of the regular troops without flinch reserve they own until they be close at hand pour in a murderous volley and then throw away they firelock attack the enemy with the broadsword the victory be almost instantaneous but it be buy at a terrible price through some mistake or misunderstanding a portion of the cavalry instead of follow they general who have charge directly for the gun execute a maneuver which throw they into disorder and when last see in the battle dundee accompany only by the earl of dunfermline and about sixteen gentleman be enter into the cloud of smoke stand up in he stirrup and wave to the other to come on it be in this attitude that he appear to have receive he death-wound on return from the pursuit the highlander find he die on the field it would he difficult to point out another instance in which the maintenance of a great cause depend solely upon the life of a single man whilst dundee survive scotland at least be not lose to the stuart for shortly before the battle he have receive assurance that the greater part of the organised troops in the north be devote to he person and ready to join he and the victory of killiecrankie would have be follow by a general rising of the loyal gentleman in the lowland but with he fall the enterprise be over i hope i shall not be accuse of exaggerate the importance of this battle which accord to the writer i have already quote be best prove by the consternation into which the opposite party be throw at the first news of mackay 's defeat the duke of hamilton commissioner for the parliament which then sit at edinburgh and the rest of the ministry be strike with such a panic that some of they be for retire into england other into the western shire of scotland where all the people almost to a man befriend they nor know they whether to abandon the government or to stay a few day until they see what use my lord dundee would make of he victory they know the rapidity of he motion and be convince that he would allow they no time to deliberate on this account it be debate whether such of the nobility and gentry as be confine for adhering to they old master should be immediately set at liberty or more closely shut up and though the last be determine on yet the greatest revolutionist among they make private and frequent visit to these prisoner excuse what be past from a fatal necessity of the time which oblige they to give a seeming compliance but protest that they always wish well to king jame as they should soon have occasion to show when my lord dundee advance the next morning after the battle say drummond the highland army have more the air of the shatter remains of broken troops than of conqueror for here it be literally true that ` the vanquish triumph and the victor mourn ' the death of they brave general and the loss of so many of they friend be inexhaustible fountain of grief and sorrow they close the last scene of this mournful tragedy in obsequy of they lament general and of the other gentleman who fall with he and inter they in the church of blair of atholl with a real funeral solemnity there not be present one single person who do not participate in the general affliction i close this notice of a great soldier and devoted loyalist by transcribe the beautiful epitaph compose by dr pitcairn : -- ultime scotorum potuit quo sospite solo liberta patriæ salva fuisse tuæ : te moriente novos accepit scotium cive accepitque novo te moriente deos illa nequit superesse tibi tu non pote illi ergo caledoniæ nomen inane vale tuque vale genti priscæ fortissime ductor ultime scotorum ac ultime grame vale the burial march of dundee sound the fife and cry the slogan -- let the pibroch shake the air with its wild triumphal music worthy of the freight we bear let the ancient hill of scotland hear once more the battle-song swell within they glen and valley as the clansman march along never from the field of combat never from the deadly fray be a nobler trophy carry than we bring with we to-day never since the valiant dougla on he dauntless bosom bear good king robert 's heart -- the priceless -- to we dear redeemer 's shore lo we bring with we the hero -- lo we bring the conquer græme crown as best beseem a victor from the altar of he fame fresh and bleeding from the battle whence he spirit take its flight midst the crash charge of squadron and the thunder of the fight strike i say the note of triumph as we march o'er moor and lea be there any here will venture to bewail we dead dundee let the widow of the traitor weep until they eye be dim wail ye may full well for scotland -- let none dare to mourn for he see above he glorious body lie the royal banner 's fold -- see he valiant blood be mingle with its crimson and its gold see how calm he look and stately like a warrior on he shield wait till the flush of morning break along the battle-field see -- oh never more my comrade shall we see that falcon eye redden with its inward lightning as the hour of fight draw nigh never shall we hear the voice that clearer than the trumpet 's call bid we strike for king and country bid we win the field or fall on the height of killiecrankie yester-morn we army lay : slowly rise the mist in column from the river 's broken way hoarsely roar the swollen torrent and the pass be wrap in gloom when the clansman rise together from they lair amidst the broom then we belt on we tartan and we bonnet down we draw and we feel we broadsword ' edge and we prove they to be true and we pray the prayer of soldier and we cry the gathering-cry and we clasp the hand of kinsman and we swear to do or die then we leader ride before we on he war-horse black as night -- well the cameronian rebel know that charger in the fight -- and a cry of exultation from the bearded warrior rise for we love the house of claver ` se and we think of good montrose but he raise he hand for silence -- soldier i have swear a vow : ere the evening-star shall glisten on schehallion 's lofty brow either we shall rest in triumph or another of the graeme shall have die in battle-harness for he country and king jame think upon the royal martyr -- think of what he race endure -- think on he whom butcher murder would on the field of magus muir : -- by he sacred blood i charge ye by the ruin would hearth and shrine -- by the blighted hope of scotland by you injury and mine -- strike this day as if the anvil lay beneath you blow the while be they covenant traitor or the brood of false argyle strike and drive the tremble rebel backwards o'er the stormy forth let they tell they pale convention how they fare within the north let they tell that highland honor be not to be buy nor sell that we scorn they prince 's anger as we loathe he foreign gold strike and when the fight be over if ye look in vain for I where the dead be lie thickest search for he that be dundee loudly then the hill re-echo with we answer to he call but a deeper echo sound in the bosom of we all for the land of wide breadalbane not a man who hear he speak would that day have leave the battle burning eye and flushing cheek tell the clansman 's fierce emotion and they harder draw they breath for they soul be strong within they stronger than the grasp of death soon we hear a challenge-trumpet sound in the pass below and the distant tramp of horse and the voice of the foe : down we crouch amid the bracken till the lowland rank draw near panting like the hound in summer when they scent the stately deer from the dark defile emerge next we see the squadron come leslie 's foot and leven 's trooper march to the tuck of drum through the scatter wood of birch o'er the broken ground and heath wind the long battalion slowly till they gain the field beneath then we bound from we covert -- judge how look the saxon then when they see the rugged mountain start to life with armèd man like a tempest down the ridge sweep the hurricane of steel rise the slogan of macdonald -- flash the broadsword of locheill vainly speed the withering volley ` mongst the foremost of we band -- on we pour until we meet they foot to foot and hand to hand horse and man go down like drift-wood when the flood be black at yule and they carcass be whirling in the garry 's deepest pool horse and man go down before we -- live foe there tarry none on the field of killiecrankie when that stubborn fight be do and the evening-star be shine on schehallion 's distant head when we wipe we bloody broadsword and return to count the dead there we find he gash and gory stretch would upon the cumbered plain as he tell we where to seek he in the thickest of the slay and a smile be on he visage for within he die ear peal the joyful note of triumph and the clansman 's clamorous cheer : so amidst the battle 's thunder shot and steel and scorching flame in the glory of he manhood pass the spirit of the græme open wide the vault of athol where the bone of hero rest -- open wide the hallowed portal to receive another guest last of scot and last of freeman -- last of all that dauntless race who would rather die unsullied than outlive the land 's disgrace o thou lion-hearted warrior reck not of the after-time : honor may be deem dishonor loyalty be call a crime sleep in peace with kindred ash of the noble and the true hand that never fail they country heart that never baseness know sleep -- and till the latest trumpet wake the dead from earth and sea scotland shall not boast a braver chieftain than we own dundee the widow of glencoe the massacre of glencoe be a event which neither can nor ought to be forget it be a deed of the worst treason and cruelty -- a barbarous infraction of all law human and divine and it exhibit in they foulest perfidy the true character of the author and abettor of the revolution after the battle of killiecrankie the cause of the scottish royalist decline rather from the want of a competent leader than from any disinclination on the part of a large section of the nobility and gentry to vindicate the right of king jame no person of adequate talent or authority be find to supply the place of the great and gallant lord dundee for general cannon who succeed in command be not only deficient in military skill but do not possess the confidence nor understand the character of the highland chief who with they clansman constitute by far the most important section of the army accordingly no enterprise of any importance be attempt and the disastrous issue of the battle of the boyne lead to a negotiation which terminate in the entire disbanding of the royal force by this treaty which be expressly sanction by william of orange a full and unreserved indemnity and pardon be grant to all of the highlander who have take arm with a proviso that they should first subscribe the oath of allegiance to william and mary before the 1st of January 1692 in presence of the lord of the scottish council or of the sheriff or they deputy of the respective shire wherein they live the letter of william address to the privy council and order proclamation to be make to the above effect contain also the follow significant passage : -- that ye communicate we pleasure to the governor of inverlochy and other commander that they be exact and diligent in they several post but that they show no more zeal against the highlander after they submission _ than they have ever do formerly when these be in open rebellion _ this enigmatical sentence which in reality be intend as the sequel will show to be interpret in the most cruel manner appear to have cause some perplexity in the council as that body deem it necessary to apply for more distinct and specific instruction which however be not then issue it have be especially stipulate by the chief as a indispensable preliminary to they treaty that they should have leave to communicate with king jame then reside at st germain for the purpose of obtain he permission and warrant previous to submit themselves to the existing government that article have be sanction by william before the proclamation be issue and a special messenger be despatch to france for that purpose in the mean time troops be gradually and cautiously advance to the confines of the highland and in some instance actually quarter on the inhabitant the condition of the country be perfectly tranquil no disturbance whatever occur in the north or west of scotland locheill and the other chief be await the communication from st germain and hold themselves bind in honor to remain inactive whilst the remainder of the royalist force -lrb- for whom separate term have be make -rrb- be leave unmolested at dunkeld but rumor which be too clearly traceable to the emissary of the new government assert the preparation make for a immediate landing of king jame at the head of a large body of the french be industriously circulate and by many be implicitly believe the infamous policy which dictate such a course be now apparent the term of the amnesty or truce grant by the proclamation expire with the year 1691 and all who have not take the oath of allegiance before that term be to be proceed against with the utmost severity the proclamation be issue upon the 29th of August : consequently only four month be allow for the complete submission of the highland not one of the chief subscribe until the mandate from king jame arrive that document which be date from st germain on the 12th of December 1691 reach dunkeld eleven day afterwards and consequently but a very short time before the indemnity expire the bearer major menzy be so fatigue that he could proceed no farther on he journey but forward the mandate by a express to the commander of the royal force who be then at glengarry it be therefore impossible that the document could be circulate through the highland within the prescribed period locheill say drummond of balhaldy do not receive he copy till about thirty hour before the time be out and appear before the sheriff at inverara where he take the oath upon the very day on which the indemnity expire that a general massacre throughout the highland be contemplate by the whig government be a fact establish by overwhelming evidence in the course of the subsequent investigation before the scot parliament letter be produce from sir john dalrymple then master of stair one of the secretary of state in attendance upon the court which too clearly indicate the intention of william in one of these date 1st December 1694 -- _ a month _ be it observe before the amnesty expire -- and address to lieutenant-colonel hamilton there be the follow word : -- the winter be the only season in which we be sure the highlander can not escape we _ nor carry they wife bairn _ and cattle to the mountain and in another letter write only two day afterwards he say it be the only time that they can not escape you for human constitution can not endure to be long out of house _ this be the proper season to maule they in the cold long night _ and in January thereafter he inform sir thoma livingston that the design be to destroy entirely the country of lochaber locheill 's land keppoch 's glengarry 's appin and glencoe i assure you he continue you power shall be full enough _ and i hope the soldier will not trouble the government with prisoner _ locheill be more fortunate than other of he friend and neighbor accord to drummond -- major menzy who upon he arrival have observe the whole force of the kingdom ready to invade the highland as he write to general buchan foresee the unhappy consequence not only beg that general to send express to all part with order immediately to submit but also write to sir thoma livingston pray he to supplicate the council for a prorogation of the time in regard that he be so excessively fatigue that he be oblige to stop some day to repose a little and that though he should send express yet it be impossible they could reach the distant part in such time as to allow the several person concern the benefit of the indemnity within the space limited besides that some person have put the highlander in a bad temper he be confident to persuade they to submit if a further time be allow sir thoma present this letter to the council on the 5th of January 1692 but they refuse to give any answer and order he to transmit the same to court the reply of william of orange be a letter countersign by dalrymple in which upon the recital that several of the chieftain and many of they clan have not take the benefit of we gracious indemnity he give order for a general massacre to that end we have give sir thoma livingston order to employ we troops -lrb- which we have already conveniently post -rrb- to cut off these obstinate rebel _ by all manner of hostility _ and we do require you to give he you assistance and concurrence in all other thing that may conduce to that service and because these rebel to avoid we force may draw themselves _ they family _ goods or cattle to lurk or be conceal among they neighbor : therefore we require and authorise you to emit a proclamation to be publish at the market-cross of these or the adjacent shire where the rebel reside discharge upon the highest penalty the law allow any reset correspondence or intercommun with these rebel this monstrous mandate which be in fact the death-warrant of many thousand innocent people no distinction be make of age or sex would in all human probability have be put into execution but for the remonstrance of one high-minded nobleman lord carmarthen afterwards duke of leed accidentally become aware of the propose massacre and personally remonstrate with the monarch against a measure which he denounce as at once cruel and impolitic after much discussion william influence rather by a apprehension that so savage and sweep a act might prove fatal to he new authority than by any compunction or impulse of humanity agree to recall the general order and to limit himself in the first instance to a single deed of butchery by way of test the temper of the nation some difficulty seem to have arise in the selection of the fittest victim both keppoch and glencoe be name but the personal rancor of secretary dalrymple decide the doom of the latter the secretary write thus : -- argyle tell I that glencoe have not take the oath at which i rejoice it be a great work of charity to be exact in root out that damnable set the final instruction regard glencoe which be issue on 16th January 1692 be as follow : -- william r -- as for m ` ian of glencoe and that tribe if they can be well distinguish from the rest of the highlander it will be proper for public justice to extirpate that set of thief wr this letter be remarkable as be sign and countersign by william alone contrary to the usual practice the secretary be no doubt desirous to screen himself from after responsibility and be further aware that the royal signature would insure a rigorous execution of the sentence macdonald or as he be more commonly design m ` ian of glencoe be the head of a considerable sept or branch of the great clan-coilum and be lineally descend from the ancient lord of the isle and from the royal family of scotland -- the common ancestor of the macdonald have espouse a daughter of robert ii he be accord to a contemporary testimony a person of great integrity honor good nature and courage and he loyalty to he old master king jame be such that he continue in arm from dundee 's first appear in the highland till the fatal treaty that bring on he ruin in common with the other chief he have omit take the benefit of the indemnity until he receive the sanction of king jame : but the copy of that document which be forward to he unfortunately arrive too late the weather be so excessively stormy at the time that there be no possibility of penetrate from glencoe to inverara the place where the sheriff reside before the expiry of the stated period and m ` ian accordingly adopt the only practicable mode of signify he submission by make he way with great difficulty to fort-william then call inverlochy and tender he signature to the military governor there that officer be not authorise to receive it but at the earnest entreaty of the chief he give he a certificate of he appearance and tender and on new-year 's day 1692 m ` ian reach inverara where he produce that paper as evidence of he intention and prevail upon the sheriff sir jame campbell of ardkinglass to administer the oath require after that ceremony which be immediately intimate to the privy council have be perform the unfortunate

horrid service special instruction be send to the major of the regiment one duncanson then quarter at ballachulish -- a morose brutal and savage man -- who accordingly write to campbell of glenlyon in

fill the air and add to the horror and darkness of the night and there be no house to shelter they within many mile -lrb- 1 -rrb- such be the awful massacre of glencoe a event which have leave a indelible and execrable stain upon the memory of william of orange the record of indian warfare can hardly afford a parallel instance of atrocity : and this deed couple with he deliberate treachery in the darien scheme whereby scotland be for a time absolutely ruin be sufficient to account for the little estimation in which the name of the great whig deliverer be still regard in the valley of the north footnote : -lrb- footnote 1 : _ memoirs of sir ewen cameron of locheill _ -rrb- the widow of glencoe do not lift he from the bracken leave he lie where he fall -- better bier ye can not fashion

with they father ' house blaze and they dearest dead below oh the horror of the tempest as the flash drift be blow crimson with the conflagration and the roof go thunder down oh the prayer -- the prayer and curse that together wing they flight from the maddened heart of many through that long and woeful night till the fire begin to dwindle and the shot grow faint and few and we hear the foeman 's challenge only in a far halloo till the silence once more settle o'er the gorge of the glen break only by the cona plunge through its naked den slowly from the mountain-summit be the drift veil withdraw and the ghastly valley glimmer in the gray December dawn better have the morning never dawn upon we dark despair black amidst the common whiteness rise the spectral ruin there : but the sight of these be nothing more than wring the wild dive 's breast when she search for she offspring round the relic of she nest for in many a spot the tartan peer above the wintry heap mark where a dead macdonald lay within he frozen sleep tremblingly we scoop the cover from each kindred victim 's head and the living lip be burn on the cold one of the dead and i leave they with they dearest --

the island of the scot in consequence of a capitulation with government the regular troops who have serve under lord dundee be tranship to france and immediately upon they landing the officer and other have they rank confirm accord to the tenor of the commission and character which they bear in scotland they be distribute throughout the different garrison in the north of france and though nominally in the service of king jame derive they whole means of subsistence from the bounty of the french monarch so long as it appear probable that another descent be meditate those gentleman who be almost without exception man of considerable family assent to this arrangement but the destruction of the french fleet under admiral tourville off la hogue lead to a material change in they view after that naval engagement it become obvious that the cause of the fugitive king be in the mean time desperate and the scottish officer with no less gallantry than honor volunteer a sacrifice which so far as i know have hardly be equal the old and interesting pamphlet write by one of the corps -lrb- 2 -rrb- from which i have extract most of the follow detail but which be seldom peruse except by the antiquary state that the scottish officer consider that by the loss of the french fleet king jame 's restoration would be retard for some time and that they be burdensome to the king of france be entertain in garrison on whole pay without do duty when he have almost all europe in confederacy against he therefore humbly entreat king jame to have they reduce into a company of private sentinel and choose officer amongst themselves to command they assure he majesty that they would serve in the meanest circumstance and undergo the greatest hardship and fatigue that reason could imagine or misfortune inflict until it pleased god to restore he king jame commend they generosity and loyalty but disapprove of what they propose and tell they it be impossible that gentleman who have serve in so honorable post as formerly they have enjoy and live in so great plenty and ease could ever undergo the fatigue and hardship of private sentinel ' duty again that he own first command be a company of officer whereof several die other weary with fatigue draw they discharge till at last it dwindle into nothing and he get no reputation by the command : therefore he desire they to insist no more on that project the officer -lrb- notwithstanding he majesty 's desire to the contrary -rrb- make several interest at court and harass he so much that at last he condescend and appoint those who be to command they shortly afterwards the new corps be review for the first and last time by the unfortunate jame in the garden of saint germain and the tear be say to have gush from he eye at the sight of so many brave man reduce through they disinterested and persevere loyalty to so very humble a condition gentleman say he my own misfortune be not so nigh my heart as yours it grieve I beyond what i can express to see so many brave and worthy gentleman who have once the prospect of be the chief officer in my army reduce to the station of private sentinel nothing but you loyalty and that of a few of my subject in britain who be force from they allegiance by the prince of orange and who i know will be ready on all occasion to serve I and my distressed family could make I willing to live the sense of what all of you have do and undergo for you loyalty have make so deep a impression upon my heart that if it ever please god to restore I it be impossible i can be forgetful of you service and suffering neither can there be any post in the army of my dominion but what you have just pretension to as for my son you prince he be of you own blood a child capable of any impression and as he education will be from you it be not supposable that he can forget you merit at you own desire you be now go a long march far distant from I fear god and love one another write you want particularly to I and depend upon it always to find I you parent and king the scene bear a strong resemblance to one which many year afterwards occur at fontainebleau the company listen to he word with deep emotion gather round he as if half repentant of they own desire to go and so part for ever on this earth the dethrone monarch and he exile subject the number of this company of officer be about one hundred and twenty : they destination be perpignan in rousillon close upon the frontier of spain where they be to join the army under the command of the mareschal de noailles they power of endurance though often most severely test in a unwholesome climate seem to have be no less remarkable than they gallantry which upon many occasion call forth the warm acknowledgment of the french commander _ le gentilhomme _ say one of the general in acknowledgment of they readiness at a peculiarly critical moment _ est toujor gentilhomme et se montre toujors tel dans besoin et dans le danger _ -- a eulogy as applicable to they as it be in later day to la tour d'auvergne style the first grenadier of france at perpignan they be join by two other scottish company and the three seem to have continue to serve together for several campaign as a proof of the estimation in which they be hold i shall merely extract a short account of the taking of rosa in catalonium before refer to the exploit which form the subject of the follow ballad on the 27th of may the company of officer and other scottish company be join by two company of irish to make up a battalion in order to mount the trench and the major part of the officer list themselves in the company of grenadier under the command of the brave major rutherford who on he way to the trench in sight of mareschal de noaille and he court march with he company on the side of the trench which expose he to the fire of a bastion where there be two culverin and several other gun plant likewise to the fire of two curtin line with small shot colonel brown follow with the battalion be oblige in honor to march the same way major rutherford have do the danger whereof the mareschal immediately perceive order one of he aide-de-camp to command rutherford to march under cover of the trench which he do and if he have but delay six minute the grenadier and battalion have be cut to piece rutherford with he grenadier march to a trench near the town and the battalion to a trench on the rear and flank of the grenadier who fire so incessantly on the besiege that they think -lrb- the trench be practicable -rrb- they be go to make they attack immediately beat a chamade and be willing to give up the town upon reasonable term : but the mareschal 's demand be so exorbitant that the governor could not agree to they then firing begin on both side to be very hot and they in the town see how the grenadier lay kill eight of they when the governor surrender the town he inquire of the mareschal what countryman these grenadier be and assure he it be on they account he deliver up the town because they fire so hotly that he believe they be resolve to attack the breach he answer smile _ ` ces sont mes enfants _ -- they be my child ' again ` they be the king of great britain 's scottish officer who to show they willingness to share of he misery have reduce themselves to the carrying of arm and choose to serve under my command ' the next day when the mareschal ride along the front of the camp he halt at the company of the officer ' piquet and they all surround he then with he hat in he hand he thank they for they good service in the trench and freely acknowledge it be they conduct and courage which compel the governor to give up the town and assure they he would acquaint he master with the same which he do for when he son arrive with the news at versaille the king have read the letter immediately take coach to st germain and when he have show king jame the letter he thank he for the service he subject have do in take rosa in catalonium who with concern reply they be the stock of he british officer and that he be sorry he could not make better provision for they and a miserable provision it be they be gradually compel to part with every remnant of the property which they have secure from the ruin of they fortune so that when they arrive after various adventure at scelestat in alsace they be literally without the common means of subsistence famine and the sword have by this time thin they rank but have not diminish they spirit as the follow narrative of they last exploit will show : -- in December 1697 general stirk who command for the german appear with 16000 man on the other side of the rhine which oblige the marquis de sell to draw out all the garrison in alsace who make up about 4000 man and he encamp on the other side of the rhine over against general stirk to prevent he pass the rhine and carry a bridge over into a island in the middle of it which the french foresaw would be of great prejudice to they for the enemy 's gun place on that island would extremely gall they camp which they could not hinder for the deepness of the water and they want of boat -- for which the marquis quickly send but arrive too late the german have carry a bridge over into the island where they have post above five hundred man who by order of they engineer intrench themselves : which the company of officer perceive who always grasp after honor and scorn all thought of danger resolve to wade the river and attack the german in the island and for that effect desire captain john foster who then command they to beg of the marquis that they might have liberty to attack the german in the island who tell captain foster when the boat come up they should be the first that attack foster courteously thank the marquis and tell he they would wade into the island who shrink up he shoulder pray god to bless they and desire they to do what they please whereupon the officer with the other two scottish company make themselves ready and have secure they arm round they neck wade into the river hand-in-hand accord to the highland fashion with the water as high as they breast and have cross the heavy stream fall upon the german in they intrenchment these be presently throw into confusion and retreat break down they own bridge whilst many of they be drown this movement have be make in the dusk of the evening partook of the character of a surprise but it appear to I a very remarkable one as have be effect under such circumstance in the dead of winter and in the face of a enemy who possess the advantage both of position and of numerical superiority the author of the narrative add : -- when the marquis de sell hear the firing and understand that the german be beat out of the island he make the sign of the cross on he face and breast and declare publicly that it be the bravest action that ever he see and that he army have no honor by it as soon as the boat come the marquis send into the island to acquaint the officer that he would send they both troops and provision who thank he excellency and desire he should be inform that they want no troops and could not spare time to make use of provision and only desire spade shovel and pickax wherewith they might intrench themselves -- which be immediately send to they the next morning the marquis come into the island and kindly embrace every officer and thank they for the good service they have do he master assure they he would write a true account of they honor and bravery to the court of france which at the read he letter immediately go to st germain and thank king jame for the service he subject have do on the rhine the company keep possession of the island for nearly six week notwithstanding repeat attempt on the part of the german to surprise and dislodge they but all these have be defeat by the extreme watchfulness of the scot general stirk at length draw off he army and retreat in consequence of this action say the chronicler that island be call at present isle d'ecosse and will in likelihood bear that name until the general conflagration two year afterwards a treaty of peace be conclude and this gallant company of soldier worthy of a better fate be break up and disperse at the time when the narrative from which i have quote so freely be compile not more than sixteen of dundee 's veteran be alive the

the sweet of a brave a just and honorable conscience render perhaps more happy under those suffering than the most prosperous and triumphant in iniquity since we mind stamp we happiness some year ago while visit the ancient scottish convent at ratisbon my attention be draw to the monumental inscription on the wall of the dormitory many of which bear reference to gentleman of family and distinction

spot win by the warrior of the sword still call that deep and dangerous ford the passage of the scot charle edward at versaille though the sceptre have depart from the house of stuart it be reserve for one of its last descendant to prove to the world by he personal gallantry and noble spirit of enterprise that he at least have not degenerate from he royal line of ancestor the daring effort of charle edward to recover the crown of these kingdom for he father be to we the most remarkable incident of the last century it be honorable alike to the prince and to those who espouse he cause and even in a political point of view the outbreak ought not to be deplore since its failure put a end for ever to the dynastical struggle which for more than half a century have agitate the whole of britain establish the rule of law and of social order throughout the mountainous district of scotland and blended celt and saxon into one prosperous and united people it be better that the antiquated system of clanship should have expire in a blaze of glory than gradually dwindle into contempt better that the patriarchal rule should at once have be extinguish by the dire catastrophe of culloden than that it should have linger on the shadow of a old tradition there be nothing now to prevent we from dwelling with pride and admiration on the matchless devotion display by the highlander in 1745 in behalf of the heir of he whom they acknowledge as they lawful king no feeling can arise to repress the interest and the sympathy which be excite by the perusal of the tale narrate the suffering of the princely wanderer that un-bought loyalty and allegiance of the heart which would not depart from its constancy until the tomb of the vatican have close upon the last of the stuart line have long since be transfer to the constitutional sovereign of these realm and the enthusiastic welcome which have so often greet the return of queen victorium to she highland home owe its origin to a deeper feeling than that dull respect which modern liberalism assert to be the only tribute due to the first magistrate of the land the campaign of 1745 yield in romantic interest to none which be write in history a young and inexperienced prince whose person be utterly unknown to any of he adherent land on the west coast of scotland not at the head of a foreign force not muniment with supplies and arm but accompany by a mere handful of follower and ignorant of the language of the people amongst whom he be hazard he person he presence in scotland have not be urge by the chief of the clan most of whom be deeply averse to embark in a enterprise which must involve they in a war with so powerful a antagonist as england and which if unsuccessful could only terminate in the utter ruin of they fortune this be not a cause in which the whole of scotland be concerned although it be well know that many lead family in the lowland entertain jacobite opinion and although a large proportion of the common people have not yet become reconcile to or satisfied of the advantage of the union by which they consider themselves dishonour and betray it be hardly to be expect that without some fair guarantee for success the bulk of the scottish nation would actively bestir themselves on the side of the exile family besides this even amongst the highlander there be not unanimity of opinion the three northern clan of sutherland mackay and monro be know to be staunch supporter of the government it be doubtful what part might be take in the struggle by those of mackenzie and ross the chief of skye who could have bring a large force of armed man into the field have decline participate in the attempt the assistance of lord lovat upon whom the co-operation of the fraser might depend could not be calculate on with certainty and nothing but hostility could be expect from the powerful sept of the campbell under such circumstance it be little wonder if cameron of locheill the most sagacious of all the chieftain who favor the stuart cause be strike with consternation and alarm at the news of the prince 's landing or that he attempt to persuade he from undertake a adventure so seemingly hopeless mr robert chamber in he admirable history of that period do not in the least exaggerate the importance of the interview on the result of which the prosecution of the war depend on arrive at borrodale locheill have a private interview with the prince in which the probability of the enterprise be anxiously debate charle use every argument to excite the loyalty of locheill and the chief exert all he eloquence to persuade the prince to withdraw till a better opportunity charle represent the present as the best possible opportunity see that the french general keep the british army completely engage abroad while at home there be no troops but one or two newly-raised regiment he express he confidence that a small body of highlander would be sufficient to gain a victory over all the force that could now be bring against he and he be equally sure that such a advantage be all that be require to make he friend at home declare in he favor and cause those abroad to send he assistance all he want be that the highlander should begin the war locheill still resist entreat charle to be more temperate and consent to remain conceal where he be till he friend should meet together and concert what be best to be do charle whose mind be wind up to the utmost pitch of impatience pay no regard to this proposal but answer that he be determine to put all to the hazard ` in a few day ' say he ` with the few friend i have i will raise the royal standard and proclaim to the people of britain that charle stuart be come over to claim the crown of he ancestor -- to win it or to perish in the attempt locheill -- who my father have often tell I be we firmest friend -- may stay at home and learn from the newspaper the fate of he prince ' ` no ' say locheill sting by so poignant a reproach and hurry away by the enthusiasm of the moment ' i will share the fate of my prince and so shall every man over whom nature or fortune have give I any power ' such be the juncture upon which depend the civil war of 1745 for it be a point agree say mr home who narrate this conversation that if locheill have persist in he refusal to take arm no other chief would have join the standard and the spark of rebellion must have be instantly extinguish not more than twelve hundred man be assemble in glenfinnan on the day when the standard be unfurl by the marquis of tullibardine and at the head of this mere handful of follower charle edward commence the stupendous enterprise of reconquere the dominion of he father with a force which at the battle of preston do not double the above number the prince descend upon the lowland have baffle the attempt of general cope to intercept he march -- occupy the city of perth and the town of dundee and finally after a faint show of resistance on the part of the burgher take possession of the ancient capital of scotland and once more establish a court in the hall of holyrood he youth he gallantry and the grace and beauty of he person add to a most winning and affable address acquire for he the sympathy of many who from political motive abstain from become he adherent possibly certain feeling of nationality which no deliberate view of civil or religious policy could altogether extirpate lead such man to regard with a sensation akin to pride the spectacle of a prince descend from the long line of scottish king again occupy he ancestral seat and restore to they country which have be utterly neglect by the new dynasty a portion of its former state no doubt a sense of pity for the probable fate of one so young and chivalrous be often present to they mind for they have thorough confidence in the intrepidity of the regular troops and in the capacity of they commander and they never for a moment suppose that these could be successfully encounter by a raw levy of undisciplined highlander ill-armed and worse equipped and without the support of any artillery the issue of the battle of prestonpan strike edinburgh with amazement in point of number the two army be nearly equal but in every thing else save personal valor the royal troops have the advantage and yet _ in four minute _ -- for the battle be say not to have last longer -- the highlander have only make one terrific and impetuous charge -- the rout of the regular be general the infantry be break and cut to piece the dragoon who behave shamefully on the occasion turn bridle and flee without have once cross sword with the enemy mr chamber thus terminate he account of the action : the general result of the battle of preston may be state as have be the total overthrow and almost entire destruction of the royal army most of the infantry fall upon the park wall of preston be there huddle together without the power of resistance into a confused drive and have either to surrender or to be cut to piece many in vainly attempt to climb over the wall fall a easy prey to the ruthless claymore nearly 400 it be say be thus slay 700 take while only about 170 in all succeed in effect they escape the dragoon with worse conduct be much more fortunate in fall back they have the good luck to find outlet from they respective position by the road which run along the various extremity of the park wall and they thus get clear through the village with little slaughter after which as the highlander have no horse to pursue they they be safe several officer among whom be fowke and lascelle escape to cockenzie and along seton sand in a direction contrary to the general flight the unfortunate cope have attempt at the first break of gardiner 's dragoon to stop and rally they but be bear headlong with the confused band through the narrow road to the south of the enclosure notwithstanding all he effort to the contrary on get beyond the village where he be join by the retreat band of the other regiment he make one anxious effort with the earl of loudoun and home to form and bring they back to charge the enemy now disorder by the pursuit but in vain they flee on duck they head along they horse ' neck to escape the bullet which the pursuer occasionally send after they by use great exertion and hold pistol to the head of the trooper sir john and a few of he officer induce a small number of they to halt in a field near st clement 's well about two mile from the battle-ground but after a momentary delay the accidental firing of a pistol renew the panic and they ride off once more in great disorder sir john cope with a portion of they reach channelkirk at a early hour in the forenoon and there halt to breakfast and to write a brief note to one of the state-officers relate the fate of the day he then resume he flight and reach coldstream that night next morning he proceed to berwick whose fortification seem competent to give the security he require he everywhere bring the first tiding of he own defeat this victory operate very much in favor of prince charle it secure he for a season the undisputed possession of scotland and enable numerous adherent from all part of the country to raise such force as they could command and to repair to he banner he popularity in edinburgh daily increase as the quality of he person and mind become known and such testimony as the follow with respect to he estimation by the fair sex and the devotion they exhibit in he cause be not overcharge he affability and great personal grace work he high favor with the lady who as we learn from the letter of president forbe become generally so zealous in he cause as to have some serious effect in induce they admirer to declare for the prince there be we know for certain a miss lumsden who plainly tell she lover a young artist name robert strange that he might think no more of she unless he should immediately join prince charle and thus actually prevail upon he to take up arm it may be add that he survive the enterprise escape with great difficulty and marry the lady he be afterwards the best line-engraver of he time and receive the honor of knighthood from george iii white ribbon and breastknot become at this time conspicuous article of female attire in private assembly the lady also show considerable zeal in contribute plate and other article for the use of the chevalier at the palace and in raise pecuniary subsidy for he many a posset-dish and snuff-box many a treasured necklace and repeater many a jewel which have adorn its successive generation of family beauty be at this time sell or lay in pledge to raise a little money for the service of prince charlie as to the motive and intended policy of this remarkable and unfortunate young man it may be interesting to quote the term of the proclamation which he issue on the 10th October 1745 before commence he march into england let he history be impartially read he character as speak to by those who know he best fairly note and i think there can not be a doubt that have he succeed in he daring attempt he would have be true to the letter of he word and fulfil a pledge which britain never more require than at the period when that document be pen : -- do not the pulpit and congregation of the clergy as well as you weekly papers ring with the dreadful threat of popery slavery tyranny and arbitrary power which be now ready to be impose upon you by the formidable power of france and spain be not my royal father represent as a bloodthirsty tyrant breathing out nothing but destruction to all who will not immediately embrace a odious religion or have i myself be better use but listen only to the naked truth i with my own money hire a small vessel ill-supplied with money arm or friend i arrive in scotland attend by seven person i publish the king my father 's declaration and proclaim he title with pardon in one hand and in the other liberty of conscience and the most solemn promise to grant whatever a free parliament shall propose for the happiness of a people i have i confess the greatest reason to adore the goodness of almighty god who have in so remarkable a manner protect I and my small army through the many danger to which we be at first expose and who have lead I in the way to victory and to the capital of this ancient kingdom amidst the acclamation of the king my father 's subject why then be so much pain take to spirit up the mind of the people against this my undertake the reason be obvious it be lest the real sense of the nation 's present suffering should blot out the remembrance of past misfortune and of the outcry formerly raise against the royal family whatever miscarriage might have give occasion to they they have be more than atone for since and the nation have now a opportunity of be secure against the like in future that we family have suffer exile during these fifty-seven year everybody know have the nation during that period of time be the more happy and flourish for it have you find reason to love and cherish you governor as the father of the people of great britain and ireland have a family upon whom a faction unlawfully bestow the diadem of a rightful prince retain a due sense of so great a trust and favor have you find more humanity and condescension in those who be not bear to a crown than in my royal forefather have they ear be open to the cry of the people have they or do they consider only the interest of these nation have you reap any other benefit from they than a immense load of debt if i be answer in the affirmative why have they government be so often rail at in all you public assembly why have the nation be so long cry out in vain for redress against the abuse of parliament upon account of they long duration the multitude of placeman which occasion they venality the introduction of penal law and in general against the miserable situation of the kingdom at home and abroad all these and many more inconvenience must now be remove unless the people of great britain be already so far corrupt that they will not accept of freedom when offer to they see the king on he restoration will refuse nothing that a free parliament can ask for the security of the religion law and liberty of he people it be now time to conclude and i shall do it with this reflection civil war be ever attend with rancor and ill-will which party rage never fail to produce in the mind of those whom different interest principle or view set in opposition to one another i therefore earnestly require it of my friend to give as little loose as possible to such passion : this will prove the most effectual means to prevent the same in the enemy of my royal cause and this my declaration will vindicate to all posterity the nobleness of my undertaking and the generosity of my intention there be much truth in the open charge prefer in this declaration against the exist government the sovereign of the house of hanover have always show a marked predilection for they continental possession and have proportionally neglect the affair of britain under walpole 's administration the imperial parliament have degenerate from a independent assembly to a junta of placeman and the most flagitious system of bribery be openly practice and avow it be not without reason that charle contrast the state of the nation then with its position when under the rule of the legitimate family and have there not be a strong though i think unreasonable suspicion in the mind of many that he success would be the prelude to a vigorous attack upon the established religion of the country and that he would be incline to follow out in this respect the fatal policy of he grandfather charle would in all probability have receive a more active and general support than be accord to he the zeal with which the episcopalian party in scotland espouse he cause naturally give rise to the idea that the attempt of the prince be of evil omen to presbytery and the settlement of the church upon its present footing be yet so recent that the sore of the old feud be still festering and green the established clergy therefore be nearly to a man oppose to he pretension and one minister of edinburgh at the time when the highland host be in possession of the city have the courage to conclude he prayer nearly in the follow term -- bless the king thou know what king i mean -- may he crown long sit easy on he head and as to this young man who have come among we to seek a earthly crown we beseech thee in mercy to take he to thyself and give he a crown of glory at the same time it be very curious to observe that the most violent sect of presbyterian who might be consider as the representative of the extreme cameronian principle and who have early secede from the church and bitterly oppose the union of the kingdom be not indispose on certain term to coalesce with the jacobite it be hardly possible to understand the motive which actuate these man who appear to have regard each successive government as equally obnoxious some writer go the length of aver that in 1688 a negociation be open by one section of the covenanter with lord dundee with the object of resistance to the usurpation of william of orange and that the project be frustrate only by the death of that heroic nobleman sir walter scott -- a great authority -- seem to have be convince that such be the case but in the absence of direct proof i can hardly credit it it be perfectly well know that a conspiracy be form by a certain section of the cameronian party to assassinate lord dundee and dunfermline whilst in attendance at the meeting of estate and although the recognition of william as king might not have be palatable to other who hold the same opinion it would be a strange thing if they have so suddenly resolve to assist dundee in he effort for the exile family but the political change in scotland more especially the union seem to have inspire some of these man with a spirit of disaffection to the government for accord to mr chamber the most rigid sect of presbyterian have since the revolution express a strong desire to coalesce with the jacobite with the hope in case the house of stuart be restore to obtain what they call a covenanted king of this sect one thousand have assemble in dumfriesshire at the first intelligence of the insurrection bearing arm and color and suppose to contemplate a junction with the chevalier but these religionist be now almost as violently distinct from the established church of scotland as ever they have be from those of england and rome and have long cease to play a prominent part in the national dispute the established clergy and the greater part of they congregation be averse to charle upon consideration perfectly moderate at the same time not easy to be shake on commence he march into england charle find himself at the head of a army of between five thousand and six thousand man which force be consider strong enough with the augmentation it might receive on the way to effect the occupation of london have the english jacobite perform they part with the same zeal as the scot it be more than probable that the attempt would have be crown with success as it be the prince succeed in reduce the strong fortified town of carlisle and in march without opposition through the heart of england as far as derby within one hundred mile of the metropolis but here he better genius desert he discord have creep into he council for some of the chief become seriously alarmed at find that the gentry of england be not prepare to join the expedition but preferred remain at home inactive spectator of the contest except at manchester they have receive few or no recruit no tiding have reach they from wale a country suppose to be devote to the cause of king jame whilst it be well know that a large force be already in arm to oppose the clan mr chamber give we the follow detail at a council of war hold on the morning of the 5th December lord george murray and the other member give it as they unanimous opinion that the army ought to return to scotland lord george point out that they be about to be environ by three army amount collectively to about thirty thousand man while they own force be not above five thousand if so many suppose a unsuccessful engagement with any of these army it could not be expect that one man would escape for the militia would beset every road the prince if not slay in the battle must fall into the enemy 's hand : the whole world would blame they as fool for run into such a risk charle answer that he regard not he own danger he press with all the force of argument to go forward he do not doubt he say that the justice of he cause would prevail he be hopeful that there might be a defection in the enemy 's army and that many would declare for he he be so very bent on put all to the risk that the duke of perth be for it since he royal highness be at last he propose go to wale instead of return to carlisle but every other officer declare he opinion for a retreat these be nearly the word of lord george murray we be elsewhere tell that the prince condescend to use entreaty to induce he adherent to alter they resolution ` rather than go back ' he say ' i would wish to be twenty foot under ground ' he chagrin when he find he councillor obdurate be beyond all bound the council break up on the understanding that the retreat be to commence next morning lord george volunteer to take the place of honor in the rear provide only that he should not be trouble with the baggage this resolution be receive by the army with mark of unequivocal vexation retreat in they estimation be little less than overthrow and it be most galling to find that after all they labor hazard and toil they be doom to disappointment at the very moment when the prize seem ready for they grasp that the movement be a injudicious one be i think obvious we be tell upon good authority that the very boldness of the prince 's onward movement especially take into connexion with the expect descent from france have at length dispose the english jacobite to come out and many be just on the point of declare themselves and march to join he army when the retreat from derby be determine on a mr barry arrive in derby two day after the prince leave it with a message from sir watkin william wynne and lord barrymore to assure he in the name of many friend of the cause that they be ready to join he in what manner he please either in the capital or every one to rise in he own county i have likewise be assure that many of the welsh gentry have actually leave they home and be on the way to join charle when intelligence of he retreat at once send they all back peaceably convince that it be now too late to contribute they assistance these man from the power they have over they tenantry could have add materially to he military force in fact from all that appear we must conclude that the insurgent have a very considerable chance of success from a onward movement -- also no doubt a chance of destruction and yet not worse than what ultimately befall many of they -- while a retreat break in a moment the spell which they gallantry have conjure up and give the enemy a great advantage over they one victory more be accord to prince charle before he final overthrow after successfully conduct he retreat to scotland occupy glasgow and strengthen he army by the accession of new recruit he give battle to the royal force under general hawley at falkirk and as at preston drive they from the field the party be on this occasion fairly match there be about eight thousand man engage on either side the action be short and though not so decisive as the former one give great confidence to the insurgent it have be thus picturesquely portray by the historian of the enterprise : some individual who behold the battle from the steeple of falkirk use to describe these its main event as occupy a surprisingly brief space of time they first see the english army enter the misty and storm-covered muir at the top of the hill then see the dull atmosphere thicken by a fast-rolling smoke and hear the peal sound of the discharge immediately after they behold the discomfited troops burst wildly from the cloud in which they have be involve and rush in far-spread disorder over the face of the hill from the commencement of what they style ` the break of the battle ' there do not intervene more than ten minute -- so soon may a efficient body of man become by one transient emotion of cowardice a feeble and contemptible rabble the rout would have be total but for the three out-flanking regiment these not have be oppose by any of the clan have a ravine in front and derive some support from a small body of dragoon stand they ground under the command of general huske and brigadier cholmondley when the highlander go past in pursuit they receive a volley from this part of the english army which bring they to a pause and cause they to draw back to they former ground they impression be that some ambuscade be intend this save the english army from destruction a pause take place during which the bulk of the english infantry get back to falkirk it be not until lord george murray bring up the second line of he wing and the picket with some other on the other wing that general huske draw off he party which he do in good order the seat of war be now remove to the north the month of April 1746 find prince charle in possession of inverness with a army sorely dwindle in number and in great want of necessaries and provision many of the highlander have retire for the winter to they native glen and have not yet rejoin the standard the duke of cumberland who now command the english army with a reputation not diminish by the unfortunate issue of fontenoy be at the head of a large body of try and discipline troops in the best condition and support by the powerful arm of artillery he effect the passage of the spey a large and rapid river which intersect the highland without encounter any opposition and on the 15th of the month have arrive at nairn about nine mile distant from the position occupy by he kinsman and opponent he superiority in point of strength be so great that the boldest of the insurgent chief hesitate as to the policy of give immediate battle and nothing but the desire of cover inverness prevent the council from recommence a further retreat into the mountain where they could not have be easily follow and where they be certain to have meet with reinforcement as to the prince he confidence in the prowess of the highlander be so unbounded that even with such odds against he he would not listen to a proposal for delay there yet remain say mr chamber before play the great stake of a pitched battle one chance of success by the irregular mode of warfare to which the army be accustomed and charle resolve to put it to trial this be a night-attack upon the camp of the duke of cumberland he rightly argue that if he man could approach without be discover and make a simultaneous attack in more than one place the royal force then probably either engage in drink they commander 's health -lrb- the 15th happen to be the anniversary of the duke 's birthday and be celebrate as such by he army -rrb- or sleep off the effect of the debauch must be completely surprise and cut to piece or at least effectually route the time appoint for set out upon the march be eight in the evening when daylight should have completely disappear and in the mean time great pain be take to conceal the secret from the army this resolution be enter into at three in the afternoon and order be give to collect the man who have go off in search of provision the officer disperse themselves to inverness and other place and besought the straggler to repair to the muir but under the influence of hunger they tell they commander to shoot they if they please rather than compel they to starve any longer charle have previously declare with he characteristic fervor that though only a thousand of he man should accompany he he would lead they on to the attack and he be not now intimidate when he see twice that number ready to assist in the enterprise though some of he officer would willingly have make this deficiency of troops a excuse for abandon what they esteem at best a hazardous expedition have give out for watchword the name of he father he embrace lord george murray who be to command the foremost column and put himself at the head of that which follow give the order to march the attempt prove peculiarly unfortunate and from the fatigue which it occasion to the highlander contribute in a great degree towards the disaster of the follow day the night chance to be uncommonly dark and as it be well know that cumberland have station spy on the principal road it become necessary to select a devious route in order to effect a surprise the column proceed over broken and irregular ground soon become scatter and dislocate : no exertion of the officer could keep the man together so that lord george murray at two o'clock find that he be still distant three mile from the hostile camp and that there be no hope of commence the attack before the break of day when they would be open to the observation of the enemy under these circumstance a retreat be commence and the scheme which at one time seem to hold out every probability of success be abandon the highlander return fatigued and disconsolate to they former position about seven in the morning when they immediately address themselves to sleep or go away in search of provision so scarce be food at this critical juncture that the prince himself on retire to culloden house could obtain no better refreshment than a little bread and whisky he feel the utmost anxiety regard he man among whom the pang of hunger upon body exhaust by fatigue must have be work effect most unpromising to he success and he give order before seek any repose that the whole country should now be mercilessly ransack for the means of refreshment he order be not without effect considerable supplies be procure and subject to the cook 's art at inverness but the poor famished clansman be destine never to taste these provision the hour of battle arrive before they be prepare about eleven in the forenoon the troops of cumberland be observe upon the eastern extremity of the wide muir of culloden and preparation be instantly make for the coming battle the army have be strengthen that morning by the arrival of the keppoch macdonald and a party of the fraser but even with these reinforcement the whole available force which the prince could muster be about five thousand man to oppose at fearful odds a enemy twice as numerous and heavily support by artillery fortune on this day seem to have desert the prince altogether in draw out the line of battle a most unlucky arrangement be make by o'sullivan who act as adjutant whereby the macdonald regiment be remove from the right wing -- the place which the great clan collum have be privileged to hold in scottish array ever since the auspicious battle of bannockburn to those who be not acquaint with the peculiar temper and spirit of the highlander and they punctilio upon point of honor and precedence the question of arrangement will naturally appear a matter of little importance but it be not so feel by the macdonald who consider they change of position as a positive degradation and who further look upon it as a evil omen to the success of the battle the result of this mistake will be explain immediately just before the commencement of the action the weather which have hitherto be fair and sunny become overcast and a heavy blast of rain and sleet beat directly in the face of the highlander the english artillery then begin to play upon they and be admirably serve every discharge tell with fearful effect upon the rank the chief object of either party at the battle of culloden seem to have be to force its opponent to leave he position and to commence the attack cumberland finding that he artillery be do such execution have no occasion to move and charle appear to have commit a great error in abandon a mode of warfare which be peculiarly suit for he troops and which on two previous occasion have prove eminently successful have he at once order a general charge and attempt to silence the gun the issue of the day might have be otherwise : but he unfortunate star prevail it be not say mr chamber till the cannonade have continue nearly half a hour and the highlander have see many of they kindred stretch upon the heath that charle at last give way to the necessity of order a charge the aide-de-camp intrust to carry he message to the lieutenant-general -- a youth of the name of maclachlan -- be kill by a cannon-ball before he reach the first line but the general sentiment of the army as report to lord george murray supply the want and that general take it upon he to order a attack without charle 's permission have be communicate lord george have scarcely determine upon order a general movement when the macintosh a brave and devoted clan though not before engage in action unable any longer to brook the unavenged slaughter make by the cannon break from the center of the line and rush forward through smoke and snow to mingle with the enemy the athole man cameron stuart fraser and maclean also go on lord george murray head they with that rash bravery befitting the commander of such force thus in the course of one or two minute the charge be general along the whole line except at the left extremity where the macdonald dissatisfy with they position hesitate to engage the action and event of the onset be throughout quite as dreadful as the mental emotion which urge it notwithstanding that the three file of the front line of english pour forth they incessant fire of musketry -- notwithstanding that the cannon now load with grapeshot sweep the field as with a hailstorm -- notwithstanding the flank fire of wolfe 's regiment -- onward onward go the headlong highlander fling themselves into rather than rush upon the line of the enemy which indeed they do not see for smoke till involve among the weapon all that courage all that despair could do be do it be a moment of dreadful and agonising suspense but only a moment -- for the whirlwind do not reap the forest with greater rapidity than the highlander clear the line nevertheless almost every man in they front rank chief and gentleman fall before the deadly weapon which they have brave and although the enemy give way it be not till every bayonet be bent and bloody with the strife when the first line have thus be sweep aside the assailant continue they impetuous advance till they come near the second when be almost annihilate by a profuse and well-directed fire the shatter remains of what have be before a numerous and confident force begin to give way still a few rush on resolve rather to die than forfeit they well-acquired and dearly-estimated honor they rush on but not a man ever come in contact with the enemy the last survivor perish as he reach the point of the bayonet some idea of the determination display by the highlander in this terrific charge may be gather from the fact that in one part of the field they body be afterwards find in layer of three and four deep the slaughter be fearful for out of the five regiment which charge the english almost all the leader and man in the front rank be kill so shake be the english line that have the macdonald regiment well-known to yield in valor to none of the clan come up the fortune of the day might have be alter but they never make a onset smart and sullen at the affront which they conceive to have be put upon they name they bear the fire of the english regiment without flinch and give way to they rage by hew at the heather with they sword in vain they chief exhort they to go forward : even at that terrible moment the pride of clanship prevail my god cry macdonald of keppoch have it come to this that the child of my tribe have forsake I and he rush forward alone sword in hand with the devotion of a ancient hero and fall pierce with bullet the lowland and foreign troops which form the second line be powerless to retrieve the disaster all be over the rout become general and the prince be force from the field which he would not quit until drag from it by he immediate bodyguard such be the last battle the result of civil war which have be fight on british soil those who be defeat have acquire as much glory from it as the conqueror -- and even more for never be a conquest sully by such deed of deliberate cruelty as be perpetrate upon the survivor of the battle of culloden it be not however the object of the present paper to recount these or even the romantic history or hairbreadth escape of the prince whilst wander on the mainland and through the hebride although a reward of thirty thousand pound -- a immense sum for the period -- be set upon he head -- although he secret be know to hundred of person in every walk of life and even to the beggar and the outlaw -- not one attempt to betray he not one of all he follower in the midst of the misery which overtake they regret have draw the sword in he cause or would not again have gladly imperil they life for the sake of they beloved chevalier he go say lord mahon but not with he depart he remembrance from the highlander for year and year do he name continue enshrine in they heart and familiar to they tongue they plaintive ditty resounding with he exploit and invite he return again in these strain do they declare themselves ready to risk life and fortune for he cause and even maternal fondness -- the strongest perhaps of all human feeling -- yield to the passionate devotion to prince charlie the subsequent life of the prince be a story of melancholy interest we find he at first receive in france with all the honor due to one who though unfortunate have exhibit a heroism rarely equal and never surpass : gradually he be neglect and slight as one of a doomed and unhappy race whom no human exertion could avail to elevate to they former seat of power and finally when he presence in france become a obstacle to the conclusion of peace he be violently arrest and convey out of the kingdom there can be little doubt that continue misfortune and disappointment have begin very early to impair he noble mind for long period he be a wanderer lose sight of by he friend and even by he father and brother there be fragment of he write extant which show how poignantly he feel the cruelty of he fortune de vivre et pas vivre est beaucoup plus que de mourir and again write to he father 's secretary eight year after culloden he say -- i be grieve that we master should think that my silence be either neglect or want of duty but in reality my situation be such that i have nothing to say but imprecation against the fatality of be bear in such a detestable age a unhappy and uncongenial marriage tend still more to embitter he existence and if at last he yield to frailty which inevitably insure degradation it must be remember that he lot have be one to which few man have ever be expose and the magnitude of he suffering may fairly be admit as some palliation for he weakness to the last he heart be with scotland the follow anecdote be relate by he brother cardinal york to bishop walker the late primus of the episcopal church of scotland : -- mr greathead a personal friend of mr fox succeed when at rome in 1782 or 1783 in obtain a interview with charle edward and be alone with he for some time studiously lead the conversation to he enterprise in scotland and to the occurrence which succeed the failure of that attempt the prince manifest some reluctance to enter upon these topic appear at the same time to undergo so much mental suffering that he guest regret the freedom he have use in call up the remembrance of he misfortune at length however the prince seem to shake off the load which oppress he he eye brighten he face assume unwonted animation and he enter upon the narrative of he scottish campaign with a distinct but somewhat vehement energy of manner -- recount he march he battle he victory he retreat and he defeat -- detailed he hairbreadth escape in the western isle the inviolable and devoted attachment of he highland friend and at length proceed to allude to the terrible penalty with which the chief among they have be visit but here the tide of emotion rise too high to allow he to go on -- he voice falter he eye become fix and he fall convulse on the floor the noise bring into he room he daughter the duchess of albany who happen to be in a adjoining apartment ` sir ' she exclaim ` what be this you have be speak to my father about scotland and the highlander no one dare to mention those subject in he presence ' he die on the 30th of January 1788 in the arm of the master of nairn

person here indicate he history be a very strange and romantic one he be son of robert iii and immediate younger brother of that unhappy duke of rothesay who be murder at falkland he father apprehensive of the design and treachery of albany have determine to remove he when a mere boy for a season from scotland and as france be then consider the best school for the education of one so important from he high position it be resolve to send he thither under the care of the earl of orkney and fleming of cumbernauld he accordingly embark at north berwick with little escort -- as there be a truce for the time between england and scotland and they be under no apprehension of meeting with any vessel save those of the former nation notwithstanding this the ship which carry the prince be capture by a armed merchantman and carry to london where henry iv the usurp bolingbroke utterly regardless of treaty commit he and he attendant to the tower in vain say mr tytler do the guardian of the young prince remonstrate against this cruelty or present to henry a letter from the king he father which with much simplicity recommend he to the kindness of the english monarch should he find it necessary to land in he dominion in vain do they represent that the mission to france be perfectly pacific and its only object the education of the prince at the french court henry merely answer by a poor witticism declare that he himself know the french language indifferently well and that he father could not have send he to a better master so flagrant a breach of the law of nation as the seizure and imprisonment of the heir-apparent during the time of truce would have call for the most violent remonstrance from any government except that of albany but to this usurper of the supreme power the capture of the prince be the most grateful event which could have happen and to detain he in captivity become from this moment one of the principal object of he future life we be not to wonder then that the conduct of henry not only draw forth no indignation from the governor but be not even follow by any request that the prince should be set at liberty the aged king already wear out by infirmity and now break by disappointment and sorrow do not long survive the captivity of he son it be say the melancholy news be bring he as he be sit down to supper in he palace of rothesay in bute and that the effect be such upon he affectionate but feeble spirit that he droop from that day forward refuse all sustenance and die soon after of a broken heart jame be finally incarcerate in windsor castle where he endure a imprisonment of nineteen year henry though he have not hesitate to commit a heinous breach of faith be not so cruel as to neglect the education of he captive the young king be supply with the best master and gradually become a adept in all the accomplishment of the age he be a singular exception from the rule which maintain that monarch be indifferent author as a poet he be entitle to a very high rank indeed be i think in point of sweetness and melody of verse not much inferior to chaucer from the window of he chamber in the tower he have often see a young lady of great beauty and grace walking in the garden and the admiration which at once possess he soon ripen into love this be lady jane beaufort daughter of the earl of somerset and niece of henry iv and who afterwards become he queen how he love and how he woo she be tell in he own beautiful poem of the king 's quhair of which the follow be a few stanza : -- now there be make fast by the towri wall a garden fair and in the corner set a arbor green with wandi long and small rail about and so with tree set be all the place and hawthorn hedge knet that lyf be none walk there forbye that might within scarce any wight espy so thick the boughi and the leavi greene beshade all the alley that there be and mid of every arbor might be see the sharpe greene sweete juniper grow so fair with branch here

use now soft now loud among that all the garden and the walli ring right of they song and therewith cast i down mine eye again where as i see walk under the tower full secretly now comen here to plain the fairest or the freshest younge flower that e'er i see methought before that hour : for which sudden abate anon astart the blood of all my body to my heart and though i stand abasit for a lite no

that prince charle be deeply attach to one of the princess of the royal family of france in the interesting collection call jacobite memoirs compile by mr chamber from the voluminous mss of bishop forbe we find the following passage from the narrative of donald macleod who act as a guide to the wanderer whilst traverse the hebride : -- when donald be ask if ever the prince use to give any particular toast when they be take a cup of cold water or the like he say that the prince very often drink to the black eye -- by which say donald he mean the second daughter of france and i never hear he name any particular health but that alone when he speak of that lady -- which he do frequently -- he appear to be more than ordinarily well pleased the old scottish cavalier the gentle locheill may he consider as the pattern of a highland chief other who head the insurrection may have be actuate by motive of personal ambition and by a desire for aggrandisement but no such charge can be make against the generous and devoted cameron he be as we have already see the first who attempt to dissuade the prince from embark in a enterprise which he conscientiously believe to be desperate but have fail in do so he nobly stand firm to the cause which he conscience vindicate as just and cheerfully imperil he life and sacrifice he fortune at the bidding of he master there be no one even among those who espouse the other side in scotland who do not commiserate the misfortune of this truly excellent man whose humanity be not less conspicuous than he valor throughout the civil war and who die in exile of a broken heart perhaps the best type of the lowland cavalier of that period may be find in the person of alexander forbe lord pitsligo a nobleman whose conscientious view impel he to take a different side from that adopt by the greater part of he house and name lord forbe the head of this very ancient and honorable family be one of the first scottish nobleman who declare for king william lord pitsligo on the contrary have be educate abroad and early introduce to the circle at saint germain conceive a deep personal attachment to the member of the exile line he be anything but a enthusiast as he philosophical and religious writings well worthy of a perusal will show he be the intimate friend of fénélon and throughout he whole life be remarkable rather for he piety and virtue than for keenness in political dispute after he return from france lord pitsligo take he seat in the scottish parliament and he parliamentary career have thus be characterise by a former writer -lrb- 3 -rrb- here it be no discredit either to he head or heart to say that oblige to become a member of one of the contend faction of the time he adopt that which have for its object the independence of scotland and restoration of the ancient race of monarch the advantage which be in future to arise from the great measure of a national union be so hide by the mist of prejudice that it can not be wonder at if lord pitsligo like many a high-spirited man see nothing but disgrace in a measure force on by such corrupt means and call in its commencement for such mortifying national sacrifice the english nation indeed with a narrow yet not unnatural view of they own interest take such pain to encumber and restrict the scottish commercial privilege that it be not till the best part of a century after the event that the inestimable fruit of the treaty begin to be feel and know this distant period lord pitsligo could not foresee he behold he countryman like the israelite of yore lead into the desert but he merely human eye could not foresee that after the extinction of a whole race -- after a longer pilgrimage than that of the follower of mose -- the scottish people should at length arrive at that promised land of which the favourer of the union hold forth so gay a prospect look upon the act of settlement of the crown and the act of abjuration as unlawful lord pitsligo retire to he house in the country and throw up attendance on parliament upon the death of queen anne he join himself in arm with a general insurrection of the highlander and jacobite head by he friend and relative the earl of mar mar a versatile statesman and a able intriguer have consult he ambition rather than he talent when he assume the command of such a enterprise he sink beneath the far superior genius of the duke of argyle and after the undecisive battle of sheriffmuir the confederacy which he have form but be unable to direct dissolve like a snow-ball and the noble concern in it be fain to fly abroad this exile be lord pitsligo 's fate for five or six year part of the time he spend at the court if it can be call so of the old chevalier de saint george where exist all the petty feud chicanery and crooked intrigue which subsist in a real scene of the same character although the object of the ambition which prompt such art have no existence man seem to play at be courtier in that illusory court as child play at be soldier it would appear that lord pitsligo be not attaint for he share in mar 's rebellion he return to scotland in 1720 and reside at he castle in aberdeenshire not mingle in public affair but gain through he charity kindness and benevolence the respect and affection of all around he he be sixty-seven year of age when charle edward land in scotland the district in which the estate of lord pitsligo lay be essentially jacobite and the young cavalier only wait for a fitting leader to take up arm in the cause accord to mr home he example be decisive of the movement of he neighbor : so when he who be so wise and prudent declare he purpose of join charle most of the gentleman in that part of the country who favor the pretender 's cause put themselves under he command think they could not follow a better or safer guide than lord pitsligo he lordship 's own account of the motive which urge he on be peculiar : -- i be grow a little old and the fear of ridicule stick to I pretty much i have mention the weightier consideration of a family which would make the censure still the greater and set the more tongue ago but we be push on i know not how -- i think -- i weigh -- and i weigh again if there be any enthusiasm in it it be of the coldest kind and there be as little remorse when the affair miscarry as there be eagerness at the begin the writer whom i have already quote go on to say -- to those friend who recall he misfortune of 1715 he reply gaily ` do you ever know I absent at the second day of a wedding ' meaning i suppose that have once contract a engagement he do not feel entitle to quit it while the contest subsist be invite by the gentleman of the district to put himself at they head and have surmount he own desire he have make a farewell visit at a neighbor 's house where a little boy a child of the family bring out a stool to assist the old nobleman in remount he horse ` my little fellow ' say lord pitsligo ` this be the severest rebuke i have yet receive for presume to go on such a expedition ' the die be however cast and lord pitsligo go to meet he friend at the rendezvous they have appoint in aberdeen they form a body of well-armed cavalry gentleman and they servant to the number of a hundred man when they be draw up in readiness to commence the expedition the venerable nobleman they leader move to they front lift he hat and look up to heaven pronounce with a solemn voice the awful appeal -- ' o lord thou knowest that we cause be just ' then add the signal for departure -- ` march gentleman ' lord pitsligo with he follower find charle at edinburgh on 8th October 1745 a few day after the highlander ' victory at preston they arrival be hail with enthusiasm not only on account of the timely reinforcement but more especially from the high character of they leader hamilton of bangor in a animated and eloquent eulogium upon pitsligo state that nothing could have fall out more fortunately for the prince than he join they do -- for it seem as if religion virtue and justice be enter he camp under the appearance of this venerable old man and what would have give sanction to a cause of the most dubious right could not fail to render sacred the very best although so far advance in year he remain in arm during the whole campaign and be treat with almost filial tenderness by the prince after culloden he become like many more a fugitive and a outlaw but succeed like the baron of bradwardine in find a shelter upon the skirt of he own estate disguise as a mendicant he secret be faithfully keep by the tenantry and although it be more than surmise by the soldier that he be lurk somewhere in the neighborhood they never be able to detect he on one occasion he actually guide a party to a cave on the sea-shore amidst the rough rock of buchan where it be rumor that he be lie in concealment and on another when overtake by he asthma and utterly unable to escape from a approach patrol of soldier he sit down by the wayside and act he assumed character so well that a good-natured fellow not only give he alms but condole with he on the violence of he complaint for ten year he remain conceal but in the mean time both title and estate be forfeit by attainder he last escape be so very remarkable that i may be pardon for give it in the language of the author of he memoirs in march 1756 and of course long after all apprehension of a search have cease information have be give to the commanding officer at fraserburgh that lord pitsligo be at that moment at the house of auchiry it be act upon with so much promptness and secrecy that the search must have prove successful but for a very singular occurrence mr sophia donaldson a lady who live much with the family repeatedly dream on that particular night that the house be surround by soldier she mind become so haunt with the idea that she get out of bed and be walk through the room in hope of give a different current to she thought before she lay down again when day begin to dawn she accidentally look out at the window as she pass it in traverse the room and be astonish at actually observe the figure of soldier among some tree near the house so completely have all idea of a search be by that time lay asleep that she suppose they have come to steal poultry -- jacobite poultry-yard afford a safe object of pillage for the english soldier in those day mr sophium be proceed to rouse the servant when she sister have awake and inquire what be the matter and be tell of soldier near the house exclaim in great alarm that she fear they want something more than hen she beg mr sophium to look out at a window on the other side of the house when not only be soldier see in that direction but also a officer give instruction by signal and frequently put he finger to he lip as if enjoin silence there be now no time to be lose in rouse the family and all the haste that could be make be scarcely sufficient to hurry the venerable man from he bed into a small recess behind the wainscot of a adjoining room which be conceal by a bed in which a lady miss gordon of towie who be there on a visit lay before the soldier obtain admission a most minute search take place the room in which lord pitsligo be conceal do not escape miss gordon 's bed be carefully examine and she be oblige to suffer the rude scrutiny of one of the party by feel she chin to ascertain that it be not a man in a lady 's night-dress before the soldier have finish they examination in this room the confinement and anxiety increase lord pitsligo 's asthma so much and he breathing become so loud that it cost miss gordon lie in bed much and violent cough which she counterfeit in order to prevent the high breathing behind the wainscot from be hear it may be easily conceive what agony she would suffer lest by overdo she part she should increase suspicion and in fact lead to a discovery the ruse be fortunately successful on the search through the house be give over lord pitsligo be hastily take from he confine situation and again replace in bed and as soon as he be able to speak he accustomed kindness of heart make he say to he servant -- ` jame go and see that these poor fellow get some breakfast and a drink of warm ale for this be a cold morning they be only do they duty and can not bear I any ill-will ' when the family be felicitate each other on he escape he pleasantly observe -- ' a poor prize have they obtain it -- a old die man ' this be the last attempt make on the part of government to seize on the person of any of the survive insurgent three year before dr archibald cameron a brother of locheill have clandestinely revisit scotland be arrest try and execute for high treason at tyburn the government be generally blame for this act of severity which be consider rather to have be dictate by revenge than require for the public safety it be however probable that they might have have secret information of certain negotiation which be still conduct in the highland by the agent of the stuart family and that they consider it necessary by one terrible example to overawe the insurrectionary spirit this i believe to have be the real motive of a execution which otherwise could not have be palliate : and in the case of lord pitsligo it be quite possible that the zeal of a partisan may have lead he to take a step which would not have be approve of by the ministry after the lapse of so many year and after so many scene of judicial bloodshed the nation would have turn in disgust from the spectacle of a old man whose private life be not only blameless but exemplary drag to the scaffold and force to lay down he head in expiation of a doubtful crime : and this view derive corroboration from the fact that shortly afterwards lord pitsligo be tacitly permit to return to the society of he friend without further notice or persecution dr king the principal of st mary 's hall oxford have bear the follow testimony to the character of lord pitsligo whoever be so happy either from he natural disposition or he good judgment constantly to observe st paul 's precept ` to speak evil of no one ' will certainly acquire the love and esteem of the whole community of which he be a member but such a man be the _ rara avi in terri _ and among all my acquaintance i have know only one person to whom i can with truth assign this character the person i mean be the present lord pitsligo of scotland i not only never hear this gentleman speak a ill word of any man living but i always observe he ready to defend any other person who be ill speak of in he company if the person accuse be of he acquaintance my lord pitsligo would always find something good to say of he as a counterpoise if he be a stranger and quite unknown to he my lord would urge in he defense the general corruption of manners and the frailty and infirmity of human nature it be no wonder that such a excellent man who besides be a polite scholar and have many other great and good quality should be universally admire and beloved -- insomuch that i persuade myself he have not one enemy in the world at least to this general esteem and affection for he person he preservation must be owe for since he attainder he have never remove far from he own house protect by man of different principle and unsought for and unmolested by government to which eulogy it might be add by those who have the good fortune to know he representative that the virtue here acknowledge seem hereditary in the family of pitsligo the venerable old nobleman be permit to remain without molestation at the residence of he son during the latter year of a existence protracted to the extreme verge of human life and so say the author of he memoirs in this happy frame of mind -- calm and full of hope -- the saintly man continue to the last with he reason uncloud able to study he favorite volume enjoy the comfort of friendship and delighting in the consolation of religion till he gently ` fall asleep in jesus ' he die on the 21st of December 1762 in the eighty-fifth year of he age and to he survive friend the recollection of the misfortune which have accompany he through he long life be painfully awaken even in the closing scene of he mortal career -- as he son have the mortification to be indebted to a stranger now the proprietor of he ancient inheritance by purchase from the crown for permission to lay he father 's honor remain in the vault which contain the ash of he family for many generation such a character as this be well worthy of remembrance and lord pitsligo have just title to be call the last of the old scottish cavalier i trust that in adapt the word of the follow little ballad to a well-known english air i have commit no unpardonable larceny footnote : -lrb- footnote 3 : see _ blackwood 's magazine _ for may 1829 -- article lord pitsligo -rrb- the old scottish cavalier i come listen to another song should

soon amidst the ever-silent dead i must repose it may be half forget yes i have break the hard and bitter bread for many a year with those who tremble not to buckle on they armor for the fight and set themselves against the tyrant 's lot and i have never bow I to he might nor knelt before he -- for i bear within my heart the sternest consciousness of right and that perpetual hate of gilded sin which make I what i be and though the stain of poverty be on I yet i win more honor by it than the blinded train who hug they willing servitude and bow unto the weakest and the most profane therefore with unencumbered soul i go before the footstool of my maker where i hope to stand as undebased as now child be the sun abroad i feel my hair bear up and waft by the gentle wind i feel the odour that perfume the air and hear the rustling of the leaf behind within my heart i picture they and then i almost can forget that i be blind and old and hate by my fellow-men yet would i fain once more behold the grace of nature ere i die and gaze again upon she living and rejoice face -- fain would i see thy countenance my child my comforter i feel thy dear embrace -- i hear thy voice so musical and mild the patient sole interpreter by whom so many year of sadness be beguile for it have make my small and scanty room people with glowing vision of the past but i will calmly bend I to my doom and wait the hour which be approach fast when triple light shall stream upon mine eye and heaven itself be open up at last to he who dare foretell its mystery i have have vision in this drear eclipse of outward consciousness and clomb the sky strive to utter with my earthly lip what the diviner soul have half divine even as the saint in he apocalypse who see the inmost glory where enshrine sit he who fashion glory this have drive all outward strife and tumult from my mind and humble I until i have forgive my bitter enemy and only seek to find the straight and narrow path to heaven yet i be weak -- oh how entirely weak for one who may not love nor suffer more sometimes unbidden tear will wet my cheek and my heart bind as keenly as of yore responsive to a voice now hush to rest which make the beautiful italian shore in all its pomp of summer vineyard drest a eden and a paradise to I do the sweet breeze from the balmy west still murmur through thy grove parthenope in search of odour from the orange bower still on thy slope of verdure do the bee cull she rare honey from the virgin flower and philomel she plaintive chaunt prolong ` neath sky more calm and more serene than ours make the summer one perpetual song art thou the same as when in manhood 's pride i walk in joy thy grassy mead among with that fair youthful vision by my side in whose bright eye i look -- and not in vain o my adored angel o my bride despite of year and woe and want and pain my soul yearn back towards thee and i seem to wander with thee hand in hand again by the bright margin of that flow stream i hear again thy voice more silver-sweet than fancied music float in a dream possess my be from afar i greet the wave of thy garment in the glade and the light rustling of thy fairy foot -- what time as one half eager half afraid love 's burning secret falter on my tongue and tremulous look and broken word betray the secret of the heart from whence they spring ah I the earth that render thee to heaven give up a angel beautiful and young spotless and pure as snow when freshly drive : a bright aurora for the starry sphere where all be love and even life forgive bride of immortal beauty -- ever dear dost thou await I in thy blest abode while i tithonus-like must linger here and count each step along the rugged road a phantom totter to a long-made grave and eager to lay down my weary load i who be fancy 's lord be fancy 's slave like the low murmur of the indian shell ta'en from its coral bed beneath the wave which unforgetful of the ocean 's swell retain within its mystic urn the hum hear in the sea-grot where the nereid dwell -- old thought still haunt I -- unaware they come between I and my rest nor can i make those aged visitor of sorrow dumb oh yet awhile my feeble soul awake nor wander back with sullen step again for neither pleasant pastime canst thou take in such a journey nor endure the pain the phantom of the past be dead for thee so let they ever uninvoked remain and be thou calm till death shall set thee free thy flower of hope expand long ago long since they blossom wither on the tree : no second spring can come to make they blow but in the silent winter of the grave they lie with blighted love and bury woe i do not waste the gift which nature give nor slothful lay in the circéan bower nor do i yield myself the willing slave of lust for pride for riches or for power no in my heart a nobler spirit dwelt for constant be my faith in manhood 's dower man -- make in god 's own image -- and i feel how of we own accord we court shame until to idol like ourselves we kneel and so renounce the great and glorious claim of freedom we immortal heritage i see how bigotry with spiteful aim smite at the search eyesight of the sage how error steal behind the step of truth and cast delusion on the sacred page so as a champion even in early youth i wage my battle with a purpose keen nor fear the hand of terror nor the tooth of serpent jealousy and i have be with starry galileo in he cell that wise magician with the brow serene who fathom space and i have see he tell the wonder of the planetary sphere and trace the rampart of heaven 's citadel on the cold flag-stone of he dungeon drear and i have walk with hampden and with vane -- name once so gracious to a english ear -- in day that never may return again my voice though not the loudest have be hear whenever freedom raise she cry of pain and the faint effort of the humble bard have rouse up thousand from they lethargy to speak in word of thunder what reward be mine or theirs it matter not for i be but a leaf cast on the whirling tide without a hope or wish except to die but truth assert once must still abide unquenchable as be those fiery spring which day and night gush from the mountain-side perpetual meteor girt with lambent wing which the wild tempest toss to and fro but can not conquer with the force it bring yet i who ever feel another 's woe more keenly than my own untold distress i who have battle with the common foe and break for year the bread of bitterness who never yet abandon or betray the trust vouchsafe I nor have cease to bless be leave alone to wither in the shade a weak old man desert by he kind -- whom none will comfort in he age nor aid oh let I not repine a quiet mind conscious and upright need no other stay nor can i grieve for what i leave behind in the rich promise of eternal day henceforth to I the world be dead and go its thorn unfelt its rose cast away : and the old pilgrim weary and alone bow down with travel at he master 's gate now sit he task of life-long labor do thankful for rest although it come so late after sore journey through this world of sin in hope and prayer and wistfulness to wait until the door shall ope and let he in hermotimus hermotimus the hero of this ballad be a philosopher or rather a prophet of clazomenæ who possess the faculty now claim by the animal-magnetist of effect a voluntary separation between he soul and body for the former could wander to any part of the universe and even hold intercourse with supernatural being whilst the senseless frame remain at home hermotimus however be not insensible to the risk attendant upon this disunion since before attempt any of these aerial flight he take the precaution to warn he wife lest ere the return of he soul the body should be render a unfit or useless receptacle this accident which he so much dread at length occur for the lady weary out by a succession of trance each of longer duration than the precede one day commit he body to the flame and thus effectually put a stop to such unconnubial conduct he receive divine honor at clazomenæ but must nevertheless remain as a terrible example and warn to all husband who carry they scientific or spiritual pursuit so far as to neglect they duty to they wife it be somewhat curious that hermotimus be not the only person -lrb- put the disciple of mesmer and dupotet altogether out of the question -rrb- who have possess this miraculous power another and much later instance be record by dr george cheyne in he work entitle _ the english malady or a treatise of nervous disease _ as have come under he own observation and as this case be exactly similar to that of the prophet it may amuse the reader to see how far a ancient fable may be illustrated and in part explain by the record of modern science dr cheyne 's patient be probably cataleptic but the worthy physician must be allow to tell he own story colonel townshend a gentleman of honor and integrity have for many year be afflict with a nephritic complaint he illness increase and he strength decay he come from bristol to bath in a litter in autumn and lay at the bell inn dr baynard and i be call to he and attend he twice a-day but he vomiting continue still incessant and obstinate against all remedy we despair of he recovery while he be in this condition he send for we one morning we wait on he with mr skrine he apothecary we find he sens clear and he mind calm : he nurse and several servant be about he he tell we he have send for we to give he a account of a odd sensation he have for some time observe and feel in himself which be that by compose himself _ he could die or expire when he please _ and yet by a effort or somehow he could come to life again which he have sometimes try before he have send for we we hear this with surprise but as it be not to be account for upon common principle we could hardly believe the fact as he relate it much less give any account of it unless he should please to make the experiment before we which we be unwilling he should do lest in he weak condition he might carry it too far he continue to talk very distinctly and sensibly above a quarter of a hour about this surprising sensation and insist so much on we see the trial make that we be at last force to comply we all three feel he pulse first -- it be distinct though small and thready and he heart have its usual beating he compose himself on he back and lay in a still posture for some time : while i hold he right hand dr baynard lay he hand on he heart and mr skrine hold a clean looking-glass to he mouth i find he pulse sink gradually till at last i could not find any by the most exact and nice touch dr baynard could not feel the least motion in he heart nor mr skrine the least soil of breath on the bright mirror he hold to he mouth then each of we by turn examine he arm heart and breath but could not by the nicest scrutiny discover the least symptom of life in he we reason a long time about this odd appearance as well as we could and all of we judge it inexplicable and unaccountable and finding he still continue in that condition we begin to conclude that he have indeed carry the experiment too far and at last be satisfy he be actually dead and be just ready to leave he this continue about half a hour as we be go away we observe some motion about the body and upon examination find he pulse and the motion of he heart gradually return he begin to breathe gently and speak softly we be all astonished to the last degree at this unexpected change and after some further conversation with he and among ourselves go away fully satisfy as to all the particulars of this fact but confound and puzzle and not able to form any rational scheme that might account for it hermotimus i wilt not lay thee down in quiet slumber weary dost thou seem and ill at rest sleep will bring thee dream in starry number -- let he come to thee and be thy guest midnight now be past --

gloom not shade around so silent be the place and cold so far from human ken it have a look that make I old and spectre time again iii i listen half in think to hear the roman trumpet blow -- i search for glint of helm and spear amidst the forest bough : and armor ring and voice swell -- i hear the legion 's tramp and mark the lonely sentinel who guard the lonely camp iv methink i have no other home no other hearth to find for nothing save the thought of rome be stir in my mind and all that i have hear or dream and all i have forget be rise up as though they seem the household of the spot v and all the name that roman know seem just as know to I as if i be a roman too -- a roman bear and free : and i could rise at cæsar 's name as though it be a charm to draw sharp lightning from the tame and brace the coward 's arm vi and yet if yonder sky be blue and earth be sunny gay if nature wear the summer hue that deck she yesterday the mound the trench the rampart 's space would move I nothing more than many a sweet sequestred place that i have mark before vii i could not feel the breeze bring rich odour from the tree i could not hear the linnet sing and think on theme like these the paint insect as they pass in swift and motley strife the very lizard in the grass would scare I back to life viii then be the past so gloomy now that it may never bear the open smile of nature 's brow or meet the sunny air i know not that -- but joy be power however short it last and joy befit the present hour if sadness fit the past danube and the euxine danube danube wherefore com ` st thou red and rage to my cave wherefore leap thy swollen water madly through the broken wave wherefore be thy tide so sullied with a hue unknown to I wherefore dost thou bring pollution to the old and sacred sea ha rejoice old father euxine i be brimming full and red noble tiding do i carry from my distant channel-bed i have be a christian river dull and slow this many a year roll down my torpid water through a silence morne and drear have not feel the tread of army trample on my reedy shore have not hear the trumpet call or the cannon 's gladsome roar only listen to the laughter from the village and the town and the church-bell ever jangle as the weary day go down so i lay and sorely ponder on the day long since go by when my old primæval forest echo to the war-man 's cry when the race of thor and odin hold they battle by my side and the blood of man be mingle warmly with my chilly tide father euxine thou rememb ` rest how i bring thee tribute then -- swollen corpse gash and gory head and limb of slaughter would man father euxine be thou joyful i be run red once more -- not with heathen blood as early but with gallant christian gore for the old time be return and the cross be break down and i hear the tocsin sound in the village and the town and the glare of burn city soon shall light I on my way -- ha my heart be big and jocund with the draught i drink to-day ha i feel my strength awaken and my brethren shout to I each be leap red and joyous to he own await sea rhine and elbe be plunge downward through they wild anarchic land everywhere be christian fall by they brother christian ' hand yea the old time be return and the olden god be here take my tribute father euxine to thy water dark and drear therefore come i with my torrent shake castle crag and town therefore with the shout of thunder sweep i herd and herdsman down therefore leap i to thy bosom with a loud triumphal roar -- greet I greet I father euxine i be christian stream no more the scheik of sinaus in 1830 from the german of freiligrath i lift I without the tent i say -- I and my ottoman -- i 'll see the messenger myself it be the caravan from africa thou sayest and they bring we news of war draw I without the tent and quick as at the desert well the freshness of the purling brook delight the tired gazelle so pant i for the voice of he that cometh from afar ii the scheik be lift from he tent and thus outspake the moor : -- i see old chief the tricolor on algier ' topmost tower -- upon its battlements the silk of lyon flutter free each morning in the market-place the muster-drum be beat and to the war-hymn of marseille the squadron pace the street the armament from toulon sail : the frank have cross the sea iii towards the south the column march beneath a cloudless sky : they weapon glitter in the blaze of the sun of barbary and with the dusty desert sand they horse ' mane be white the wild maraud tribe disperse in terror of they life they flee unto the mountain with they child and they wife and urge the clumsy dromedary up the atla ' height iv the moor have ta'en they vantage-ground the volley thunder fast -- the dark defile be blaze like a heated oven-blast the lion hear the strange turmoil and leave he mangled prey -- no place be that for he to feed and thick and loud the cry feu -- allah allah -- en avant in mingled discord rise the frank have reach the summit -- they have win the victory v with bristle steel upon the top the victor take they stand : beneath they foot with all its town they see the promised land -- from tunis even unto fez from atla to the sea the cavalier alight to gaze and gaze full well they may where countless minaret stand up so solemnly and gray amidst the dark-green mass of the flowering myrtle-tree vi the almond blossom in the vale the aloe from the rock throw out its long and prickly leaf nor dread the tempest 's shock : a bless land i ween be that though luckless be its bey there lie the sea -- beyond lie france she

thus speak he -- ` tis not _ he _ eye -- ` tis not _ he _ brow -- another face be there : i never see this man before -- he head be like a pear take back thy medal moor -- ` tis not that which i hope to see epitaph of constantine kanari from the german of wilhelm müller i be constantine kanari : i who lie beneath this stone twice into the air in thunder have the turkish galley blow in my bed i die
