affection and as a souvenir of that loving act of benevolent sympathy elihu burritt worcester mass march 20 1850 jemmy stubbin or the nailer boy before i leave america in 1846 in order to gratify the wish that have long occupy my heart of visit the motherland i form for myself a plan of procedure to which i hope to be able rigidly to adhere i determine that my visit to england should bring I face to face with the people that i should converse with the artizan in he workshop and lift the lowly door-latch of the poor should become intimately acquaint with they life -- with they manners and it might be with they hope and sorrow \* \* \* \* \* Tuesday July 21st 1846 -- after a quiet cosy breakfast serve up on a little round table for myself alone i sit down to test the practicability of the plan i have form at home for my peregrination in england : -- _ viz _ to write until one pm then to take my staff and travel on eight or ten mile to another convenient stopping-place for the night as much depend upon the success of the experiment i be determine to carry the point against the prediction of my friend so at it i go _ con amore _ the house be as quiet as if a profound sabbath be rest upon it and the window of my airy chamber look through the foliage of grave elm down upon a green valley i get on swimmingly and after a frugal dinner at the little round table i buckle on my knapsack with a feeling of self-gratulation in view of the literary part of my day 's work have pay my bill and give the lady a copy of my corn-meal receipt i resume my walk toward w -- i be suddenly divert from my contemplation of this magnificent scenery by a fall of heavy rain drop as the prelude of a impending shower see a gate open and hear a familiar click behind the hedge i step through into a little blacksmith 's shop about as large a american smoke-house for cure bacon the first object that my eye rest on be a full-grown man nine year of age and nearly three foot high perch upon a stone of half that height to raise he breast to the level of he father 's anvil at which he be at work with all the vigor of he little short arm make nail i say a _ full-grown _ man for i fear he can never grow any larger physically or mentally as i put my hand on he shoulder in a familiar way to make myself at home with he and to remove the timidity with which my sudden appearance seem to inspire he by a pleasant word or two of greet he flesh feel case-hardened into all the induration of toiling manhood and as unsusceptible of growth as the anvil block fix manhood have set in upon he in the greenness of he youth and there he be by he father 's side a stinted premature _ man _ with he childhood cut off with no space to grow in between the cradle and the anvil-block chase as soon as he could stand on he little leg from the hearth-stone to the forge-stone by iron necessity that would not let he stop long enough to pick up a letter of the english alphabet on the way o lord john russell think of this of this englishman 's son place by he mother scarcely wean on a high cold stone barefoot before the anvil there to harden sear and blister he young hand by heating and hammer ragged nailrod for the sustenance those breast can no longer supply lord john look at those nail as they lie hiss on the block know you they meaning use and language please you lordship let I tell you -- i have make nail many a day and many a night -- _ they be iron exclamation point _ which this unlettered dwarf boy be unconsciously array against you against the british government and the government of british literature for cut he off without a letter of the english alphabet when printing be do by steam for incarcerate he for no sin on he parent ' side but poverty in a dark six-by-eight prison of hard labor a _ youthless _ be -- think of it -- a infant harden almost in its mother 's arm into a man by toil that bow the sturdiest of the world 's laborer who come to manhood through the intervene year of childhood the boy 's father be at work with he back toward I when i enter at my first word of salutation to the lad he turn around and accost I a little bashfully as if unaccustomed to the sight of stranger in that place or reluctant to let they into the scene and secret of he poverty i sit down upon one end of he nail-bench and tell he i be a american blacksmith by trade and that i have come in to see how he get on in the world whether he be earn pretty good wages at he business so that he could live comfortably and send he child to school as i say this i glance inquiringly toward the boy who be look steadily at I from he stone stool by the anvil two or three little crock-faced girl from two to five year of age have steal in timidly and a couple of young frightened eye be peer over the door-sill at I the poor englishman -- he be as much a englishman as the duke of wellington -- look at he bushy-headed barefooted child and say softly with a melancholy shake of the head that the time be rather hard with he it trouble he heart and many hour of the night he have be keep awake by the thought of it that he could not send he child to school nor teach they himself to read they be good child he say with a moist yearning in he eye they be all the wealth he have and he love they the more the harder he have to work for they the poorest part of the poverty that be on he be that he could not give he child the letter they be good child for all the crock of the shop be on they face and they finger be bent like eagle 's claw with handle nail he have be a poor man all he day and he know he child would be poor all they day and poorer than he if the nail business should continue to grow worse if he could only give they the letter it would make they the like of rich for then they could read the testament he could read the testament a little for he have learn the letter by the forge-light it be a good book be the testament and he be sure it be make for nailer and such like it help he wonderfully when the loaf be small on he table he have but little time to read it when the sun be up and it take he loner to read a little for he learn the letter when he be old but he lay it beside he dish at dinner time and feed he heart with it while he child be eat the bread that fall to he share and when he have spell out a line of the shortest word he read they aloud and he eldest boy -- the one on the block there -- could say several whole verse he have learn in this way it be a great comfort to he to think that jame could take into he heart so many verse of the testament which he could not read he intend to teach all he child in this way it be all he could do for they and this he have to do at meal-time for all the other hour he have to be at the anvil the nailing business be grow harder he be grow old and he family large _ he have to work from four o'clock in the morning till ten o'clock at night to earn eighteen-pence _ he wages average only about _ seven shilling a week _ and there be five of they in the family to live on what they could earn it be hard to make up the loss of a hour not one of they hand however little could be spare jemmy be go on nine year of age and a helpful lad he be and the poor man look at he doatingly jemmy could work off a thousand nail a day of the smallest size the rent of they little shop tenement and garden be five pound a year and a few penny earn by the youngest of they be of great account but continue the blacksmith speak cheerily i be not the one that ought to complain many be the man that have a harder lot of it than i among the nailer along this hill and in the valley my neighbor in the next door could tell you something about labor you never have hear the like of in you country he be a older man than i and there be seven of they in he family and for all that he have no boy like jemmy here to help he some of he little girl be sickly and they mother be not over strong and it all come on he he be a oldish man as i be say yet he not only work eighteen hour every day at he forge but _ every Friday in the year he work all night long _ and never lay off he clothes till late of Saturday night a good neighbor be john stubbin and the only man just in we neighborhood who can read the newspaper it be not often he get a newspaper for it be not the like of we that can have newspaper and bread too at the same time in we house but now and then he beg a old one partly tear at the baker 's and read it to we of a Sunday night so once in two or three week we hear something of what be go on in the world -- something about corn law and the duke of wellington and oregon and indium and ireland and other part of england we hear tell a while ago that the poor people would not have to make so many nail for a loaf of bread much longer because sir robert peel and some other man be go to take off the port-lock and other tax and let we buy bread of they that could sell it the cheapest when we hear this talk of without know the truth of it john stubbin take a penny and go to the white hart and buy a drink of beer and then the landlady let he look into the newspaper which she keep for she customer when he come back he tell we a good deal of what be go on and say he be sure the time would be better one of these day here he be interrupt by john stubbin himself who hear some strange voice mingle in earnest conversation in the other end of the building come round to see who be there with the entrance of this john stubbin i must turn over another leaf of my journal \* \* \* \* \* second visit to the little nailer the interest create in the united state by the above account of my first meeting with josiah encourage I to propose that the child of america should by a subscription of a half dime each contribute as much money as would clothe and educate he for a year the proposition meet with a cordial response and one hundred dollar be soon collect for this purpose at the time i first throw out the proposition in regard to the education of the little nailer i hardly believe that they could so abolish space and dry up the ocean intervene between they and such a young sufferer as they have do bless you heart child i reckon you would have a merry time of it about christmas and have you pocket fill with all sort of nice thing that would come by way of affectionate remembrance from grand-papa down to the fourth cousin and you would bring to mind lot of boy and girl that have no one to give they a picture-book as large as a cent and who could not read it if they have one i think this would be a good time to put in a word for the little nailer and so i throw out the thought very hopefully that you should all contribute something from you christmas present and make the little fellow a christmas gift of a year 's schooling i suggest this idea between doubt and hope i do not know how it would strike you i do not know but some of you might think that the great ocean be too wide to be cross by you little charity that other might say he be only a _ english _ boy -- he do not belong to we family circle -- let he alone and so i wait anxiously to hear from you for i be sure you would talk it over among yourselve in the school-room and on the way home and by the fireside well after wait a few week the english steamer come in from boston and bring I a letter from ezekiel and the happiest thing in it be that the boy and girl of we school room have make no more of the atlantic ocean than if it have be a mud-puddle which they could step across to give a help hand to a lad who be down and could not get up alone it make my heart get up in my mouth and try to talk instead of my tongue when i read to some of my friend here what you have do for the little nailer when i tell they to read for themselves and see that you sympathy know nothing about any geography any more than if the science of natural division have never be discover or if ocean sea river or mountain or any such term as _ american english _ or _ african _ be not to be find in the dictionary the letter state that one hundred and sixty half-dime have already come in from child all over the country to pay the schoolmaster for teach the little english nailer to read in the testament and to write a legible hand nor be this all -- ezekiel say that there be no tell how many more half-dime would come in for not only have the child of we own school-room take up the matter but those of other school-room especially away down in maine be determine to have some share in fitting out the nailer-boy with a education sufficient to make a man of he if he will use it aright i see it clear that the little fellow be to be put to school that he hammer be to lie silent on the anvil for the space of one cold winter and that the young folk in america would foot the bill and i be determine that this should be a christmas gift to he that he and he young american benefactor might enjoy it together so two day before christmas i start from birmingham on foot to carry the present to he it be a bright frosty morning and after a walk of twelve mile i come in sight of the little brick cottage of the nailer by the wayside i approach it with mingled emotion of solicitude perhaps it have be vacate by the poor man and he family and some other nailer have take he place perhaps the hand that spare neither rich nor poor have be there and i should miss the boy at the anvil i stop once or twice to listen the window be open but all be still there be no clicking of hammer nor blowing of bellows to indicate that the nailer family be still its occupant i begin to fear that they be go and my imagination run rapidly over a hundred casualty and change which might have come upon they the same gate be open that invite I to enter last summer and as i pass through it i meet a woman who say the nailer be at dinner in the family apartment of the building she go in before I and the next moment i be in the midst of the circle of my old acquaintance who have just rise from the table and be sit around the fire my sudden appearance in they midst seem to cause as much pleasure as surprise the father arise and welcome I with the heartfelt expression of good-will little josiah the hero of my story come forward timidly with a sunny token of recognition brighten up he black sharp eye the mother a tidy interesting look woman in a clean white cap add she welcome and i sit down with they with josiah standing between my knee and tell they my story -- how some child in america have interested themselves in they boy -- how they have think of he on they way to school and talk of he on they way home and in the parlor and the kitchen and the cottage -- how they have contribute they penny which they have save or earn to send josiah to school to learn to read the testament and how i have come to bring they and to ask if the boy could be spare from the anvil i glance around upon the group of child whose eager eye indicate that they partially comprehend my errand and then at a couple of side of bacon suspend over my head the nailer 's eye follow my own and as they reciprocally rest on the bacon he commence he reply from that end of the subject he say it be true that many be worse off than he and many be the comfort he have that thousand of the poor know nothing of here he glance affectionately at he child but my eye bring he back to the bacon and so he go on apparently under a new impression of he resource of comfort he say he have to sell some of he goods to buy the pig when very small and have _ luggled _ along with some difficulty to feed and fatten he into a respectable size yes he be a pretty clever pig nor be that all -- the nailing business have become better by a half-penny a thousand than when i be with they in the summer and josiah could now earn ninepence a day he want to send all he child to school if they could not read they would be poor even if they should come to own park and carriage he could not bear to see they grow up with no book in they hand he work long at the anvil as it be and he be willing to work longer and harder to pay the schoolmaster for teach he child to read josiah be now ten year old he have be a faithful boy he have make nail ever since he could hold a hammer and it be for this that he desire the more to send he to school it have trouble he much all along that the boy be work so long and so well at the anvil without have any of he wages to pay the schoolmaster for teach he something that would make he rich in he poverty when he come to be a man and he have try to make up this to he in a little way by read to he easy verse from the testament many of which he have learn by heart besides this he have buy a little picture-reading-book since i be with they last and josiah could master many easy word in it for he have learn almost all the letter but he know this be a slow way of get on although he fear it be the best he could do for he he know not how he could manage to spare he for the winter he have no other boy there be a baby in the cradle only a fortnight old which make he five child under ten year of age to be feed warm and clothe through the winter month here he fall into a calculation of this kind -- he could now earn nine shilling or about two dollar and twenty cent a week he coal cost he three shilling a week and he house-rent two leave he but _ four _ shilling a week for a family of seven person to live upon josiah 's clothes be well nigh go they be indeed ragged there be nothing leave to sew patch to and all he have in the world be on he except a smock frock which he put on over they on the sabbath these consideration give a thoughtful tone to the nailer 's voice as they come upon he mind and a thoughtful air come over the family group when he have finish and they all look straitly into the fire as much as to say it can not be do so i begin at the bacon to soften down these obstacle -- there be nearly 150 pound of it besides a spare-rib hanging from another joist -- and suggest how much better off they be than ten thousand of poor people in the world could they ever spare josiah better than during this winter he would learn faster now than when he be older and when they could not spare he so well nor be this all if they could get on without he for a few month he might not only learn to read without spelling but he could teach he three little sister to read during the winter night and the baby too as soon as it could talk so that send he to school now would be like send all he child to the same school yes it might be more than this let he go for a few month and when he come back to the anvil he might work all day and in the evening he might get together all the nailer child that live within a mile and teach they how to read and write there be the little wesleyan chapel within a rod of they own door lie useless except on sunday it would be just the place for a evening school for fifty or even a hundred little child whose parent be too poor to send they to the day-school of the town and would not they like to look in and see josiah with he primer in hand teach they neighbor ' child to read in this way with he clean smock-frock on set copy in the writing-book of the little nailer josiah who be stand between my knee look sharply into the fire with he picture book in he hand turn suddenly around at this idea and fix he eye inquiringly upon my own the thought vibrate through all the fine-strung sympathy of parental affection the mother lean forward to part away the black hair from the boy 's forehead and say softly to he father that she would take the lad 's place at the anvil if they should want he wages while at school this be the crisis of my errand and in my imagination i try to catch the eye of the child in we school room in america as i go on to say that they would not be willing to have josiah go to school in he old wear out clothes to be laugh at or shun by well-dressed school-mate nor that he should stay at home for want of decent and comfortable clothes i know what they would say if they be with I and so i offer to fit he out at the tailor 's shop with a good comfortable suit as a part of the christmas present from he young friend on the other side of the ocean the little one be too timid to crow but they look as if they would when i be go and the nailer and he wife almost cry for joy at what the child of a far-off land have do for they son for myself i only regret that i could not share at the moment with those young friend all the pleasure i feel in carry out they wish and deed of beneficence i hope it be not the last time that i shall be associate with they in these little adventure of benevolence perhaps i have make too long a story of my second visit to the nailer 's cottage i will merely add that it be agree that i should proceed into the town a distance of a mile and a half to make arrangement for the boy 's schooling and be join there by he and he father so bidding adieu to the remainder of the family i continue my walk into the town of bromsgrove and soon find a kind-hearted school teacher who agree to take the lad and do he best to forward he education have meet several gentleman in the course of my inquiry they become interested in the case and go with I to the inn where the lad and he father be wait for I thence we all proceed to a clothing shop where the little nailer be soon fit with a warm and decent suit one of the company a baptist minister to whose congregation the schoolmaster belong promise to call in and see the boy occasionally and to let I know how he get on i hope josiah will soon be able to speak for himself to the child in we school room on Monday after christmas he make he first entry into any school-room for the object of learn to read \* \* \* \* \* a budget from the little nailer they have come the long expect letter from jemmy stubbing or the nailer boy i be sure they will be a treat to all the child that meet in we school-room i hope all the bench will be full whilst josiah 's letter be read and what a nice thing it be in the child in america to take that little fellow out of the cinder and soot of the blacksmith 's shop and send he to school for two year now many a little boy and girl of we school-room circle have contribute half a dime towards josiah 's education i would ask that little boy or girl what he or she would sell out all right and title to the pleasure and consequence of that act for what would you take in money down for you share in the work of expand that little fellow 's mind and fill it with such new idea as he express in he letter what a new world he have live in since he return from school to he little wayside smithy the roof of which can hardly be see over the hedge think of it -- but you can not think of it as it be unless you could see that nailer 's shop and cottage but think of what he be when you take he from the anvil and send he to school then he could not tell a letter of the alphabet and never would have read a verse in the bible if it have not be for you half dime now see with what delight he search the scripture and mark and commit to memory choice verse in that holy book he have teach he father to read it too and be teach he sister and the child of the neighbor to read it and all good book a great many young boy and girl in england have hear what you do for he and some of they be begin to write to he and he answer they and give they good advice the last steamer from england bring we a nice lot of letter from he some direct to you some to I and one or two to other i will read they to you in the order in which they be write

josiah write they he be now about 12 year old work with two hammer one with he foot the other with he hand strike off nail as fast as he can but i should like to compare he write with the writing of any little boy and girl of he age that meet in we school-room he have no nice desk to write on he pen and ink be such as he can get there be no pen and ink in he father 's house three year ago for no one could make letter there when you send josiah to school you see he care for he little sister it do not take all the two gold sovereign we send he first to pay for he suit of clothes it would have do if he have determine to buy himself a nicer suit but he remember he sister lovingly and give part of he money to buy each of they a shawl and pretty nice shawl they be we have not the slightest doubt and take a considerable part of the money you send he he know you be kind to he but he do not think you would remember he sister too and send they something to make they warm and comfortable through the winter they have receive before this time the two sovereign or ten dollar which you contribute for they new year 's present how i wish that all of you who send in you half dime for they could look in upon that nailer 's family circle when they open the letter and see two bright gold sovereign for the little one the baby will crow a little at that and the mother who drop she head and wipe she eye as josiah read to she out of the citizen about that little girl in newton who go without milk so long that he might have a suit of clothes for christmas will drop she head again but she will cry for joy and there will be hop up and down for the space of fifteen minute i reckon and josiah 's black eye will twinkle with the gladness in he heart and the neighbor 's child will know it all before the news be two hour old and then you will have another letter from josiah and may be he oldest sister will try she hand at a few mark for you and now before i dismiss the school i want to ask each boy and girl on these bench who give a half dime for josiah 's education if the brightest silver dollar ever coin would buy of either of they that half dime would you sell for a dollar you share in he education and happiness in the joy hope and expectation which you gift have bring to life in that poor nailer 's cottage there be some beautiful verse in the bible which i hope you will write in you copy-book and remember all you day he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord and he will repay and have you not be pay fifty time over for what you give josiah it be more bless to give than to receive say one who give the greatest gift that god could give to mail have you not find it so in regard to you gift to josiah you see how happy you have make he how bless it have be to he to receive you present but how bless and happy you must be to make he all this joy and gladness ask little phebe alcott there if she have not get she pay ten time over for go without milk so many day that he might have some warm clothes for winter ask little sarah brown if she have not be repay well for carry around she subscription paper for he so many frosty morning in worcester and now good-night it have be a long long time since i meet you in the school-room many new face have be add to we circle some that i use to see here be go but still the bench be full and i hope no boy or girl will vacate they seat for the next year little johnny by jb syme \* \* \* \* \* it be we fortune to be bear in the country -- far away at the foot of one of the blue hill of scotland -- in a quaint old fashion little house -- in a quiet little village that seem shrunken and gray and grim and decrepid with age the droop ash the solemn oak and the shady plane-tree spread they long arm tenderly over the straw-thatched roof of this lowly hamlet as if to defend it from the burning sun and reckless storm and the ayrshire rise and ivy creep up and cling to its damp and crumble wall in the broken part of the gable and in the crevice of the ruin chimney the dew-fed wall-flower grow in poverty and beauty and shake the incense from its wave flower into the bosom of summer the bearded moss cluster like a thousand little brown pin-cushion upon the old thatch and older stone and sometimes the polyanthus and primrose plant beside it by some child who love to look at flower would close they eye and lay they dewy check upon the moss 's breast at evening the only link that connect the simple primitive people of this little hamlet with the purely ideal be they flower they do not know about the participle mystery that science have discover in those beautiful child of god the flower they could not like the poor pariah to whom the proud hindoo of indium will not speak converse poetic story with those daughter of spring and summer yet they see something in they flower beyond the visible and lowly circumstance of they own every-day life -- something that lift they eye from the ground to heaven the marigold that star of the earth with its bright yellow petal remind they of the golden star of heaven the daisy with its pure white blossom bath in the dew and sunlight of smile morning recall to they mind the story they have hear in they childhood about the diadem of fairy and the blue forget-me-not seem to twinkle like the blue eye of the angel and when winter come and the fair summer flower fade away moralizing on life on death and eternity come sigh in they expire exhalation over that simple people 's soul it be from be teach in this way to love the flower of the country that i cultivate sympathy which pre-dispose I to love city flower when i be first transplant from my own green native valley into the heart of a great city when my early home be level to the ground and when its flower be wither never to bloom any more i feel as if i have come amongst grim wall to wither too and have be uproot from the light and life of my youth that i might die the bird that wail around I in they prison cage seem to weep for the hawthorn and alder tree that be grow beside the ruin of my old home and i weep with they for i too be sigh for nature as i become familiar with the lane and street and byway of the city i begin at last to find that there be flower too -- flower beautiful as the rose in the garden of paradise and bright as the smile of abel when he worship he god day by day in my little walk i pass a large square encompass by a low wall and lofty iron railing in which several hundred of boy and girl with rosy cheek and light heart sport and sing like fairy hold festival here be face lovelier than rose lip brighter than ripe cherry and eye purer than dew from the day i first beheld those flower of the city i cease to sigh for the country and its flower i use to stand and gaze at they with grateful delight and live over again my own childhood 's hour as i watch they childhood 's sport by and by i know and become know to several of those child i give they kind word and they return I beautiful smile there be amongst that host of child one little boy whose face be very fair whose eye be very bright and whose little foot make merry music on the smooth pavement girl have a strong intuitive love of the beautiful and johnny with he liquid eye and dimpled cheek and float ringlet of gold be the favorite of all the girl at school often wish that i have rose to place upon he brow and the water of paradise to sprinkle on he cheek that i might preserve they bloom forever but alas city flower droop and fade and die and though tear fall like hermon 's dew upon the cold green earth where they be sleep it will not renew they bloom nor bring they back from the grave i look amongst the tiny throng one day and johnny be not there -- i come again and again and still he be not there he have go away say i to gladden he grandmother 's bosom -- he grandmother who doubtless life far away in some little cottage in the country he will soon come back again and he do come back again for on a lovely summer day when the bird and butterfly and child be sport in the sun i see he seat in a little chair amidst he young companion shall i soon get well again to play with they say he lift he pale face and sad eye towards he mother 's yes say he mother with a sad smile and a deep sigh you will soon get well again johnny alas no fond mother the bloom have go from he cheek forever the beauty from he form henceforth if he live the thoughtless will laugh at he as he move painfully about the street -- the wicked will mock he in thy heart only and in the bower of paradise shall he now henceforth and forever live and bloom slowly and sadly i see he pale cheek grow paler and the lustre fade away from he eye time wear away and this stricken flower of the city fade away with it he could no longer sit and look upon he former playmate the air of autumn be too cool at last for he sensitive thin pale transparent cheek i be walk one day in a pensive mood along a crowded thoroughfare where active man jostle each other in the pursuit of business there be life and hope in they eye and vigor in they limb it be not on the street that one be likely to meet the blighted flower of the city -- the droop and the die do not wither away there within the chamber of silent and sorrowful home they breathe out they life and fade away as i walk along gaze at the tall grim building and dark alley that be so full of old historical memory i be suddenly recall from a reverie by a feeble cry and turn quickly round i saw in the arm of a robust and rosy lad the waste corpse-like form of my little friend i do not know how i recognize he it be by a intuition of the soul for not a feature that he countenance bear in he healthful day be visible i take he tremble little hand in mine and shake my head to clear the moisture from my eye say i attempt to smile -- how be you quite well say the die infant and he too smile i know that it be a angel that light up that smile -- that it be the immortal spirit rise in sublime resignation above the vanity of health and earthly beauty that beam in he blighted face i can not walk now say johnny in a soft low voice that he panting chest could scarcely articulate i could not speak -- and continue the boy with a little sigh and in tremulous tone -- my mother be dead -- but thy father from whom the purest and holiest thing and thought have they being -- the source of all light and life and beauty and goodness live to thee johnny say i in my heart poor little blighted city flower think i as i look at he through my tear -- immortal flower of humanity -- purer and lovelier now in thy pain and resignation than when thy cheek be rosy and thy laugh be like a song-bird 's music thou shall soon be transplant to a land where no sorrow sigh and pain be know thy little feeble frame will moulder away beneath the daisy and the weep snow-drop but thy purify soul shall bloom in everlasting glory in the bosom of god oh you who be strong and full of life speak gently to the fragile droop blighted flower of city and do not scorn they they once be beautiful and now they only linger sadly here with no mother to cherish they kind word and gentle look be everlasting sunshine to city flower around the throne of god be white-winged cherubim whose countenance be purer than transparent snow and whose voice be sweeter than that of the angel azazil who lead the choir of the daughter of paradise those be the soul of little child who have suffer in they body and in they affection and who have yet
