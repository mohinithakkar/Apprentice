and now for college sam have say and all be anxious to know where they parent intend to send they next but instead of settle this question mr rover come forward with a proposition that be as novel as it be invite this be nothing less than to visit a spot in the west indy know as treasure isle and make a hunt for a large treasure secrete there during a rebellion in one of the central american

be introduce to stanley and max and the whole crowd walk slowly back to the college grounds then tom be take to he room the other go up-stair with he he wash and brush up go to the office and register and then the bell ring for supper the dining hall at brill be a more elaborate affair than the messroom at putnam hall but the rover be use to dine out in fine place so they feel perfectly at home dick and sam have already meet the instructor who have charge of they table mr timothy blackie and they introduce tom stanley and max be at the same table and also a long-haired youth name will jackson although he friend call he spud i do not know why they call I spud he say to dick except because i like potato so i would rather eat they than any other vegetable why when i be out in jersey

stanley do you sleep with you coat on why i -- er -- i guess i do that night answer will jackson in some confusion anyway i be a great potato eater he add lightly later on the other find out that spud have a vivid imagination and do not hesitate to draw the long bow for the sake of tell a good story the meal be rather a stiff and quiet one among the new student but the old scholar make the room hum with talk about what have happen at the previous term there be a good bit of conversation concern the last season of baseball and more about the come work on the gridiron from the talk the rover gather that brill belong to something of a league compose of several college situate in that territory and that they have hold the football championship four and three season before but have lose it to one of the college the next season and to another college the season just past football hit I say dick to stanley i would like to play first-rate maybe you 'll get a chance on the eleven although i suppose they give the older student the preference be the reply stanley have meet quite a few of the other student and after supper he introduce the rover and max and also spud thus the rover be speedily put on friendly term with a score or more of the freshman and also several of the other one of the senior a refined young man name allan charter take the crowd through the library and the laboratory and also down to the gymnasium and the boathouse we have not any boat race for we have no other college to race against say the senior the student sometimes get up contest between themselves though dick dawson use to be we best oarsman but last June a fellow name jerry koswell beat he koswell cry sam i think he be too much of a dude to row in a race at this remark the senior smile faintly evidently you have meet mr koswell he remark pointedly we have answer tom well he can row if he can not do anything else i would like to try my skill against he some day say tom who during the past year have take quite a fancy to rowing perhaps koswell will be glad to let you have the chance say allan charter a little later the senior leave the freshman and the latter stroll back in the direction of the college building it be now grow dark and the rover conclude to go up to they room and unpack they trunk which have just come in from the depot you fellow want to keep you eye wide open to-night caution stanley who come up with they haze ask dick so i be tell will they start in so early ask sam any time after midnight i hate to think of it but i reckon a fellow have get to

apartment for company lock he door as he do so i 'll tell you what i would do if i be you dick say tom stay here to-night my bed be big enough for two on a pinch then if there be any hazing we can keep together to-morrow if songbird come it will be different this suit the oldest rover and he bring over such thing as he need for the night the boy be tire out have put in a busy day and by ten o'clock sam and tom be both yawning i think i 'll go to bed say sam if anything happen wake I up oh you 'll wake up fast enough if they come answer tom but i be go to lay down myself but i be not go to undress yet take off they shoe and collar tie and coat the boy say they prayer and lay down sam be soon in the land of dream and presently tom and dick follow two hour pass and the three lad be sleep soundly when suddenly tom awake with a yell a stream of cold water have strike he in the head make he imagine for the instant that he be be drown hi stop he splutter and then stop for the stream of water take he directly in the mouth then the stream be shift and strike first dick and then sam all three of the rover leap from the bed as quickly as possible although confuse from be awaken so rudely they realize what it mean they be be haze chapter vi a hazing and what follow the stream of water come from a small hose that be be play through a transom window over the door of the room a lad be hold the hose and in the dim light dick recognize the face of a youth name bart larkspur a sophomore who do not bear a very good reputation larkspur be poor and dick have hear that he be use by flockley koswell and other to do all sort of odd job for which the richer lad pay he well stop that you cry the oldest rover and then rush to the door he fling it open and give a shove to what be beyond this be a short step-ladder upon which larkspur and several other be stand and over the ladder go with a crash send the hazer to the floor of the hallway in a heap get the hose whisper tom who have follow he brother and while the sophomore be endeavor to get up he catch the squirm hose and wrench it nozzle and all from bart larkspur 's hand hi give I that yell larkspur all right here you be answer tom merrily and turn the stream of water directly in the sophomore 's face larkspur splutter and shy and then plunge to one side into a fellow student standing near this be dudd flockley and he be carry down on he back play away six call out tom in true fireman style and direct the stream on flockley it hit the dudish student in the chin and run down inside he shirt collar stop i beg of you oh my scream flockley try to dodge the water larkspur grab the hose knock that rascal down why do not somebody do something give I that hose you freshie call out jerry koswell who be in the crowd do not you know better than to resist you superior i want you to understand -- keep cool old man do not get excited answer tom brazenly ah i see you be too warm will that serve to keep you temperature down and now he turn the hose on koswell hit the fellow directly in the left ear koswell let out a wild yell and start to retreat and so do several other do not go capture the hose call out flockley but even as he speak he take good care to get behind another sophomore capture it yourself growl the youth he be use as a shield say you be make too much noise whisper another student do you want the proctor down on we and turn that water off before you ruin the building somebody have get to pay for this remember he add as it be a unwritten law of brill that all hazer must pay for any damage do to college property while haze anybody one of the sophomore start for the lavatory where the hose have be attach to a water faucet but while the water still run tom aid by dick and sam direct the stream on the sophomore who be force to retreat down the hallway now rush 'em rush 'em yell flockley when the water have cease to run bind and gag 'em and take 'em down to the gym we can finish haze 'em there get into the room whisper dick hurry up and barricade the door right you be but no more hose water for I answer tom and pull on the rubber with all he might it part about half way down the hallway and into the room he dart with the piece in he hand then sam and dick close the door lock it and shove a bed and the table against the barrier they also turn the button of the transom window so that the glass could not be swing back as before now they can not get in unless they break in say dick grimly and i doubt if they 'll dare to do that say maybe i be not wet remark sam survey he drip shirt never mind we send as good as we get and more answer tom with a grin let we put on we coat so we do not catch cold no use of put on dry clothing until you be sure the ball be over tom you be a crack fireman say dick with a smile i 'll wager those soph be mad enough to chew nail what be sauce for the goose be sauce for the gander quote the fun-loving rover what be the good of live if you can not return a compliment now and then for several minute all be silent outside then come a light knock on the door dick hold he hand up for silence and the knock be repeat do not answer they whisper the oldest rover say i want to talk to you fellow come in low tone this be important who be you ask dick after a pause i be larkspur -- bart larkspur i want to tell you something well what be it demand tom you resistance to we class will not do you any good if you 'll come out and take you medicine like man all right but if you resist it will go that much harder with you who send you -- frank holden asked sam what have holden to do with it growl larkspur we know he be the leader of you class he be not dudd flockley be we leader then flockley send you eh put in dick yes if you want to know it well tell flockley to mind he own business answer dick sharply if frank holden want we we 'll come but not otherwise be you haze any of the other fellow ask tom we 'll haze they after we get through with you growl larkspur and then the rover hear he tiptoe he way down the hall i think this attack be get up by the flockley-koswell crowd be dick 's comment maybe it be not sanction by the other soph at all the rover wait a while longer and then with caution they pull back the bed and the table and open the door by the dim light in the hallway they see that the place be desert somebody have run a mop over the polished floor thus take up most of the water i guess they have give it up for to-night say dick and he word prove correct after wait a good hour the three rover rearrange the room hang up some of the bedding and rug to dry near the window which they leave wide open then they lock the door and go into dick 's room which have not be disturb as they do this another door open and stanley poke out he head follow by max we hear it all say the southern lad with a chuckle hope you douse 'em good we do answer tom they do not tackle you do they no but i suppose they will later or to-morrow i be ready for they if they come come from max i get this and he hold up a long white sack what be it ask sam plaster of paris if they tackle I i 'll make 'em look like marble statue

water brighten they greatly while get ready for breakfast they look for flockley and koswell but those two student as well as larkspur keep out of sight they do not like the way matter turn out last night say dick on enter the dining-room they see the sophomore at a nearby table flockley and koswell glare darkly while as they pass larkspur put out he foot to trip sam up but sam be on guard and instead of stumble he step on the fellow 's ankle something that cause larkspur to utter a gasp of pain what do you do that for he demand savagely sorry but you should not sprawl all over with you foot answer the youngest rover coldly and pass on to he seat when he look back larkspur watch he chance so that no teacher might see he shake he fist at sam we have get to keep we eye wide open for

dick sure thing come from songbird and he commence to recite : oh the soph and the junior will try to steal from the freshy each tie but they will not win for we 'll fight they like sin -- and bust 'em right plumb in the eye finish tom oh say but will you all sew you necktie fast sure and we 'll tell the rest to do so too add another freshman who be present the news soon circulate and be keep from all but the first-year student it must be confess that many of the student find it hard to fix they mind on they lesson that afternoon one boy max spangler bring on a great laugh when the follow question be put to he : what great improvement in navigation do fulton introduce necktie answer max abstractedly necktie query the instructor in astonishment i -- er -- i do not mean necktie stammer the german-american student i mean steamboat when the afternoon session be over the student hurry to they various room the sophomore and the junior who be to take part in the contest talk matter over and as far as possible lay out a plan of action it be decide that the largest and heaviest of the second and third-year student be to tackle the smallest freshman first while the other be to hold the rest of the first-year man at bay we 'll get fifteen or twenty necktie first clip that way say one of the sophomore and it do not matter who we get they from a little chap 's tie count as much as that of a two-hundred pounder in the meantime the freshman be busy follow tom 's advice and sew they tie fast to they collar shirt and even they undershirt then dick who have unconsciously almost become a leader call the boy into a empty recitation-room now i have get a plan say he we want to bunch up and all the little fellow and lightweight get in the center the heavy fellow can take the outside and fight the other off understand yes that be a good idea forward to the fray yell stanley and woe be to he who try to get my tie he blood be on he own head he add tragically forward cry sam and let we watchword be ` die but no tie ' now do not get excite say dick take it coolly and i be certain that when the time be up we 'll have the most of we tie still on it be the custom to go out on the campus at a give time and when the chapel bell sound out the hour dick lead the freshman forward they come out of a side door in a body and form around the flagstaff almost before the sophomore and junior know they have appear the senior take no part but three have be tell off to act as referee and they stand around as if inspect the building and the scenery the instructor who also know what be come wisely keep out of sight come on and at 'em call out dudd flockley and this cry be quickly take up by all the other who be to take part in the contest hello they know a thing or two say frank holden who be the sophomore leader in the attack they have get the little fellow in the middle as tightly as possible the freshman gather around the flagstaff each wear a necktie of the college color and it be fasten as tightly as strong thread could hold it at 'em be the yell of the second and third-year lad tear 'em apart pull the tie from 'em and then they leap in at the big freshman and on the instant a battle royal be start down go four boy on the campus rolling over and over other catch each other by the hand and shoulder and wrestle valiantly dick and tom be in the front rank with sam directly behind they dick be catch by frank holden and the two wrestle with might and main frank be big and strong but dick manage to hold he so that all the sophomore leader could do be to get he finger tip on the sought-for necktie flockley tackle tom and much to he surprise be trip up and send flat on he back mad with sudden rage flockley scramble up and let out a savage kick for tom 's stomach but tom be too quick for the sophomore and leap to one side foul cry tom do not do that again call one of the senior to dudd if you do you 'll be rule out kick and punch be prohibit by the rule all the boy could do be to wrestle and throw each other and either try to pull the necktie away or hold on to they on and on the battle wage each minute grow hotter many of the student be almost winded and feel that they could not endure the struggle much longer dick tom and sam manage to keep they necktie although sam 's be tear loose by two sophomore who hold he as in a vise until stanley come to he assistance when the time be half up eleven necktie have be capture -- two of they almost tear to shred at 'em yell frank holden we have not begin yet hold 'em back be dick 's rally answer do not let 'em get near the little fellow again the contest rage and this time with increase bitterness in the melee some few blow be exchange but it must be admit that one side be about as much to blame for this as the other three additional necktie be capture make fourteen in all as thirty-seven freshman be in the contest the sophomore and junior have to capture five more necktie to win only three minute more sing out one student look at he watch at 'em rip 'em apart three minute more yell dick hold 'em back and we 'll win the enemy fight with increase fury and one more necktie be take -- the collar and collar band come with it but then of a sudden the chapel bell toll out the hour time 's up be the cry and we win come from a score of freshman in huge delight look out look out cry several small youth in the center of the crowd crack it be the flagstaff and all look in that direction the pole old and decayed be fall it look as if it would crush all who stand in its path chapter ix tom in trouble look out the flagpole be come down stand from under or you 'll be kill crack come from the pole and now many see that it be break off close to the ground some of the student have cling to it during the contest and the strain have be too much for the stick which be much rot just where it enter the ground those on the outside of the crowd run away with ease but not so those who be hem in two of the smallest of the freshman billy dean and charley atwood could not move fast enough and one fall over the other and both go down save I gasp one of the lad do not let the pole come down on I scream the other the flagstaff be fall swiftly and dick and many other see that it would fall directly across dean and atwood unless its progress be stay hold it up hold it up yell dick hold it up or they 'll be kill he put up he hand to meet the pole which be come down across the front of the campus tom do likewise and so do frank holden stanley brown and several other include a extra tall and powerful senior it be a heavy weight and for the moment the boy under it think they would have to let it go over come the pole and when it rest on the boy ' hand the top overbalanced the bottom and strike the ground send the lower end into the air as this happen billy dean and charley atwood be haul out of harm 's way then the pole be drop to the campus with a thud for several seconds all who stand near be too daze to speak then a cheer arise for those who have hold the flagstaff up long enough for the small youth to be rescue say that be a close shave exclaim sam he like a good many other be quite pale it be indeed say a senior who have come up the fellow who hold the pole up deserve a good deal of credit dick rover suggest it say songbird good for you dick he add warmly the fall of the flagstaff sober the whole party of student yet the freshman be jubilant over the fact that they have win in the color contest and we 'll wear the color this term cry tom proudly so we will call out other in a chorus we 'll wear 'em good and strong too and they do the very next day some of the lad come out with necktie twice the ordinary size and with hat band several inch wide all of course in the brill color billy dean and charley atwood be much affect by what have occur and quickly retire from the scene but later both of the small student thank dick and the other for what have be do for they the broken flagstaff be haul away by the laborer of the place and inside of a week a new pole much larger than the old one and set in concrete be put up for several day after the

dora and the laning girl what a bold young man be dora 's comment after they have pass he be a student at brill answer dick not a very nice kind either dick be much put out for he do not like any young man to stare at dora ashton be soon leave behind and carriage and buggy bowl along slowly over a country road line on either side with tree and bush and tidy farm under the tree dick allow he horse to drop into a walk and manage to drive with one hand while the other find dora 's waist and hold it dick somebody might see you she half whisper well i can not help it dora he answer it be be such a long time since we meet yes it seem like year and year do not it and to think we have get to go through college before -- before we can -- yes but dick be not it splendid that we be go to be so close to each other why we 'll be able to meet lot of time if the seminary authority will let you i understand they be very strict oh well we 'll meet anyhow will not we if you say so dear why yes

seminary i have get my eye open answer dick but just one more -- and then you can fix you hat they have get to make some allowance for folk that be engage he add softly as he press she cheek close to he own be we engage dick she ask as she adjust she hat be not we he demand why of course we be well if you say so but -- but -- i suppose some folk would think we be rather young well i be not so young as i use to be -- and i be grow older every day so be i i be not near as young as i be when we first meet -- on that little steamboat on cayuga lake when you and tom and sam be go to putnam hall for the first time no you be not quite so young dora but you be just as pretty in fact you be prettier than ever oh you just say that i mean it and i be the happiest fellow in the world this minute cry dick and catch she again in he arm once more the hat go over on dora 's ear but this time she forget to mention it truth to tell for the time be she be just as happy as he be but presently she face grow troubled and he remember the look she have give he at the depot something be on you mind dora he say what be it dick do you know that tad sobber be alive that he escape from that dreadful hurricane in west indian water yes i know it but i do not know it until a few day ago when songbird powell come to brill he say he have meet sobber in ithaca he come to see mamma i be afraid he would what do he say he come one evening after supper it be dark and stormy and he drive up in a buggy mamma and i and the servant be home alone although nellie have be over in the afternoon he ring the bell and ask for mamma and the girl usher he into the parlor he ask the girl if we have company and he say if we have he would not bother we guess he be afraid of be arrest perhaps so he tell the girl he be a friend from new york i go down first and when i see he i be almost scare to death i think i be look at a ghost naturally since you think he have be drown it be too bad he scare you so dora he say he have come on business and without wait begin to talk about the treasure we have take from the isle he insist upon it that the treasure belong to he since he uncle sid merrick be dead when my mother come in he demand that she give he some money and sign some papers what do you mother do she refuse of course then he get very wild and talk in a rambling fashion oh dick i be half inclined to think he be crazy and dora shudder what do he say after you mother refuse to do as he wish he get up and walk around the parlor wave he hand and cry that we be rob he that the treasure be he and that the rover be nothing but thief then mamma order he out of the house and send the girl to get the man who run the farm for we but before the man come sobber go away drive he horse as fast as he could have you hear from he since yes the next day we get a unsigned letter in it sobber say that by hook or by crook he intend to get possession of the treasure and for the rover to beware chapter xiii the rowing race have tell so much dora go into all the particulars of tad sobber 's visit to the stanhope homestead she tell of how sobber have argue and she say he have affirm that the rover have falsify matter so that the stanhope and the laning might benefit thereby what he say be absolutely untrue say dick father go over those papers with care and so do the lawyer and the treasure belong to you and the laning and to nobody else do not you think sid merrick fool sobber ask the girl perhaps but i guess tad be willing to be fool they set they heart on that money and now tad can not give it up in one way i be sorry for he and if a small amount of cash would satisfy he and set he on he foot i would hand it over we put dan baxter on he foot that way oh but baxter be not sobber dick sobber be wild and wicked i be so afraid he would attack mamma and I i hardly know what to do and he eye roll so when he talk do he go to the laning no probably he be afraid of you uncle mr laning will not stand for any nonsense i suppose you mother be afraid he 'll come back yes and to protect herself she have hire one of the farm man to sleep in the house the man be once in the army and he know how to use a gun then that will make sobber keep he distance he be a coward at heart i find that out when we go to putnam hall together but you must beware of he dick he may show himself here next it will not do he any good all i have get here be a little spending money no i do not think he 'll show himself here more than likely he 'll try to hire some shyster lawyer to fight for the treasure in the court but i do not think he 'll be able to upset you claim they have now reach hope seminary and the conversation come to a end the boy help the girl to alight and say good-by then they drive back to ashton where the buggy be leave at the livery stable and all pile into the carriage for the college on the way dick tell he brother about tad sobber dora be right he be a bad egg say sam i would not trust he under any consideration he be too much of a coward to attack anybody openly be tom 's comment but as dick say he may hire some shyster lawyer to take the matter into the court it would be too bad if the fortune be tie up in endless litigation he be get to get money to fight with first say dick oh some lawyer will take a case like that on a venture that be true several day pass quietly and the rover boy apply themselves diligently to they study for they wish to make fine record at brill we be here to get a good education be the way dick express himself and we want to make the most of we time as if i be not bone away to beat the band murmur tom reproachfully i would like to take the full course in about two year come from sam college study be mighty hard break in songbird who be work over he chemistry i do not get any chance to write poetry any more for which let we all be truly thankful murmured sam to tom ten minute more announce dick look at he watch then what do you say to a row on the river suit I cry tom all right then now clear out and -- silence a quarter of a hour later the rover boy and songbird walk down to the river there be plenty of boat to be have and dick and tom be soon out songbird and sam receive a invitation to go for a ride in a gasolene launch own by stanley suit I cry the would-be poet i can row any time but i can not always ride in a motor boat same here say sam a number of craft be on the river include one contain jerry koswell and bart larkspur koswell scowl as he see tom and dick rowing near by we 'll give 'em a shake up he say to he crony and turn they rowboat so that it bump fairly and squarely into the craft man by tom and dick the shock be so great that dick who have get up to fix he seat be nearly hurl overboard see here what do you mean by run into we demand the oldest rover on recover he balance sorry but it could not be help answer koswell why do not you get out of the way we do not have to retort sam and if you try that trick again somebody will get he head punch talk be cheap sneer larkspur say i hear you fellow have be boast of how you can row go on koswell after a pause we have not be boast but we can row answer tom want to race when now i do not know as i care to race with a chap like you koswell answer dick pointedly you be afraid no i be not afraid let we race they whisper tom to he brother i be not afraid of they oh neither be i tom well race you to rock island and back say koswell after consult larkspur all right answer dick want to bet on the result question koswell he be usually willing to bet on anything we do not bet answer tom and we would not with you if we do add dick i do not think you be in we class koswell and you never will be at the same time since you be so anxious to row against we we 'll race you -- and beat you this answer enrage jerry koswell and he dare the rover to wager ten dollar on the race they would not but other take up the bet and then several other wager be make rock island be a small stony spot half a mile up the stream so the race would be about a mile in length frank holden be choose as referee and umpire and all of the contestant prepare for the struggle you boat be lighter than that of the rover say holden to koswell and larkspur you really ought to give they some lead no this be a even start growled koswell very well but it do not seem quite fair it be soon noised around that the race be to take place and the river bank speedily become line with student anxious to see how the contest would terminate now tom take it easy at the start but finish up strong caution dick i feel like pull a strong stroke from the first answer tom let we do it and leave they completely in the shade no we must first try to find out what they can do say you have get to beat 'em come from sam as the launch come close if they win you 'll never hear the end of it they be not go to win answer dick quietly but firmly all ready ask frank holden as the boat draw up side by side near the boathouse float we be sing out tom ready answer jerry koswell go shout frank four pair of oar drop into the water simultaneously and away shoot the two craft side by side there be no disguise the fact that koswell and larkspur be good oarsman and what be equally important they have do much practice together on the other hand while dick and tom could row well they have pull together but twice since come to brill you have get you work cut out for you shout songbird but never mind go in and win for the first quarter of a mile the two row-boat keep close together occasionally one would forge ahead a few inch but the other would speedily overtake it then however the rover boy settle down to a strong steady stroke and forge a full length ahead see see the rover be win shout max in delight that be the way to do it cry stanley keep it up you be do nobly show 'em the way home add songbird pull jerry pull bart scream dudd flockley to he crony do not let they beat you before long the island be reach and the rover round it a length and a half ahead this make jerry koswell frantic and he call on larkspur to increase the stroke all right i be with you be the short answer the increase in the stroke speedily tell and inch by inch the second boat begin to overhaul the first then tom make a miss send a shower of water into the air at this the craft contain koswell and larkspur shot ahead hurrah that be the way to do it yell flockley in delight even money on the green boat take you answer spud jackson promptly how much a fiver all right steady tom caution dick now then ready yes then bend to it one two three four again the rover boy go at the rowing with a will increase they stroke until it be six to the minute more than that of koswell and larkspur the latter be frantic and try to do likewise but find it impossible inch by inch the rover ' craft go ahead now it be half a length then a length then two length say there be rowing for you be the comment of a senior just look at they bend to it yes and look at the quick recovery add another fourth-year student from two length the rover go three length ahead then koswell miss a stroke and tumble up against larkspur hi what be you do splutter larkspur in disgust cou -- could not hel -- help it pant jerry he be all but wind for the pull have be too much for he the rover win the rover win be the shout that go up and in the midst of the hubbub dick and tom cross the line win by at least six length koswell and larkspur be so disgusted that they do not even finish but stop rowing and turn away from the float the rover win announce frank holden a fine race too he add let I congratulate you and he wave he hand pleasantly to dick and tom i get a pain in my side and that make I miss the stroke say jerry koswell lamely some day i 'll race they again and win too you should have win this time growl dudd flockley when he be alone with he crony i drop twenty dollar on that race i never think they could row like that be larkspur 's comment i do not think i want to row against they again dick and tom be warmly congratulate by all they friend it have be a well-earned victory and they be correspondingly happy koswell be sourer than ever against they and vow he would square up somehow and larkspur agree to help he dudd flockley be glum for he spend money for the month be run

turn he almost run for the dormitory the laughter of the student ring out loudly after he chapter xvii a misunderstanding here be a letter from father -- quite a important one too say dick as he join he brother in one of the room several day later what about question sam while tom look up from a book with interest it be about tad sobber and that fortune from treasure isle answer dick what have that rascal show up again exclaim tom he have and accord to what father say he be go to make all the trouble possible for the stanhope and the laning that be too bad say sam i 'll read the letter go on dick and proceed to do so in part the communication run as follow : you write that you know about sobber 's call upon mr stanhope well after the girl leave for hope seminary sobber and a lawyer name martin snodd call upon mr laning and then upon I sobber be very bitter and he want to know all about what have be do with the treasure he claim that he and he uncle who be dead be rob of the box evidently sobber and the lawyer have talk the matter over carefully for the latter intimate that sobber might settle the case if the stanhope and the laning would give he seventy-five per cent of the fortune mr laning do not wish to go to law and tell sobber he might be willing to settle for a small amount say two or three thousand dollar but sobber would not listen to this and go off declare he would have it all ` since that time martin snodd have be busy and he have obtain a temporary injunction against the stanhope and the laning so that they can not touch a dollar of the money which as you know be now in several bank the matter will now have to await the result of the case which will probably be try in court some month from now ' i have learn that sobber have little or no money and that martin snodd have take the case on speculation sobber to allow he half of whatever he get out of it snodd 's reputation be anything but good so i be afraid he will have a lot of evidence manufacture to order i have recommend a firm of first-class lawyer to mr stanhope and the laning and they will of course fight the matter to the bitter end this be too bad cry sam after dick have finish so the fortune be tie up so they can not spend a cent of what be leave they can not touch a cent until the court decide who the fortune really belong to answer dick and if sobber should win the stanhope and the laning will have to pay back that which they have already use oh how can sobber win cry tom father say the stanhope and lan claim be perfectly legal true tom but you can never tell how a case be go to turn out in court if this martin snodd be a shyster he may have all sort of evidence cook up against we friend sobber would most likely swear to anything and so would some of the sailor save from the _ josephine _ and then there be some of sid merrick 's other relative who would try to benefit by the case they would probably testify in favor of sobber for they would not expect anything from mr stanhope or the laning but the record of mr stanhope 's business deal ought to be clear say sam they be not as clear as one would wish so father tell I answer dick he give a long sigh too bad and just when we think the stanhope and the laning could sit down and enjoy all that fortune i wonder if the girl know of this yet muse tom most likely they have have word from home answer dick it will make they feel pretty sore say sam yes it would make anybody feel sore answer the oldest rover we 'll have to drive over and see the first chance we get when they meet the girl the boy learn that they know all about the affair all be worried and show it this will upset mamma very much say dora i be afraid it will put she in bed it be too bad but it can not be help say dick dick do you think we ought to buy sobber off no he do not deserve a cent of that money papa say the case will not come up for a long time the court be so crowd with case remark nellie he be about as worry as anybody for he have already spend several thousand dollar and if we lose he will not know how to pay it back we 'll lend he the cash say tom promptly and for this nellie give he a grateful look the boy do they best to cheer up the girl but they effort be not entirely successful all feel that the coming legal contest would be a bitter one and that tad sobber and the shyster lawyer who be aid he would do all in they power to get possession of the fortune find on treasure isle the girl be come to the football game with sam and all say they trust brill would win the contest we be all go to carry brill flag say grace and i be go to root -- be not that what you call it -- as hard as i can then we 'll be sure to win cry dick yet the oldest rover be by no means confident the brill eleven have hear that they opponent be in the pink of condition they have play three game already and win all of they brill have play against the scrub only which be hardly a test of what it could do the day for the contest dawn clear and bright and early in the afternoon the visitor from roxley hope and other institution of learn as well as from ashton and other town commence to pour in they come on foot in carriage and automobile and on bicycle and soon the grandstand and the bleacher be fill to overflow flag and college color be in evidence everywhere and so be horn and rattle while dick be wait to catch sight of the carriage contain sam and the girl from hope he see another turnout approach in it be mr sanderson and he daughter minnie why how do you do mr rover cry the girl pleasantly very well answer dick politely raise he cap and how be you oh fine i make papa drive I over to see the game it be go to be something grand so i have hear go on minnie and then she add : think you and you brother be come to see we we -- er -- we have not have much time stammer dick he do not care to add that when he go to see a young lady it be always dora stanhope and that tom and sam call only on nellie and grace laning i have be expect you say the girl with a pretty pout have dudd flockley and jerry koswell be there since yes both of they come once and flockley come after that but i refuse to see they mr flockley wish to bring I to see this game but i send word that i be go with papa he ought to know enough to stay away by this time say dick he could think of no other remark to make can i get a seat anywhere ask minnie look anxiously over in the direction of the grandstand i think so wait i 'll look hold on put in mr sanderson just you take minnie along mr rover i 'll go and take care of the hoss i can stand anywhere and look on minnie prepare to spring to the ground and there be nothing to do but for dick to assist she he wonder if sam be come with dora and the other but do not see they then he lead the way through the crowd to where some seat be reserve i think you 'll be able to see nicely from here he say oh i know i shall she smile broadly at he you be very kind i do not know what i should have do if i have be alone -- there be such a jam oh i do hope you win and minnie beam on dick in a manner that make he blush for he see that several be watch they i must go now it be get late say dick after a little more talk he turn to see sam dora and the laning girl only a few seat away dora be look fully at minnie sanderson with wide open eye and a flush mount to she cheek oh so you have arrive cry dick cheerily but he voice have a catch in it somehow he feel guilty he could not tell why yes here we be answer nellie and what a crowd add grace dora say not a word she have stop look at minnie and she eye be direct to nothing at all on the football field well dora be you go to wish I success ask dick bind to say something oh i guess all you lady friend will wish you that be the answer in a voice that do not seem like dora 's at all why what be the matter he ask in a low voice mean only for she ear nothing but there be dora you have better go down to the field now i see the other player be get ready but if you be angry at I -- oh i be not angry so please leave I alone and now dora turn still further away while something like tear begin to spring into she eye dick draw back for she tone of voice nettle he he feel he have do nothing wrong he do not see that look in she eye or he would have understand how much she be hurt he turn nodded pleasantly to nellie and grace and hurry from the grandstand where have you be ask tom when he appear in the dressing-room up on the stand talk to the girl be dick 's short answer anything wrong you look out of sort no nothing be wrong answer the oldest rover but he feel that there be something my much wrong yet he could not tell tom i do not do anything out of the way i be sure i do not dick murmured to himself as he prepare to go out on the gridiron any gentleman would have find a seat for miss sanderson i suppose dora see I talk to she and now she imagine all sort of thing it be not fair well i do not care and dick whistle to himself just to keep up he courage he do care a great deal at last he be ready and he follow tom out on the field the roxley team have just come out and they friend be give they a royal welcome roxley roxley they shout they be the boy to win it be brill this time be the answering rally and then horn and rattle add to the din while banner be wave gaily in the brace autumn air dick look toward the grandstand try to single out dora instead he eye meet those of minnie sanderson and she wave both she banner and she handkerchief he answer the salute and then turn to look where dora and the laning be sit nellie and grace as well as sam cheer he but dora take no notice but she wave she flag at tom this last action make dick 's heart sink figuratively speak to he shoe how could a fellow hope to play and win with he girl cut he like that but then of a sudden he shut he tooth hard i 'll win even if she do not care he tell himself i 'll not do it for she or myself -- i 'll do it for the honor of brill chapter xviii the great football game it be not my intention to give all the particulars of that game of football between brill and roxley for the reason that i have many other thing to tell about yet i feel that i must tell something of that great second half which nobody who see it will ever forget in the first half roxley have the kick-off and they play such a fierce whirlwind game that before the leather have be on the gridiron eight minute they score a touchdown then they make another touchdown and just before the whistle blow for the end of the first half one of they player kick a goal from the field and brill score nothing more than this the playing be so rough that two of the brill eleven and one from roxley have to retire from the field of course the visitor go wild with joy and shout themselves hoarse they wave they color swing they rattle and toot they horn for fully five minute while the silence among the brill contingent be so thick it could be cut with a knife as sam afterward express it it be all over murmured stanley with a glum look on he face they eleven this year be too heavy for we we can not meet they in mass play that be certain be dick 's comment if we be go to gain anything at all it must be by open work tom rover can take felton 's place come the order from the head of the team and tom at once throw off the blanket he have be use and get into practice with another new man and some other dick feel sore physically and mentally he have be roughly use by two of the roxley player and have make a fumble at a critical moment and all during that heartrending first half dora have not notice he at all the coach do some plain talk to the player while in the dressing-room and tell they of where he think roxley might be weak -- at the left end do not mass unless you absolutely have to be he word of caution they have the weight but i do not think they have the wind keep they on the jump i think that be you only chance when the whistle blow for the second half the brill eleven come out on the gridiron with a do or die look on they face now pile it into 'em cry the coach do not give 'em time to think about it whether it be this caution or the very desperateness of the case it would be hard to say but true it be that brill go at they opponent hammer and tong from the very start they avoid all wedge work and confine themselves as much as possible to open play more than this they use a little trick dick have once play when on the eleven at putnam hall the ball be pass from right to left then to center and then to leave again and then carry around the end for a gain of twenty-five yard then it be pick up again turn back and to the left once more and force around the end for twenty yard more that be the way to do it yell several of the brill supporter over with it while you have get the chance the ball be force back by sheer weight of roxley but only for five yard then the brill quarter-back get it send it over to tom and in a twinkling tom nurse it to where he want it and kick a goal from the field hurrah hurrah hurrah that be the way to do it now then for another by the great julius caesar cry sam be not that fine oh it be grand exclaimed nellie and she wave she banner directly at tom and he wave he hand in return just then nellie feel as if she could go and hug he it certainly be fine say grace but it be only one goal and they have such a big score she pout never mind we will not be whitewashed anyway it be a pity they do not have tom in the first half say dora although she heart be strangely sore she nevertheless feel proud of what tom have accomplish again the two eleven go at it and now roxley try again to force the center by a rush but to they surprise brill shift to the leave -- that one weak spot -- and get the ball on a fumble by the roxley half-back there be more quick action by four of the brill player and when the scrimmage come to a end the leather be find just three yard from the roxley goal line and then come that awful struggle where muscle meet muscle in a strain that be truly terrific roxley be heavier but its wind be go fast brill hold at first then go ahead -- a inch -- a foot -- a yard hold 'em hold 'em be the roxley cry but it be not to be the yard become two and then the leather go over with a rush a touchdown a touchdown for brill now make it a goal be the cry and a goal it become the brill quarter-back do the kick from that moment on the battle wage with a fury seldom see on any gridiron brill from almost certain defeat commence to scent a victory and go into the play regardless of physical consequence tom have he thumb wrench and dick have he ankle skin but neither give heed to the hurt indeed they never notice they until the game be at a end and then come dick 's hour of triumph how he get the ball from the burly roxley right guard nobody could exactly tell afterward but get the ball he do and round two rival player before they know what be up then down the field he speed with he enemy yell like demon behind he and he friend on the bench encourage he to go on he see nothing and hear nothing until on the grandstand he perceive a slender girlish form arise wave a banner and fairly scream : dick dick run run run it be dora he think dora see I she want I to win it be the last bit of inspiration he need and as a roxley full-back come thunder up to he he throw the fellow headlong then straight as a arrow from a bow he rush for the goal line cross it and sink limply down in front of the grandstand hurrah for dick rover say be not that a dandy run those brother can certainly play it be brill 's game now roxley be go to piece amid a great din the leather be take down into the field and the goal be kick want to get out of the game dick be ask as he come down breathing heavily no not unless i be put out be the gritty answer you 'll not be put out that be the finest run ever make on this field what have be say

college result in a tie but delton be beat by brill by a score of 16 to 10 tom and dick play in both game and win considerable credit for they work during these day the boy do not see the girl nor do they hear from they thanksgive be pass at brill only a few of the student go home among the number to leave be dudd flockley and jerry koswell and they do not return until a week later the dude and he crony as well as larkspur be still down upon the rover but for the present they keep quiet the reason be that they be behind in they lesson and have to work hard to make up but all be watch they chance to do the rover boy some injury on the quiet dick tom and sam get along well in they study the only trouble they have in the classroom be with professor sharp who make they toe the mark upon every occasion but they take good care to obey the rule so the irascible teacher get no chance to lecture or punish they the boy get a number of letter from home and these bring news that the law case tad sobber have institute against the stanhope and the laning be be push vigorously mr rover write that he feel certain the shyster lawyer sobber have on the case be go to present a great mass of evidence no doubt manufacture for the occasion it be a shame cry tom after hear this such a lawyer ought to be in prison the thing of it be to prove he be do something wrong answer dick it be one thing to know the truth and quite another to prove it in court if the case should be lose the laning will be poorer than ever say sam that be true sam i wish we could do something but i be afraid we can not fate seem bind to make matter worse for the rover boy on a clear cold Saturday afternoon in December the three brother and songbird go out to look for nut in the wood near ashton they have hear that the seminary girl occasionally visit the wood for that purpose and each be secretly hope to run across dora and the laning it do not take the boy long to reach the wood and they soon find a spot where hickory nut be plentiful they have bring some bag along and be soon hard at work gather the nut while thus occupy they hear a number of girl come along at first they fancy the newcomer might be from the seminary but soon see that they be native of the place they be five in number and among they be minnie sanderson why how do you do say minnie come up with a smile on she face how strange to meet out here and then she shake hand with each of the rover and speedily introduce she friend and the rover introduce songbird minnie be neatly attire in a brown dress with a brown hat to match and while she do not look anyway stunning she make a attractive appearance she friend too be pretty and well dress and all be very jolly it be a nice bunch all right murmured tom to sam i like they open-hearted way of talk so do i answer the youngest rover the girl join the boy in gather nut and so spend a enjoyable hour roam through the wood often the rover and songbird would knock down the nut with stick and stone and leave the girl to gather what they want we like to have a large quantity of nut on hand for the winter say minnie to dick then when there be a deep snow on the ground we can sit before the blaze fire and crack nut and eat they you must come over some time this winter and help she add perhaps i will murmur dick he have to admit to himself that minnie be very cordial and that she be by no means bad look he do not wonder why flockley and koswell be so anxious to call upon she roaming through the wood cause songbird to become poetic and while they rest in the sunshine and pick some of the nut that tom and sam have crack he recite some verse compose on the spur of the moment : hark to the silence all around the well-trained ear doth hear no sound the bird be silent in they nest all tired nature be at rest the brook in silence find its way from shadow deep to perfect day the wind be dead there be no breeze -- to make a fellow cough and sneeze murmur tom and give a loud ker-chew that set all the girl to laugh that be not right declare songbird half angrily there be no sneeze in this poem oh excuse I i only think i would help you out answer tom soberly and then the would-be poet continue : the wind be dead there be no breeze to stir the bush or the tree full well i know as here i stand that solitude command the land good fine immense great cry sam enthusiastically hurrah for solitude why mr powell you be a real poet say one of the girl gravely and this pleased songbird greatly you 'll have to write in my autograph album say another and the would-be poet readily consent later he inscribe a poem in the book three page long at last it come time to leave the wood and the boy walk with the girl toward the road as they do this they hear the sound of wheel must be a carriage come say dick and step into the roadway to see follow by the other in the party a few seconds later a turnout rumble into sight it be the hope seminary carryall and it contain half a dozen girl include dora nellie and grace hello look there cry tom and raise he cap and the other boy do the same dora and she cousin look at the crowd and they face flush they bow rather stiffly and then the carryall bowl on its way why those be you friend cry minnie turn to the rover do not you want to speak to they it be too late now answer dick he have a curious sinking sensation in he heart that he could not explain he look at he brother and see that they too be out of sort the passing of the carryall put a damper on matter and the girl feel it they talk with the rover and songbird a few minute longer and then turn in one direction while the brill student turn in another fine lot of girl be songbird 's comment very nice indeed and they know how to appreciate poetry too he add with satisfaction oh yes they be all right answer dick carelessly somehow he be now sorry he have go to the wood after nut i be go to call on all of they some time go on songbird that minnie sanderson tell I she play the piano and sing i be go to get she to sing a new song i be write it go like this -- excuse I songbird not now say dick i want to do a extra lesson and he hurry

sarcastic as well as severe i -- i be not well sir say dick in a low voice none of we be but it be not liquor that do it it be the vapor vapor query doctor wallington in perplexity yes sir what do you

very sceptical i can not account for it except by think it be part of a plot against we hum the doctor turn to stanley have you anything to add to rover 's story nothing sir except that it be

to apologize for he get mad at first and threaten I with instant dismissal then i warm up and say i be innocent of all wrongdoing and perhaps i would be able to prove it some day and if so and i be dismiss i would sue the college for loss of reputation that bring matter to a head and i guess the doctor see i be in deadly earnest he tell I i could consider myself suspend for two week or until he could get to the bottom of the affair so i have get a holiday i be glad you do not apologize to sharp say sam what be you go to do with yourself -- go home ask dick no i be go to move to ashton and

satisfaction chapter xxx a beginning and a end it be allan charter 's come that clinch matter say tom doctor wallington might not have believe we but he have to believe charter he have to believe the girl too add dick he know they would not tell he such falsehood but i be glad charter come along he hate to get mix up in it i know but he act the man about it do not he wonder what the doctor will do with koswell & company question sam fire 'em most likely and they deserve to be fire growled stanley oh when i think of the trick that be play i feel like wipe up the floor with every one of those scoundrel it be certainly a bit of dirty work be dick 's comment the boy be seat in sam and tom 's room talk it over it be Sunday afternoon and outside the sun shone brightly and a light breeze stir the tree it have prove a strenuous Saturday afternoon and evening dick and dora have come up meeting allan charter the lead senior of brill on the way they have persuade charter to accompany they to the brice cottage and there all have witness a bitter quarrel between henry parwick and koswell larkspur and flockley parwick be semi-intoxicated and in a maudlin way have expose all that have be do at the haunt house he have speak about get the powder for they and mention how koswell have fix a fuse and light it and he tell of get the liquor bottle and flask and other thing he have warm up during he recital and have demand fifty dollar on the spot when refuse he have threaten to go to the brill authority and blow everything then koswell have threaten if this be do that he would have parwick arrest for rob he former employer william schlemp then have come blow and in the midst of this charter have step forward and confront the evildoer we have see and hear all he have say sternly i be a witness and so be these young lady you koswell flockley and larkspur ought to be ashamed of yourselve i never dream any student of brill could be so bad i shall report to doctor wallington without delay charter have be as good as he word and have be closet with the head of the college for a hour the girl go back with tom dick and sam and also have a interview with the president then doctor wallington send for flockley koswell and larkspur only flockley answer the summons and it be learn that koswell and larkspur be afraid to come back fear arrest parwick have also disappear then have come a telegram from dan baxter give the address of the druggist schlemp word be send to this man and later he write that parwick have once work for he but have be discharge for drunkenness and because he be not honest the interview between doctor wallington and flockley be a most affect one the dudish student break down utterly and confess all he say koswell have hatch out the plot aid by larkspur and that he himself have be a more or less unwilling participant he tell much about parwick and how that dissolute fellow have speak of have the strange powder which be a japanese concoction and which if use often would render a person insane he beg the good doctor to forgive he and say he would be willing to do anything in order to remain at brill my father will never forgive I if i be dismiss he say in a broken voice but suppose i have dismiss the rover and stanley browne ask the doctor severely yes yes i know sir wail flockley but oh sir do not send I away i 'll do anything if you 'll let I stay i will think it over answer the head of brill shortly and thus flockley be dismiss from the office it be certainly a wicked piece of work say songbird to the other in the room i really think somebody ought to be arrest tom be about to speak when a footstep sound in the hall and a knock on the door follow sam open the portal to behold flockley standing there hat in hand the dudish student be as white as the wall he clothing look dishevelled and he shoe be un-blacked a great contrast to the flockley of old what do you want ask sam abruptly i want -- i want -- commence flockley brokenly then he step into the room and confront dick oh rover he cry will not you -- will not you please please get doctor wallington to let I stay at brill please do not let he send I home i 'll do anything -- apologize get down on my knee if you like -- but please help I to stay here flockley catch dick by the arm and continue to plead and then he entreat sam tom and stanley also it be a truly affect scene they all commence to speak he have be so mean wicked so unlike a decent college fellow how could they forgive he and then come a pause and during that pause a distant church bell sound out full and clear across the hill surround brill dick listen and so do he brother and stanley and the anger in they face die down well i be willing you should stay say dick and i 'll speak to the doctor about it if you wish and so will i add sam and tom and stanley nod but you ought to cut such fellow as koswell and larkspur say tom i will i will say flockley earnestly the rover and stanley browne be as good as they word on the follow day they have another interview with the head of the college and speak of flockley well if you desire it he can remain say doctor wallington as for koswell and larkspur i doubt if they wish to return since they have not yet show themselves you can prosecute they if you wish no we do not want to do that say dick we have talk it over and we think for the honor of brill the least say the better that conclusion do you much credit and i feel greatly relieve say the head of the college he turn to tom you be of course reinstate thoma and i shall see to it that the mark place against you name be wipe out i sincerely trust that you and professor sharp will allow bygones to be bygones and will make a new beginning i be willing answer tom and a little later he enter one of the classroom and he and professor sharp shake hand after school professor blackie come up and shake hand all around i be glad to know you be exonerate say that professor this have teach I a lesson to take nothing for grant he add when the truth become know many of the student flock around the rover and stanley and songbird and congratulate they on the outcome of the affair flockley do not show himself for a long time except at meal and during class hour he feel he position keenly say dick well i hope he turn over a new leaf a telegram for richard rover say one of the teacher to the boy a few day later wonder what be up now muse dick as he tear open the yellow envelope he read the slip inside hurrah this be the best news yet he cry what be it ask tom and sam the injunction against the stanhope and the laning be dissolve by the court they can keep the fortune tad sobber have have he case throw out of court say that be great ejaculate tom and in the fullness of he spirit he turn a handspring i reckon that be the end of mr tad sobber say sam but the youngest rover be mistaken though beat in court sobber do not give up all idea of gain possession of the fortune and what he do next will be relate in another volume to be call the rover boy down east or the struggle for the stanhope fortune in that book we shall also meet jerry koswell and bart larkspur
