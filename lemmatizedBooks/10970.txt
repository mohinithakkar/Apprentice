viii thought and life bibliography preface mr murray 's youthful modesty insist that he study of pragmatism need a sponsor this be not at all my own opinion but i may take the opportunity of point out how singularly qualify he be to give a good account of it in the first place he be young and youth be a almost indispensable qualification for the appreciation of novelty for the mind work more and more stiffly as it grow older and become less and less capable of absorb what be new hence if we ` great authority ' live for ever they would become complete _ struldbrug _ this be the justification of death from the standpoint of social progress and as there be no subject in which _ struldbruggery _ be more rampant than in philosophy a youthful and nimble mind be here particularly need it have give mr murray a eye also to the variety of pragmatism and to they connection secondly mr murray have -lrb- like myself -rrb- enjoy the advantage of a severely intellectualistic training in the classical philosophy of oxford university and in its premier college balliol the aim of this training be to instil into the best mind the country produce a adamantine conviction that philosophy have make no progress since aristotle it cost about # 50000 a year but on the whole it be singularly successful its effect upon capable mind possess of common sense be to produce that contempt for pure intellect which distinguish the british nation from all other and ensure the practical success of administrator select by a examination so gloriously irrelevant to they future duty that since the lamentable demise of the chinese system it may boast to be the most antiquated in the world in mind however which be more prone to theorize but at the same time clear-headed this training produce a keenness of insight into the defect of intellectualism and a perception of the _ intellectual necessity _ of pragmatism which can probably be reach in no other way mr murray therefore be quite right in emphasize above all the service of pragmatism as a rigorously critical theory of knowledge and in refute the amiable delusion of many pedant that pragmatism be merely a emotional revolt against the rigor of logic it be essentially a reform of logic which protest against a logic that have become so formal as to abstract from mean altogether thirdly a elementary introduction to pragmatism be greatly need less because the subject be inherently difficult than because it have become so deeply involve in philosophic controversy intrinsically it should be as easy to make philosophy intelligible as any other subject the exposition of a truth be difficult only to those who have not understand it or do not desire to reveal it but british philosophy have long become almost as open as german to the -lrb- german -rrb- gibe that ` philosophy be nothing but the systematic misuse of a terminology invent expressly for this purpose ' and pragmatism too could obtain a hearing only by show that it could parley with its foe in the technical language of kant and hegel hence it have no leisure to compose a fitting introduction to itself for student of philosophy william jame 's _ pragmatism _ great as it be as a work of genius brilliant as it be as a contribution to literature be intend mainly for the man in the street it be so lack in the familiar philosophic catchword that it may be doubt whether any professor have quite understand it and moreover it be write some year ago and no longer cover the whole ground the other writings of the pragmatist have all be too controversial and technical the critic of pragmatism have produce only caricature so gross as to be unrecognizable and so obscure as to be unintelligible mr murray 's little book alone may claim to be -lrb- within its limit -rrb- a complete survey of the field simply word and yet not unmindful of due technicality it be also up to date though in deal with so progressive a subject it be impossible to say how long it be destine to remain so fcs schiller chapter i the genesis of pragmatism there be a curious impression to-day in the world of thought that pragmatism be the most audacious of philosophic novelty the most anarchical transvaluation of all respectable tradition sometimes it be picture as a insurgence of emotion against logic sometimes as a assault of theology upon the integrity of pure reason one day it be describe as the reckless theorizing of dilettante whose knowledge of philosophy be too superficial to require refutation the next as a transatlantic importation of the debase slang of the wild west abroad it be frequently denounce as a outbreak of the sordid commercialism of the anglo-saxon mind all these idea be mistaken pragmatism be neither a revolt against philosophy nor a revolution in philosophy except in so far as it be a important evolution of philosophy it be a collective name for the most modern solution of puzzle which have impede philosophical progress from time immemorial and it have arise naturally in the course of philosophical reflection it answer the big problem which be as familiar to the scientist and the theologian as to the metaphysician and epistemologist and which be both intelligible and interesting to common sense the follow question stand out : -lrb- 1 -rrb- can the possibility of knowledge be maintain against hume and other sceptic certainly if it can be show that ` the new psychology ' have antiquated the analysis of mind which hume assume and ` british associationism ' respectfully continue to uphold -lrb- 2 -rrb- see that inclination and volition indisputably play a part in the _ acceptance _ of all belief scientific and religious what be the logical significance of this fact this yield the problem ` the will to believe ' and more generally of ` the place of will in cognition ' -lrb- 3 -rrb- be there no criterion by which the divergent claim of rival creed and philosophy -- to be possess of unconditional truth -- can be scientifically test the sceptic 's sneer that the shift system of philosophy illustrate only the change fashion of a great illusion about man 's capacity for truth plunge dogmatism into a ` dilemma ' from which it can emerge only by find a way of discriminate a ` truth ' from a ` error ' and so solve the ` problem of truth and error ' the weird verbalism of the traditional logic suggest a problem which strike deeper even than the question ` what _ do _ you mean by truth ' viz : ` do you mean anything ' and so the ` problem of mean ' be propound by the failure of formal logic be logic not concern at all with _ meaning _ be it only juggle with empty form of word lastly if from all this there spring up a conviction of ` the bankruptcy of intellectualism ' the question suggest itself whether the relation between abstract thinking and concrete experience between ` think ' and ` life ' have be rightly grasp be life worth live only for the sake of philosophic contemplation or be think only worth do to aid we in the struggle for life be ` theory ' and ` practice ' two separate kingdom with rigid frontier strictly guard or do it appear that theory which can not be apply have in the end neither worth nor truth nor even mean it be plain from this catalogue of inquiry that pragmatism make no abrupt breach in tradition it be not the _ pétroleuse _ of philosophy it do not wipe out the history of speculation in order to announce a millennium of new idea it claim on the contrary to be the culmination and _ dénoûment _ of that history it can not rightly be represent as try either to sell new lamp for old or to jerry-build a new metaphysical system on the ruin of all previous achievement its real task be singularly modest it aim merely at instruct system-builder in the elementary law which condition the stability of such structure and conduce to they conservation it be therefore a grave mistake to regard it as a parochial eccentricity as a specific americanism nor be it the product of the misplace ingenuity of individual paradox-monger it have come into be by the _ convergence _ of distinct line of thought pursue in different country by different thinker 1 one of the most interesting of these have originate in the scientific world the immense growth of scientific knowledge during the last century be bind to react on human conception of scientific procedure the enormous number of new fact bring to light by manipulate hypothesis could not but modify we view of scientific law law no longer seem to scientist the immutable foundation of a eternal order but be inevitably treat as man-made formula for group and predict the event which verify they the labor of physicist like mach duhem and ostwald point to alternative formulation of new hypothesis for the best establish law the physics of newton be no longer final and the notion of ` energy ' be a dangerous rival to the older conception of ` matter ' it be of course indifferent to the philosopher whether the new physics be successful in supersede the old or not what it concern he to note be that dogmatic confidence in the finality of scientific law have give place to a belief that we law be only work formula for scientific purpose and that no science can truly boast of have read off the mind of the deity as sir jj thomson neatly put it a scientific theory for the enlighten modern scientist be a ` policy and not a creed ' science have become content to be only ' a conceptual shorthand ' provide that its message be humanly intelligible it no longer claim truth because abstractly and absolutely it ` correspond with nature ' but because it yield a convenient means of master the flux of event even mathematics long the pattern of absolute knowledge have not escape the stigma of relativity ` metageometry ' have be invent by riemann and lobatschewskus as rival to the assumption of euclid and the brilliant writings of poincaré have explain the human device on which mathematical concept rest euclidean geometry be reduce to a useful interpretation of the datum of experience it be not theoretically the only one its superior validity be dependent upon its use when apply to the physical world even mathematics therefore lend themselves to the philosophic inference draw by henrus bergson and other that all conceptual system of the human mind have a merely conditional truth depend on the circumstance of they application 2 another fountain-head of pragmatic philosophy have be darwinism indeed the pragmatic be the only philosophizing which have completely assimilate evolution the insight into the real fluidity of natural species ought long ago to have tone down the artificial rigidity of logical classification to know reality man can no longer rest in a ` timeless ' contemplation of a static system he must expand he thought so as to cope with a perpetually change process since the world change he ` truth ' must change to fit it he be face with the necessity of a continuous reconstruction of belief this influence of darwin have inspire the logical theory of professor dewey and the ` chicago school ' of pragmatist think in they writings be essentially the instrument of this readjustment its function be to effect the necessary change in belief as economically and usefully as possible it be a evolve process which keep pace with the evolution of reality and the change situation of mortal life 3 it be not however entirely the reaction of science upon philosophy which have give birth to pragmatism philosophy itself have be rent by internal convulsion these have be emphasize in the work of dr fc schiller who have show that already in the day of plato the distinction between ` truth ' and ` error ' be baffling philosophy that plato 's _ theaetetus _ have fail to establish it and that the famous dictum of protagoras ` man be the measure of all thing ' distinctly foreshadow the ` pragmatic ' or as he call it the ` humanist ' solution of the difficulty elsewhere dr schiller have comment on the controversy raise by hume 's criticism of dogmatism he have show that kant fail to answer hume because he accept hume 's psychology and that no _ a priori _ philosopher have since be able to devise any consistent and tenable doctrine the idealistic theory of the ` absolute ' reveal they futility by they want of application to the genuine problem of life and by the theoretic agnosticism from which they can not escape hence the need for a new theory of knowledge and a thorough reform of logic 4 at this point he join force with mr alfr sidgwick who have long be urge a radical criticism of the procedure of formal logic and show the gulf between they and the process of concrete thought sidgwick have demonstrate that the belief in formal truth render logic merely verbal and that the actual _ meaning _ of assertion completely escape it 5 the most sensational approach to pragmatism however be that from the side of religion the pragmatic method of decide religious problem which assert the legitimacy of a ` faith ' that precede knowledge have always be more or less consciously practice by the religious it be brilliantly advocate in the _ thought _ of pascal and clearly and forcibly defend in that most remarkable essay in unprofessional philosophy cardinal newman 's _ grammar of assent _ this line of reasoning however be most familiarly associate with the name of william jame he first illustrate the pragmatic method by a famous paper -lrb- for a theological audience -rrb- on _ the will to believe _ and found the psychological study of religious experience in he gifford lecture on _ the variety of religious experience _ 6 this bring we to the last and historically the most fertile of the source of pragmatism psychology the publication in 1890 of jame 's great _ principle of psychology _ open a new era in the history of that science more than that it be destine in the long run to work a transformation in philosophy as a whole by introduce into it those biological and voluntaristic principle to which he afterwards apply the generic name of pragmatism or philosophy of action we must pass then to consider the new psychology of william james chapter ii the new psychology until the year 1890 when jame 's _ principle _ be publish the psychology of hume reign absolutely in philosophy -lrb- a -rrb- all empiricist accept it enthusiastically as the sum of philosophic wisdom all apriorist submit to it even in supplement and modify it by ` transcendental ' and metaphysical addition in either case it remain uncontested _ as psychology _ and by propound a utterly erroneous analysis of the mind and its experience entangled philosophy in inextricable difficulty hume have as philosopher commonly do set out from the practically sufficient analysis of experience which all find ready-made in language he accept therefore from common sense the belief that physical reality be compose of a multitude of separate existence that act on one another and try to conceive mental life strictly on the same analogy he theory of experience therefore closely parallel the atomistic theory of matter just as the physicist explain body as collection of discrete particle so hume reduce all the contents of the mind to a number of elementary sensation whether the mind be reflect on its own internal idea or whether it be undergo impression which it suppose to come from a external source all that be really happen be a succession of detach sensation it seem to hume indisputable that every distinct perception -lrb- or ` impression ' -rrb- be a distinct existence and that all ` idea ' be equally distinct though fainter copy of impression beyond impression and idea it be unnecessary to look thus to look at a chessboard be to have a number of sensation of black and white arrange in a certain order to listen to a piece of music be to experience a succession of loud and soft auditory sensation to handle a stone be to receive a group of sensation of touch to suppose that anything beyond these sensory unit be ever really experienced be futile fiction experience be a mosaic of which the stone be the detach sensation and they washed-out copy the idea if this analysis of the mind be correct -- and its correctness be not dispute for more than a hundred year for be not the sensation admit to be the ultimate analysis of all that be perceive -- the common-sense belief that knowledge reveal a world outside the thinker be of course erroneous for common sense could hardly treat ` thing ' as merely ` sensation ' artificially group together in space each ` thing ' be a complex of a number of sensation have relation to similar complex it hold rather that the successive appearance of thing be relate in time in such a way that they could be suppose to reveal a single object able to endure in spite of surface change and to manifest the identity of its sensory ` quality ' similarly the succession of idea within the mind be for it support by the inward unity of the soul within which they arise moreover hume 's analysis make havoc of all idea of ` causation ' if every sensation be a separate be how be it to be connect with any other in any regular or necessary connection two event related as 'cause ' and ` effect ' must be a myth these subversive consequence of he theory hume do not conceal though he do not push he mental ` atomism ' to its logical extreme when he define material object as ` colored point dispose in a certain order ' he be in fact admit space as a relate factor when he speak of the succession of impression and idea in experience he be tacitly assume that what be apprehend be not a bare succession of sensation but _ also _ the fact that they be succeed one another and so allow a sense of temporal relation but further than this he refuse to go the idea of a continuous self be fantastic there be nothing beneath the idea to connect they the notion of causal connection be equally chimerical each sensation be distinct and exist in its own right it could therefore occur alone there be nothing to link together the distinct impression hence necessary connection in event could not be more than a fiction of the mind base on expectation of customary sequence how the mind he have describe as non-existent could form a expectation or observe a sequence be calmly leave a mystery hume then seem to leave to he successor in philosophy a task of synthesis he have tumble the soul off she high watch-tower but how to combine she shattered fragment again into a work unity he decline to say he see the sceptical implication of he analysis but profess himself unable to suggest a remedy he have however make the embarrassment of the theory of knowledge sufficiently clear for kant he most important successor to hit upon the most obvious palliative and in the _ critique of pure reason _ kant set himself to patch up hume 's analysis experience as it come through the channel of sense he admit hume have analyze correctly it be ' a manifold ' a whirl of separate sensation but these _ per se _ could not yield knowledge they must be make to cohere and the way to do this he have find the mind on to which they fall be equip with a complicated apparatus of faculty which could organize the chaotic manifold of sense and turn it into the connected world which common sense and science recognize first it view the datum of sense in the light of its own ` pure intuition ' and lo they be see to be in space and time then it solidify they with its own ` category ' which turn they into ` substance ' and 'cause s ' and endow they with all the attribute require to sustain that status finally it refer they all to a transcendental ego which be not indeed a soul but sufficiently like one to provide something that can admire the creative synthesis of ` mind as such ' have hume live to read kant 's _ critique _ he would probably have jeer at the vain complication of kant 's transcendental machinery and make it clear that between the primary manifold of sensation and the first construction of the intellect there still yawn a gulf which kant 's labor explanation nowhere bridge why do the chaotic ` matter ' of sensation submit itself so tamely to the form of the mind how can the _ a priori _ necessity of thought which be the ` presupposition ' of the complexity kant loved operate upon so alien a stuff as the sensation be assume to be and after all be not kant a bit premature in proclaim the _ finality _ of he analysis and of he refutation of empiricism for all time the search question why should the future resemble the past have receive no answer and so might not the mind itself with all its category be susceptible to change be it certain that the miracle whereby the datum present to we faculty conform to they would be a stand one have not kant himself as good as admit that we faculty might distort reality instead of make it intelligible the truth be that at this point kant be open to a charge against which the assumption he share with hume admit of no defense hume have be the first to discover that we be in the habit of try to rationalize we sense-datum by put ideal construction upon they though he have abstain from sanctify the practice by a hideous jargon of technical terminology but this way of eke out the fact only seem to he to _ falsify _ they truth in he view be to be reach by accept with docility the sensation give from without to set to work to ` imagine ' connection between they and to claim for they a higher truth have seem to he a outrage what right then have kant to legitimate the mind 's impudence in tamper with sensation be not every _ a priori _ form a ` imagination ' and a vain one at that to these objection the kantian school have never find a answer they have simply repeat kant 's phrase about the necessary ` presupposition ' which be to be add to hume 's datum the english psychologist -lrb- the mill bain etc -rrb- exhibit a similar fidelity they never accept the _ a priori _ but rely on ` the association of idea ' to build up a mind out of isolate sensation but be this expedient really thinkable for if all ` sensation ' or quality be separate entity how can the addition of more ` distinct existence ' of the same sort really bind they together if in ` the cat be upon the wall ' ` upon ' be a distinct entity which have to relate ` cat ' and ` wall ' what be to connect ` cat ' with ` upon ' and ` upon ' with ` wall ' the atomize method carry to its logical extreme demand that not only ` sensation ' but also ` thought ' should be essentially disconnect and then of course _ no _ thinking can cohere psychology then have work itself to a breakdown by accept the ` sensationalistic ' analysis offer by hume and drag philosophy with it yet the escape be as easy as the egg of columbus to the insight of genius william jame have merely to invert the problem instead of assume with hume that because some experience seem to attest the presence of distinct object all connection be illusory and all experience must ultimately consist of psychical atom jame have merely to maintain that this separation be secondary and artificial and that experience be initially a continuum once this be point out the fact be obvious the stream of experience no doubt contain what it be afterwards possible to single out as ` sensation ' but it present they also as connect by ` relation ' moreover the ` sensation ' or ` quality ' and they ` relation ' exhibit the immediate indiscerptible unity of a fluid rather than a succession of flash temporal and spatial relation with all the connection they sustain be perceive just as directly as what we come to distinguish as the ` thing ' in they ` consciousness ' jame insist ` do not appear to itself chop up in bit ' and ` we ought to say a feeling of _ and _ a feeling of _ if _ a feeling of _ but _ and a feeling of _ by _ quite as readily as we say a feeling of _ blue _ or a feeling of _ cold _ all thing in experience naturally ` compenetrate ' to use a phrase of bergson 's they be distinct and they be unite at the same time the great crux in hume be thus see to be illusory immediate experience do not require ` synthesis ' : it call for ` analysis ' it be not a jigsaw puzzle to be piece together without glue : it be a confused whole which have to be divide and set in order for clear thinking hume 's mistake be to have start from experience _ as partly analyze _ by common sense and not from the flux _ as give _ he ` sensation ' be the quality already analyze out of the flux he take these selection for the whole and neglect the other less obvious feature in it -- viz the relation which float they thus the puzzle ` how do relation relate ' receive its solution in this new account of experience philosopher be puzzle by this question because they confuse percept with concept percept be _ give _ in relation but concept be ideal dissection of the perceptual flux be discontinuous term which have to be relate by a act of thought because they be make for this very purpose of distinction thus the eye see cat sit upon wall as part of a rural landscape and without the sharp distinction which exist between the concept ` cat ' ` upon ' ` wall ' these idea be _ mean _ to disconnect ` the cat ' in think from the site it sit upon think then have _ make _ the ` atomism ' it profess to find it have only to unmake it and to allow the distinction it hold apart to merge again into the stream of change all hume 's problem therefore be unreal and those of he apriorist critic be doubly remove from reality the whole conception of philosophy as aim at unite disjointed datum in a higher synthesis run counter to the real movement which aim at the analysis of a give whole the real question about causation be not how event can be connect causally but why be certain antecedent prefer and dissect out and entitle 'cause s ' so the ` self ' be not one -lrb- undiscoverable -rrb- item imagine to keep in order a host of other such item any given moment of a consciousness be just the mass of its ` sensation ' but these be consciously the heir of its history and connect with a past which be remembered no transcendental ego could do more to support the process of experience than be achieve by ' a stream of consciousness which carry its own past along ' here then be the straight way jame desiderate a critical philosophy which go not ` through ' the complexity of kantism but leave they on one side as superfluous ` curio ' but there remain a even more important deduction from the new psychology hume have be convict of error in select those element of the flux which serve he purpose and neglect the rest but this mistake might reveal the important fact that all analysis be a choice and inspire by volition a mind that analysis can not but be _ active _ in handle its experience it manipulate it to serve its end it emphasize only those portion of the flux which seem to it important in a better and fairer analysis than hume 's these feature will persist it too would be a product of selection of a selection depend on its maker 's preference as jame show the distinction between ` dream ' and ` reality ' between ` thing ' and ` illusion ' result only from the differential value we attach to the part of the flux accord as they seem important or interesting to we or not the volitional contribution be all-pervasive in we thinking and once this volitional interference with ` pure perception ' be show to be indispensable it must be allow to be legitimate nor can this approval of we interference be restrict to selection it must be extend to _ addition _ just as we can select factor from ` the give ' to construct ` reality ' we can add hypothesis to it to make it ` intelligible ' we can claim the right of causal analysis and assume that we dissection have lay bare the inner spring of the connection of event moreover to the ` real world which we choice have build out of the chaos of ` appearance ' we may hypothetically add ` infernal ' and ` heavenly ' region -lrb- b -rrb- both be transformation of ` the give ' by the will but like the postulate of causal series experience _ may _ confirm they kant 's _ a priori _ activity of the mind may thus in a sense supply a answer to hume -- but only in a voluntaristic philosophy which would probably have seem too bold both to he and to hume there can be no doubt that we do not approach the datum of perception in a attitude of quiescent resignation we desire and need equip we with assumption and ` first principle ' which originate from within not from without but how precisely should this mental contribution to knowledge be conceive in the last chapter of he _ psychology _ jame suggest that the mind 's organization be essentially biological it have evolve accord to sound darwinian principle and in so do the fittest of its ` variation ' have survive but be these variation quite fortuitous may they not have be purposive response to the stimulation of environment can logic have be invent like saw and ship for purpose of human service these be some of the stimulate question which jame 's work in _ psychology _ have suggest footnote : -lrb- footnote a : not in bradley 's logic -rrb- -lrb- footnote b : this be the substance of the doctrine of ` the will to believe ' -rrb- chapter iii will in cognition the new psychology of jame be bind to produce a new theory of knowledge and though it do not actually explore this problem it contain several valuable suggestion upon the subject for instance in a brief passage discuss ` the relation of belief and will ' jame point out that belief be essentially a attitude of the will towards a idea add that in order to acquire a belief ` we need only in cold blood act as if the thing in question be real and keep act as if it be real and it will infallibly end by grow into such a connection with we life that it will become real ' -lrb- ii p 321 -rrb- this passage be a outline of the doctrine of ` the will to believe ' which he be afterwards to develop so forcibly again in he last chapter jame criticize the doctrine of spencer that all the principle of think all its general truth and axiom be derive from impression of the external world he argue on the other hand that such way of look at phenomenon must originate in the mind and be prior to the experience which confirm they without digging further into the character of this mental contribution to knowledge jame contented himself with the suggestion that the use of these axiomatic principle might be construe in darwinian style as a ` variation ' survive by its fitness thus introduce into he account of mental process the important idea that think might be test by its vital value what if knowledge be neither a dull submission to dictation from without nor a unexplained necessity of think what if it be a bold adventure a experimental sally of a will to live to know and to control reality what if its principle be frankly _ risky _ and they truth have to be _ desire _ before it be test and assure in a word what if first principle be to begin with _ postulate _ thus the way be pave from the new psychology to a new theory of knowledge a third alternative to the banal dilemma of 'em piricism ' or ` apriorism ' suggest itself the old _ empiricist _ view as typify by mill be that the mind have be impress with all its principle such as the truth of arithmetic the axiom of geometry and the law of causation by a uncontradicted course of experience until it generalize fact into ` law ' and be enable to predict a similar future with certainty but this theory have really be explode in advance by hume fact do not _ appear _ as causally connect nor if they do would this guarantee that they will continue to do so in the future the continuum of experience we may add be not _ give _ as a series of arithmetical unit or geometrical equality unless we deliberately measure it out in accordance with mathematical principle empiricism thus give no real account of the scientific rational order of the world but do it follow from the failure of empiricism that apriorism be true this have always be assume and hold to dispense rationalist philosopher from give any direct and positive proof that these principle be _ a priori _ truth but manifestly they procedure be logically far from cogent if a third explanation can be think of it will _ not _ follow that apriorism be true all that follow be that _ something _ have to be assume before experience prove it what that something be and whence it come remain a open question moreover apriorism have _ not _ escape from the empirical doubt about the future even grant that fact now conform to the necessity of we thought why should they so comport themselves for ever let we therefore try a compromise which ignore neither that which we bring to experience -lrb- like empiricism -rrb- nor that which we gain from experience -lrb- like apriorism -rrb- this compromise be effect by the doctrine of postulation for though a postulate proceeds from we and be mean to guide think in anticipate fact it yet allow the fact to test and mould it so that its work modify expand or restrict its demand and fit it to meet the exigency of experience and permit also a certain reinterpretation of the previous ` fact ' in order to conform they to the postulate a postulate thus fully meet the demand of apriorism it be ` universal ' in claim because it be convenient and economical to make a rule carry as far as it will go and it be ` necessary ' because all fresh fact be on principle subject to it in the hope that they will support and illustrate it yet a postulate can never be accuse of be a mere sophistication or a bar to the progress of knowledge because it be always willing to submit to verification in the course of fresh experience and can always be reconstruct or abandon should it cease to edify a long and successful course of service raise a postulate to the dignity of a ` axiom ' -- _ ie _ a principle which it be incredible anyone should think worth dispute -- whereas repeat failure in application degrade it to the position of a prejudice -- _ ie _ a _ a priori _ opinion which be always belie by its consequence a ` postulate ' thus differ essentially from the ' _ a priori _ truth ' by its dependence upon the will by its be the product of a free choice we have always to select the assumption upon which we mean to act in we commerce with reality we select the rule upon which we go and we select the ` fact ' by which we claim to support we rule strip they of all the ` irrelevant ' detail involve by they position in the flux of happening thus we emphasize that side of thing which fit in with we expectation until the fact be ` fake ' sufficiently to figure as ` case ' of we ` law ' postulation and the verify of postulate be thus a process of reciprocal discrimination and selection the postulate once formulate we seek in the flux for confirmation of it and thus construct a system of ` fact ' which be relative to it that be how the postulate react upon experience if on the other hand this process of selection be unfruitful and the confirmation of we rule turn out infinitesimal we alter the rule and thus the ` fact ' in the case reject the postulate this continuous process of selection and rejection of ` principle ' and ` fact ' have as we have say a thoroughly _ biological _ tinge the fitness of a postulate to survive be be continually test it spring in the first place from a human hope that event may be systematize in a certain way and it endure so long as it enable man to deal with they in that way if it fail the formation of fresh ideal and fresh hypothesis be demand but that which cause one postulate to prevail over another be always the satisfaction which if successful it promise to some need or desire thus ` think ' be everywhere inspire by ` will ' it be a _ instrument _ the most potent man have find whereby he bring about a harmony with he environment this harmony be always something of a compromise we postulate conformity between nature and one of we ideal we usually desire more than we can get but insist on all that nature can concede causation serve as a good example experience as it first come to we be a mere flood of happening with no distinction between causal and casual sequence clearly we whole ability to control we life or even to continue it demand that we should _ predict _ what happen and guide we action accordingly we therefore postulate a right to _ dissect _ the flux to fit together select series without reference to the rest thus a systematic network of natural ` law ' be slowly knit together and chaos visibly transform itself into scientific order the postulation of 'cause s ' be verify by its success moreover it be to be note that to this postulate there be no alternative a belief that all event be casual would be scientifically worthless so be a doctrine -lrb- still popular among philosopher -rrb- that the only true 'cause ' be the total universe at one moment the only true ` effect ' the whole of reality at the next for that be merely to reinstate the give chaos science try to analyze and to forbid we to make selection from it it would make prediction wholly vain and entangle truth in a totality of thing which be unique at every instant and never can recur the principle of mathematics be as clearly postulate in euclidean geometry we assume definition of ` point ' ` line ' ` surface ' etc which be never find in nature but form the most convenient abstraction for measure thing both ` space ' and ` time ' as define for mathematical purpose be ideal construction draw from empirical ` space ' -lrb- extension -rrb- and ` time ' -lrb- succession -rrb- feeling and purge of the subjective variation of these experience nevertheless geometry form the handiest system for apply to experience and calculate shape and motion but ideally other system might be use the ` metageometry ' have construct other ideal ` space ' out of postulate differ from euclid 's though when apply to real space they greater complexity destroy they value the postulatory character of the arithmetical unit be quite as clear for in application we always have to _ agree _ as to what be to count as ` one ' if we agree to count apple and count the two half of a apple as each equal one we be say to be ` wrong ' though if we be divide the apple among two applicant it would be quite right to treat each half as ` one ' share again though one penny add to another make two one drop of water add to another make one or a dozen accord as it be drop common sense therefore admit that we may reckon variously and that arithmetic do not _ apply _ to _ all _ thing again it be impossible to concede any meaning even to the central ` law of thought ' itself -- the law of identity -lrb- ' a be a ' -rrb- -- except as a postulate outside of formal logic and lunatic asylum no one wish to assert that ' a be a ' all significant assertion take the form ' a be b ' but a and b be _ different _ and indeed no two ` a 's ' be ever _ quite _ the same hence when we assert either the ` identity ' of ` a ' in two context or that of ` a ' and ` b ' in ' a be b ' we be clearly _ ignore difference which really exist -- ie _ we postulate that in spite of these difference a and b will for we purpose behave as if they be one -lrb- ` identical ' -rrb- and we should realize that this postulate be of we make and involve a risk it may be that experience refuse to confirm it and convict we instead of a ` mistaken identity ' in short _ every identity we reason from be make by we postulate a irrelevance of difference _ there be thus perhaps no fundamental procedure of think in which we can not trace some deliberately adopt attitude we distinguish between ` ourselves ' and the ` external ' world perhaps because we have more control over we thought and limb and less or none over stick and stone and mountain fundamental as it be it be a distinction _ within _ experience and be not give ready-made but elaborate in the course of we dealings with it similarly in accordance with its vary degree of vividness continuity and value experience itself get sort into ` reality ' ` dream ' and ` hallucination ' in short when the process of discriminate between ` dream ' and ` reality ' be consider all these distinction will ultimately be find to be judgment of value nor be it only in the realm of scientific know that postulation reveal itself as a practicable and successful method of anticipate experience and consolidate fact the same method have always be employ by man in reach out towards the final synthesis which -lrb- in imagination -rrb- complete he vision of reality the ` truth ' of all religion originate in postulate ` god ' and ` devil ' ` heaven ' and ` hell ' be essentially demand for a moral order in experience which transcend the give the value of the actual world be supplement and enhance by be conceive as project and continue into a greater and we postulate be verify by the salutary influence they exercise on we earthly life both postulation and verification then be applicable to the problem of religion as of science this be the meaning of the will to believe when jame first define and defend it it provoke abundant protest on the ground that it allow everyone to believe whatever he please and to call it ` true ' the critic have simply fail to see that verification by experience be just as integral a part of voluntaristic procedure as experimental postulation and that jame himself have from the first assert this indeed that he have first give a theological illustration of the function of volition in know be merely a accident but that the will to believe be capable of be generalize into a voluntarist theory of all knowledge be soon show in dr schiller 's _ axiom as postulate _ chapter iv the dilemma of dogmatism every man probably be by instinct a dogmatist he feel perfectly sure that he know some thing and be right about they against the world whatever he believe in he do not doubt but hold to be self-evidently or indisputably true he naive dogmatism moreover spontaneously assume that he truth be universal and share by all other if now he could live like a fakir wholly wrap in a cloud of he own imagining and nothing ever happen to disappoint he expectation to jar upon he prejudice and to convict he of error if he never hold converse with anyone who take a different view and controvert he he dogmatism would be lifelong and incurable but as he live socially he have in practice to outgrow it and this land he in a serious theoretical dilemma he have to learn to live with other who differ from he in they dogmatize social life plainly would become impossible if all rigidly insist on the absolute rightness of they own belief and the absolute wrongness of all other so compromise have to be make to get at a common ` truth ' it must be recognize that not everything which be believe to be ` knowledge ' be knowledge in fact it be safer to assume that none have knowledge though all think they have to say fact man only have ` opinion ' which may be nearer to or farther from ` the truth ' but be not of necessity as unquestionable as they seem to be out of this concession to the social life arise three problem how be ` opinion ' to be compare with each other and how be the extent of they ` truth ' or ` error ' to be determine how be the belief in absolute truth to be interpret and discount how be the penitent dogmatist once he have allow doubt to corrupt he self-confidence to be stop from doubt all thing and turn sceptic as regard the first problem the first question be whether we shall try to _ test _ opinion and to arrive at a standard of value by which to measure they by compare the opinion themselves with one another or shall presume that there must be some absolute standard which alone be truly true whether we be aware of it or not the former view be _ relativism _ the latter be _ absolutism _ in the matter of truth now there can be no doubt that absolutism be more congenial to we natural prejudice accordingly it be the method try first but it soon conduct dogmatism to a awkward series of dilemma 1 if there be absolute truth who have it and who can use the absolute criterion of opinion it be suppose to form not surely everyone who _ think _ he have it will never do to let every dogmatist vote for himself and condemn all other that way war and madness lie until there be absolute agreement there can not be absolute truth 2 but absolute truth may still be reverence as a ideal to save we from the scepticism to which a complete relativity of truth would lead but would it save we if it be admit that no one can arrogate to himself its possession what use be it to believe that it be a ideal for if no one can assume that he have it all _ human _ truth be in fact such as the relativist assert and scepticism be just as inevitable as before it make no difference to the sceptical inference whether there be no absolute truth or whether it be unattained by man and human unattainable 3 it be a mistake therefore to admit that opinion can not be compare together some be much more certain than other and indeed ` self-evident ' and ` intuitive ' let we therefore take these to be ` truer ' if so the thinker who feel most certain he be right be most likely to be right 4 this suggestion will be welcome by all dogmatist -- until they discover that it do not help they to agree together because they be all as certain as can be but a critically-minded man will urge against it that _ ` certainty ' be a subjective and psychological criterion _ and that no one have be able to devise a method for distinguish the alleged logical from the undeniable psychological certainty he will hesitate to say therefore that because a belief seem certain it be true and to trust the formal claim to infallibility which be make in every judgment and when ` intuition ' be appeal to he will ask how ` true ' intuition be to be discriminate from ` false ' sound from insane and inquire to what he be commit himself in admit the truth of intuition he will demand therefore the publication of a list of the intuition which be absolutely true but he will not get it and if he do it may be predict that he would not find a single one which have not be dispute by some eminent philosopher 5 intuition therefore be a embarrassment rather than a help to intellectualism it have to maintain both that intuition be the foundation of all truth and certitude and also that not all be true but we natural curiosity as to how these sort be to be know apart be leave unsatisfied we must not ask which be true and which not no one can say in advance about what matter intuitive certainty be possible what be or be not a intuition be reveal only to reflection after the event only if a intuition _ have _ play we false we may be sure it _ be _ not infallible it must either have be one of the fallible sort or else no intuition at all 6 at this point universal scepticism begin to raise its hydra head and to grin at the dogmatist 's discomfiture for in point of fact the history of thought reveal not a steady accumulation of indubitable truth but a continuous strife of opinion in which the most widely accept belief daily succumb to fresh criticism and fall into disrepute as the ` error of the past ' nothing it seem can guarantee a ` truth ' however firmly it may be believe for a time from the corrosive force of new speculation and change opinion to survey the field of philosophic dispute strew with the remains of ` infallible ' system and ` absolute ' certainty be to be lead irresistibly to a sceptical doubt as to the competence of human thought if ` absolute truth ' be we ideal and acquaintance with ` absolute reality ' we aim then in view of the persistent illusion on both these point to which the human mind be liable it seem necessary to recognize the hopelessness of we search thus the last dilemma of dogmatism be reach in view of the diversity of human belief and the discredit which have historically fall on the most axiomatic article of faith we must either admit scepticism to be the issue of the debate or else condemn we absolute view of truth find some means of utilize the relative truth which be all that humanity seem able to grasp but to come to term with relativism be to renounce the dogmatic attitude entirely and to approach the problem of philosophy in a totally different spirit chapter v the problem of truth and error it have be show in the last chapter how urgent have become the problem of discriminate between the true and false among relative ` truth ' for absolute truth have become a chimera self-evidence a illusion and intuition untrustworthy all three be psychologically very real to those who believe in they but logically they succumb to the assault of a scepticism which infer from the fact that no ` truth ' be absolute that all may reasonably be overthrow the only obstacle to its triumph lie in the existence of ` relative ' truth which be _ not _ absolute and do not claim to be and in the unexamined possibility that in a relativist interpretation of all truth a meaning may be find for the distinction between ` true ' and ` false ' now not even a sceptic could deny that the size of a object be better measure by a yard-measure than by the eye even though it may be meaningless to ask what its size may be absolutely or that it be probable that bread will be find more nourishing than stone even though it may not be a perfect elixir of life even if he deny this the sceptic 's _ act _ would convict he _ word _ of insincerity and _ practically _ at any rate no one have be or can be a sceptic whatever the extent of he _ theoretic _ doubt this fact be construe by the pragmatist as a significant indication of the way out of the epistemological _ impasse _ the ` relative ' truth which intellectualism pass by with contempt may differ in _ practical value _ and lead to the conception of _ practical truth _ and certainty which may be better adapt to the requirement of human life than the elusive and discredited ideal of absolute truth and certainty and may enable we to justify the distinction we make between the ` true ' and the ` false at any rate this suggestion seem worth follow up to begin with we must radically disabuse we mind of the idea that think _ start from certainty _ even the self-evident and self-confident ` intuition ' that impress the uncritical so much with they claim to infallibility be really the result of antecedent doubt and pondering and would never be enunciate unless there be think to be a dispute about they in real life think start from perplexity from situation in which as professor dewey say belief have to be ` reconstruct ' and it aim at set doubt at rest it be psychologically impossible for a rational mind to assert what it know to be true and suppose everyone else to admit the truth of this be why even a philosopher 's conversation do not consist of a rehearsal of all the unchallenged truism that he can remember be thus condition by a doubt every judgment be a challenge it claim truth and back its claim by the authority of its maker but it would be folly to imagine that it thereby become _ ipso facto _ true or be mean to be universally accept without test its maker must know this as well as anyone unless he dogmatism have quite blot out he common sense indeed he may himself have give preference to the judgment he make over the alternative that occur to he only after much debate and hesitation and may propound it only as a basis for further discussion and testing initially then every judgment be a _ truth-claim _ and this claim be merely _ formal _ it do not _ mean _ that the claim be absolutely true and that it be impious to question it on the contrary it have still to be validate by other and may work in such a way that its own maker withdraw it and correct it by a better the intellectualist account of truth have all fail to make this vital distinction between ` truth-claim ' and validate truth they rest on a _ confusion of formal with absolute truth _ and it be on this account that they can not distinguish between ` truth ' and error for false judgment also formally claim ` truth ' no judgment allege that it be false -lrb- c -rrb- on the other hand if the distinction between truth-claim and validate truth be make there cease to be any _ theoretic _ difficulty about the conception and correction of error however difficult it may be to detect they in practice ` truth ' will be ` claim ' which have work well and maintain themselves ` error ' such as have be supersede by better one all ` truth ' must be _ test _ by something more objective than they own self-assertiveness and this testing by they working and the consequence to which they lead may go on indefinitely in other word however much a ` truth ' have be validate it be always possible to test it further _ ie _ it be never theoretically ` absolute ' however well it may practically be assure for a confirmation of this doctrine pragmatism appeal to the history of scientific truth which have show a continuous correction of ` truth ' which be re-value as ` error ' as better statement for they become available it may also be confirm negatively by the breakdown of the current definition of truth which all seem in the end to mean nothing the oldest and commonest definition of a ` truth ' which be give be that it be ` the correspondence of a think to reality ' but intellectualism never perceive the difficulty lurk in it at first sight this seem a brave attempt to get outside the circle of think in order to test its value and to control its vagary unluckily this theory can only assert and neither explain nor prove the connection between the thought and the reality it desiderate for grant that it be the intent of every thought to correspond with reality we must yet inquire how the allege correspondence be to be make out make out it must be for as the criterion be quite formal and hold of all assertion the claim to ` correspond ' may be false to prove the correspondence then the ` reality ' would have somehow to be know apart from the truth-claim of the think in order that the two might be compare and find to agree but if the reality be already know directly what would be the need of assert a idea of it and claim ` truth ' for this how moreover could the claim be test if as be admit the reality be not directly know to assert the ` correspondence ' must become a groundless postulate about something which be define to transcend all knowledge the correspondence theory then do not _ test _ the truth-claim of the assertion it only give a fresh definition of it a ` true ' think it say be one which _ claim to correspond _ with a ` reality ' _ but so do a false _ and hence the theory leave we as we be puzzle to distinguish they -lrb- d -rrb- yet the theory be not wholly wrong many of we thought do claim to correspond with reality in way that can be verify if the judgment ` there be a green carpet in my hall ' be take to mean ` if i enter my hall i shall _ see _ a green carpet ' perception test whether the judgment ` correspond ' with the reality perceive and so go to validate or disprove the claim but the limit within which this correspondence work be very strait it apply only to such judgment as be anticipation of perception -lrb- e -rrb- and will test a truth-claim only where there be willingness to act on it it imply a experiment and be not a wholly intellectual process the superiority of the ` correspondence ' theory over the belief in ` intuition ' lie in its insistence that thought be not to audit its own account its success or failure depend upon factor external to it which establish the truth or falsehood of its claim no such guarantee be offer by the next theory which be know as the ` consistence ' or ` coherence ' theory in order to avoid the difficulty which wreck the ` correspondence ' theory that of make the truth of a assertion reside in a inexperienceable relation to a unattainable reality this view maintain that a idea be true if it be consistent with the rest of we thought and so can be fit with they into a coherent system no doubt a coherence among we idea be a convenience and a part of they ` work ' but it be hardly a test of they objective truth for a harmonious system of thought be conceivable which would either not apply to reality at all or if apply would completely fail on this theory systematic delusion fiction and dream might properly lay claim to truth true they might not be quite consistent : but neither be the system of we science if then this _ absolute _ coherence be insist on this test condemn we whole knowledge if not it remain formal and fail to recognize any distinction of value in the claim which can be systematize to avoid this _ reductio ad absurdum _ it have be suggest that it be not the coherence of the idea in human finite mind which constitute ` truth ' but the perfect consistency of the experience of a absolute mind the test then of we limited coherency will lie in its relation to this absolute system but here we have the correspondence doctrine once again in a fresh disguise we human system be now ` true ' if they correspond with the absolute 's but as there be no way for we of share the absolute experience we test be again illusory and productive of a depressing scepticism and again we have only assert that truth be what _ claim _ to be part of the absolute system a word may be devote to the simple refusal of intuitionist to give a account of truth on the ground that it be ` indefinable ' truth be take to be a ultimate unanalyzable quality of certain proposition intuitively feel and incapable of description error by the same token should be equally indefinable and as immediately apprehend how then can there be difference of opinion and mistake as to what be true and what false how be it that a proposition which be feel to be ` true ' so often turn out to be erroneous if all error be feel to be true by those they deceive be it not clear that immediate feeling be not a good enough test of a validate truth thus once again we find that a account of truth-claim be be foist on we in place of a description of truth-test the intellectualist then be in every case unable to justify the vital distinction commonly make between the true and the false we return to the pragmatist he start with no preconception as to what truth must mean whether it exist or not he be content to watch how _ de facto _ claim to truth get themselves validate in experience he observe that every question be intimately related to some scheme of human purpose for it have to be _ put _ in order to come into be hence every inquiry arise and every question be ask because of obstacle and problem which arise in the carry out of human purpose so soon as uncertainty arise in the course of fulfil a purpose a idea or belief be formulate _ and act on _ to fill the gap where immediate certitude have break down this engender the truth-claim which be necessarily a ` good ' in its maker 's eye because it have be select by he and judge _ preferable _ to any alternative that occur to he how then be it test simply by the consequence which follow from adopt it and use it as a assumption upon which to work if these consequence be satisfactory if they promote the purpose in hand instead of thwart it and thus have a valuable effect upon life then the truth-claim maintain its ` truth ' and be so far validate this be the universal method of testing assertion alike in the formation of mathematical law physical hypothesis religious belief and ethical postulate hence such pragmatic aphorism as ` truth be useful ' or ` truth be a matter of practical consequence ' mean essentially that all assertion must be _ test by be apply to a real problem of know _ what be signify by such statement be that no ` truth ' must be accept merely on account of the insistence of its claim but that every idea must be test by the consequence of its work its truth will then depend upon those consequence be fruitful for life in general and in particular for the purpose behind the particular inquiry in which it arise truth be a _ value _ and a satisfaction but ` intellectual satisfaction ' be not a morbid delight in dialectical and verbal juggling : it be the satisfaction which reward the hard labor of rationalize experience and render it more conformable with human desire it should be clear though it be often misunderstand that there be nothing arbitrary or ` subjective ' in this method of testing belief it do not mean that we be free to assert the truth of every idea which seem to we pretty or pleasant the very term ` useful ' be choose by pragmatist as a protest against the common philosophic licence of allege ` truth ' which could never be apply or test and be suppose to be none the worse for be ` useless ' it be clear both that such ` truth ' must be a monopoly of intellectualism and also that they do allow every man to believe whatever he wish provide only that he boldly claim ` self-evidence ' for he idiosyncrasy in this purely subjective sense into which intellectualism be drive it be however clear that there can be no useless idea for any idea anyone decide to adopt because it pleased or amuse he would be _ ipso facto _ true pragmatism therefore by refute ` useless ' knowledge show that it do _ not _ admit such merely subjective ` use ' it insist that idea must be more objectively useful -- viz by show ability to cope with the situation they be devise to meet if they fail to harmonize with the situation they be untrue however attractive they may be for idea do not function in a void they have to work in a world of fact and to adapt themselves to all fact though they may succeed in transform they in the end nor have a idea to reckon only with fact : it have also to cohere with other idea it must be congruous with the mass of other belief hold for good reason by the thinker who accept it for no one can afford to have a stock of belief which conflict too violently with those of he fellow if he ` intuition ' contrast too seriously with those of other and he act on they he will be shut up as a lunatic if then the ` useful ' idea have to approve itself both to its maker and he fellow without develop limitation in its use it be clear that a pragmatic truth be really far less arbitrary and subjective than the ` truth ' accept as absolute on the bare ground that they seem ` self-evident ' to a few intellectualist if however it be urge that pragmatic truth never grow absolutely true at all and that the most prolonged pragmatic test do not exclude the possibility of a ultimate error in the idea there be no difficulty about admit this the pragmatic test yield _ practical _ and not ` absolute ' certainty the existence of absolute certainty be deny and the demand for it in a world which contain only the practical sort merely play into the hand of scepticism the uncertainty of all we verificatory process however be not the creation of the pragmatist nor be he a god to abolish it abstractly there be always a doubt about what transcend we immediate experience and this be why it be so healthy to have to repudiate so many theoretic doubt in every act we do for belief have to be act on and the result of the action rightly react on the belief the pragmatic test be practically adequate and be the only one available that it bring out the risk of action only bring out its superiority to a theory which can not get start at all until it be supply with absolute certainty and meantime can only idly rail at all exist human truth we have in all this consistently refer the truth of idea to individual experience for verification this evidently make all truth in some sense dependent upon the personality of those who assert and accept they intellectualist logic on the other hand have always proclaim that mental process if true be ` independent ' of the idiosyncrasy of particular mind idea have a _ fix _ meaning and cohere in body of ` universal ' truth quite irrespective of whether any particular mind harbor they or not this be not only a contention fatal to the pragmatic claim but also bind up with other assumption of formal logic so it become necessary to inquire whether this logic be a success and so can coherently abstract from the personality of the knower and the particular situation that incite he to know footnote : -lrb- footnote c : not even ' i lie ' which be meaningless as it stand _ cf _ dr schiller 's _ formal logic _ p 373 -rrb- -lrb- footnote d : this same difficulty reappear in various form as _ eg _ in a recent theory which make the truth of a judgment lie in its assert a relation between different object and not in the existence of those object themselves this formulum also apply as evidently to false judgment as to true it too bring no independent evidence of the existence of the object refer to and might fall into error through assert a relation between object which do not exist it be moreover incapable of show that a relation correspond to the idea we have of it really exist when we judge that it do -rrb- -lrb- footnote e : each perception however contain much that be supply by the mind not ` give ' to it -rrb- chapter vi the failure of formal logic in order to escape the necessity of concern itself with personality and particular circumstance in question of truth and error intellectualism appeal to logic which it conceive as a purely formal science and its impregnable citadel this appeal however rest on a number of questionable assumption and most of these be not avow 1 it assume that form of thought can be treat in abstraction from they matter -- in other word that the general type of think be never affect by the particular context in which they occur now this mean that the question of real truth must not be raise for as we have see -lrb- chapter v -rrb- real truth be always a affair of particular consequence the result be that as truth-claim be no longer test they _ all pass as true _ for logic and be even raise to the rank of ` absolute truth ' or be mistake for they for the notion of a really -lrb- ` materially ' -rrb- true judgment which someone have choose make and test there be substitute that of a formally valid proposition and in the end logic get so involve in the study of ` validity ' that it put aside altogether all real test of truth and become a game with verbal symbol which be entirely irrelevant to scientific thinking 2 formal logic assume the right of abstract from the whole process of make a assertion it presume that the assertion have already be make somehow how it do not inquire yet it be clear that in each case there be concrete reason why just _ that _ assertion be prefer to any other these concrete reason it make bold to dismiss as ` psychological ' and between ` logic ' and ` psychology ' -lrb- f -rrb- it decree a absolute divorce where when why by and to whom a assertion be make be take to be irrelevant and put aside as ` extralogical ' 3 this convenient assumption however ultimately necessitate a abstraction from mean though formal logic do not avow this openly every assertion be mean to convey a certain meaning in a certain context and therefore its verbal ` form ' have to take on its own individual _ nuance _ of mean what any particular form of word do in fact mean on any particular occasion always depend upon the use of the word in a particular context meaning therefore can not be depersonalize if meaning be depersonalize they cease to be real and become verbal formal logic have in fact mistaken _ word _ which be -lrb- within the same language -rrb- identical on all occasion for the _ thought _ they be intend to express which be vary to suit each occasion word alone be tolerant of the abstract treatment formal logic demand this ` science ' therefore finally reduce to mere verbalism distract by inconsistent relapse into ` psychology ' but will this conception of logic either work out consistently in itself or lead to a tenable theory of scientific thinking emphatically not what be the use of a logic which -lrb- 1 -rrb- can not effect the capital distinction of all think that between the true and the false -lrb- 2 -rrb- be debar by its own principle from consider the _ meaning _ of any real assertion and -lrb- 3 -rrb- be thus toss helplessly from horn to horn of the dilemma ` either verbalism or psychology ' we may select a few example of this fatal dilemma 1 in deal with what it call ` the meaning ' of term proposition etc formal logic have always to choose between the meaning of the _ word _ and the meaning of the _ man _ for it be clear that word which may be use ambiguously may on occasion leave no doubt as to they meaning while conversely all may become ` ambiguous ' in a context if therefore the occasion be abstract from all form must be treat verbally as ambiguous formula which may be use in different sens if it be nevertheless attempt to deal with they actual meaning on any give occasion what its maker mean the word to convey must be discover and the inquiry at once become ` psychological ' -- that be to say ` extralogical ' 2 if judgment be not to be verbal -lrb- ` proposition ' -rrb- but real assertion which be actually mean they must proceed from personal selection and must have be choose from among alternative formulation because of they superior value for they maker 's purpose but all this be plainly a affair of psychology so inevitable be this that a truly formal ideal of ` logic ' would exclude all judgment whatever from the complete system of ` eternal ' truth for from such a system no part could be rightly extract to stand alone such a selection could be effect and justify only by the exigency of a human thinker the impotent verbalism of the formal treatment of judgment appear in another way when the question be raise _ how _ a ` true ' judgment be to be distinguish from a ` false ' for the logician if he public will not accept either the relegation of this distinction to ` psychology ' or the proper formal answer that _ all _ judgment be -lrb- formally -rrb- ` true ' and even ` infallible ' can think of nothing better to say than that if the ` judgment ' be not true it be not a ` true judgment ' but a false ` opinion ' which may be abandon to ` psychology ' -lrb- g -rrb- apparently he be not concern to help man to discriminate between ` judgment ' and ` opinion ' or even to show that true ` judgment ' do in fact occur 3 inference involve formal logic in a host of difficulty _ -lrb- a -rrb- _ if it be not to be a verbal manipulation of phrase whose coming together be not inquire into it must be a connected train of thought but such a connection of thought can not be conceive or understand without reference to the purpose of a reasoner who _ select _ what he require from the totality of ` truth ' if then ` logic ' have merely to contemplate this eternal and immutable system of truth in its integrity and forbid all selection from it for a merely human purpose how can it either justify or even understand the drawing of any inference whatever -lrb- _ b _ -rrb- formal logic clearly will not quail before the charge of uselessness but on its own principle it ought to be consistent but by this test also when it be rigorously judge by it it fail completely its inconsistency be many and incurable it can not even be consistent in its theory of the simplest fundamental it be find upon some occasion to define judgment as that which may be _ either _ true _ or _ false and upon other as that which be ` true ' -lrb- formally -rrb- -- _ ie _ it can not decide whether or not to ignore the existence of error -lrb- _ c _ -rrb- the formal view of inference regard it as a ` paradox ' a inference be require on the one hand to supply fresh information and on the other to follow rigorously from its premiss it must in a word exhibit both _ novelty _ and _ necessity _ it would seem however that if we inference genuinely have impart new knowledge the event must be merely psychological for how can any process or event perturb or add to the complete totality of truth in itself on the other hand if the ` necessity ' of the operation be take seriously the ` inference ' become illusory for if the conclusion infer be already contain in the premiss what sense be there in the purely verbal process of draw it out -lrb- _ d _ -rrb- most glaringly inadequate of all however be the formal doctrine of ` proof ' contain in its theory of the syllogism a formal or verbal syllogism depend essentially on the ability of its middle term to connect the term in its conclusion if however the middle term have not _ the same _ meaning in the two premiss the syllogism break in two and no ` valid ' conclusion can be reach now whether in fact any particular middle term bear the same meaning in any actual reasoning formal logic have debar itself from inquire by decide that actual meaning be ` psychological ' it have to be content therefore with a identity _ in the word _ employ for its middle but this evidence may always fail for when two premiss which be -lrb- in general -rrb- ` true ' be bring together for the purpose of draw a particular conclusion a glaring falsehood may result _ eg _ it would in general be grant that ` iron sink in water ' yet it do not follow that because ` this ship be iron ' it will ` sink in water ' hence syllogistic ` proof ' seem quite devoid of the ` cogency ' it claim after a conclusion have be ` demonstrate ' _ it have still to come true in fact _ this flaw in the syllogism be first point out by mr alfr sidgwick -lrb- _ e _ -rrb- the formal syllogism moreover conceal another formal flaw a infinite regress lurk in its bosom for if its premiss be dispute they must in turn be ` prove ' four fresh premiss be need and if these again be challenge the number of true premiss need to prove the first conclusion go on double at every step _ ad infinitum _ the only way to stop the process that occur to logician be a appeal to the ` self-evident ' truth of ` intuition ' but this have be show to be argumentatively worthless from this difficulty the pragmatist alone escape by assume he premiss _ provisionally _ and argue _ forwards _ in order to test they by they consequence if the deduce conclusion can be verify in fact the premiss grow more assure thus every real inference be a experiment and ` proof ' be a affair of continuous trial and verification -- not a infinite fall back upon a elusive ` certainty ' but a infinite reach forwards towards a fuller consummation -lrb- _ f _ -rrb- so long as the logician regard he premiss not as hypothesis to be test but as established truth he must condemn the syllogism as a formal fallacy it be inevitably a _ petitio principius _ if the argument ` all man be mortal smith be a man therefore smith be mortal ' mean that we know before draw we inference that literally all man be mortal we must already have discover that smith be mortal if we do not know beforehand that smith be mortal we be not justified in state that _ all _ man be mortal nor be it a escape to interpret ` all man be mortal ' to mean that immortal be exclude from ` man ' by definition for then the question be merely beg in the minor premiss that ` smith be a man ' can not be assert without assume that he be mortal if lastly ` all man be mortal ' be take to state a law of nature conjoin inseparably mortality and humanity the logician either already know that smith be rightly class under the species ` man ' and so subject to its mortality or else he _ assume _ this but how do he know smith be not like elijah or tithonus a peculiar case to which for some reason the law do not apply will he declare it to be ` intuitively certain ' that whatever be call or look like a case of a ` law ' _ ipso facto _ become one the logician 's analysis of reasoning then break down in whichever way he interpret the syllogism it be reveal as either a superfluity or a fallacy : it be never a ` formally valid inference ' that can compel assent but common sense be undismay by the pragmatist 's discovery that if the syllogism be to have any sense its premiss _ must _ be take as disputable for unlike formal logic it have perceive that man do not reason about what they think they know for certain but about matter in dispute 4 it be not necessary to dwell at length on the futility of the formal notion of induction formal induction presuppose that enough particular instance have be collect to establish a general rule but in actual practice induction always repose not on indiscriminate observation but on a _ selection of relevant instance _ and never claim to be base upon a _ exhaustive _ knowledge of particulars hence _ in form _ the most satisfactory induction be always incomplete and differ in no wise from a bad one ` all body fall to the ground ' be a induction which have work ` all swan be white ' break down when black swan be discover in australium the validity of a induction then be not a question of form the necessity for such selection no intellectualist theory of induction have understand all have aim at exhaustiveness and imagine that if it could be attain inductive reasoning would be render sound and not impossible they ideal 'cause ' be the totality of reality identify with its ` effect ' in a meaningless tautology nothing but voluntarism can enable logician to see that we actual procedure in know be the reverse of this that causal explanation be the _ analysis _ of a continuum and that ` phenomenon ' ` event ' ` effect ' and 'cause s ' be all creation of we selective attention that in select they we run a risk of analyze falsely and that if we do we ` induction ' will be worthless but whether they be right or wrong valuable or not real reasoning from ` fact ' can never be a ` formally valid ' process we be thus bring to see the hollowness of the contention that ` pure reason ' can ignore its psychological context and dehumanize itself a think to be think at all must seem _ worth _ think to someone it must convey the meaning he intend it must be true in he eye and relevant to he purpose in the situation in which it arise -- _ ie _ it must have a motive a value a mean a purpose a context and be select from a greater whole for its relevance to these none of these feature do intellectualist logic deign to recognize for if truth be absolute and not relative it be all or nothing yet no actual thinking have such transcendent aim it be content with selection relative to a concrete situation if it be permissible to diversify a debate -- _ eg _ about the authorship of the _ odyssey _ -- by a irruption of undisputed truth -- _ eg _ a recitation of the multiplication table -- how would it be possible to distinguish a philosopher from a lunatic formal logic be either a perennial source of error about real thinking or at best a aimless dissection of a _ caput mortuum -- ie _ of the verbal husk of dead thought whose value formal logic could neither establish nor apprehend a real logic therefore would most anxiously avoid all the initial abstraction which have reduce formal logic to such impotence and would abandon the insane attempt to eliminate the thinker from the theory of thought footnote : -lrb- footnote f : the descriptive science of think in its concrete actuality in different mind -rrb- -lrb- footnote g : the most popular contribution which oxford make just now to the theory of error be ' a judgment which be erroneous be not really a judgment ' so when a professor ` judge ' he be infallible -- by definition -rrb- chapter vii the bankruptcy of intellectualism we have now struggle through the quagmire of intellectualist philosophy and find that neither in its psychology which divide the mind 's integrity into a heap of faculty and comminute it into a dust-cloud of sensation nor in its epistemology which ignore the will to know and the value of know nor in its logic which abstract think wholly from the thinking and the thinker and so finally from all meaning could man find a practicable route of philosophic progress but we struggle will not have be in vain if they have leave we with a willingness to try the pragmatist alternative and convinced we that it be not a wanton innovation but the only path of salvation for the scientific spirit but before we venture on it it will be well to restore confidence in the solvency of human think by analyze the cause of the bankruptcy of intellectualism and expose the extravagance of the assumption which conduct to it be it not after all a unwarranted assumption that sever the intellect from its natural connection with human activity no doubt it seem to simplify the problem to suppose that the functioning of the intellect could be study as a thing apart and unrelated to the general context of the vital function again it be to simplify to assume that thought could be consider apart from the personality of the human thinker but it should not have be forget that it be possible to pay too dearly for simplification and abstraction and that they all involve a risk which the event may show should never have be take so it be in this case its rash assumption confront intellectualism with a host of problem it can not attack it can do nothing to assuage the conflict of opinion which all claim truth with equal confidence it can not understand the correction of error which be continually proceed nor can it understand either the existence of error or the meaning of truth or the means of distinguish between they it have no means of testing and confuting even the wildest and maddest assertion it can not discriminate between the intuition of the sage and of the lunatic it be force to view energy of will in know as a source merely of corruption and when it find that as a psychic fact willing be ineradicable it must conclude that we be constitutionally incapable of that passive reflection of reality which it regard as the _ sine qua non _ of truth hence if disinterestedness be the condition of know knowledge be impossible and it be so entangled in its unintelligible theory of truth as a copying of reality that rather than renounce it when it find that human know be _ not _ copy it prefer a surrender to scepticism yet be not its whole procedure a signal example of human arbitrariness and perversity we profess to be impel by logical necessity at every step but be free to escape from all we perplexity by adopt the pragmatic inference from they the pragmatic method of observe the consequence readily suggest the means of discriminate between truth and error of sift value and of testing claim and though not infallible it be adequate to all we need the pragmatic notion that _ truth be practical _ close the artificial gulf between the theoretic and the practical side of life and assign to truth a biological function and vital value the humanist contention that _ truth be human _ rescue man from the despondency in which he failure to grasp absolute truth have leave he the protagorean dictum that _ man be the measure of all thing _ assure he that _ he _ knowledge may become adequate to _ he _ reality and that the value of truth and the difference between truth and error also be susceptible of estimation true this policy avert the bankruptcy of the intellect by scale down the intolerable charge on it true practical knowledge be not absolute but if it be enough to live by be it not better to live by it than to be lure on to perish in the desert of scepticism by the _ mirage _ of a absolute truth not humanly attainable true verification be not ` proof ' but as its conclusion be not incorrigible its defect be not fatal and its demand be not impracticable true no truth and no reality be wholly ` objective ' in the sense of wholly indifferent to we action but to say that the human and ` subjective ' factor in all knowledge must be take into account do not preclude we apprehend and measure a ` objective ' world as real as and more knowable than any other theory can offer thus the proposal of pragmatism for reconstruct the business of the intellect and rescue it from the bankruptcy of intellectualism be not unreasonable they open out to it a prospect of recover its credit and its usefulness by return to the service of life chapter viii thought and life the mission of pragmatism be to bring philosophy into relation to real life and action so far from regard think as a self-centred self-enclosed activity pragmatism insist upon replace it in its context among the other function of life and in measure its value by its effect upon they so far again from regard the abstract intellect as a vast juggernaut machine which absorb and crush the individual thinker it treat he individually as have he own constitution _ raison d'être _ and intrinsic interest and credit he with a power to make new truth and to enrich the resource of think each thinker have before he a individual situation a system of aim and value a stock of knowledge and of means from which he must select what be relevant to he end and so can not escape in any judgment from the responsibility of a personal decision thus for pragmatism _ every thought be a act _ with a person behind it who be responsible for launch it into the world of fact the result of this change of attitude be immediate in the first place as have be show in chapter v by bring think face to face with the whole experience upon which it claim to work we be enable to find a tangible rule for evaluate its assertion and distinguish truth from error and secondly by recognize that the mind be not a apparatus which function in a vacuum but be a constituent of a individual organism we see that think always depend upon a purpose for it be the purpose of a inquiry which give reflection its cue and determine its scope and -lrb- most essential of all -rrb- its meaning we be thus lead from the narrower logical question ` what constitute the truth of a statement ' to a wider outlook from which we can survey the place of know in human life at large this may be call the transition from pragmatism to humanism this last word be introduce into philosophic terminology by dr schiller in order to describe he general philosophical position as distinct from the original question of the theory of knowledge which have be treat by jame under the name of pragmatism to the humanist the best definition of life be one which display it as throughout purposive as a rational pursuit of end this raise the question of the validity of valuation valuation be a widespread human practice in they most general aspect we classify all object as ` good ' and ` bad ' accord as they be end to be pursue or avoid or mean which further or frustrate the pursuit of end this general antithesis between the ` good ' and the ` bad ' have numerous specific form applicable to different department of human activity thus in conduct action be judge ` good ' or ` evil ' and ` right ' or ` wrong ' in think idea be ` true ' or ` false ' and ` relevant ' or ` irrelevant ' for art object be ` beautiful ' or ` ugly ' and so forth for the mode of valuation in life be innumerable any one of these adjective either denote value or censure lack of worth and each get its meaning by reference to the specific purpose moral aesthetic or intellectual it appeal to the _ summum bonum _ or supreme good will then be the ideal of the harmonious satisfaction of all purpose what then from the standpoint of humanism be the function of ` truth-value ' in we life they indicate a relation to the cognitive end what be this end surely not self-suffice a truth that be merely true in itself have no interest for human life and no human mind have a interest in discover and affirm it truth therefore can not stand aloof from life it must somehow subserve we vital purpose but how shall it do this only by become applicable to the reality we have to live with by become useful for the change we desire to effect in it whoever will not admit this and render truth inapplicable do in fact render it unmean the fact that think essentially refer to a ` reality ' external to it in no way diminish its purposive character whether the mind be idealize a aspect of reality -lrb- as in mathematics -rrb- or abstract classify and predict -lrb- as in science -rrb- it be always the fact that a particular kind of reality be need for some serious or trivial purpose which guide the operation of the thinker a mind which crave to embrace all or ` any ' reality need not _ think _ it would do better to float without discrimination upon the flux of change this procedure would be so absolutely antithetical to human know that it seem a wanton paradox on that account to treat it as the final goal of knowledge actually of course the philosopher who claim to be devote to pure theory follow no such course they deliberately choose they ideal of what be worth know -- _ eg _ ` god ' or ` the unity of all thing ' or ` the law of the universe ' -- and disregard all other existence they pursue the kind of reality they desire because of its religious or moral or aesthetic value for there could be no greater mistake than to suppose that the common antithesis between ` reality ' and the ` un-real ' usually mean the same thing as the distinction between what ` exist ' and what be absolutely non-existent on the contrary it be usually a judgment of value we may say that the ` haunt ' house be real and the ` ghost ' be not but as a hallucination the ghost be real enough utopia be unreal for the politician but exist as a ideal for the theorist the platonist treat we physical world of sight and touch which we think the most real of all as a mere illusion compare to the ` idea ' of he metaphysical world the thinker who declare he want to know all about ` reality ' do not mean that he wish to investigate _ everything _ which in any sense exist but that he wish to know what _ he _ consider _ best worth know _ -- and this of course imply a personal valuation a purge and expurgate extract which will not offend he taste so all philosophy be in fact selective even the more conscientious rationalist show very little anxiety to include in they intellectual scheme a knowledge of they opponent ' opinion -- indeed they seem to think that the existence of such fact may be make dependent wholly on they will to recognize they a exposition of pragmatism be for they a ` reality ' which do not count : it be not worth know about and this be only natural after all for ` reality ' the object of the mind 's search be always a selection conceive after the likeness of the heart 's desire the product of a human purpose to recognize this be to appreciate the wisdom of humanism 's refusal to treat the world for good or bad as a give and complete whole for not only be what we call the real world always a selection from a larger whole from which we have venture to exclude great mass of irrelevance but every day bring fresh experience and may bring fresh enlightenment and since man have always a interest in improve he condition be it not futile to forbid he to re-make he world as beat he can why prematurely claim to have reach finality when unexpected novelty may shatter any system before it be even complete we world be plastic it be most ` really ' what we can make of it and the process of we making be not end whether a decree of fate have fix any ultimate limit to we effort we have no means of know and no occasion to assume be not we wisest course then to persist in try it be bad method ever to despair of know what we need for good or ill the world with which the humanist contend be always a world that reveal itself to he reality as it be assume presumed or guess to be ` in itself ' apart from we experience of it be cancel from he reckoning for he can not discover how he -lrb- or anyone -rrb- can get any ` knowledge ' or ` intuition ' which transcend all human faculty the theory of metaphysician on these lofty theme he regard as personal postulate which in so far as they can not be subject to the pragmatic method must remain open question human experience do not warrant such gratuitous demand it confirm neither the rigid system of unchanging fact which realism postulate -lrb- see that the only fact that science speak of be ever change in its progress -rrb- nor find its problem conflict and error credible as a reflexion of any universal mind unless idealism ultimately repudiate the sanity of its absolute the superiority of humanism then lie in this that it do not discourage human enterprise by assume that the real be completely rigid and eternally achieve without regard to human effort in the drama that unroll reality every man it teach have a duty and a power to play he humble but essential part humanism be neither a optimism nor a pessimism -- both of which must consistently in they extreme form deny that reality can be improve -- but concede to man the right and duty to improve the world it impress we with the necessity of act it vindicate the procedure of act on we hope it show we how we may correct we error and so give reason for we faith in the possibility of progress bibliography william jame : _ the principle of
