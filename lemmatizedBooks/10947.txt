produce by keith m eckrich and pg distribute proofreader the best american humorous short story _ edit by _ alexander jessup _ editor of representative american short story the book of the short story the little french masterpiece series etc _ introduction this volume do not aim to contain all the best american humorous short story there be many other story equally as good i suppose in much the same vein scatter through the range of american literature i have try to keep a certain unity of aim and impression in select these story in the first place i determine that the piece of brief fiction which i include must first of all be not merely good story but good short story i put myself in the position of one who be about to select the best short story in the whole range of american literature -lrb- 1 -rrb- but who just before he start to do this be notify that he must refrain from select any of the best american short story that do not contain the element of humor to a marked degree but i have keep in mind the wide boundary of the term humor and also the fact that the humorous standard should be keep second -- although a close second -- to the short story standard in view of the necessary limitation as to the volume 's size i could not hope to represent all period of american literature adequately nor be this necessary in order to give example of the best that have be do in the short story in a humorous vein in american literature probably all type of the short story of humor be include here at any rate not only copyright restriction but in a measure my own opinion have combine to exclude anything by joel chandler harri -- _ uncle remus _ -- from the collection harri be primarily -- in he best work -- a humorist and only secondarily a short story writer as a humorist he be of the first rank as a writer of short story he place be hardly so high he humor be not mere funniness and diversion he be a humorist in the fundamental and large sense as be cervante rabelai and mark twain no book be duller than a book of joke for what be refreshing in small dose become nauseating when peruse in large assignment humor in literature be at its best not when serve merely by itself but when present along with other ingredient of literary force in order to give a wide representation of life therefore professional literary humorist as they may be call have not be much consider in make up this collection in the history of american humor there be three name which stand out more prominently than all other before mark twain who however also belong to a wider classification : josh billing -lrb- henry wheeler shaw 1815-1885 -rrb- petroleum v nasby -lrb- david ross locke 1833-1888 -rrb- and artemus ward -lrb- charle farrar browne 1834-1867 -rrb- in the history of american humor these name rank high in the field of american literature and the american short story they do not rank so high i have find nothing of theirs that be first-class both as humor and as short story perhaps just below these three should be mention george horatio derby -lrb- 1823-1861 -rrb- author of _ phoenixiana _ -lrb- 1855 -rrb- and the _ squibob papers _ -lrb- 1859 -rrb- who write under the name john phoenix as have be justly say derby shaw locke and browne carry to a extreme numerous trick already invent by earlier american humorist particularly the trick of gigantic exaggeration and calm-faced mendacity but they be plainly in the main channel of american humor which have its origin in the first comment of settler upon the condition of the frontier long draw its principal inspiration from the difference between that frontier and the more settled and compact region of the country and reach its highest development in mark twain in he youth a child of the american frontier admirer and imitator of derby and browne and eventually a man of the world and one of its greatest humorist -lrb- 2 -rrb- nor have such later writer who be essentially humorist as bill nye -lrb- edgar wilson nye 1850-1896 -rrb- be consider because they work do not attain the literary standard and the short story standard as creditably as it do the humorous one when we come to the close of the nineteenth century the work of such man as mr dooley -lrb- finley peter dunne 1867 - -rrb- and george ade -lrb- 1866 - -rrb- stand out but while these two writer successfully conform to the exact critical requirement of good humor and -- especially the former -- of good literature neither -- though ade more so -- attain to the greatest excellence of the short story mr dooley of the archey road be essentially a wholesome and wide-poised humorous philosopher and the author of _ fable in slang _ be chiefly a satirist whether in fable play or what not this volume might well have start with something by washington irving i suppose many critic would say it do not seem to I however that irving 's best short story such as _ the legend of sleepy hollow _ and _ rip van winkle _ be essentially humorous story although they be o'erspread with the genial light of reminiscence it be the armchair geniality of the eighteenth century essayist a constituent of the author rather than of he material and product irving 's best humorous creation indeed be scarcely short story at all but rather essaylike sketch or sketchlike essay jame lawson -lrb- 1799-1880 -rrb- in he _ tale and sketch : by a cosmopolite _ -lrb- 1830 -rrb- notably in _ the dapper gentleman 's story _ be also plainly a follower of irve we come to a different vein in the work of such writer as william tappan thompson -lrb- 1812-1882 -rrb- author of the amusing story in letter form _ major jone 's courtship _ -lrb- 1840 -rrb- johnson jone hooper -lrb- 1815-1862 -rrb- author of _ widow rugby 's husband and other tale of alabama _ -lrb- 1851 -rrb- joseph g baldwin -lrb- 1815-1864 -rrb- who write _ the flush time of alabama and mississippus _ -lrb- 1853 -rrb- and augustus baldwin longstreet -lrb- 1790-1870 -rrb- whose _ georgium scene _ -lrb- 1835 -rrb- be as important in local color as they be racy in humor yet none of these writer yield the excellent short story which be also a good piece of humorous literature but they open the way for the work of later writer who do attain these combine excellence the sentimental vein of the midcentury be see in the work of seba smith -lrb- 1792-1868 -rrb- eliza leslie -lrb- 1787-1858 -rrb- france miriam whitcher -lrb- widow bedott 1811-1852 -rrb- mary w janvrin -lrb- 1830-1870 -rrb- and alice bradley haven neal -lrb- 1828-1863 -rrb- the well-known work of joseph clay neal -lrb- 1807-1847 -rrb- be so all pervade with caricature and humor that it belong with the work of the professional humorist school rather than with the short story writer to mention he _ charcoal sketch or scene in a metropolis _ -lrb- 1837-1849 -rrb- must suffice the work of seba smith be sufficiently express in he title _ way down east or portraiture of yankee life _ -lrb- 1854 -rrb- although he _ letter of major jack down _ -lrb- 1833 -rrb- be better know of he single story may be mention _ the general court and jane andrew ' firkin of butter _ -lrb- October 1847 _ graham 's magazine _ -rrb- the work of france miriam whitcher -lrb- widow bedott -rrb- be of somewhat finer grain both as humor and in other literary quality she story or sketch such as _ aunt magwire 's account of parson scrantum 's donation party _ -lrb- march 1848 _ godey 's lady 's book _ -rrb- and _ aunt magwire 's account of the mission to muffletegawmy _ -lrb- July 1859 _ godey 's _ -rrb- be afterwards collect in _ the widow bedott papers _ -lrb- 1855-56-80 -rrb- the scope of the work of mary b haven be sufficiently suggest by she story _ mr bowen 's parlor and spare bedroom _ -lrb- February 1860 _ godey 's _ -rrb- while the best story of mary w janvrin include _ the foreign count or high art in tattletown _ -lrb- October 1860 _ godey 's _ -rrb- and _ city relation or the newman ' summer at clovernook _ -lrb- November 1861 _ godey 's _ -rrb- the work of alice bradley haven neal be of somewhat similar texture she book _ the gossip of rivertown with sketch in prose and verse _ -lrb- 1850 -rrb- indicate she field as do the single title _ the third-class hotel _ -lrb- December 1861 _ godey 's _ -rrb- perhaps the most representative figure of this school be eliza leslie -lrb- 1787-1858 -rrb- who as miss leslie be one of the most frequent contributor to the magazine of the 1830 's 1840 's and 1850 's one of she best story be _ the watkinson evening _ -lrb- December 1846 _ godey 's lady 's book _ -rrb- include in the present volume other be _ the batson cottage _ -lrb- November 1846 _ godey 's lady 's book _ -rrb- and _ juliet irwin or the carriage people _ -lrb- June 1847 _ godey 's lady 's book _ -rrb- one of she chief collection of story be _ pencil sketch _ -lrb- 1833-1837 -rrb- miss leslie write edgar allan poe be celebrate for the homely naturalness of she story and for the broad satire of she comic style she be the editor of _ the gift _ one of the best annual of the time and in that position perhaps exert she chief influence on american literature when one have read three or four representative story by these seven author one can grasp they all they title as a rule strike the keynote these writer except the widow bedott be perhaps sentimentalist rather than humorist in intention but read in the light of later day they apparent serious delineation of the frolic and foible of they time take on a highly humorous aspect george pope morri -lrb- 1802-1864 -rrb- be one of the founder of _ the new york mirror _ and for a time its editor he be best know as the author of the poem _ woodman spare that tree _ and other poem and song _ the little frenchman and he water lot _ -lrb- 1839 -rrb- the first story in the present volume be select not because morri be especially prominent in the field of the short story or humorous prose but because of this single story 's representative character edgar allan poe -lrb- 1809-1849 -rrb- follow with _ the angel of the odd _ -lrb- October 1844 _ columbian magazine _ -rrb- perhaps the best of he humorous story _ the system of dr tarr and prof fether _ -lrb- November 1845 _ graham 's magazine _ -rrb- may be rate higher but it be not essentially a humorous story rather it be incisive satire with too bite a undercurrent to pass muster in the company of the genial in literature poe 's humorous story as a whole have tend to belittle rather than increase he fame many of they verge on the inane there be some however which be at least excellent fooling few more than that probably this be hardly the place for a extended discussion of poe since the present volume cover neither american literature as a whole nor the american short story in general and poe be not a humorist in he more notable production let it be say that poe invent or perfect -- more exactly perfect he own invention of -- the modern short story that be he general and supreme achievement he also stand superlative for the quality of three variety of short story those of terror beauty and ratiocination in the first class belong _ a descent into the maelstrom _ -lrb- 1841 -rrb- _ the pit and the pendulum _ -lrb- 1842 -rrb- _ the black cat _ -lrb- 1843 -rrb- and _ the cask of amontillado _ -lrb- 1846 -rrb- in the realm of beauty he notable production be _ the assignation _ -lrb- 1834 -rrb- _ shadow : a parable _ -lrb- 1835 -rrb- _ ligeium _ -lrb- 1838 -rrb- _ the fall of the house of usher _ -lrb- 1839 -rrb- _ eleonora _ -lrb- 1841 -rrb- and _ the masque of the red death _ -lrb- 1842 -rrb- the tale of ratiocination -- what be now generally term detective story -- include _ the murder in the rue morgue _ -lrb- 1841 -rrb- and its sequel _ the mystery of marie rogêt _ -lrb- 1842-1843 -rrb- _ the gold-bug _ -lrb- 1843 -rrb- _ the oblong box _ -lrb- 1844 -rrb- _ thou art the man _ -lrb- 1844 -rrb- and _ the purloined letter _ -lrb- 1844 -rrb- then too poe be a master of style one of the greatest in english prose possibly the greatest since de quincey and quite the most remarkable among american author poe 's influence on the short story form have be tremendous although the _ effect _ of structure may be astounding in they power or unexpectedness yet the _ mean _ by which these effect be bring about be purely mechanical any student of fiction can comprehend they almost any practitioner of fiction with a bent toward form can fairly master they the merit of any short story production depend on many other element as well -- the value of the structural element to the production as a whole depend first on the selection of the particular sort of structural scheme best suit to the story in hand and secondly on the way in which this be _ combined _ with the piece of write to form a well-balanced whole style be more difficult to imitate than structure but on the other hand _ the origin of structural influence _ be more difficult to trace than that of style so while in a general way we feel that poe 's influence on structure in the short story have be great it be difficult rather than obvious to trace particular instance it be feel in the advance of the general level of short story art there be nothing personal about structure -- there be everything personal about style poe 's style be both too much he own and too superlatively good to be successfully imitate -- whom have we have who even if he be a master of structural effect could be a second poe look at the matter in another way poe 's style be not he own at all there be nothing personal about it in the petty sense of that term rather we feel that in the case of this author universality have be attain it be poe 's good fortune to be himself in style as often in content on a plane of universal appeal but in some general characteristic of he style he work can be not perhaps imitate but emulate greater vividness deft impressionism brevity that strike instantly to a telling effect -- all these a author may have without imitate any one 's style but rather imitate excellence poe 's imitator who have amount to anything have not try to imitate he but to vie with he they be strive after perfectionism of course the sort of good style in which poe indulge be not the kind of style -- or the variety of style -- suit for all purpose but for the purpose to which it be adapt it may well be call supreme then as a poet he work be almost or quite as excellent in a somewhat more restricted range in verse he be probably the best artist in american letter here he sole pursuit be beauty both of form and think he be vivid and apt intensely lyrical but without much range of thought he have deep intuition but no comprehensive grasp of life he criticism be on the whole the least important part of he work he have a few good and brilliant idea which come at just the right time to make a stir in the world and these he logical mind and tell style enable he to present to the best advantage as a critic he be neither broad-minded learn nor comprehensive nor be he except in the few idea refer to deep he be however limitedly original -- perhaps intensely original within he narrow scope but the excellence and limitation of poe in any one part of he work be he limitation and excellence in all as poe 's

1824-1892 -rrb- gain he chief fame as a essayist and probably become best know from the department which he conduct from 1853 as _ the editor 's easy chair _ for _ harper 's magazine _ for many year he volume _ prue and i _ -lrb- 1856 -rrb- contain many fictional element and a story from it _ titbottom 's spectacles _ which first appear in putnam 's monthly for December 1854 be give in this volume because it be a good humorous short story rather than because of its author 's general eminence in this field other story of he worth note be _ the shroud portrait _ -lrb- in _ the knickerbocker gallery _ 1855 -rrb- and _ the millenial club _ -lrb- November 1858 _ knickerbocker magazine _ -rrb- edward everett hale -lrb- 1822-1909 -rrb- be chiefly know as the author of the short story _ the man without a country _ -lrb- December 1863 _ atlantic monthly _ -rrb- but he venture in the comic vein _ my double and how he undo I _ -lrb- September 1859 _ atlantic monthly _ -rrb- be equally worthy of appreciation it be he first publish story of importance other noteworthy story of he be : _ the brick moon _ -lrb- October November and December 1869 _ atlantic monthly _ -rrb- _

the story by hale which have make he fame all show ability of no mean order but they be characterize by invention and ingenuity rather than by suffuse imagination there be not much homogeneity about hale 's work almost any two story of he read as if they might have be write by different author for the time be perhaps this be a advantage -- he story charm by they novelty and individuality in the long run however this prove rather a handicap true individuality in literature as in the other art consist not in be different on different occasion -- in different work -- so much as in be _ samely _ different from other writer in be _ consistently _ one 's self rather than diffusedly various self this do not lessen the value of particular story of course it merely injure hale 's fame as a whole perhaps some will chiefly feel not so much that he story be different among themselves but that they be not strongly anything -- anybody 's -- in particular that they lack strong personality the pathway to fame be strew with stray exhibition of talent apart from he purely literary production hale be one of the large moral force of he time through uplift both in speech and the write word oliver wendell holme -lrb- 1809-1894 -rrb- one of the lead wit of american literature be not at all well know as a short story writer nor do he write many brief piece of fiction he fame rest chiefly on he poem and on the _ breakfast-table _ book -lrb- 1858-1860-1872-1890 -rrb- _ old ironside _ _ the last leaf _ _ the chambered nautilus _ and _ homesick in heaven _ be secure of place in the anthology of the future while he lighter verse have make he one of the lead american writer of familiar verse frederick locker-lampson in the preface to the first edition of he _ lyra elegantiarum _ -lrb- 1867 -rrb- declare that holme be perhaps the best living writer of this species of verse he trenchant attack on _ homeopathy and its kindred delusion _ -lrb- 1842 -rrb- make we wonder what would have be he attitude toward some of the belief of we own day christian science for example he might have expose it under some such title as _ the religio-medical masquerade _ or bring the battery of he humor to bear on it in the manner of robert loui stevenson 's fable _ something in it _ : perhaps there be not much in it as i suppose but there be something in it after all let I be thankful for that in holme ' long work of fiction elsie venner -lrb- 1861 -rrb- _ the guardian angel _ -lrb- 1867 -rrb- and _ a mortal antipathy _ -lrb- 1885 -rrb- the method be still somewhat that of the essayist i have find a short piece of fiction by he in the march 1832 number of _ the new england magazine _ call _ the début _ sign owh _ the story of iris _ in _ the professor at the breakfast table _ which run in _ the atlantic _ throughout 1859 and _ a visit to the asylum for aged and decayed punster _ -lrb- January 1861 _ atlantic _ -rrb- be he only other brief fiction of which i be aware the last name have be give place in the present selection because it be characteristic of a certain type and period of american humor although its short story quality be not particularly strong samuel langhorne clemen -lrb- 1835-1910 -rrb- who achieve fame as mark twain be only incidentally a short story writer although he write many short piece of fiction he humorous quality i mean be so preponderant that one hardly think of the form indeed he be never very strong in fictional construction and of the modern short story art he evidently know or care little he be a humorist in the large sense as be rabelai and cervante although he be also a humorist in various restricted application of the word that be wholly american _ the celebrated jump frog of calaveras county _ be he first

be essentially a writer of human-nature sketch he be humorous and picturesque say fred lewi pattee and often he be for a moment the master of pathos but he have add nothing new and nothing

from about 1895 to he death in 1917 i remember walk up fifth avenue with he one Sunday afternoon just after he have show I a letter from the man who be then comptroller of the currency the letter be sign so illegibly that my companion be in doubt as to the sender so he suggest that we stop at a well-known hotel at the corner of 59th street and ask the manager who the comptroller of the currency then be so that he might know whom the letter be from he say that the manager of a big hotel like that where many prominent people stay would be sure to know when this problem have be solve to we satisfaction john skelton william prove to be the man lampton say now you have tell I who he be i 'll show you who i be so he ask for a copy of _ the american magazine _ at a newsstand in the hotel corridor open it and show the manager a full-page picture of himself clothe in a costume suggestive of the time of christopher columbus with high ruff around he neck that happen to appear in the magazine the current month i mention this incident to illustrate the lack of conventionality and whimsical originality of the man that stand out no less forcibly in he writings than in he daily life he have little use for do the usual thing in the usual sort of way he first gain prominence by he book of verse _ yawp _ -lrb- 1900 -rrb- he poem be free from convention in technique as well as in spirit although they chief innovation be simply that as a rule there be no regular number of syllable in a line he let the line be any length they want to be to fit the sense or the length of what he have to say he once say to I that if anything of he be remember he think it would be he poem_lo the summer girl _ he muse often take the direction of satire but it be always good-natured even when it hit the hardest he have in he makeup much of the detach philosopher like cervante and mark twain there be something cosmic about he attitude to life and this show in much that he do he be the only american writer of humorous verse of he day whom i always care to read or whose line i could remember more than a few week this be perhaps because he work be never _ merely _ humorous but always have a big sweep of background to it like the ruggedness of the kentucky mountain from which he come it be colonel george harvey then editor of _ harper 's weekly _ who have start the boom to make woodrow wilson president wilson afterwards at least seemingly repudiate he sponsor probably because of harvey 's identification with various moneyed interest lampton 's poem on the subject with its refrain never again say colonel george i remember as one of the most notable of he poem on current topic but what always seem to I the best of he poem deal with matter of the hour be one that i suggest he write which deal with gift-giving to the public at about the time that andrew carnegie be make a big stir with he gift for library begin : dunno perhaps one of the yap like I would make a holy break do he turn with money to burn anyhow i would not shy make a try and contain among many effective touch the pathetic line i would help the poor who try to help themselves who have to work so hard for bread they can not get very far ahead when jame lane allen 's novel _ the reign of law _ come out -lrb- 1900 -rrb- a little quatrain by lampton that appear in _ the bookman _ -lrb- September 1900 -rrb- sweep like wildfire across the country and be read by a hundred time as many people as the book itself : the reign of law well allen you be lucky it be the first time it ever rain law in kentucky the reader need not be remind that at that period kentucky family feud be well to the fore as lampton have start as a poet the editor be bind to keep he pigeon-hole as far as they could and he ambition to write short story be not at first much encourage by they he predicament be something like that of the chief character of frank r stockton 's story _ he wife 's deceased sister _ -lrb- January 1884 _ century _ -rrb- who have write a story so good that whenever he bring the editor another story they invariably answer in substance we be afraid it will not do can not you give we something like ' _ he wife 's deceased sister _ ' this be merely stockton 's turn to account he own somewhat similar experience with the editor after he story _ the lady or the tiger _ -lrb- November 1882 _ century _ -rrb- appear likewise the editor do not want lampton 's short story for a while because they like he poem so well do i hear some critic exclaim that there be nothing remarkable about _ how the widow win the deacon _ the story by lampton include in this volume it handle a amusing situation lightly and with grace it be one of those thing that read easily and be often difficult to

the lot in which heaven have cast he and how much trouble would be avoid if people would only let well alone a moderate independence quietly and honestly procure be certainly every way preferable even to immense possession achieve by the wear and tear of mind and body so necessary to procure they yet there be very few individual let they be do ever so well in the world who be not always strain every nerve to do better and this be one of the many cause why failure in business so frequently occur among we the present generation seem unwilling to realize by slow and sure degree but choose

they all over again there be he purchase sure enough but then it could not be perceive for there be a river flow over it he draw a box from he waistcoat pocket open it with a emphatic knock upon the lid take a pinch of snuff and restore it to he waistcoat pocket as before poopoo be evidently in trouble have thought which often lie too deep for tear and as he grief be also too big for word he untie he horse jump into he gig and return to the auctioneer in hot haste it be near night when he arrive at the auction-room -- he horse in a foam and himself in a fury the auctioneer be lean back in

_ October 1844 -rrb- by edgar allan poe -lrb- 1809-1849 -rrb- it be a chilly November afternoon i have just consummate a unusually hearty dinner of which the dyspeptic _ truffe _ form not the least important item and be sit alone in the dining-room with my foot upon the fender and at my elbow a small table which i have roll up to the fire and upon which be some apology for dessert with some miscellaneous bottle of wine spirit and _ liqueur _ in the morning i have be read glover 's _ leonida _ wilkie 's _ epigoniad _ lamartine 's _ pilgrimage _ barlow 's _ columbiad _ tuckerman 's _ sicily _ and griswold 's _ curiosity _ i be willing to confess therefore that i now feel a little stupid i make effort to arouse myself by frequent aid of lafitte and all fail i betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair have carefully peruse the column of house to let and the column of dog lose and then the column of wife and apprentice runaway i attack with great resolution the editorial matter and read it from begin to end without understand a syllable conceive the possibility of its be chinese and so re-read it from the end to the beginning but with no more satisfactory result i be about throw away in disgust this folio of four page happy work which not even critic criticise when i feel my attention somewhat arouse by the paragraph which follow : the avenue to death be numerous and strange a london paper mention the decease of a person from a singular cause he be play at ` puff the dart ' which be play with a long needle insert in some worst and blow at a target through a tin tube he place the needle at the wrong end of the tube and draw he breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force draw the needle into he throat it enter the lung and in a few day kill he upon see this i fall into a great rage without exactly know why this thing i exclaimed be a contemptible falsehood -- a poor hoax -- the lees of the invention of some pitiable penny-a-liner of some wretched concocter of accident in cocaigne these fellow know the extravagant gullibility of the age set they wit to work in the imagination of improbable possibility of odd accident as they term they but to a reflect intellect -lrb- like mine i add in parenthesis put my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose -rrb- to a contemplative understanding such as i myself possess it seem evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these ` odd accident ' be by far the oddest accident of all for my own part i intend to believe nothing henceforward that have anything of the ` singular ' about it mein gott den vat a vool you bee for dat reply one of the most remarkable voice i ever hear at first i take it for a rumble in my ear -- such as a man sometimes experience when get very drunk -- but upon second thought i consider the sound as more nearly resemble that which proceed from a empty barrel beat with a big stick and in fact this i should have conclude it to be but for the articulation of the syllable and word i be by no means naturally nervous and the very few glass of lafitte which i have sip serve to embolden I a little so that i feel nothing of trepidation but merely uplift my eye with a leisurely movement and look carefully around the room for the intruder i could not however perceive any one at all humph resume the voice as i continue my survey you mus pe so dronk as de pig den for not zee I as i zit here at you zide hereupon i bethought I of look immediately before my nose and there sure enough confront I at the table sit a personage nondescript although not altogether indescribable he body be a wine-pipe or a rum puncheon or something of that character and have a truly falstaffian air in its nether extremity be insert two keg which seem to answer all the purpose of leg for arm there dangle from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottle with the neck outward for hand all the head that i see the monster possess of be one of those hessian canteen which resemble a large snuff-box with a hole in the middle of the lid this canteen -lrb- with a funnel on its top like a cavalier cap slouch over the eye -rrb- be set on edge upon the puncheon with the hole toward myself and through this hole which seem pucker up like the mouth of a very precise old maid the creature be emit certain rumble and grumble noise which he evidently intend for intelligible talk i zay say he you mos pe dronk as de pig vor zit dare and not zee I zit ere and i zay doo you mos pe pigger vool as de goose vor to dispelief vat iz print in de

mean i can not do what ring de pell he reply attempt a grin with he little villainous mouth upon this i make a effort to get up in order to put my threat into execution but the ruffian just reach across the table very deliberately and hit I a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottle knock I back into the armchair from which i have half arise i be utterly astounded and for a moment be quite at a loss what to do in the meantime he continue he talk you zee say he it iz te bess vor zit still and now you shall know who i pe look at I zee i be te _ angel ov te odd _ and odd enough too i venture to reply but i be always under the impression that a angel have wing te wing he cry highly incensed vat i pe do mit te wing mein gott do you take I for a shicken no -- oh no i reply much alarmed you be no chicken -- certainly not well den zit still and pehabe yourself or i 'll rap you again mid I vist it iz te shicken ab te wing und te owl ab te wing und te imp ab te wing

mos pe vor to ask a gentleman und a angel apout he pizziness this language be rather more than i could bear even from a angel so pluck up courage i seize a salt-cellar which lay within reach and hurl it at the head of the intruder either he dodge however or my aim be inaccurate for all i accomplish be the demolition of the crystal which protect the dial of the clock upon the mantelpiece as for the angel he evince he sense of my assault by give I two or three hard consecutive rap upon the forehead as before these reduce I at once to submission and i be almost ashamed to confess that either through pain or vexation there come a few tear into my eye mein gott say the angel of the odd apparently much soften at my distress mein gott te man be eder ferry dronk or ferry zorry you mo not trink it so strong -- you mo put te water in te wine here trink di like a good veller and do not gry now -- do not hereupon the angel of the odd replenish my goblet -lrb- which be about a third full of port -rrb- with a colorless fluid that he pour from one of he hand-bottle i observe that these bottle have label about they neck and that these label be inscribe kirschenwässer the considerate kindness of the angel mollify I in no little measure and aid by the water with which he dilute my port more than once i at length regain sufficient temper to listen to he very extraordinary discourse i can not pretend to recount all that he tell I but i glean from what he say that he be a genius who preside over the _ contretemps _ of mankind and whose business it be to bring about the _ odd accident _ which be continually astonishing the skeptic once or twice upon my venture to express my total incredulity in respect to he pretension he grow very angry indeed so that at length i consider it the wiser policy to say nothing at all and let he have he own way he talk on therefore at great length while i merely lean back in my chair with my eye shut and amuse myself with munch raisin and filip the stem about the room but by and by the angel suddenly construe this behavior of mine into contempt he arise in a terrible passion slouch he funnel down over he eye swear a vast oath utter a threat of some character which i do not precisely comprehend and finally make I a low bow and depart wish I in the language of the archbishop in gil bias _ beaucoup de bonheur et un peu plus de bon sens _ he departure afford I relief the _ very _ few glass of lafitte that i have sip have the effect of render I drowsy and i feel inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minute as be my custom after dinner at six i have a appointment of consequence which it be quite indispensable that i should keep the policy of insurance for my dwelling-house have expire the day before and some dispute have arise it be agree that at six i should meet the board of director of the company and settle the term of a renewal glance upward at the clock on the mantelpiece -lrb- for i feel too drowsy to take out my watch -rrb- i have the pleasure to find that i have still twenty-five minute to spare it be half-past five i could easily walk to the insurance office in five minute and my usual siesta have never be know to exceed five-and-twenty i feel sufficiently safe therefore and compose myself to my slumber forthwith have complete they to my satisfaction i again look toward the timepiece and be half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accident when i find that instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minute i have be doze only three for it still want seven-and-twenty of the appoint hour i betook myself again to my nap and at length a second time awake when to my utter amazement it still want twenty-seven minute of six i jump up to examine the clock and find that it have cease run my watch inform I that it be half-past seven and of course have sleep two hour i be too late for my appointment it will make no difference i say : i can call at the office in the morning and apologize in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock upon examine it i discover that one of the raisin stem which i have be filip about the room during the discourse of the angel of the odd have fly through the fracture crystal and lodging singularly enough in the keyhole with a end project outward have thus arrest the revolution of the minute hand ah say i i see how it be this thing speak for itself a natural accident such as will happen now and then i give the matter no further consideration and at my usual hour retire to bed here have place a candle upon a reading stand at the bed head and have make a attempt to peruse some page of the _ omnipresence of the deity _ i unfortunately fall asleep in less than twenty seconds leave the light burning as it be my dream be terrifically disturb by vision of the angel of the odd methought he stand at the foot of the couch draw aside the curtain and in the hollow detestable tone of a rum puncheon menace I with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which i have treat he he conclude a long harangue by take off he funnel-cap insert the tube into my gullet and thus deluge I with a ocean of kirschenwässer which he pour in a continuous flood from one of the long-necked bottle that stand he instead of a arm my agony be at length insufferable and i awake just in time to perceive that a rat have run off with the light candle from the stand but _ not _ in season to prevent he make he escape with it through the hole very soon a strong suffocating odor assail my nostril the house i clearly perceive be on fire in a few minute the blaze break forth with violence and in a incredibly brief period the entire building be wrap in flame all egress from my chamber except through a window be cut off the crowd however quickly procure and raise a long ladder by means of this i be descend rapidly and in apparent safety when a huge hog about whose rotund stomach and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy there be something which remind I of the angel of the odd -- when this hog i say which hitherto have be quietly slumber in the mud take it suddenly into he head that he left shoulder need scratch and could find no more convenient rubbing-post than that afford by the foot of the ladder in a instant i be precipitated and have the misfortune to fracture my arm this accident with the loss of my insurance and with the more serious loss of my hair the whole of which have be singe off by the fire predispose I to serious impression so that finally i make up my mind to take a wife there be a rich widow disconsolate for the loss of she seventh husband and to she wounded spirit i offer the balm of my vow she yield a reluctant consent to my prayer i knelt at she foot in gratitude and adoration she blush and bow she luxuriant tress into close contact with those supply I temporarily by grandjean i know not how the entanglement take place but so it be i arise with a shine pate wigless she in disdain and wrath half-buried in alien hair thus end my hope of the widow by a accident which could not have be anticipate to be sure but which the natural sequence of event have bring about without despair however i undertake the siege of a less implacable heart the fate be again propitious for a brief period but again a trivial incident interfere meeting my betroth in a avenue throng with the elite of the city i be hasten to greet she with one of my best consider bow when a small particle of some foreign matter lodging in the corner of my eye render I for the moment completely blind before i could recover my sight the lady of my love have disappear -- irreparably affront at what she choose to consider my premeditated rudeness in pass she by ungreeted while i stand bewilder at the suddenness of this accident -lrb- which might have happen nevertheless to any one under the sun -rrb- and while i still continue incapable of sight i be accost by the angel of the odd who proffer I he aid with a civility which i have no reason to expect he examine my disorder eye with much gentleness and skill inform I that i have a drop in it and -lrb- whatever a drop be -rrb- take it out and afford I relief i now consider it high time to die -lrb- since fortune have so determine to persecute I -rrb- and accordingly make my way to the nearest river here divest myself of my clothes -lrb- for there be no reason why we can not die as we be bear -rrb- i throw myself headlong into the current the sole witness of my fate be a solitary crow that have be seduce into the eating of brandy-saturated corn and so have stagger away from he fellow no sooner have i enter the water than this bird take it into he head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel postpone therefore for the present my suicidal design i just slip my nether extremity into the sleeve of my coat and betook myself to a pursuit of the felon with all the nimbleness which the case require and its circumstance would admit but my evil destiny attend I still as i run at full speed with my nose up in the atmosphere and intent only upon the purloiner of my property i suddenly perceive that my foot rest no longer upon _ terra firma _ the fact be i have throw myself over a precipice and should inevitably have be dash to piece but for my good fortune in grasp the end of a long guide-rope which depend from a pass balloon as soon as i sufficiently recover my sens to comprehend the terrific predicament in which i stand or rather hang i exert all the power of my lung to make that predicament know to the aeronaut overhead but for a long time i exert myself in vain either the fool could not or the villain would not perceive I meanwhile the machine rapidly soar while my strength even more rapidly fail i be soon upon the point of resign myself to my fate and drop quietly into the sea when my spirit be suddenly revive by hear a hollow voice from above which seem to be lazily hum a opera air look up i perceive the angel of the odd he be lean with he arm fold over the rim of the car and with a pipe in he mouth at which he puff leisurely seem to be upon excellent term with himself and the universe i be too much exhaust to speak so i merely regard he with a implore air for several minute although he look I full in the face he say nothing at length remove carefully he meerschaum from the right to the left corner of he mouth he condescend to speak who pe you he ask und what der teuffel you pe do dare to this piece of impudence cruelty and affectation i could reply only by ejaculate the monosyllable help elp echo the ruffian not i dare iz te pottle -- elp yourself und pe tam would with these word he let fall a heavy bottle of kirschenwässer which drop precisely upon the crown of my head cause I to imagine that my brain be entirely knock out impress with this idea i be about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good grace when i be arrest by the cry of the angel who bid I hold on ` old on he say : do not pe in te ` urry -- do not will you pe take de odder pottle or ` ave you pe get zober yet and come to you zenz i make haste hereupon to nod my head twice -- once in the negative meaning thereby that i would prefer not take the other bottle at present and once in the affirmative intending thus to imply that i _ be _ sober and _ have _ positively come to my sens by these means i somewhat soften the angel und you pelief ten he inquire at te last you pelief ten in te possibility of te odd i again nod my head in assent und you ave pelief in _ I _ te angel of te odd i nod again und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind dronk und te vool i nod once more put you right hand into you left preech pocket ten in token ov you vull

the volume _ western clearing _ -lrb- 1845 -rrb- by caroline m kirkland -rrb- master william horner come to we village to school when he be about eighteen year old : tall lank straight-sided and straight-haired with a mouth of the most puckered and solemn kind he figure and movement be those of a puppet cut out of shingle and jerk by a string and he address correspond very well with he appearance never do that prim mouth give way before a laugh a faint and misty smile be the widest departure from its propriety and this unaccustomed disturbance make wrinkle in the flat skinny cheek like those in the surface of a lake after the intrusion of a stone master horner know well what belong to the pedagogical character and that facial solemnity stand high on the list of indispensable qualification he have make up he mind before he leave he father 's house how he would look during the term he have not plan any smile -lrb- know that he must board round -rrb- and it be not for ordinary occurrence to alter he arrangement so that when he be betray into a relaxation of the muscle it be in such a sort as if he be put he bread and butter in jeopardy truly he have a grave time that first winter the rod of power be new to he and he feel it he duty to use it more frequently than might have be think necessary by those upon whose sense the privilege have pall tear and sulky face and impotent fist double fiercely when he back be turn be the reward of he conscientiousness and the boy -- and girl too -- be glad when work time come round again and the master go home to help he father on the farm but with the autumn come master horner again drop among we as quietly as the fade leaf and awaken at least as much serious reflection would he be as self-sacrificing as before postpone he own ease and comfort to the public good or would he have become more sedentary and less fond of circumambulate the school-room with a switch over he shoulder many be fain to hope he might have learn to smoke during the summer a accomplishment which would probably have moderate he energy not a little and disposed he rather to reverie than to action but here he be and all the broader-chested and stouter-armed for he labor in the harvest-field let it not be suppose that master horner be of a cruel and ogrish nature -- a babe-eater -- a herod -- one who delight in torture the helpless such soul there may be among those endowed with the awful control of the ferule but they be rare in the fresh and natural region we describe it be we believe where young gentleman be to be cram for college that the process of harden heart and skin together go on most vigorously yet among the uneducated there be so high a respect for bodily strength that it be necessary for the schoolmaster to show first of all that he possess this inadmissible requisite for he place the rest be more readily take for grant brain he _ may _ have -- a strong arm he _ must _ have : so he prove the more important claim first we must therefore make all due allowance for master horner who could not be expect to overtop he position so far as to discern at once the philosophy of teaching he be sadly brow-beaten during he first term of service by a great broad-shouldered lout of some eighteen year or so who think he need a little more schooling but at the same time feel quite competent to direct the manner and measure of he attempt you would ought to begin with large-hand joshuay say master horner to this youth what should i want coarse-hand for say the disciple with great contempt coarse-hand will not never do I no good i want a fine-hand copy the master look at the infant giant and do as he wish but we say not with what secret resolution at another time master horner have have a hint from some one more know than himself propose to he elder scholar to write after dictation expatiate at the same time quite floridly -lrb- the idea have be supply by the know friend -rrb- upon the advantage likely to arise from this practice and say among other thing it will help you when you write letter to spell the word good pooh say joshua spellin ' be not nothin ' let they that find the mistake correct 'em i be for every one 's havin ' a way of they own how dare you be so saucy to the master ask one of the little boy after school because i could lick he easy say the hopeful joshua who know very well why the master do not undertake he on the spot can we wonder that master horner determine to make he empire good as far as it go a new examination be require on the entrance into a second term and with whatever secret trepidation the master be oblige to submit we law prescribe examination but forget to provide for the competency of the examiner so that few better farce offer than the course of question and answer on these occasion we know not precisely what be master horner 's trial but we have hear of a sharp dispute between the inspector whether a-n-g-e-l spell _ angle _ or _ angel _ _ angle _ have it and the school maintain that pronunciation ever after master horner pass and he be request to draw up the certificate for the inspector to sign as one have leave he spectacles at home and the other have a bad cold so that it be not convenient for either to write more than he name master homer 's exhibition of learn on this occasion do not reach we but we know that it must have be considerable since he stand the ordeal what be orthography say a inspector once in we presence the candidate writhe a good deal study the beam overhead and the chicken out of the window and then reply it be so long since i learn the first part of the spelling-book that i can not justly answer that question but if i could just look it over i guess i could we schoolmaster enter upon he second term with new courage and invigorated authority twice certify who should dare doubt he competency even joshua be civil and lesser lout of course obsequious though the girl take more liberty for they feel even at that early age that influence be stronger than strength could a young schoolmaster think of ferule a girl with she hair in ringlet and a gold ring on she finger impossible -- and the immunity extend to all the little sister and cousin and there be enough large girl to protect all the feminine part of the school with the boy master horner still have many a battle and whether with a view to this or as a economical ruse he never wear he coat in school say it be too warm perhaps it be a astute attention to the prejudice of he employer who love no man that do not earn he living by the sweat of he brow the shirt-sleeve give the idea of a manual-labor school in one sense at least it be evident that the master work and that afford a probability that the scholar work too master horner 's success be most triumphant that winter a year 's growth have improve he outward man exceedingly fill out the limb so that they do not remind you so forcibly of a young colt 's and supply the cheek with the flesh and blood so necessary where mustach be not worn experience have give he a degree of confidence and confidence give he power in short people say the master have wake up and so he have he actually set about read for improvement and although at the end of the term he could not quite make out from he historical study which side hannibal be on yet this be readily explain by the fact that he board round and be oblige to read generally by firelight surround by ungoverned child after this master horner make he own bargain when schooltime come round with the follow autumn and the teacher present himself for a third examination such a test be pronounced no longer necessary and the district consent to engage he at the astounding rate of sixteen dollar a month with the understanding that he be to have a fix home provide he be willing to allow a dollar a week for it master horner bethought he of the successive killing-time and consequent doughnut of the twenty family in which he have sojourn the year before and consent to the exaction behold we friend now as high as district teacher can ever hope to be -- he scholarship establish he home stationary and not revolving and the good behavior of the community insure by the fact that he be of age have now a farm to retire upon in case of any disgust master horner be at once the preëminent beau of the neighborhood spite of the prejudice against learn he brush he hair straight up in front and wear a sky-blue ribbon for a guard to he silver watch and walk as if the tall heel of he blunt boot be egg-shell and not leather yet he be far from neglect the duty of he place he be beau only on sunday and holiday very schoolmaster the rest of the time it be at a spelling-school that master horner first meet the educate eye of miss harriet bangle a young lady visit the englehart in we neighborhood she be from one of the town in western new york and have bring with she a variety of city air and grace somewhat caricatured set off with year-old french fashion much travesty whether she have be send out to the new country to try somewhat late a rustic chance for a establishment or whether she company have be find rather try at home we can not say the view which she be at some pain to make understand be that she friend have contrived this method of keep she out of the way of a desperate lover whose address be not acceptable to they if it should seem surprising that so high-bred a visitor should be sojourn in the wild wood it must be remember that more than one celebrated englishman and not a few distinguished american have farmer brother in the western country no whit less rustic in they exterior and manner of life than the plainest of they neighbor when these be visit by they refine kinsfolk we of the wood catch glimpse of the gay world or think we do that great medicine have with its tinct gilded -- many a vulgarism to the satisfaction of wiser head than ours miss bangle 's manner bespoke for she that high consideration which she feel to be she due yet she condescend to be amuse by the rustic and they awkward attempt at gaiety and elegance and to say truth few of the village merry-makings escape she though she wear always the air of great superiority the spelling-school be one of the ordinary winter amusement in the country it occur once in a fortnight or so and have power to draw out all the young people for mile round array in they best clothes and they holiday behavior when all be ready umpire be elect and after these have take the distinguished place usually occupy by the teacher the young people of the school choose the two best scholar to head the oppose class these leader choose they follower from the mass each call a name in turn until all the speller be rank on one side or the other line the side of the room and all stand the schoolmaster standing too take he spelling-book and give a placid yet awe-inspiring look along the rank remark that he intend to be very impartial and that he shall give out nothing _ that be not in the spelling-book _ for the first half hour or so he choose common and easy word that the spirit of the evening may not be damp by the too early thin of the class when a word be miss the blunderer have to sit down and be a spectator only for the rest of the evening at certain interval some of the best speaker mount the platform and speak a piece which be generally as declamatory as possible the excitement of this scene be equal to that afford by any city spectacle whatever and towards the close of the evening when difficult and unusual word be choose to confound the small number who still keep the floor it become scarcely less than painful when perhaps only one or two remain to be puzzle the master weary at last of he task though a favorite one try by trick to put down those whom he can not overcome in fair fight if among all the curious useless unheard-of word which may be pick out of the spelling-book he can not find one which the scholar have not notice he get the last head down by some quip or catch bay will perhaps be the sound one scholar spell it bey another bay while the master all the time mean ba which come within the rule be _ in the spelling-book _ it be on one of these occasion as we have say that miss bangle have come to the spelling-school to get material for a letter to a female friend first shone upon mr horner she be excessively amuse by he solemn air and puckered mouth and set he down at once as fair game yet she could not help become somewhat interested in the spelling-school and after it be over find she have not store up half as many of the schoolmaster 's point as she intend for the benefit of she correspondent in the evening 's contest a young girl from some few mile ' distance ellen kingsbury the only child of a substantial farmer have be the very last to sit down after a prolonged effort on the part of mr horner to puzzle she for the credit of he own school she blush and smile and blush again but spell on until mr horner 's cheek be crimson with excitement and some touch of shame that he should be baffle at he own weapon at length either by accident or design ellen miss a word and sink into she seat be number with the slay in the laugh and talk which follow -lrb- for with the conclusion of the spelling all form of a public assembly vanish -rrb- we schoolmaster say so many gallant thing to he fair enemy and appear so much animated by the excitement of the contest that miss bangle begin to look upon he with rather more respect and to feel somewhat indignant that a little rustic like ellen should absorb the entire attention of the only beau she put on therefore she most gracious aspect and mingle in the circle cause the schoolmaster to be present to she and do she best to fascinate he by certain air and grace which she have find successful elsewhere what game be too small for the close-woven net of a coquette mr horner quit not the fair ellen until he have hand she into she father 's sleigh and he then wend he way homewards never think that he ought to have escort miss bangle to she uncle 's though she certainly wait a little while for he return we must not follow into particulars the subsequent intercourse of we schoolmaster with the civilized young lady all that concern we be the result of miss bangle 's benevolent design upon he heart she try most sincerely to find its vulnerable spot meaning no doubt to put mr homer on he guard for the future and she be unfeignedly surprised to discover that she best effort be of no avail she conclude he must have take a counter-poison and she be not slow in guess its source she have observe the peculiar fire which light up he eye in the presence of ellen kingsbury and she bethink she of a plan which would ensure she some amusement at the expense of these impertinent rustic though in a manner different somewhat from she original more natural idea of simple coquetry a letter be write to master horner purport to come from ellen kingsbury word so artfully that the schoolmaster understand at once that it be intend to be a secret communication though its ostensible object be a inquiry about some ordinary affair this be lay in mr horner 's desk before he come to school with a intimation that he might leave a answer in a certain spot on the follow morning the bait take at once for mr horner honest and true himself and much smitten with the fair ellen be too happy to be circumspect the answer be duly place and as duly carry to miss bangle by she accomplice joe englehart a unlucky pickle who be always for ill never for good and who find no difficulty in obtain the letter unwatched since the master be oblige to be in school at nine and joe could always linger a few minute later this answer be open and laugh at miss bangle have only to contrive a rejoinder which be rather more particular in its tone than the original communication lead on yet again the happy schoolmaster who branch out into sentiment taffeta phrase silken term precise talk of hill and dale and rivulet and the pleasure of friendship and conclude by entreat a continuance of the correspondence another letter and another every one more flattering and encouraging than the last almost turn the sober head of we poor master and warm up he heart so effectually that he could scarcely attend to he business the spelling-school be remembered however and ellen kingsbury make one of the merry company but the latest letter have not forget to caution mr horner not to betray the intimacy so that he be in honor bind to restrict himself to the language of the eye hard as it be to forbear the single whisper for which he would have give he very dictionary so they meeting pass off without the explanation which miss bangle begin to fear would cut short she benevolent amusement the correspondence be resume with renew spirit and carry on until miss bangle though not overburdened with sensitiveness begin to be a little alarmed for the consequence of she malicious pleasantry she perceive that she herself have turn schoolmistress and that master horner instead of be merely she dupe have become she pupil too for the style of he reply have be constantly improve and the earnest and manly tone which he assume promise any thing but the quiet sheepish pocket of injury and insult upon which she have count in truth there be something deeper than vanity in the feeling with which he regard ellen kingsbury the encouragement which he suppose himself to have receive throw down the barrier which he extreme bashfulness would have interpose between himself and any one who possess charm enough to attract he and we must excuse he if in such a case he do not criticise the mode of encouragement but rather grasp eagerly the proffer good without a scruple or one which he would own to himself as to the propriety with which it be tender he be as much in love as a man can be and the seriousness of real attachment give both grace and dignity to he once awkward diction the evident determination of mr horner to come to the point of ask papa bring miss bangle to a very awkward pass she have expect to return home before matter have proceed so far but be oblige to remain some time longer she be equally afraid to go on and to leave off a _ dénouement _ be almost certain to ensue in either case thing stand thus when it be time to prepare for the grand exhibition which be to close the winter 's term this be a affair of too much magnitude to be fully describe in the small space yet remain in which to bring out we veracious history it must be slubber would o'er in haste -- its important preliminary leave to the cold imagination of the reader -- its fine spirit perhaps evaporate for want of be embody in word we can only say that we master whose school-life be to close with the term labor as man never before labor in such a cause resolute to trail a cloud of glory after he when he leave we not a candlestick nor a curtain that be attainable either by coax or bribery be leave in the village even the only piano that frail treasure be wile away and place in one corner of the rickety stage the most splendid of all the piece in the _ columbian orator _ the _ american speaker _ the -- but we must not enumerate -- in a word the most astounding and pathetic specimen of eloquence within ken of either teacher or scholar have be select for the occasion and several young lady and gentleman whose academical course have be happily conclude at a earlier period either at we own institution or at some other have consent to lend themselves to the part and they choicest decoration for the property of the dramatic portion of the entertainment among these last be pretty ellen kingsbury who have agree to personate the queen of scot in the garden scene from schiller 's tragedy of _ mary stuart _ and this circumstance accidentally afford master horner the opportunity he have so long desire of see he fascinating correspondent without the presence of peer eye a dress-rehearsal occupy the afternoon before the day of day and the pathetic expostulation of the lovely mary -- mine all doth hang -- my life -- my destiny -- upon my word -- upon the force of tear -- aid by the long veil and the emotion which sympathy bring into ellen 's countenance prove too much for the enforced prudence of master horner when the rehearsal be over and the hero and heroine be to return home it be find that by a stroke of witty invention not new in the country the harness of mr kingsbury 's horse have be cut in several place he whip hide he buffalo-skin spread on the ground and the sleigh turn bottom upward on they this afford a excuse for the master 's borrow a horse and sleigh of somebody and claim the privilege of take miss ellen home while she father return with only aunt sally and a great bag of bran from the mill -- companion about equally interesting here then be the golden opportunity so long wish for here be the power of ascertain at once what be never quite certain until we have hear it from warm living lip whose testimony be strengthen by glance in which the whole soul speak or -- seem to speak the time be short for the sleigh be but too fine and father kingsbury have tie up he harness and collect he scattered equipment be drive so close behind that there be no possibility of linger for a moment yet many moment be lose before mr horner very much in earnest and all unhackney in matter of this sort could find a word in which to clothe he new-found feeling the horse seem to fly -- the distance be half past -- and at length in absolute despair of anything better he blurt out at once what he have determine to avoid -- a direct reference to the correspondence a game at cross-purposes ensue exclamation and explanation and denial and apology fill up the time which be to have make master horner so blest the light from mr kingsbury 's window shine upon the path and the whole result of this conference so long for be a burst of tear from the perplexed and mortified ellen who spring from mr horner 's attempt to detain she rush into the house without vouchsafe he a word of adieu and leave he stand no bad personification of orpheus after the last hopeless flitting of he eurydice will not you ` light master say mr kingsbury yes -- no -- thank you -- good evening stammer poor master horner so stupefy that even aunt sally call he a dummy the horse take the sleigh against the fence go home and throw out the master who scarcely recollect the accident while to ellen the issue of this unfortunate drive be a sleepless night and so high a fever in the morning that we village doctor be call to mr kingsbury 's before breakfast poor master horner 's distress may hardly be imagine disappointed bewildered cut to the quick yet as much in love as ever he could only in bitter silence turn over in he thought the issue of he cherish dream now persuade himself that ellen 's denial be the effect of a sudden bashfulness now inveigh against the fickleness of the sex as all man do when they be angry with any one woman in particular but he exhibition must go on in spite of wretchedness and he go about mechanically talk of curtain and candle and music and attitude and pause and emphasis look like a somnambulist whose eye be open but they sense be shut and often surprising those concern by the utter unfitness of he answer it be almost evening when mr kingsbury have discover through the intervention of the doctor and aunt sally the cause of ellen 's distress make he appearance before the unhappy eye of master horner angry solemn and determine take the schoolmaster apart and require a explanation of he treatment of he daughter in vain do the perplexed lover ask for time to clear himself declare he respect for miss ellen and he willingness to give every explanation which she might require the father be not to be put off and though excessively reluctant mr horner have no resource but to show the letter which alone could account for he strange discourse to ellen he unlock he desk slowly and unwillingly while the old man 's impatience be such that he could scarcely forbear thrust in he own hand to snatch at the papers which be to explain this vexatious mystery what could equal the utter confusion of master horner and the contemptuous anger of the father when no letter be to be find mr kingsbury be too passionate to listen to reason or to reflect for one moment upon the irreproachable good name of the schoolmaster he go away in inexorable wrath threaten every practicable visitation of public and private justice upon the head of the offender whom he accuse of have attempt to trick he daughter into a entanglement which should result in he favor a doleful exhibition be this last one of we thrice approve and most worthy teacher stern necessity and the power of habit enable he to go through with most of he part but where be the proud fire which have light up he eye on similar occasion before he sit as one of three judge before whom the unfortunate robert emmet be drag in he shirt-sleeve by two fierce-looking official but the chief judge look far more like a criminal than do the proper representative he ought to have personate othello but be oblige to excuse himself from rave for the handkerchief the handkerchief on the rather anomalous plea of a bad cold _ mary stuart _ be i ' the bond be anxiously expect by the impatient crowd and it be with distress amounting to agony that the master be oblige to announce in person the necessity of omit that part of the representation on account of the illness of one of the young lady scarcely have the word be utter and the speaker hide he burning face behind the curtain when mr kingsbury start up in he place amid the throng to give a public recital of he grievance -- no uncommon resort in the new country he dash at once to the point and before some friend who see the utter impropriety of he proceeding could persuade he to defer he vengeance he have lay before the assembly -- some three hundred people perhaps -- he own statement of the case he be get out at last half coaxed half hustle and the gentle public only half understand what have be set forth thus unexpectedly make quite a pretty row of it some clamor loudly for the conclusion of the exercise other give utterance in no particularly choice term to a variety of opinion as to the schoolmaster 's proceedings vary the note occasionally by shout the letter the letter why do not you bring out the letter at length by means of much rap on the desk by the president of the evening who be fortunately a popular character order be partially restore and the favorite scene from miss more 's dialogue of david and goliath be announce as the closing piece the sight of little david in a white tunic edge with red tape with a calico scrip and a very primitive-looking sling and a huge goliath decorate with a militia belt and sword and a spear like a weaver 's beam indeed enchain everybody 's attention even the peccant schoolmaster and he pretended letter be forget while the sapient goliath every time that he raise the spear in the energy of he declamation to thump upon the stage pick away fragment of the low ceiling which fall conspicuously on he great shock of black hair at last with the crowning threat up go the spear for a astounding thump and down come a large piece of the ceiling and with it -- a shower of letter the confusion that ensue beggar all description a general scramble take place and in another moment twenty pair of eye at least be feast on the choice phrase lavish upon mr horner miss bangle have sit through the whole previous scene tremble for herself although she have as she suppose guard cunningly against exposure she have need no prophet to tell she what must be the result of a tête-à-tête between mr horner and ellen and the moment she see they drive off together she induce she imp to seize the opportunity of abstract the whole parcel of letter from mr horner 's desk which he do by means of a sort of skill which come by nature to such goblin pick the lock by the aid of a crooked nail as neatly as if he have be bear within the shadow of the tomb but magician sometimes suffer severely from the malice with which they have themselves inspire they familiar joe englehart have be a convenient tool thus far think it quite time to torment miss bangle a little so have steal the letter at she bidding he hide they on he own account and no persuasion of hers could induce he to reveal this important secret which he choose to reserve as a rod in case she refuse he some intercession with he father or some other accommodation render necessary by he mischievous habit he have conceal the precious parcel in the unfloored loft above the school-room a place accessible only by means of a small trap-door without staircase or ladder and here he mean to have keep they while it suit he purpose but for the untimely intrusion of the weaver 's beam miss bangle have sit through all as we have say think the letter safe yet vow vengeance against she confederate for not allow she to secure they by a satisfactory conflagration and it be not until she hear she own name whisper through the crowd that she be awaken to she true situation the sagacity of the low creature whom she have despise show they at once that the letter must be hers since she character have be pretty shrewdly guess and the handwriting wear a more practiced air than be usual among female in the country this be first take for grant and then speak of as a acknowledged fact the assembly move like the heaving of a troubled sea everybody feel that this be everybody 's business put she out be hear from more than one rough voice near the door and this be respond to by loud and angry murmur from within mr englehart not wait to inquire into the merit of the case in this scene of confusion hasten to get he family out as quietly and as quickly as possible but groan and hiss follow he niece as she hang half-fainting on he arm quail completely beneath the instinctive indignation of the rustic public as she pass out a yell resound among the rude boy about the door and she be lift into a sleigh insensible from terror she disappear from that evening and no one know the time of she final departure for the east mr kingsbury who be a just man when he be not in a passion make all the reparation in he power for he harsh and ill-considered attack upon the master and we believe that functionary do not show any trait of implacability of character at least he be see not many day after sit peaceably at tea with mr kingsbury aunt sally and miss ellen and he have since go home to build a house upon he farm and people _ do _ say that after a few month more ellen will not need miss

stranger have send a excuse almost at the eleventh hour i think no inducement however strong could tempt I to do so myself i confess that you be perfectly right say mr st leonard i see you must go to mr watkinson but can you not divide the evening by pass a part of it with she and then finish with I at this suggestion the eye of the young people sparkle for they have become delighted with mr st

evidence say edward how superior we woman of fashion be to those of europe wait my dear son say mr morland till you have be in europe and have a opportunity of form a opinion on that point -lrb- as on many other -rrb- from actual observation for my part i believe that in all civilized country the upper class of people be very much alike at least in they lead characteristic ah here come the man that be send to mr watkinson say caroline morland i hope he could not find the house and have bring the note back with he we shall then be able to go at first to mr st leonard 's and pass the whole evening there the man report that he _ have _ find the house and have deliver the note into mr watkinson 's own hand as she chance to be cross the entry when the door be open and that she read it immediately and say very well be you certain that you make no mistake in the house say edward and that you really _ do _ give it to mr watkinson and it be quite sure i be sir reply the man when i first come over

she the billy-dux be ` very well jame ' come come say edward when they find themselves alone let we look on the bright side if we do not find a large party at mr watkinson 's we may in all probability meet some very agreeable people there and enjoy the feast of reason and the flow of soul we may find the watkinson house so pleasant as to leave it with regret even for mr st leonard 's i do not believe mr watkinson be in fashionable society say caroline or mr st leonard would have know she i hear some of the lady here talk last evening of mr st leonard and i find from what they say that she be among the _ élite _ of the _ lite _ even if she be observe mr morland be polish of manners and cultivation of mind confine exclusively to person of that class certainly not say edward the most talented and refined youth at we college and he in whose society i find the greatest pleasure be the son of a bricklayer in the lady ' drawing-room after dinner the morland hear a conversation between several of the female guest who all seem to know mr st leonard very well by reputation and they talk of she party that be to come off on this evening i hear say one lady that mr st leonard be to have a unusual number of lion she then proceed to name a gallant general with he elegant wife and accomplished daughter a celebrated commander in the navy two highly distinguish member of congress and even a ex-president also several of the most eminent among the american literati and two first-rate artist edward morland feel as if he could say have i three ear i would hear thee such a woman as mr st leonard can always command the best lion that be to be find observe another lady and then say a third i have be tell that she have such exquisite taste in lighting and embellish she always elegant room and she supper table whether for summer or winter party be so beautifully arrange all the viand be so delicious and the attendance of the servant so perfect -- and mr st leonard do the honor with so much ease and tact some friend of mine that visit she say a fourth lady describe she party as absolute perfection she always manage to bring together those person that be best fit to enjoy each other 's conversation still no one be overlook or neglect then everything at she reunion be so well proportion -- she have just enough of music and just enough of whatever amusement may add to the pleasure of she guest and still there be no appearance of design or management on she part and better than all say the lady who have speak first mr st leonard be one of the kindest most generous and most benevolent of woman -- she do good in every possible way i can listen no longer say caroline to edward rise to change she seat if i hear any more i shall absolutely hate the watkinson how provoke that they should have send we the first invitation if we have only think of wait till we could hear from mrs st leonard for shame caroline say she brother how can you talk so of person you have never see and to whom you ought to feel grateful for the kindness of they invitation even if it have interfere with another party that i must confess seem to offer unusual attraction now i have a presentiment that we shall find the watkinson part of the evening very enjoyable as soon as tea be over mr morland and she daughter repair to they toilette fortunately fashion as well as good taste have decide that at a summer party the costume of the lady should never go beyond a elegant simplicity therefore we two lady in prepare for they intended appearance at mr st leonard 's be enable to attire themselves in a manner that would not seem out of place in the smaller company they expect to meet at the watkinson over a under-dress of lawn caroline morland put on a white organdy trim with lace and decorate with bow of pink ribbon at the back of she head be a wreath of fresh and beautiful pink flower tie with a similar ribbon mr morland wear a black grenadine over a satin and a lace cap trim with white it be but a quarter past nine o'clock when they carriage stop at the watkinson door the front of the house look very dark not a ray gleam through the venetian shutter and the glimmer beyond the fan-light over the door be almost imperceptible after the coachman have ring several time a irish girl open the door cautiously -lrb- as irish girl always do -rrb- and admit they into the entry where one light only be burn in a branch lamp shall we go upstairs say mr morland and what for would ye go upstairs say the girl in a pert tone it be all dark there and there be no preparation ye can lave you thing here a-hang on the rack it be a party ye be expect bless be they what expect nothing the sanguine edward morland look rather blank at this intelligence and he sister whisper to he we 'll get off to mr st leonard 's as soon as we possibly can when do you tell the coachman to come for we at half past ten be the brother 's reply oh edward edward she exclaim and i dare say he will not be punctual he may keep we here till eleven _ courage me enfant _ say they mother _ et parlez plus doucement _ the girl then usher they into the back parlor say here be the company the room be large and gloomy a checquered mat cover the floor and all the furniture be encase in striped calico cover and the lamp mirror etc conceal under green gauze the front parlor be entirely dark and in the back apartment be no other light than a shaded lamp on a large center table round which be assemble a circle of child of all size and age on a backless cushionless sofa sit mr watkinson and a young lady whom she introduce as she daughter jane and mr morland in return present edward and caroline will you take the rocking-chair ma'am inquire mr watkinson mr morland decline the offer the hostess take it herself and see-saw on it nearly the whole time it be a very awkward high-legged crouch-backed rocking-chair and shamefully unprovided with anything in the form of a footstool my husband be away at boston on business say mr watkinson i think at first ma'am i should not be able to ask you here this evening for it be not we way to have company in he absence but my daughter jane over-persuade I to send for you what a pity think caroline you must take we as you find we ma'am continued mr watkinson we use no ceremony with anybody and we rule be never to put ourselves out of the way we do not give party -lrb- look at the dress of the lady -rrb- we first duty be to we child and we can not waste we substance on fashion and folly they 'll have cause to thank we for it when we die something like a sob be hear from the center table at which the child be sit and a boy be see to hold he handkerchief to he face joseph my child say he mother do not cry you have no idea ma'am what a extraordinary boy that be you see how the bare mention of such a thing as we death have overcome he there be another sob behind the handkerchief and the morland think it now sound very much like a smother laugh as i be say ma'am continue mr watkinson we never give party we leave all sinful thing to the vain and foolish my daughter jane have be tell I that she hear this morning of a party that be go on tonight at the widow st leonard 's it be only fifteen year since she husband die he be carry off with a three day ' illness but two month after they be marry i have have a domestic that

how i pity she thank heaven nobody that i know go to she party if they do i would never wish to see they again in my house it be a encouragement to folly and nonsense -- and folly and nonsense be sinful do not you think so ma'am if carry too far they may certainly become so reply mr morland we have hear say edward that mr st leonard though one of the ornament of the gay world have a kind heart a beneficent spirit and a liberal hand i know very little about she reply mr watkinson draw up she head and i have not the least desire to know any more it be well she have no child they would be lose sheep if bring up in she fold for my part ma'am she continue turn to mr morland i be quite satisfied with the quiet joy of a happy home and no mother have the least business with any other pleasure my innocent babe know nothing about play and ball and party and they never shall do they look as if they have be accustom to a life of pleasure they certainly do not for when the morland take a glance at they they think they have never see youthful face that be less gay and indeed less prepossessing there be not a good feature or a pleasant expression among they all edward morland recollect he have often read that childhood be always lovely but he see that the juvenile watkinson be a exception to the rule the first duty of a mother be to she child repeat mr watkinson till nine o'clock my daughter jane and myself be occupy every evening in hear the lesson that they have learn for to-morrow 's school before that hour we can receive no visitor and we never have company to tea as that would interfere too much with we duty we have just finish hear these lesson when you arrive afterwards the child be permit to indulge themselves in rational play for i permit no amusement that be not also instructive my child be so well train that even when alone they sport be always serious two of the boy glance slyly at each other with what edward morland comprehend as a expression of pitch-penny and marble they be now engage at they game of astronomy continue mr watkinson they have also a sort of geography card and a set of mathematical card it be a bless discovery the invention of these educationary game so that even the play-time of child can be turn to account and you have no idea ma'am how they enjoy they just then the boy joseph rise from the table and stalk up to mr watkinson say to she mamma please to whip I at this unusual request the visitor look much amaze and mr watkinson reply to he whip you my best joseph -- for what cause i have not see you do anything wrong this evening and you know my anxiety induce I to watch my child all the time you could not see I answer joseph for i have not _ do _ anything very wrong but i have have a bad thought and you know mr ironrule say that a fault imagine be just as wicked as a fault commit you see ma'am what a good memory he have say mr watkinson aside to mr morland but my best joseph you make you mother tremble what fault have you imagine what be you bad thought ay say another boy what be you thought like my thought say joseph be ` confound all astronomy and i could see the man hang that make this game ' oh my child exclaim the mother stop she ear i be indeed shocked i be glad you repent so immediately yes return joseph but i be afraid my repentance will not last if i be not whip i may have these bad thought whenever i play at astronomy and worse still at the geography game whip I ma and punish I as i deserve there be the rattan in the corner : i 'll bring it to you myself excellent boy say he mother you know i always pardon my child when they be so candid as to confess they fault so you do say joseph but a whipping will cure I better i can not resolve to punish so conscientious a child say mr watkinson shall i take the trouble off you hand inquire edward lose all patience in he disgust at the sanctimonious hypocrisy of this young blifil it be such a rarity for a boy to request a whipping that so remarkable a desire ought by all means to be gratify joseph turn round and make a face at he give I the rattan say edward half laughing and offer to take it out of he hand i 'll use it to you full satisfaction the boy think it most prudent to stride off and return to the table and ensconce himself among he brother and sister some of whom be stare with stupid surprise other be whisper and giggle in the hope of see joseph get a real flogging mr watkinson have bestow a bitter look on edward hasten to turn the attention of he mother to something else mr morland say she allow I to introduce you to my youngest hope she point to a sleepy boy about five year old who with head throw back and mouth wide open be slumber in he chair mr watkinson 's child be of that uncomfortable species who never go to bed at least never without all manner of resistance all she boast authority be inadequate to compel they they never would confess themselves sleepy always want to sit up and there be a nightly scene of scold coax threatening and manoeuvring to get they off i declare say mr watkinson dear benny be almost asleep shake he up christopher i want he to speak a speech he school-mistress take great pain in teach she little pupil to speak and stand up herself and show they how the child have be shake up hard -lrb- two or three other help christopher -rrb- rub he eye and begin to whine he mother go to he take he on she lap hush he up and begin to coax he this do she stand he on he foot before mr morland and desire he to speak a speech for the company the child put he thumb into he mouth and remain silent ma say jane watkinson you have better tell he what speech to speak speak cato or plato say he mother which do you call it come now benny -- how do it begin ` you be quite right and reasonable plato ' that be it speak lucius say he sister jane come now benny -- say ` you thought be turn on peace ' the little boy look very much as if they be _ not _ and as if meditate a outbreak no no exclaimed christopher let he say hamlet come now benny -- ` to be or not to be ' it be not to be at all cry benny and i will not speak the least bit of it for any of you i hate that speech only see he obstinacy say the solemn joseph and be he to be give up to speak anything benny say mr watkinson anything so that it be only a speech all the watkinson voice now begin to clamor violently at the obstinate child -- speak a speech speak a speech speak a speech but they have no more effect than the reiterate exhortation with which nurse confuse the poor head of baby when they require they to shake a day-day -- shake a day-day mr morland now interfere and beg that the sleepy little boy might be excuse on which he scream out that he be not sleepy at all and would not go to bed ever i never know any of my child behave so before say mr watkinson they be always model of obedience ma'am a look be sufficient for they and i must say that they have in every way profit by the education we be give they it be not we way ma'am to waste we money in party and foolery and fine furniture and fine clothes and rich food and all such abomination we first duty be to we child and to make they learn everything that be teach in the school if they go wrong it will not be for want of education hester my dear come and talk to miss morland in french hester -lrb- unlike she little brother that would not speak a speech -rrb- step boldly forward and address caroline morland with : _ parlez-vous français mademoiselle comment se va madame votre mère aimez-vous la musique aimez-vous la danse bon jour -- bon soir -- bon repos comprenez-vous _ to this tirade utter with great volubility miss morland make no other reply than _ ouus -- je compren _ very well hester -- very well indeed say mr watkinson you see ma'am turn to mr morland how very fluent she be in french and she have only be learn eleven quarter after considerable whispering between jane and she mother the former withdraw and send in by the irish girl a waiter with a basket of soda biscuit a pitcher of water and some glass mr watkinson invite she guest to consider themselves at home and help themselves freely say : we never let cake sweetmeat confectionery or any such thing enter the house as they would be very unwholesome for the child and it would be sinful to put temptation in they way i be sure ma'am you will agree with I that the plainest food be the best for everybody people that want nice thing may go to party for they but they will never get any with I when the collation be over and every child provide with a biscuit mr watkinson say to mr morland : now ma'am you shall have some music from my daughter jane who be one of mr bangwhanger 's best scholar jane watkinson sit down to the piano and commence a powerful piece of six mortal page which she play out of time and out of tune but with tremendous force of hand notwithstanding which it have however the good effect of put most of the child to sleep to the morland the evening have seem already five hour long still it be only half past ten when jane be in the midst of she piece the guest have all tacitly determine that it would be best not to let mr watkinson know they intention to go directly from she house to mr st leonard 's party and the arrival of they carriage would have be the signal of departure even if jane 's piece have not reach its termination they steal glance at the clock on the mantel it want but a quarter of eleven when jane rise from the piano and be congratulate by she mother on the excellence of she music still no carriage be hear to stop no doorbell be hear to ring mr morland express she fear that the coachman have forget to come for they have he be pay for bring you here ask mrs watkinson i pay he when we come to the door say edward i think perhaps he might want the money for some purpose before he come for we that be very kind in you sir say mr watkinson but not very wise there be no dependence on any coachman and perhaps as he may be sure of business enough this rainy night he may never come at all -- be already pay for bring you here now the truth be that the coachman _ have _ come at the appoint time but the noise of jane 's piano have prevent he arrival be hear in the back parlor the irish girl have go to the door when he ring the bell and recognize in he what she call a ould friend just then a lady and gentleman who have be catch in the rain come run along and see a carriage draw up at a door the gentleman inquire of the driver if he could not take they to rutger place the driver reply that he have just come for two lady and a gentleman whom he have bring from the astor house indeed and patrick say the girl who stand at the door if i be you i would be after make another penny to-night miss jane be pound away at one of she long music piece and it will not be over before you have time to get to rutger and back again and if you do make they wait awhile where 's the harm they have a dry roof over they head and i warrant it be not the first wait they have ever have in they life and it will not be the last neither exactly so say the gentleman and regardless of the propriety of first send to consult the person who have engage the carriage he tell he wife to step in and follow she instantly himself they drive away to rutger place reader if you be ever detain in a strange house by the non-arrival of you carriage you will easily understand the excessive annoyance of find that you be keep a family out of they bed beyond they usual hour and in this case there be a double grievance the guest be all impatience to get off to a better place the child all cry when waken from they sleep be finally take to bed by two servant maid and jane watkinson who never come back again none be leave but hester the great french scholar who be one of those young imp that seem to have the faculty of living without sleep sit bolt upright with she eye wide open watch the uncomfortable visitor the morland feel as if they could bear it no longer and edward propose send for another carriage to the nearest livery stable we do not keep a man now say mr watkinson who sit nod in the rocking-chair attempt now and then a snatch of conversation and say ma'am still more frequently than usual man servant be dreadful trial ma'am and we give they up three year ago and i do not know how mary or katy be to go out this stormy night in search of a livery stable on no consideration could i allow the woman to do so reply edward if you will oblige I by the loan of a umbrella i will go myself accordingly he set out on this business but be unsuccessful at two livery stable the carriage be all out at last he find one and be drive in it to mr watkinson 's house where he mother and sister be await he all quite ready with they calash and shawl on they gladly take they leave mr watkinson rouse herself to hope they have spend a pleasant evening and that they would come and pass another with she on they return to new york in such case how difficult it be to reply even with what be call word of course a kitchen lamp be bring to light they to the door the entry lamp have long since be extinguish fortunately the rain have cease the star begin to reappear and the morland when they find themselves in the carriage and on they way to mr st leonard 's feel as if they could breathe again as may be suppose they freely discuss the annoyance of the evening but now those trouble be over they feel rather incline to be merry about they dear mother say edward how i pitied you for have to endure mr watkinson 's perpetual ` ma'ame ' and ` ma'ame ' for i know you dislike the word i wish say caroline i be not so prone to be take with ridiculous recollection but really to-night i could not get that old foolish child 's play out of my head -- here come three knight out of spain a-courting of you daughter jane _ i _ shall certainly never be one of those spanish knight say edward she daughter jane be in no danger of be rule by any ` flattering tongue ' of mine but what a shame for we to be talk of they in this manner they drive to mr st leonard 's hope to be yet in time to pass half a hour there though it be now near twelve o'clock and summer party never continue to a very late hour but as they come into the street in which she live they be meet by a number of coach on they way home and on reach the door of she brilliantly light mansion they see the last of the guest drive off in the last of the carriage and several musician come down the step with they instrument in they hand so there _ have _ be a dance then sigh caroline oh what we have miss it be really too provoke so it be say edward but remember that to-morrow morning we set off for niagara i will leave a note for mr st leonard say he mother explain that we be detain at mr watkinson 's by we coachman disappointing we let we console ourselves with the hope of see more of this lady on we return and now dear caroline you must draw a moral from the untoward event of to-day when you be mistress of a house and wish to show civility to stranger let the invitation be always accompany with a frank disclosure of what they be to expect and if you can not conveniently invite company to meet they tell they at once that you will not insist on they keep they engagement with _ you _ if anything offer afterwards that they think they would prefer provide only that they apprize you in time of the change in they plan oh mamma reply caroline you may be sure i shall always take care not to betray my visitor into a engagement which they may have cause to regret particularly if they be stranger whose time be limited i shall certainly as you say tell they not to consider themselves bind to I if they afterwards receive a invitation which promise they more enjoyment it will be a long while before i forget the watkinson evening titbottom 's spectacles by george william curti -lrb- 1824-1892 -rrb- -lrb- from _ putnam 's monthly _ December 1854 republish in the volume _ prue and i _ -lrb- 1856 -rrb- by george william curti -lrb- harper & brother -rrb- -rrb- in my mind 's eye horatio prue and i do not entertain much we means forbid it in truth other people entertain for we we enjoy that hospitality of which no account be make we see the show and hear the music and smell the flower of great festivity tasting as it be the dripping from rich dish we own dinner service be remarkably plain we dinner even on state occasion be strictly in keep and almost we only guest be titbottom i buy a handful of rose as i come up from the office perhaps and prue arrange they so prettily in a glass dish for the center of the table that even when i have hurry out to see aurelia step into she carriage to go out to dine i have think that the bouquet she carry be not more beautiful because it be more costly i grant that it be more harmonious with she superb beauty and she rich attire and i have no doubt that if aurelium know the old man whom she must have see so often watch she and he wife who ornament she sex with as much sweetness although with less splendor than aurelium herself she would also acknowledge that the nosegay of rose be as fine and fit upon they table as she own sumptuous bouquet be for herself i have that faith in the perception of that lovely lady it be at least my habit -- i hope i may say my nature to believe the best of people rather than the worst if i think that all this sparkling setting of beauty -- this fine fashion -- these blaze jewel and lustrous silk and airy gauze embellish with gold-threaded embroidery and work in a thousand exquisite elaboration so that i can not see one of those lovely girl pass I by without thank god for the vision -- if i think that this be all and that underneath she lace flounce and diamond bracelet aurelium be a sullen selfish woman then i should turn sadly homewards for i should see that she jewel be flash scorn upon the object they adorn and that she lace be of a more exquisite loveliness than the woman whom they merely touch with a superficial grace it would be like a gaily decorate mausoleum -- bright to see but silent and dark within great excellence my dear prue i sometimes allow myself to say lie conceal in the depths of character like pearl at the bottom of the sea under the laughing glance surface how little they be suspect perhaps love be nothing else than the sight of they by one person hence every man 's mistress be apt to be a enigma to everybody else i have no doubt that when aurelium be engage people will say that she be a most admirable girl certainly but they can not understand why any man should be in love with she as if it be at all necessary that they should and she lover like a boy who find a pearl in the public street and wonder as much that other do not see it as that he do will tremble until he know he passion be return feeling of course that the whole world must be in love with this paragon who can not possibly smile upon anything so unworthy as he i hope therefore my dear mr prue i continue to say to my wife who look up from she work regard I with pleased pride as if i be such a irresistible humorist you will allow I to believe that the depth may be calm although the surface be dance if you tell I that aurelium be but a giddy girl i shall believe that you think so but i shall know all the while what profound dignity and sweetness and peace lie at the foundation of she character i say such thing to titbottom during the dull season at the office and i have know he sometimes to reply with a kind of dry sad humor not as if he enjoy the joke but as if the joke must be make that he see no reason why i should be dull because the season be so and what do i know of aurelium or any other girl he say to I with that abstracted air i whose aurelia be of another century and another zone then he fall into a silence which it seem quite profane to interrupt but as we sit upon we high stool at the desk opposite each other i lean upon my elbow and look at he he with sidelong face glance out of the window as if it command a boundless landscape instead of a dim dingy office court i can not refrain from say : well he turn slowly and i go chat on -- a little too loquacious perhaps about those young girl but i know that titbottom regard such a excess as venial for he sadness be so sweet that you could believe it the reflection of a smile from long long year ago one day after i have be talk for a long time and we have put up we book and be prepare to leave he stand for some time by the window gaze with a droop intentness as if he really see something more than the dark court and say slowly : perhaps you would have different impression of thing if you see they through my spectacles there be no change in he expression he still look from the window and i say : titbottom i do not know that you use glass i have never see you wear spectacles no i do not often wear they i be not very fond of look through they but sometimes a irresistible necessity compel I to put they on and i can not help see titbottom sigh be it so grievous a fate to see inquire i yes through my spectacles he say turn slowly and look at I with wan solemnity it grow dark as we stand in the office talking and take we hat we go out together the narrow street of business be desert the heavy iron shutter be gloomily close over the window from one or two office struggle the dim gleam of a early candle by whose light some perplexed accountant sit belated and hunting for he error a careless clerk pass whistle but the great tide of life have ebb we hear its roar far away and the sound steal into that silent street like the murmur of the ocean into a inland dell you will come and dine with we titbottom he assent by continue to walk with I and i think we be both glad when we reach the house and prue come to meet we say : do you know i hope you would bring mr titbottom to dine titbottom smile gently and answer : he might have bring he spectacles with he and i have be a happier man for it prue look a little puzzle my dear i say you must know that we friend mr titbottom be the happy possessor of a pair of wonderful spectacles i have never see they indeed and from what he say i should be rather afraid of be see by they most short-sighted person be very glad to have the help of glass but mr titbottom seem to find very little pleasure in he it be because they make he too far-sighted perhaps interrupted prue quietly as she take the silver soup-ladle from the sideboard we sip we wine after dinner and prue take she work can a man be too far-sighted i do not ask the question aloud the very tone in which prue have speak convinced I that he might at least i say mr titbottom will not refuse to tell we the history of he mysterious spectacles i have know plenty of magic in eye -- and i glance at the tender blue eye of prue -- but i have not hear of any enchanted glass yet you must have see the glass in which you wife look every morning and i take it that glass must be daily enchant say titbottom with a bow of quaint respect to my wife i do not think i have see such a blush upon prue 's cheek since -- well since a great many year ago i will gladly tell you the history of my spectacles begin titbottom it be very simple and i be not at all sure that a great many other people have not a pair of the same kind i have never indeed hear of they by the gross like those of we young friend mose the son of the vicar of wakefield in fact i think a gross would be quite enough to supply the world it be a kind of article for which the demand do not increase with use if we should all wear spectacles like mine we should never smile any more oh -- i be not quite sure -- we should all be very happy a very important difference say prue count she stitch you know my grandfather titbottom be a west indian a large proprietor and a easy man he bask in the tropical sun lead he quiet luxurious life he live much alone and be what people call eccentric by which i understand that he be very much himself and refuse the influence of other people they have they little revenge and call he name it be a habit not exclusively tropical i think i have see the same thing even in this city but he be greatly beloved -- my bland and bountiful grandfather he be so large-hearted and open-handed he be so friendly and thoughtful and genial that even he joke have the air of graceful benediction he do not seem to grow old and he be one of those who never appear to have be very young he flourish in a perennial maturity a immortal middle-age my grandfather live upon one of the small island st kit 's perhaps and he domain extend to the sea he house a rambling west indian mansion be surround with deep spacious piazza cover with luxurious lounge among which one capacious chair be he peculiar seat they tell I he use sometimes to sit there for the whole day he great soft brown eye fasten upon the sea watch the speck of sail that flash upon the horizon while the evanescent expression chase each other over he placid face as if it reflect the calm and change sea before he he morning costume be a ample dressing-gown of gorgeously flowered silk and he morning be very apt to last all day he rarely read but he would pace the great piazza for hour with he hand sunken in the pocket of he dressing-gown and a air of sweet reverie which any author might be very happy to produce society of course he see little there be some slight apprehension that if he be bid to social entertainment he might forget he coat or arrive without some other essential part of he dress and there be a sly tradition in the titbottom family that have be invite to a ball in honor of the new governor of the island my grandfather titbottom saunter into the hall towards midnight wrap in the gorgeous flower of he dressing-gown and with he hand bury in the pocket as usual there be great excitement and immense deprecation of gubernatorial ire but it happen that the governor and my grandfather be old friend and there be no offense but as they be converse together one of the distressed manager cast indignant glance at the brilliant costume of my grandfather who summon he and ask courteously : ` do you invite I or my coat ' ` you in a proper coat ' reply the manager the governor smile approvingly and look at my grandfather ` my friend say he to the manager ' i beg you pardon i forget ' the next day my grandfather be see promenade in full ball dress along the street of the little town ` they ought to know ' say he ` that i have a proper coat and that not contempt nor poverty but forgetfulness send I to a ball in my dressing-gown ' he do not much frequent social festival after this failure but he always tell the story with satisfaction and a quiet smile to a stranger life upon those little island be uniform even to weariness but the old native don like my grandfather ripen in the prolonged sunshine like the turtle upon the bahama bank nor know of existence more desirable life in the tropics i take to be a placid torpidity during the long warm morning of nearly half a century my grandfather titbottom have sit in he dressing-gown and gaze at the sea but one calm June day as he slowly pace the piazza after breakfast he dreamy glance be arrest by a little vessel evidently near the shore he call for he spyglass and survey the craft see that she come from the neighboring island she glide smoothly slowly over the summer sea the warm morning air be sweet with perfume and silent with heat the sea sparkle languidly and the brilliant blue hung cloudlessly over score of little island vessel have my grandfather see come over the horizon and cast anchor in the port hundred of summer morning have the white sail flash and fade like vague face through forget dream but this time he lay down the spyglass and lean against a column of the piazza and watch the vessel with a intentness that he could not explain she come nearer and nearer a graceful spectre in the dazzling morning ` decidedly i must step down and see about that vessel ' say my grandfather titbottom he gather he ample dressing-gown about he and step from the piazza with no other protection from the sun than the little smoking cap upon he head he face wear a calm beam smile as if he approve of all the world he be not a old man but there be almost a patriarchal pathos in he expression as he saunter along in the sunshine towards the shore a group of idle gazer be collect to watch the arrival the little vessel furl she sail and drift slowly landward and as she be of very light draft she come close to the shelve shore a long plank be put out from she side and the debarkation commence my grandfather titbottom stand look on to see the passenger descend there be but a few of they and mostly trader from the neighboring island but suddenly the face of a young girl appear over the side of the vessel and she step upon the plank to descend my grandfather titbottom instantly advance and move briskly reach the top of the plank at the same moment and with the old tassel of he cap flash in the sun and one hand in the pocket of he dress gown with the other he hand the young lady carefully down the plank that young lady be afterwards my grandmother titbottom and so over the gleaming sea which he have watch so long and which seem thus to reward he patient gaze come he bride that sunny morning ` of course we be happy ' he use to say : ` for you be the gift of the sun i have love so long and so well ' and my grandfather titbottom would lay he hand so tenderly upon the golden hair of he young bride that you could fancy he a devout parsee caress sunbeam there be endless festivity upon occasion of the marriage and my grandfather do not go to one of they in he dressing-gown the gentle sweetness of he wife melt every heart into love and sympathy he be much older than she without doubt but age as he use to say with a smile of immortal youth be a matter of feeling not of year and if sometimes as she sit by he side upon the piazza she fancy look through she eye upon that summer sea and see a younger lover perhaps some one of those graceful and glowing hero who occupy the foreground of all young maiden ' vision by the sea yet she could not find one more generous and gracious nor fancy one more worthy and loving than my grandfather titbottom and if in the moonlit midnight while he lay calmly sleep she lean out of the window and sink into vague reverie of sweet possibility and watch the gleaming path of the moonlight upon the water until the dawn glide over it -- it be only that mood of nameless regret and longing which underlie all human happiness -- or it be the vision of that life of society which she have never see but of which she have often read and which look very fair and alluring across the sea to a girlish imagination which know that it should never know that reality these west indian year be the great day of the family say titbottom with a air of majestic and regal regret pause and muse in we little parlor like a late stuart in exile remember england prue raise she eye from she work and look at he with a subdue admiration for i have observe that like the rest of she sex she have a singular sympathy with the representative of a reduce family perhaps it be they finer perception which lead these tender-hearted woman to recognize the divine right of social superiority so much more readily than we and yet much as titbottom be enhance in my wife 's admiration by the discovery that he dusky sadness of nature and expression be as it be the expire gleam and late twilight of ancestral splendor i doubt if mr bourne would have prefer he for bookkeeper a moment sooner upon that account in truth i have observe down town that the fact of you ancestor do nothing be not consider good proof that you can do anything but prue and she sex regard sentiment more than action and i understand easily enough why she be never tire of hear I read of prince charlie if titbottom have be only a little younger a little handsomer a little more gallantly dress -- in fact a little more of the prince charlie i be sure she eye would not have fall again upon she work so tranquilly as he resume he story i can remember my grandfather titbottom although i be a very young child and he be a very old man my young mother and my young grandmother be very distinct figure in my memory minister to the old gentleman wrap in he dressing-gown and seat upon the piazza i remember he white hair and he calm smile and how not long before he die he call I to he and lay he hand upon my head say to I : my child the world be not this great sunny piazza nor life the fairy story which the woman tell you here as you sit in they lap i shall soon be go but i want to leave with you some memento of my love for you and i know nothing more valuable than these spectacles which you grandmother bring from she native island when she arrive here one fine summer morning long ago i can not quite tell whether when you grow older you will regard it as a gift of the greatest value or as something that you have be happier never to have possess ' ` but grandpapa i be not short-sighted ' ` my son be you not human ' say the old gentleman and how shall i ever forget the thoughtful sadness with which at the same time he hand I the spectacles instinctively i put they on and look at my grandfather but i see no grandfather no piazza no flowered dressing-gown : i see only a luxuriant palm-tree wave broadly over a tranquil landscape pleasant home cluster around it garden teem with fruit and flower flock quietly feed bird wheeling and chirping i hear child 's voice and the low lullaby of happy mother the sound of cheerful singing come waft from distant field upon the light breeze golden harvest glisten out of sight and i catch they rustling whisper of prosperity a warm mellow atmosphere bath the whole i have see copy of the landscape of the italian painter claude which seem to I faint reminiscence of that calm and happy vision but all this peace and prosperity seem to flow from the spreading palm as from a fountain i do not know how long i look but i have apparently no power as i have no will to remove the spectacles what a wonderful island must nevi be think i if people carry such picture in they pocket only by buy a pair of spectacles what wonder that my dear grandmother titbottom have live such a placid life and have bless we all with she sunny temper when she have live surround by such image of peace my grandfather die but still in the warm morning sunshine upon the piazza i feel he placid presence and as i crawl into he great chair and drift on in reverie through the still tropical day it be as if he soft dreamy eye have pass into my soul my grandmother cherish he memory with tender regret a violent passion of grief for he loss be no more possible than for the pensive decay of the year we have no portrait of he but i see always when i remember he that peaceful and luxuriant palm and i think that to have know one good old man -- one man who through the chance and rub of a long life have carry he heart in he hand like a palm branch wave all discord into peace help we faith in god in ourselves and in each other more than many sermon i hardly know whether to be grateful to my grandfather for the spectacles and yet when i remember that it be to they i owe the pleasant image of he which i cherish i seem to myself sadly ungrateful madam say titbottom to prue solemnly my memory be a long and gloomy gallery and only remotely at its further end do i see the glimmer of soft sunshine and only there be the pleasant picture hang they seem to I very happy along whose gallery the sunlight stream to they very foot strike all the picture wall into unfading splendor prue have lay she work in she lap and as titbottom pause a moment and i turn towards she i find she mild eye fasten upon my face and glisten with happy tear misfortune of many kind come heavily upon the family after the head be go the great house be relinquish my parent be both dead and my grandmother have entire charge of I but from the moment that i receive the gift of the spectacles i could not resist they fascination and i withdraw into myself and become a solitary boy there be not many companion for I of my own age and they gradually leave I or at least have not a hearty sympathy with I for if they tease I i pull out my spectacles and survey they so seriously that they acquire a kind of awe of I and evidently regard my grandfather 's gift as a conceal magical weapon which might be dangerously draw upon they at any moment whenever in we game there be quarrel and high word and i begin to feel about my dress and to wear a grave look they all take the alarm and shout ` look out for titbottom 's spectacles ' and scatter like a flock of scared sheep nor could i wonder at it for at first before they take the alarm i see strange sight when i look at they through the glass if two be quarrel about a marble or a ball i have only to go behind a tree where i be conceal and look at they leisurely then the scene change and no longer a green meadow with boy play but a spot which i do not recognize and form that make I shudder or smile it be not a big boy bully a little one but a young wolf with glisten tooth and a lamb cower before he or it be a dog faithful and famishing -- or a star go slowly into eclipse -- or a rainbow fading -- or a flower bloom -- or a sun rise -- or a wane moon the revelation of the spectacles determine my feeling for the boy and for all whom i see through they no shyness nor awkwardness nor silence could separate I from those who look lovely as lily to my illuminated eye if i feel myself warmly draw to any one i struggle with the fierce desire of see he through the spectacles i long to enjoy the luxury of ignorant feeling to love without know to float like a leaf upon the eddy of life drift now to a sunny point now to a solemn shade -- now over glitter ripple now over gleaming calm -- and not to determine port a trim vessel with a inexorable rudder but sometimes master after long struggle i seize my spectacles and saunter into the little town put they to my eye i peer into the house and at the people who pass I here sit a family at breakfast and i stand at the window look in o motley meal fantastic vision the good mother see she lord sit opposite a grave respectable be eating muffin but i see only a bank-bill more or less crumpled and tattered marked with a larger or lesser figure if a sharp wind blow suddenly i see it tremble and flutter it be thin flat impalpable i remove my glass and look with my eye at the wife i could have smile to see the humid tenderness with which she regard she strange _ vis-à-vi _ be life only a game of blind-man 's - buff of droll cross-purposes or i put they on again and look at the wife how many stout tree i saw -- how many tender flower -- how many placid pool yes and how many little stream wind out of sight shrink before the large hard round eye opposite and slip off into solitude and shade with a low inner song for they own solace and in many house i think to see angel nymph or at least woman and could only find broomstick mop or kettle hurry about rattle tinkling in a state of shrill activity i make call upon elegant lady and after i have enjoy the gloss of silk and the delicacy of lace and the flash of jewel i slip on my spectacles and see a peacock 's feather flounce and furbelow and flutter or a iron rod thin sharp and hard nor could i possibly mistake the movement of the drapery for any flexibility of the thing drape -- or mysteriously chill i see a statue of perfect form or flow movement it might be alabaster or bronze or marble -- but sadly often it be ice and i know that after it have shine a little and freeze a few eye with its despairing perfection it could not be put away in the niche of palace for ornament and proud family tradition like the alabaster or bronze or marble statue but would melt and shrink and fall coldly away in colorless and useless water be absorb in the earth and utterly forget but the true sadness be rather in see those who not have the spectacles think that the iron rod be flexible and the ice statue warm i see many a gallant heart which seem to I brave and loyal as the crusader send by genuine and noble faith to syrium and the sepulchre pursue through day and night and a long life of devotion the hope of lighting at least a smile in the cold eye if not a fire in the icy heart i watch the earnest enthusiastic sacrifice i see the pure resolve the generous faith the fine scorn of doubt the impatience of suspicion i watch the grace the ardor the glory of devotion through those strange spectacles how often i see the noblest heart renounce all other hope all other ambition all other life than the possible love of some one of those statue ah I it be terrible but they have not the love to give the parian face be so polished and smooth because there be no sorrow upon the heart -- and drearily often no heart to be touch i could not wonder that the noble heart of devotion be break for it have dash itself against a stone i weep until my spectacles be dim for that hopeless sorrow but there be a pang beyond tear for those icy statue still a boy i be thus too much a man in knowledge -- i do not comprehend the sight i be compel to see i use to tear my glass away from my eye and frighten at myself run to escape my own consciousness reach the small house where we then live i plunge into my grandmother 's room and throw myself upon the floor bury my face in she lap and sob myself to sleep with premature grief but when i awaken and feel she cool hand upon my hot forehead and hear the low sweet song or the gentle story or the tenderly tell parable from the bible with which she try to soothe I i could not resist the mystic fascination that lure I as i lay in she lap to steal a glance at she through the spectacles picture of the madonna have not she rare and pensive beauty upon the tranquil little island she life have be eventless and all the fine possibility of she nature be like flower that never bloom placid be all she year yet i have read of no heroine of no woman great in sudden crisis that it do not seem to I she might have be the wife and widow of a man who love he own home better than the home of other i have yet hear of no queen no belle no imperial beauty whom in grace and brilliancy and persuasive courtesy she might not have surpass madam say titbottom to my wife whose heart hang upon he story you husband 's young friend aurelium wear sometimes a camelium in she hair and no diamond in the ball-room seem so costly as that perfect flower which woman envy and for whose least and withered petal man sigh yet in the tropical solitude of brazil how many a camelium bud drop from a bush that no eye have ever see which have it flower and be notice would have gilded all heart with its memory when i steal these furtive glance at my grandmother half fear that they be wrong i see only a calm lake whose shore be low and over which the sky hang unbroken so that the least star be clearly reflect it have a atmosphere of solemn twilight tranquillity and so completely do its unruffled surface blend with the cloudless star-studded sky that when i look through my spectacles at my grandmother the vision seem to I all heaven and star yet as i gazed and gaze i feel what stately city might well have be build upon those shore and have flash prosperity over the calm like coruscation of pearl i dream of gorgeous fleet silken sail and blow by perfumed wind drift over those depthless water and through those spacious sky i gaze upon the twilight the inscrutable silence like a god-fearing discoverer upon a new and vast and dim sea burst upon he through forest gloom and in the fervor of whose impassioned gaze a millennial and poetic world arise and man need no longer die to be happy my companion naturally desert I for i have grow wearily grave and abstracted : and unable to resist the allurement of my spectacles i be constantly lose in a world of which those companion be part yet of which they know nothing i grow cold and hard almost morose people seem to I blind and unreasonable they do the wrong thing they call green yellow and black white young man say of a girl ` what a lovely simple creature ' i look and there be only a glisten wisp of straw dry and hollow or they say ` what a cold proud beauty ' i look and lo a madonna whose heart hold the world or they say ` what a wild giddy girl ' and i see a glancing dancing mountain stream pure as the virgin snow whence it flow singing through sun and shade over pearl and gold dust slip along unstained by weed or rain or heavy foot of cattle touch the flower with a dewy kiss -- a beam of grace a happy song a line of light in the dim and troubled landscape my grandmother send I to school but i look at the master and see that he be a smooth round ferule -- or a improper noun -- or a vulgar fraction and refuse to obey he or he be a piece of string a rag a willow-wand and i have a contemptuous pity but one be a well of cool deep water and look suddenly in one day i see the star he give I all my schooling with he i use to walk by the sea and as we stroll and the wave plunge in long legion before we i look at he through the spectacles and as he eye dilate with the boundless view and he chest heave with a impossible desire i see xerx and he army toss and glitter rank upon rank multitude upon multitude out of sight but ever regularly advance and with the confused roar of ceaseless music prostrate themselves in abject homage or as with arm outstretch and hair streaming on the wind he chant full line of the resounding iliad i see homer pacing the aegean sand in the greek sunset of forget time my grandmother die and i be throw into the world without resource and with no capital but my spectacles i try to find employment but man be shy of I there be a vague suspicion that i be either a little crazed or a good deal in league with the prince of darkness my companion who would persist in call a piece of paint muslin a fair and fragrant flower have no difficulty success wait for they around every corner and arrive in every ship i try to teach for i love child but if anything excited my suspicion and put on my spectacles i see that i be fondle a snake or smell at a bud with a worm in it i spring up in horror and run away or if it seem to I through the glass that a cherub smile upon I or a rose be bloom in my buttonhole then i feel myself imperfect and impure not fit to be lead and train what be so essentially superior in quality to myself and i kiss the child and leave they weep and wonder in despair i go to a great merchant on the island and ask he to employ I ` my young friend ' say he ' i understand that you have some singular secret some charm or spell or gift or something i do not know what of which people be afraid now you know my dear ' say the merchant swell up and apparently prouder of he great stomach than of he large fortune ' i be not of that kind i be not easily frightened you may spare yourself the pain of try to impose upon I people who propose to come to time before i arrive be accustom to arise very early in the morning ' say he thrust he thumb in the armhole of he waistcoat and spread the finger like two fan upon he bosom ' i think i have hear something of you secret you have a pair of spectacles i believe that you value very much because you grandmother bring they as a marriage portion to you grandfather now if you think fit to sell I those spectacles i will pay you the largest market price for glass what do you say ' i tell he that i have not the slightest idea of sell my spectacles ` my young friend mean to eat they i suppose ' say he with a contemptuous smile i make no reply but be turn to leave the office when the merchant call after I -- ` my young friend poor people should never suffer themselves to get into pet anger be a expensive luxury in which only man of a certain income can indulge a pair of spectacles and a hot temper be not the most promising capital for success in life master titbottom ' i say nothing but put my hand upon the door to go out when the merchant say more respectfully -- ` well you foolish boy if you will not sell you spectacles perhaps you will agree to sell the use of they to I that be you shall only put they on when i direct you and for my purpose hallo you little fool ' cry he impatiently as he see that i intend to make no reply but i have pull out my spectacles and put they on for my own purpose and against he direction and desire i look at he and see a huge bald-headed wild boar with gross chop and a leering eye -- only the more ridiculous for the high-arched gold-bowed spectacles that straddle he nose one of he fore hoof be thrust into the safe where he bill payable be hive and the other into he pocket among the loose change and bill there he ear be prick forward with a brisk sensitive smartness in a world where prize pork be the best excellence he would have carry off all the premium i step into the next office in the street and a mild-faced genial man also a large and opulent merchant ask I my business in such a tone that i instantly look through my spectacles and see a land flow with milk and honey there i pitch my tent and stay till the good man die and he business be discontinue but while there say titbottom and he voice tremble away into a sigh i first saw preciosa spite of the spectacles i see preciosa for day for week for month i do not take my spectacles with I i run away from they i throw they up on high shelf i try to make up my mind to throw they into the sea or down the well i could not i would not i dare not look at preciosa through the spectacles it be not possible for I deliberately to destroy they but i awake in the night and could almost have curse my dear old grandfather for he gift i escape from the office and sit for whole day with preciosa i tell she the strange thing i have see with my mystic glass the hour be not enough for the wild romance which i rave in she ear she listen astonished and appal she blue eye turn upon I with a sweet deprecation she cling to I and then withdraw and flee fearfully from the room but she could not stay away she could not resist my voice in whose tone burn all the love that fill my heart and brain the very effort to resist the desire of see she as i see everybody else give a frenzy and a unnatural tension to my feeling and my manner i sit by she side look into she eye smooth she hair folding she to my heart which be sunken and deep -- why not forever -- in that dream of peace i run from she presence and shout and leap with joy and sit the whole night through thrill into happiness by the thought of she love and loveliness like a wind-harp tightly string and answer the airiest sigh of the breeze with music then come calmer day -- the conviction of deep love settle upon we life -- as after the hurry heaving day of spring come the bland and benignant summer ` it be no dream then after all and we be happy ' i say to she one day and there come no answer for happiness be speechless we be happy then i say to myself there be no excitement now how glad i be that i can now look at she through my spectacles i fear lest some instinct should warn I to beware i escape from she arm and run home and seize the glass and bound back again to preciosa as i enter the room i be heat my head be swim with confused apprehension my eye must have glare preciosa be frightened and rise from she seat stand with a inquire glance of surprise in she eye but i be bent with frenzy upon my purpose i be merely aware that she be in the room i see nothing else i hear nothing i care for nothing but to see she through that magic glass and feel at once all the fulness of blissful perfection which that would reveal preciosa stand before the mirror but alarm at my wild and eager movement unable to distinguish what i have in my hand and see I raise they suddenly to my face she shriek with terror and fall faint upon the floor at the very moment that i place the glass before my eye and beheld -- myself reflect in the mirror before which she have be stand dear madam cry titbottom to my wife spring up and fall back again in he chair pale and tremble while prue run to he and take he hand and i pour out a glass of water -- i see myself there be silence for many minute prue lay she hand gently upon the head of we guest whose eye be close and who breathe softly like a infant in sleep perhaps in all the long year of anguish since that hour no tender hand have touch he brow nor wipe away the damp of a bitter sorrow perhaps the tender maternal finger of my wife soothe he weary head with the conviction that he feel the hand of he mother play with the long hair of she boy in the soft west indian morning perhaps it be only the natural relief of express a pent-up sorrow when he speak again it be with the old subdue tone and the air of quaint solemnity these thing be matter of long long ago and i come to this country soon after i bring with I premature age a past of melancholy memory and the magic spectacles i have become they slave i have nothing more to fear have see myself i be compel to see other properly to understand my relation to they the light that cheer the future of other man have go out for I my eye be those of a exile turn backwards upon the recede shore and not forwards with hope upon the ocean i mingle with man but with little pleasure there be but many variety of a few type i do not find those i come to clearer sight than those i have leave behind i hear man call shrewd and wise and report say they be highly intelligent and successful but when i look at they through my glass i find no halo of real manliness my finest sense detect no aroma of purity and principle but i see only a fungus that have fatten and spread in a night they all go to the theater to see actor upon the stage i go to see actor in the box so consummately cunning that the other do not know they be act and they do not suspect it themselves perhaps you wonder it do not make I misanthropical my dear friend do not forget that i have see myself it make I compassionate not cynical of course i could not value highly the ordinary standard of success and excellence when i go to church and see a thin blue artificial flower or a great sleepy cushion expound the beauty of holiness to pew full of eagle half-eagle and threepence however adroitly conceal in broadcloth and boot : or see a onion in a easter bonnet weep over the sin of magdalen i do not feel as they feel who see in all this not only propriety but piety or when at public meeting a eel stand up on end and wriggle and squirm lithely in every direction and declare that for he part he go in for rainbow and hot water -- how could i help see that he be still black and love a slimy pool i could not grow misanthropical when i saw in the eye of so many who be call old the gush fountain of eternal youth and the light of a immortal dawn or when i see those who be esteem unsuccessful and aimless ruling a fair realm of peace and plenty either in themselves or more perfectly in another -- a realm and princely possession for which they have well renounce a hopeless search and a belated triumph i know one man who have be for year a by-word for have seek the philosopher 's stone but i look at he through the spectacles and see a satisfaction in concentrated energy and a tenacity arise from devotion to a noble dream which be not apparent in the youth who pity he in the aimless effeminacy of club nor in the clever gentleman who crack they thin joke upon he over a gossip dinner and there be you neighbor over the way who pass for a woman who have fail in she career because she be a old maid people wag solemn head of pity and say that she make so great a mistake in not marry the brilliant and famous man who be for long year she suitor it be clear that no orange flower will ever bloom for she the young people make tender romance about she as they watch she and think of she solitary hour of bitter regret and waste longing never to be satisfy when i first come to town i share this sympathy and pleased my imagination with fancy she hard struggle with the conviction that she have lose all that make life beautiful i suppose that if i look at she through my spectacles i should see that it be only she radiant temper which so illuminate she dress that we do not see it to be heavy sable but when one day i do raise my glass and glance at she i do not see the old maid whom we all pity for a secret sorrow but a woman whose nature be a tropic in which the sun shone and bird sing and flower bloom forever there be no regret no doubt and half wish but a calm sweetness a transparent peace i see she blush when that old lover pass by or pause to speak to she but it be only the sign of delicate feminine consciousness she know he love and honor it although she could not understand it nor return it i look closely at she and i see that although all the world have exclaim at she indifference to such homage and have declare it be astonishing she should lose so fine a match she would only say simply and quietly -- ` if shakespeare love I and i do not love he how could i marry he ' could i be misanthropical when i see such fidelity and dignity and simplicity you may believe that i be especially curious to look at that old lover of hers through my glass he be no longer young you know when i come and he fame and fortune be secure certainly i have hear of few man more beloved and of none more worthy to be love he have the easy manner of a man of the world the sensitive grace of a poet and the charitable judgment of a wide traveller he be account the most successful and most unspoiled of man handsome brilliant wise tender graceful accomplished rich and famous i look at he without the spectacles in surprise and admiration and wonder how you neighbor over the way have be so entirely untouch by he homage i watch they intercourse in society i see she gay smile she cordial greeting i mark he frank address he lofty courtesy they manner tell no tale the eager world be balk and i pull out my spectacles i have see she already and now i see he he live only in memory and he memory be a spacious and stately palace but he do not oftenest frequent the banqueting hall where be endless hospitality and feast -- nor do he loiter much in reception room where a throng of new visitor be forever swarm -- nor do he feed he vanity by haunt the apartment in which be store the trophy of he varied triumph -- nor dream much in the great gallery hang with picture of he travels but from all these lofty hall of memory he constantly escape to a remote and solitary chamber into which no one have ever penetrate but my fatal eye behind the glass follow and enter with he and see that the chamber be a chapel it be dim and silent and sweet with perpetual incense that burn upon a altar before a picture forever veil there whenever i chance to look i see he kneel and pray and there by day and by night a funeral hymn be chant i do not believe you will be surprise that i have be content to remain deputy bookkeeper my spectacles regulate my ambition and i early learn that there be better god than plutus the glass have lose much of they fascination now and i do not often use they sometimes the desire be irresistible whenever i be greatly interested i be compel to take they out and see what it be that i admire and yet -- and yet say titbottom after a pause i be not sure that i thank my grandfather prue have long since lay away she work and have hear every word of the story i see that the dear woman have yet one question to ask and have be earnestly hope to hear something that would spare she the necessity of ask but titbottom have resume he usual tone after the momentary excitement and make no further allusion to himself we all sit silently titbottom 's eye fasten musingly upon the carpet : prue look wistfully at he and i regard both it be past midnight and we guest arise to go he shake hand quietly make he grave spanish bow to prue and take he hat go towards the front door prue and i accompany he i saw in she eye that she would ask she question and as titbottom open the door i hear the low word : and preciosa titbottom pause he have just open the door and the moonlight stream over he as he stand turn back to we i have see she but once since it be in church and she be kneel with she eye close so that she do not see I but i rub the glass well and look at she and see a white lily whose stem be break but which be fresh and luminous and fragrant still that be a miracle interrupted prue madam it be a miracle reply titbottom and for that one sight i be devoutly grateful for my grandfather 's gift i see that although a flower may have lose its hold upon earthly moisture it may still bloom as sweetly feed by the dew of heaven the door close and he be go but as prue put she arm in mine and we go upstairs together she whisper in my ear : how glad i be that you

the finest water-power in maine we use to call it a western town in the heart of the civilization of new england a charming place it be and be a spirited brave young parish have i and it seem as if we might have all the joy of eventful living to we heart ' content alas how little we know on the day of my ordination and in those halcyon moment of we first housekeeping to be the confidential friend in a hundred family in the town -- cut the social trifle as my friend haliburton say from the top of the whipped-syllabub to the bottom of the sponge-cake which be the foundation -- to keep abreast of the thought of the age in one 's study and to do one 's best on Sunday to interweave that think with the active life of a active town and to inspirit both and make both infinite by glimpse of the eternal glory seem such a exquisite forelook into one 's life enough to do and all so real and so grand if this vision could only have last the truth be that this vision be not in itself a delusion nor indeed half bright enough if one could only have be leave to do he own business the vision would have accomplish itself and bring out new paraheliacal vision each as bright as the original the misery be and be as we find out i and polly before long that besides the vision and besides the usual human and finite failure in life -lrb- such as break the old pitcher that come over in the mayflower and put into the fire the alpenstock with which she father climb mont blanc -rrb- -- besides these i say -lrb- imitate the style of robinson crusoe -rrb- there be pitchfork in on we a great rowen-heap of humbug hand down from some unknown seed-time in which we be expect and i chiefly to fulfil certain public function before the community of the character of those fulfil by the third row of supernumerary who stand behind the sepoy in the spectacle of the _ cataract of the gange _ they be the duty in a word which one perform as member of one or another social class or subdivision wholly distinct from what one do as a by himself a what invisible power put these function on I it would be very hard to tell but such power there be and be and i have not be at work a year before i find i be live two life one real and one merely functional -- for two set of people one my parish whom i loved and the other a vague public for whom i do not care two straw all this be in a vague notion which everybody have and have that this second life would eventually bring out some great result unknown at present to somebody somewhere craze by this duality of life i first read dr wigan on the _ duality of the brain _ hope that i could train one side of my head to do these outside job and the other to do my intimate and real duty for richard greenough once tell I that in study for the statue of franklin he find that the left side of the great man 's face be philosophic and reflective and the right side funny and smile if you will go and look at the bronze statue you will find he have repeat this observation there for posterity the eastern profile be the portrait of the statesman franklin the western of poor richard but dr wigan do not go into these nicety of this subject and i fail it be then that on my wife 's suggestion i resolve to look out for a double i be at first singularly successful we happen to be recreate at stafford spring that summer we ride out one day for one of the relaxation of that watering-place to the great monsonpon house we be pass through one of the large hall when my destiny be fulfil i see my man he be not shaven he have on no spectacles he be dress in a green baize roundabout and fade blue overalls worn sadly at the knee but i see at once that he be of my height five foot four and a half he have black hair wear off by he hat so have and have not i he stoop in walk so do i he hand be large and mine and -- choicest gift of fate in all -- he have not a strawberry-mark on he left arm but a cut from a juvenile brickbat over he right eye slightly affect the play of that eyebrow reader so have i -- my fate be seal a word with mr holley one of the inspector settle the whole thing it prove that this denni shea be a harmless amiable fellow of the class know as shiftless who have seal he fate by marry a dumb wife who be at that moment iron in the laundry before i leave stafford i have hire both for five year we have apply to judge pynchon then the probate judge at springfield to change the name of denni shea to frederic ingham we have explain to the judge what be the precise truth that a eccentric gentleman wish to adopt denni under this new name into he family it never occur to he that denni might be more than fourteen year old and thus to shorten this preface when we return at night to my parsonage at naguadavick there enter mr ingham she new dumb laundress myself who be mr frederic ingham and my double who be mr frederic ingham by as good right as i oh the fun we have the next morning in shave he beard to my pattern cut he hair to match mine and teaching he how to wear and how to take off gold-bowed spectacles really they be electroplate and the glass be plain -lrb- for the poor fellow 's eye be excellent -rrb- then in four successive afternoon i teach he four speech i have find these would be quite enough for the supernumerary-sepoy line of life and it be well for I they be for though he be good-natured he be very shiftless and it be as we national proverb say like pull tooth to teach he but at the end of the next week he could say with quite my easy and frisky air : 1 very well thank you and you this for a answer to casual salutation 2 i be very glad you like it 3 there have be so much say and on the whole so well say that i will not occupy the time 4 i agree in general with my friend on the other side of the room at first i have a feeling that i be go to be at great cost for clothing he but it prove of course at once that whenever he be out i should be at home and i go during the bright period of he success to so few of those awful pageant which require a black dress-coat and what the ungodly call after mr dickens a white choker that in the happy retreat of my own dressing-gown and jacket my day go by as happily and cheaply as those of another thalaba and polly declare there be never a year when the tailor cost so little he live -lrb- denni not thalaba -rrb- in he wife 's room over the kitchen he have order never to show himself at that window when he appear in the front of the house i retire to my sanctissimum and my dressing-gown in short the dutchman and he wife in the old weather-box have not less to do with each other than he and i he make the furnace-fire and split the wood before daylight then he go to sleep again and sleep late then come for order with a red silk bandanna tie round he head with he overalls on and he dress-coat and spectacles off if we happen to be interrupted no one guess that he be frederic ingham as well as i and in the neighborhood there grow up a impression that the minister 's irishman work day-time in the factory village at new coventry after i have give he he order i never see he till the next day i launch he by send he to a meeting of the enlightenment board the enlightenment board consist of seventy-four member of whom sixty-seven be necessary to form a quorum one become a member under the regulation lay down in old judge dudley 's will i become one by be ordain pastor of a church in naguadavick you see you can not help yourself if you would at this particular time we have have four successive meeting average four hour each -- wholly occupy in whipping in a quorum at the first only eleven man be present at the next by force of three circular twenty-seven at the third thanks to two day ' canvassing by auchmuty and myself beg man to come we have sixty half the other be in europe but without a quorum we could do nothing all the rest of we wait grimly for we four hour and adjourn without any action at the fourth meeting we have flag and only get fifty-nine together but on the first appearance of my double -- whom i send on this fatal Monday to the fifth meeting -- he be the _ sixty-seventh _ man who enter the room he be greet with a storm of applause the poor fellow have miss he way -- read the street sign ill through he spectacles -lrb- very ill in fact without they -rrb- -- and have not dare to inquire he enter the room -- find the president and secretary hold to they chair two judge of the supreme court who be also member _ ex officio _ and be beg leave to go away on he entrance all be change _ presto _ the by-law be amend and the western property be give away nobody stop to converse with he he vote as i have charge he to do in every instance with the minority i win new laurel as a man of sense though a little unpunctual -- and dennis _ alia _ ingham return to the parsonage astonish to see with how little wisdom the world be govern he cut a few of my parishioner in the street but he have he glass off and i be know to be nearsighted eventually he recognize they more readily than i i set he again at the exhibition of the new coventry academy and here he undertake a speak part -- as in my boyish worldly day i remember the bill use to say of mlle celeste we be all trustee of the new coventry academy and there have lately be a good deal of feeling because the sandemanian trustee do not regularly attend the exhibition it have be intimate indeed that the sandemanian be lean towards free-will and that we have therefore neglect these semi-annual exhibition while there be no doubt that auchmuty last year go to commencement at waterville now the head master at new coventry be a real good fellow who know a sanskrit root when he see it and often crack etymology with I -- so that in strictness i ought to go to they exhibition but think reader of sit through three long July day in that academy chapel follow the program from Tuesday morning english composition sunshine miss jone round to trio on three piano duel from opera of midshipman easy marryatt come in at nine Thursday evening think of this reader for man who know the world be try to go backward and who would give they life if they could help it on well the double have succeed so well at the board that i send he to the academy -lrb- shade of plato pardon -rrb- he arrive early on Tuesday when indeed few but mother and clergyman be generally expect and return in the evening to we cover with honor he have dine at the right hand of the chairman and he speak in high term of the repast the chairman have express he interest in the french conversation i be very glad you like it say denni and the poor chairman abashed suppose the accent have be wrong at the end of the day the gentleman present have be call upon for speech -- the rev frederic ingham first as it happen upon which denni have rise and have say there have be so much say and on the whole so well say that i will not occupy the time the girl be delighted because dr dabney the year before have give they at this occasion a scolding on impropriety of behavior at lyceum lecture they all declare mr ingham be a love -- and _ so _ handsome -lrb- denni be good-looking -rrb- three of they with arm behind the other ' waist follow he up to the wagon he ride home in and a little girl with a blue sash have be send to give he a rosebud after this debut in speak he go to the exhibition for two day more to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned indeed polly report that he have pronounce the trustee ' dinner of a higher grade than those of the parsonage when the next term begin i find six of the academy girl have obtain permission to come across the river and attend we church but this arrangement do not long continue after this he go to several commencement for I and eat the dinner provide he sit through three of we quarterly convention for I -- always vote judiciously by the simple rule mention above of siding with the minority and i meanwhile who have before be lose caste among my friend as hold myself aloof from the association of the body begin to rise in everybody 's favor ingham 's a good fellow -- always on hand never talk much -- but do the right thing at the right time be not as unpunctual as he use to be -- he come early and sit through to the end he have get over he old talkative habit too i speak to a friend of he about it once and i think ingham take it kindly etc etc this voting power of denni be particularly valuable at the quarterly meeting of the proprietor of the naguadavick ferry my wife inherit from she father some share in that enterprise which be not yet fully develop though it doubtless will become a very valuable property the law of maine then forbid stockholder to appear by proxy at such meeting polly dislike to go not be in fact a hen ' - rights hen and transfer she stock to I i after go once dislike it more than she but dennis go to the next meeting and like it very much he say the armchair be good the collation good and the free ride to stockholder pleasant he be a little frightened when they first take he upon one of the ferry-boat but after two or three quarterly meeting he become quite brave thus far i never have any difficulty with he indeed be of that type which be call shiftless he be only too happy to be tell daily what to do and to be charge not to be forthputting or in any way original in he discharge of that duty he learn however to discriminate between the line of he life and very much prefer these stockholder ' meeting and trustee ' dinner and commencement collation to another set of occasion from which he use to beg off most piteously we excellent brother dr fillmore have take a notion at this time that we sandemanian church need more expression of mutual sympathy he insist upon it that we be remiss he say that if the bishop come to preach at naguadavick all the episcopal clergy of the neighborhood be present if dr pond come all the congregational clergyman turn out to hear he if dr nichol all the unitarian and he think we owe it to each other that whenever there be a occasional service at a sandemanian church the other brethren should all if possible attend it look well if nothing more now this really mean that i have not be to hear one of dr fillmore 's lecture on the ethnology of religion he forget that he do not hear one of my course on the sandemanianism of anselm but i feel badly when he say it and afterwards i always make denni go to hear all the brethren preach when i be not preach myself this be what he take exception to -- the only thing as i say which he ever do except to now come the advantage of he long morning-nap and of the green tea with which polly supply the kitchen but he would plead so humbly to be let off only from one or two i never except he however i know the lecture be of value and i think it best he should be able to keep the connection polly be more rash than i be as the reader have observe in the outset of this memoir she risk dennis one night under the eye of she own sex governor gorge have always be very kind to we and when he give he great annual party to the town ask we i confess i hate to go i be deep in the new volume of pfeiffer 's _ mystic _ which haliburton have just send I from boston but how rude say polly not to return the governor 's civility and mr gorge 's when they will be sure to ask why you be away still i demur and at last she with the wit of eve and of semiramis conjoin let I off by say that if i would go in with she and sustain the initial conversation with the governor and the lady stay there she would risk denni for the rest of the evening and that be just what we do she take denni in training all that afternoon instruct he in fashionable conversation caution he against the temptation of the supper-table -- and at nine in the evening he drive we all down in the carryall i make the grand star-entrée with polly and the pretty walton girl who be stay with we we have put denni into a great rough top-coat without he glass -- and the girl never dream in the darkness of look at he he sit in the carriage at the door while we enter i do the agreeable to mr gorge be introduce to she niece miss fernanda -- i complimented judge jeffry on he decision in the great case of d'aulnay _ vs _ laconium mining co -- i step into the dressing-room for a moment -- step out for another -- walk home after a nod with denni and tie the horse to a pump -- and while i walk home mr frederic ingham my double step in through the library into the gorge 's grand saloon oh polly die of laugh as she tell I of it at midnight and even here where i have to teach my hand to hew the beech for stake to fence we cave she die of laugh as she recall it -- and say that single occasion be worth all we have pay for it gallant eve that she be she join denni at the library door and in a instant present he to dr ochterlong from baltimore who be on a visit in town and be talk with she as denni come in mr ingham would like to hear what you be tell we about you success among the german population and denni bow and say in spite of a scowl from polly i be very glad you like it but dr ochterlong do not observe and plunge into the tide of explanation denni listen like a prime-minister and bow like a mandarin -- which be i suppose the same thing polly declare it be just like haliburton 's latin conversation with the hungarian minister of which he be very fond of tell _ quoene sit historium reformationi in ungariâ _ quoth haliburton after some thought and he _ confrère _ reply gallantly _ in seculo decimo tertio _ etc etc etc and from _ decimo tertio _ -lrb- which mean in the thirteenth century my dear little bell-and-coral reader you have rightly guess that the question mean what be the history of the reformation in hungary -rrb- to the nineteenth century and a half last till the oyster come so be it that before dr ochterlong come to the success or near it governor gorge come to denni and ask he to hand mr jeffry down to supper a request which he hear with great joy polly be skip round the room i guess gay as a lark auchmuty come to she in pity for poor ingham who be so bore by the stupid pundit -- and auchmuty could not understand why i stand it so long but when denni take mr jeffry down polly could not resist standing near they he be a little flustered till the sight of the eatables and drinkable give he the same mercian courage which it give diggory a little excited then he attempt one or two of he speech to the judge 's lady but little he know how hard it be to get in even a _ promptu _ there edgewise very well i thank you say he after the eating element be adjust and you and then do not he have to hear about the mumps and the measles and arnica and belladonna and chamomile-flower and dodecathem till she change oyster for salad -- and then about the old practice and the new and what she sister say and what she sister 's friend say and what the physician to she sister 's friend say and then what be say by the brother of the sister of the physician of the friend of she sister exactly as if it have be in ollendorff there be a moment 's pause as she decline champagne i be very glad you like it say denni again which he never should have say but to one who compliment a sermon oh you be so sharp mr ingham no i never drink any wine at all -- except sometimes in summer a little currant spirit -- from we own currant you know my own mother -- that be i call she my own mother because you know i do not remember etc etc etc till they come to the candied orange at the end of the feast -- when denni rather confuse think he must say something and try no 4 -- i agree in general with my friend the other side of the room -- which he never should have say but at a public meeting but mr jeffry who never listen expect to understand catch he up instantly with well i be sure my husband return the compliment he always agree with you -- though we do worship with the methodist -- but you know mr ingham etc etc etc till the move be make upstairs and as denni lead she through the hall he be scarcely understand by any but polly as he say there have be so much say and on the whole so well say that i will not occupy the time he great resource the rest of the evening be stand in the library carry on animated conversation with one and another in much the same way polly have initiate he in the mystery of a discovery of mine that it be not necessary to finish you sentence in a crowd but by a sort of mumble omit sibilant and dental this indeed if you word fail you answer even in public extempore speech -- but better where other talk be go on thus : we miss you at the natural history society ingham ingham reply : i be very gligloglum that be that you be m-m-m-m-m by gradually drop the voice the interlocutor be compel to supply the answer mr ingham i hope you friend augusta be better augusta have not be ill polly can not think of explain however and answer : thank you ma'am she be very rearason wewahwewob in lower and lower tone and mr throckmorton who forget the subject of which she speak as soon as she ask the question be quite satisfied denni could see into the card-room and come to polly to ask if he might not go and play all-fours but of course she sternly refuse at midnight they come home delightedly : polly as i say wild to tell I the story of victory only both the pretty walton girl say : cousin frederic you do not come near I all the evening we always call he denni at home for convenience though he real name be frederic ingham as i have explain when the election day come round however i find that by some accident there be only one frederic ingham 's name on the voting-list and as i be quite busy that day in write some foreign letter to halle i think i would forego my privilege of suffrage and stay quietly at home tell denni that he might use the record on the voting-list and vote i give he a ticket which i tell he he might use if he like to that be that very sharp election in maine which the reader of _ the atlantic _ so well remember and it have be intimate in public that the minister would do well not to appear at the poll of course after that we have to appear by self or proxy still naguadavick be not then a city and this standing in a double queue at townmeet several hour to vote be a bear of the first water and so when i find that there be but one frederic ingham on the list and that one of we must give up i stay at home and finish the letter -lrb- which indeed procure for fothergill he coveted appointment of professor of astronomy at leavenworth -rrb- and i give denni as we call he the chance something in the matter give a good deal of popularity to the frederic ingham name and at the adjourn election next week frederic ingham be choose to the legislature whether this be i or dennis i never really know my friend seem to think it be i but i feel that as denni have do the popular thing he be entitle to the honor so i send he to augusta when the time come and he take the oath and a very valuable member he make they appoint he on the committee on parish but i write a letter for he resign on the ground that he take a interest in we claim to the stumpage in the minister 's sixteenth of gore a next no 7 in the 10th range he never make any speech and always vote with the minority which be what he be send to do he make I and himself a great many good friend some of whom i do not afterwards recognize as quickly as denni do my parishioner on one or two occasion when there be wood to saw at home i keep he at home but i take those occasion to go to augusta myself find myself often in he vacant seat at these time i watch the proceedings with a good deal of care and once be so much excite that i deliver my somewhat celebrated speech on the central school district question a speech of which the state of maine print some extra copy i believe there be no formal rule permit stranger to speak but no one object dennis himself as i say never speak at all but we experience this session lead I to think that if by some such general understanding as the report speak of in legislation daily every member of congress might leave a double to sit through those deadly session and answer to roll-call and do the legitimate party-voting which appear stereotyped in the regular list of ashe bocock black etc we should gain decidedly in work power as thing stand the saddest state prison i ever visit be that representative ' chamber in washington if a man leave for a hour twenty correspondent may be howl where be mr prendergast when the oregon bill pass and if poor prendergast stay there certainly the worst use you can make of a man be to put he in prison i know indeed that public man of the highest rank have resort to this expedient long ago duma 's novel of _ the iron mask _ turn on the brutal imprisonment of loui the fourteenth 's double there seem little doubt in we own history that it be the real general pierce who shed tear when the delegate from lawrence explain to he the suffering of the people there -- and only general pierce 's double who have give the order for the assault on that town which be invade the next day my charming friend george withers have i be almost sure a double who preach he afternoon sermon for he this be the reason that the theology often vary so from that of the forenoon but that double be almost as charming as the original some of the most well-defined man who stand out most prominently on the background of history be in this way stereoscopic man who owe they distinct relief to the slight difference between the double all this i know my present suggestion be simply the great extension of the system so that all public machine-work may be do by it but i see i loiter on my story which be rush to the plunge let I stop a instant more however to recall be it only to myself that charming year while all be yet well after the double have become a matter of course for nearly twelve month before he undo I what a year it be full of active life full of happy love of the hardest work of the sweetest sleep and the fulfilment of so many of the fresh aspiration and dream of boyhood denni go to every school-committee meeting and sit through all those late wrangling which use to keep I up till midnight and awake till morning he attend all the lecture to which foreign exile send I ticket beg I to come for the love of heaven and of bohemia he accept and use all the ticket for charity concert which be send to I he appear everywhere where it be specially desirable that we denomination or we party or we class or we family or we street or we town or we country or we state should be fully represent and i fall back to that charming life which in boyhood one dream of when he suppose he shall do he own duty and make he own sacrifice without be tie up with those of other people my rusty sanskrit arabic hebrew greek latin french italian spanish german and english begin to take polish heaven how little i have do with they while i attend to my _ public _ duty my call on my parishioner become the friendly frequent homelike sociability they be mean to be instead of the hard work of a man goad to desperation by the sight of he list of arrears and preach what a luxury preach be when i have on Sunday the whole result of a individual personal week from which to speak to a people whom all that week i have be meet as hand-to-hand friend i never tire on Sunday and be in condition to leave the sermon at home if i choose and preach it extempore as all man should do always indeed i wonder when i think that a sensible people like ours -- really more attach to they clergy than they be in the lose day when the mather and norton be nobleman -- should choose to neutralize so much of they minister ' life and destroy so much of they early training by this undefined passion for see they in public it spring from we balancing of sect if a spirited episcopalian take a interest in the almshouse and be put on the poor board every other denomination must have a minister there lest the poorhouse be change into st paul 's cathedral if a sandemanian be choose president of the young man 's library there must be a methodist vice-president and a baptist secretary and if a universalist sunday-school convention collect five hundred delegate the next congregationalist sabbath-school conference must be as large lest ` they ' -- whoever _ they _ may be -- should think ` we ' -- whoever _ we _ may be -- be go down free from these necessity that happy year i begin to know my wife by sight we see each other sometimes in those long morning when denni be in the study explain to map-peddler that i have eleven map of jerusalem already and to school-book agent that i would see they hang before i would be bribe to introduce they textbook into the school -- she and i be at work together as in those old dreamy day -- and in these of we log-cabin again but all this could not last -- and at length poor denni my double overtask in turn undo I it be thus it happen there be a excellent fellow -- once a minister -- i will call he isaac -- who deserve well of the world till he die and after -- because he once in a real exigency do the right thing in the right way at the right time as no other man could do it in the world 's great football match the ball by chance find he loitering on the outside of the field he close with it camp it charge it home -- yes right through the other side -- not disturb not frighten by he own success -- and breathless find himself a great man -- as the great delta ring applause but he do not find himself a rich man and the football have never come in he way again from that moment to this moment he have be of no use that one can see at all still for that great act we speak of isaac gratefully and remember he kindly and he forge on hope to meet the football somewhere again in that vague hope he have arrange a movement for a general organization of the human family into debate club county society state union etc etc with a view of induce all child to take hold of the handle of they knife and fork instead of the metal child have bad habit in that way the movement of course be absurd but we all do we best to forward not it but he it come time for the annual county-meeting on this subject to be hold at naguadavick isaac come round good fellow to arrange for it -- get the townhall get the governor to preside -lrb- the saint -- he ought to have triplet double provide he by law -rrb- and then come to get I to speak no i say i would not speak if ten governor preside i do not believe in the enterprise if i speak it should be to say child should take hold of the prong of the fork and the blade of the knife i would subscribe ten dollar but i would not speak a mill so poor isaac go he way sadly to coax auchmuty to speak and delafield i go out not long after he come back and tell polly that they have promise to speak -- the governor would speak -- and he himself would close with the quarterly report and some interesting anecdote regard miss biffin 's way of handle she knife and mr nelli 's way of foot he fork now if mr ingham will only come and sit on the platform he need not say one word but it will show well in the paper -- it will show that the sandemanian take as much interest in the movement as the armenian or the mesopotamian and will be a great favor to I polly good soul be tempt and she promise she know mr isaac be starve and the baby -- she know denni be at home -- and she promise night come and i return i hear she story i be sorry i doubt but polly have promise to beg I and i dare all i tell denni to hold he peace under all circumstance and send he down it be not half a hour more before he return wild with excitement -- in a perfect irish fury -- which it be long before i understand but i know at once that he have undo I what happen be this : the audience get together attract by governor gorge 's name there be a thousand people poor gorge be late from augusta they become impatient he come in direct from the train at last really ignorant of the object of the meeting he open it in the fewest possible word and say other gentleman be present who would entertain they better than he the audience be disappointed but wait the governor prompt by isaac say the honorable mr delafield will address you delafield have forget the knife and fork and be play the ruy lopez opening at the chess club the rev mr auchmuty will address you auchmuty have promise to speak late and be at the school committee i see dr stearn in the hall perhaps he will say a word dr stearn say he have come to listen and not to speak the governor and isaac whisper the governor look at denni who be resplendent on the platform but isaac to give he he due shake he head but the look be enough a miserable lad ill-bred who have once be in boston think it would sound well to call for I and peep out ingham a few more wretch cry ingham ingham still isaac be firm but the governor anxious indeed to prevent a row know i would say something and say we friend mr ingham be always prepare -- and though we have not rely upon he he will say a word perhaps applause follow which turn dennis 's head he rise flattered and try no 3 : there have be so much say and on the whole so well say that i will not longer occupy the time and sit down look for he hat for thing seem squally but the people cry go on go on and some applaud denni still confuse but flatter by the applause to which neither he nor i be use rise again and this time try no 2 : i be very glad you like it in a sonorous clear delivery my best friend stare all the people who do not know I personally yell with delight at the aspect of the evening the governor be beside himself and poor isaac think he be undo alas it be i a boy in the gallery cry in a loud tone it be all a infernal humbug just as denni wave he hand command silence and try no 4 : i agree in general with my friend the other side of the room the poor governor doubt he sens and cross to stop he -- not in time however the same gallery-boy shout how 's you mother -- and denni now completely lose try as he last shot no 1 vainly : very well thank you and you i think i must have be undo already but denni like another lockhard choose to make sicker the audience rise in a whirl of amazement rage and sorrow some other impertinence aim at denni break all restraint and in pure irish he deliver himself of a address to the gallery invite any person who wish to fight to come down and do so -- state that they be all dog and coward -- that he would take any five of they single-handed shure i have say all he riverence and the misthress bid I say cry he in defiance and seize the governor 's cane from he hand brandish it quarter-staff fashion above he head he be indeed get from the hall only with the greatest difficulty by the governor the city marshal who have be call in and the superintendent of my Sunday school the universal impression of course be that the rev frederic ingham have lose all command of himself in some of those haunt of intoxication which for fifteen year i have be labor to destroy till this moment indeed

knock _ whether a new york _ feuilletoniste _ be not the same thing as a _ fellow down east _ at this time a plausible-looking bald-headed man join we evidently wait to take a part in the conversation good morning mr riggle say the superintendent anything fresh this morning any conundrum i have not look at the cattle he answer dryly cattle why cattle why to see if there be any _ corn under 'em _ he say and immediately ask why be dougla like the earth we try but could not guess because he be _ flatten out at the poll _ say mr riggle a famous politician formerly say the superintendent he grandfather be a _ seize-hessian-ist _ in the revolutionary war by the way i hear the _ freeze-oil _ doctrine do not go down at new bedford the next inmate look as if he might have be a sailor formerly ask he what he calling be say the superintendent follow the sea he reply to the question put by one of we go as mate in a fishing-schooner why do you give it up because i do not like work for

enter and say luncheon-time the old gentleman who have excellent appetite disperse at once one of they politely ask we if we would not stop and have a bit of bread and a little mite of cheese there be one thing i have forget to show you say the superintendent the cell for the confinement of violent and unmanageable punster we be very curious to see it particularly with reference to the alleged absence of every object upon which a play of word could possibly be make the superintendent lead we up some dark stair to a corridor then along a narrow passage then down a broad flight of step into another passageway and open a large door which look out on the main entrance we have not see the cell for the confinement of ` violent and unmanageable ' punster we both exclaim this be the _ sell _ he exclaim point to the outside prospect my friend the director look I in the face so good-naturedly that i have to laugh we like to humor the inmate he say it have a bad effect we find on they health and spirit to disappoint they of they little pleasantry some of the jest to which we have listen be not new to I though i dare say you may not have hear they often before the same thing happen in general society with this additional disadvantage that there be no punishment provide for ` violent and unmanageable ' punster as in we institution we make we bow to the superintendent and walk to the place where we carriage be wait for we on we way a exceedingly decrepit old man move slowly toward we with a perfectly blank look on he face but still appear as if he wish to speak look say the director -- that be we centenarian the ancient man crawl toward we cock one eye with which he seem to see a little up at we and say : sarvant young gentleman why be a -- a -- a -- like a -- a -- a -- give it up because it be a -- a -- a -- a -- he smile a pleasant smile as if it be all plain enough one hundred and seven last christmas say the director of late year he put he whole conundrum in blank -- but they please he just as well we take we departure much gratified and instruct by we visit hope to have some future opportunity of inspect the record of this excellent charity and make extract for the benefit of we reader the celebrated jump frog of calaveras county by mark twain -lrb- 1835-1910 -rrb- -lrb- from _ the Saturday press _ nov 18 1865 republish in _ the celebrated jump frog of calaveras county and other sketch _ -lrb- 1867 -rrb- by mark twain all of whose work be publish by harper & brother -rrb- in compliance with the request of a friend of mine who write I from the east i call on good-natured garrulous old simon wheeler and inquire after my friend 's friend leonida w smiley as request to do and i hereunto append the result i have a lurk suspicion that _ leonida w _ smiley be a myth and that my friend never know such a personage and that he only conjecture that if i ask old wheeler about he it would remind he of he infamous _ jim smiley _ and he would go to work and bear I to death with some exasperating reminiscence of he as long and as tedious as it should be useless to I if that be the design it succeed i find simon wheeler doze comfortably by the barroom stove of the dilapidated tavern in the decayed mining camp of angel 's and i notice that he be fat and bald-headed and have a expression of win gentleness and simplicity upon he tranquil countenance he rouse up and give I good-day i tell he a friend have commission I to make some inquiry about a cherish companion of he boyhood name _ leonida w _ smiley -- _ rev leonida w _ smiley a young minister of the gospel who he have hear be at one time a resident of angel 's camp i add that if mr wheeler could tell I anything about this rev leonida w smiley i would feel under many obligation to he simon wheeler back I into a corner and blockade I there with he chair and then sit down and reel off the monotonous narrative which follow this paragraph he never smile he never frown he never change he voice from the gentle-flowing key to which he tune he initial sentence he never betray the slightest suspicion of enthusiasm but all through the interminable narrative there run a vein of impressive earnestness and sincerity which show I plainly that so far from he imagine that there be anything ridiculous or funny about he story he regard it as a really important matter and admire its two hero as man of transcendent genius in _ finesse _ i let he go on in he own way and never interrupt he once rev leonida w h be reverend le -- well there be a feller here once by the name of _ jim _ smiley in the winter of ' 49 -- or may be it be the spring of ' 50 -- i do not recollect exactly somehow though what make I think it be one or the other be because i remember the big flume war not finish when he first come to the camp but any way he be the curiousest man about always bet on anything that turn up you ever see if he could get anybody to bet on the other side and if he could not he would change side any way that suit the other man would suit _ he _ -- any way just so 's he get a bet _ he _ be satisfied but still he be lucky uncommon lucky he most always come out winner he be always ready and lay for a chance there could not be no solit ` ry thing mention but that feller would offer to bet on it and take any side you please as i be just tell you if there be a horse-race you would find he flush or you would find he bust at the end of it if there be a dog-fight he would bet on it if there be a cat-fight he would bet on it if there be a chicken-fight he would bet on it why if there be two bird set on a fence he would bet you which one would fly first or if there be a camp-meeting he would be there reg ` lar to bet on parson walker which he judge to be the best exhorter about here and he be too and a good man if he even see a straddle-bug start to go anywhere he would bet you how long it would take he to get to -- to wherever he _ be _ go to and if you take he up he would foller that straddle-bug to mexico but what he would find out where he be bind for and how long he be on the road lot of the boy here have see that smiley and can tell you about he why it never make no difference to _ he _ -- he would bet on _ any _ thing -- the dangest feller parson walker 's wife lay very sick once for a good while and it seem as if they war not go to save she but one morning he come in and smiley up and ask he how she be and he say she be considerable better -- thank the lord for he inf ` nit ' mercy -- and come on so smart that with the blessing of prov ` dence she have get well yet and smiley before he think say ` well i 'll risk two-and-a-half she do not anyway ' thish-yer smiley have a mare -- the boy call she the fifteen-minute nag but that be only in fun you know because of course she be faster than that -- and he use to win money on that horse for all she be so slow and always have the asthma or the distemper or the consumption or something of that kind they use to give she two or three hundred yard start and then pass she under way but always at the fag-end of the race she have get excite and desperate-like and come cavort and straddle up and scatter she leg around limber sometimes in the air and sometimes out to one side amongst the fence and kick up m-o-r-e dust and raise m-o-r-e racket with she cough and sneeze and blow she nose -- and always fetch up at the stand just about a neck ahead as near as you could cipher it down and he have a little small bull-pup that to look at he you would think he war not worth a cent but to set around and look ornery and lay for a chance to steal something but as soon as money be up on he he be a different dog he under-jaw would begin to stick out like the fo ' - castle of a steamboat and he tooth would uncover and shine like the furnace and a dog might tackle he and bully-rag he and bite he and throw he over he shoulder two or three time and andrew jackson -- which be the name of the pup -- andrew jackson would never let on but what _ he _ be satisfied and have not expect nothing else -- and the bet be double and double on the other side all the time till the money be all up and then all of a sudden he would grab that other dog jest by the j' int of he hind leg and freeze to it -- not chaw you understand but only just grip and hang on till they throw up the sponge if it be a year smiley always come out winner on that pup till he harness a dog once that do not have no hind leg because they would be saw off in a circular saw and when the thing have go along far enough and the money be all up and he come to make a snatch for he pet holt he see in a minute how he would be impose on and how the other dog have he in the door so to speak and he ` pear surprised and then he look sorter discouraged-like and do not try no more to win the fight and so he get shuck out bad he give smiley a look as much as to say he heart be break and it be _ he _ fault for put up a dog that have not no hind leg for he to take holt of which be he main dependence in a fight and then he limp off a piece and lay down and die it be a good pup be that andrew jackson and would have make a name for hisself if he would live for the stuff be in he and he have genius -- i know it because he have not no opportunity to speak of and it do not stand to reason that a dog could make such a fight as he could under they circumstance if he have not no talent it always make I feel sorry when i think of that last fight of he 'n and the way it turn out well thish-yer smiley have rat-tarrier and chicken cock and tom-cat and all of they kind of thing till you could not rest and you could not fetch nothing for he to bet on but he would match you he ketch a frog one day and take he home and say he cal ` late to educate he and so he never do nothing for three month but set in he back yard and learn that frog to jump and you bet you he _ do _ learn he too he would give he a little punch behind and the next minute you would see that frog whirling in the air like a doughnut -- see he turn one summerset or may be a couple if he get a good start and come down flat-footed and all right like a cat he get he up so in the matter of ketch fly and kep ' he in practice so constant that he would nail a fly every time as fur as he could see he smiley say all a frog want be education and he could do ` most anything -- and i believe he why i have see he set dan ' l webster down here on this floor -- dan ' l webster be the name of the frog -- and sing out fly dan ' l fly and quicker 'n you could wink he would spring straight up and snake a fly off 'n the counter there and flop down on the floor ag ` in as solid as a gob of mud and fall to scratch the side of he head with he hind foot as indifferent as if he have not no idea he have be doin ' any more 'n any frog might do you never see a frog so modest and straightfor ` ard as he be for all he be so gifted and when it come to fair and square jump on a dead level he could get over more ground at one straddle than any animal of he breed you ever see jump on a dead level be he strong suit you understand and when it come to that smiley would ante up money on he as long as he have a red smiley be monstrous proud of he frog and well he might be for feller that have travel and be everywhere all say he lay over any frog that ever _ they _ see well smiley kep ' the beast in a little lattice box and he use to fetch he downtown sometimes and lay for a bet one day a feller -- a stranger in the camp he be -- come acrost he with he box and say : what might be that you have get in the box and smiley say sorter indifferent-like it might be a parrot or it might be a canary maybe but it be not -- it be only just a frog and the feller take it and look at it careful and turn it round this way and that and say h be -- so ` tis well what be _ he _ good for well smiley say easy and careless he be good enough for _ one _ thing i should judge -- he can outjump any frog in calaveras county the feller take the box again and take another long particular look and give it back to smiley and say very deliberate well he say i do not see no p ` int about that frog that be any better 'n any other frog maybe you do not smiley say maybe you understand frog and maybe you do not understand 'em maybe you have have experience and maybe you be not only a amature as it be anyways i have get _ my _ opinion and i 'll risk forty dollar that he can outjump any frog in calaveras county and the feller study a minute and then say kinder sad like well i be only a stranger here and i be not get no frog but if i have a frog i would bet you and then smiley say that be all right -- that be all right -- if you 'll hold my box a minute i 'll go and get you a frog and so the feller take the box and put up he forty dollar along with smiley 's and set down to wait so he set there a good while think and think to his-self and then he get the frog out and prize he mouth open and take a teaspoon and fill he full of quail shot -- fill he pretty near up to he chin -- and set he on the floor smiley he go to the swamp and slop around in the mud for a long time and finally he ketch a frog and fetch he in and give he to this feller and say : now if you be ready set he alongside of dan ' l with he forepaw just even with dan ` l 's and i 'll give the word then he say one -- two -- three -- _ git _ and he and the feller touch up the frog from behind and the new frog hop off lively but dan ' l give a heave and hyst up he shoulder -- so -- like a frenchman but it war not no use -- he could not budge he be plant as solid as a church and he could not no more stir than if he be anchor out smiley be a good deal surprised and he be disgusted too but he do not have no idea what the matter be of course the feller take the money and start away and when he be go out at the door he sorter jerk he thumb over he shoulder -- so -- at dan ' l and say again very deliberate well he say _ i _ do not see no p ` int about that frog that be any better 'n any other frog smiley he stand scratch he head and look down at dan ' l a long time and at last say i do wonder what in the nation that frog throw off for -- i wonder if there be not something the matter with he -- he ` pear to look mighty baggy somehow and he ketch dan ' l up by the nap of the neck and heft he and say why blame my cat if he do not weigh five pound and turn he upside down and he belch out a double handful of shot and then he see how it be and he be the maddest man -- he set the frog down and take out after that feller but he never ketch he and -- -lrb- here simon wheeler hear he name call from the front yard and get up to see what be want -rrb- and turn to I as he move away he say : just set where you be stranger and rest easy -- i be not go to be go a second but by you leave i do not think that a continuation of the history of the enterprising vagabond _ jim _ smiley would be likely to afford I much information concern the rev _ leonida w _ smiley and so i start away at the door i meet the sociable wheeler return and he buttonhole I and recommence : well thish-yer smiley have a yaller one-eyed cow that do not have no tail only jest a short stump like a bannanner and -- however lack both time and inclination i do not wait to hear about the afflict cow but take my leave elder

elder for he omission on this occasion since he wife have long ago discourage all amorous demonstration on the part of she liege lord and at this particular moment be fill the parting moment with a rattle list of direction concern thread button hook needle and all the many etcetera of a industrious housewife 's basket the elder be laboriously assort these postscript commission in he memory well know that to return with any one of they neglect would cause trouble in the family circle elder brown mount he patient steed that stand sleepily motionless in the warm sunlight with he great pointed ear display to the right and leave as though they owner have grow tired of the life burden they weight inflict upon he and be old soldier fashion ready to forego the once rigid alertness of early training for the pleasure of frequent rest on arm and elder do not you forgit they caliker scrap or you 'll be wantin ' kiver soon a ' no kiver will be a-comin ' elder brown do not turn he head but merely let the whip hand which have be check in its backward motion fall as he answer mechanically the beast he bestride respond with a rapid whisking of its tail and a great show of effort as it amble off down the sandy road the rider 's long leg seem now and then to touch the ground but as the zigzag panel of the rail fence creep behind he and he feel the freedom of the morning begin to act upon he well-trained blood the mechanical manner of the old man 's mind give place to a mild exuberance a weight seem to be lift from it ounce by ounce as the fence panel the weedy corner the

the level ground for the melody he hum softly and then sing strongly in the quaver catchy tone of a good old country churchman be i be glad salvation 's free it be during the singing of this hymn that elder brown 's regular motion-inspiring stroke be for the first time vary he begin to hold he hickory up at certain pause in the melody and beat the change upon the side of he astonished steed the

there be a italic the hickory descend it fall about as regularly and after the fashion of the stick beating upon the bass drum during a funeral march but the beast although convinced that something serious be impend do not consider a funeral march appropriate for the occasion he protest at first with vigorous whisking of he tail and a rapid shift of he ear find these demonstration unavailing and convinced that some urgent cause for hurry have suddenly invade the elder 's serenity as it have he own he begin to cover the ground with frantic leap that would have surprise he owner could he have realize what be go on but elder brown 's eye be half close and he be sing at the top of he voice lose in a trance of divine exaltation for he feel the effect of the invigorating motion bent only on

cheek-bone and a faint tinge upon he prominent nose he nod familiarly to people as he meet they and see not the look of amusement which succeed astonishment upon the various face when he reach the neighborhood of balaam it suddenly occur to he that he might have forget some one of he numerous commission and he pause to think then a brilliant idea rise in he mind he would forestall blame and

1886 by the century co republish in the volume _ mr absalom billingslea and other georgium folk _ -lrb- 1888 -rrb- by richard malcolm johnston -lrb- harper & brother -rrb- -rrb- i mr peterson fluker generally call pink for he fondness for as stylish dress as he could afford be one of that sort of man who habitually seem busy and efficient when they be not he have the bustling activity often noticeable in man of he size and in one way and another have make up as he believe for be so much smaller than most of he adult acquaintance of the male sex prominent among he achievement on that line be get marry to a woman who among other excellent gift have that of be twice as big as she husband fool who on the day after he marriage he have ask with a look at those who have often say that he be too little to have a wife they have a little property to begin with a couple of hundred of acre and two or three negro apiece yet except in the natural increase of the latter the accretion of worldly estate have be inconsiderable till now when they oldest child marann be some fifteen year old these accretion have be save and take care of by mr fluker who be as staid and silent as he be mobile and voluble mr fluker often say that it puzzle he how it be that he make smaller crop than most of he neighbor when if not always convince he could generally put every one of they to silence in discussion upon agricultural topic this puzzle have lead he to not unfrequent rumination in he mind as to whether or not he vocation might lie in something higher than the mere tilling of the ground these rumination have lately take a definite direction and it be after several conversation which he have hold with he friend matt pike mr matt pike be a bachelor of some thirty summer a foretime clerk consecutively in each of the two store of the village but latterly a trader on a limited scale in horse wagon cow and similar object of commerce and at all time a politician he hope of hold office have be continually disappoint until mr john sanks become sheriff and reward with a deputyship some important special service render by he in the late very close canvass now be a chance to rise mr pike think all he want he have often say be a start politics i would remark however have be regard by mr pike as a means rather than a end it be doubtful if he hope to become governor of the state at least before a advanced period in he career he main object now be to get money and he believe that official position would promote he in the line of he ambition faster than be possible to any private station by lead he into more extensive acquaintance with mankind they need they desire and they caprice a deputy sheriff provide that lawyer be not too indulgent in allow acknowledgment of service of court process in postpone levy and sale and in settlement of litigate case might pick up three hundred dollar a good sum for those time a fact which mr pike have know and ponder long it happen just about then that the arrears of rent for the village hotel have so accumulate on mr spouter the last occupant that the owner a indulgent man finally have say what he have be expect for year and year to say that he could not wait on mr spouter forever and eternally it be at this very nick so to speak that mr pike make to mr fluker the suggestion to quit a business so far beneath he power sell out or rent out or tenant out or do something else with he farm march into town plant himself upon the ruin of jacob spouter and begin he upward soar now mr fluker have many and many a time acknowledge that he have ambition so one night he say to he wife : you see how it be here nervy farmin ' somehow do not suit my talon i need to be fling more ` mong people to fetch out what be in I then thar 's marann which be gittin ' to be nigh on to a growd-up woman a ' the child need the s ` iety which you ` bleege to acknowledge be sca ` ce about here six mile from town you brer sam can stay here a ' raise butter chicken egg pig a ' -- a ' -- a ' so forth matt pike say he je ' know they 's money in it a ' special with a housekeeper keerful a ' equinomical like you it be always curious the extent of influence that some man have upon wife who be they superior mr fluker in spite of accident have ever set upon she husband a value that be not recognize outside of he family in this respect there seem a surprising compensation in human life but this remark i make only in pass mr fluker admit in she heart that farm be not she husband 's forte hope like a true wife that it might be find in the new field to which he aspire besides she do not forget that she brother sam have say to she several time privately that if he brer pink would not have so many notion and would let he alone in he management they would all do better she reflect for a day or two and then say : maybe it be best mr fluker i be willin ' to try it for a year anyhow we can not lose much by that as for matt pike i hai not the confidence in he you have still he bein ' a boarder and deputy sheriff he might accidentally do we some good i 'll try it for a year providin ' you 'll fetch I the money as it be pay in for you know i know how to manage that better 'n you do and you know i 'll try to manage it and all the rest of the business for the best to this provision mr fluker give consent qualify by the claim that he be to retain a small margin for indispensable personal exigency for he contend perhaps with justice that no man in the responsible position he be about to take ought to be expect to go about or sit about or even lounge about without even a continental red in he pocket the new house -- i say _ new _ because tongue could not tell the amount of scour scalding and whitewashing that that excellent housekeeper have do before a single stick of she furniture go into it -- the new house i repeat open with six eating boarder at ten dollar a month apiece and two eat and sleep at eleven besides mr pike who make a special contract transient custom be hope to hold its own and that of the county people under the deputy 's patronage and influence to be considerably enlarged in word and other encouragement mr pike be pronounced he could commend honestly and he do so cordially the thing to do pink be to have you price reg ` lar and make people pay up reg ` lar ten dollar for eatin ' je ' so eleb 'n for eatin ' _ a _ ' sleepin ' half a dollar for dinner je ' so quarter apiece for breakfast supper and bed be what i call reason ` ble bo would as for I i sca ` cely know how to rig ` late because you know i be a ' officer now a ' in course i natchel _ have _ to be away sometimes a ' on expense at ` tother place a ' it seem like some ` lowance ought by good rights to be make for that do not you think so why matter o ' course matt what you think i be not so powerful good at figger nervy be s ` posen you speak to she ` bout it oh that be perfec ' unuseless pink i be a ' officer o ' the

nervy say mr fluker to he wife afterwards matt pike 's a sensibler a ' a friendlier a ' a ` commodatiner feller 'n i think then without give detail of the contract he mention merely the willingness of they boarder to resign he bed on occasion of press emergency he be talk mighty fine to I and marann answer mr fluker we 'll see how he hold out one thing i do not like of he doin ' a ' that be the talkin ' ` bout sim marchman to marann a ' makin ' game o ' he country way as he call 'em sech as that be not right it may be as well to explain just here that simeon marchman the person just name by mr fluker a stout industrious young farmer reside with he parent in the country near by where the fluker have dwell before remove to town have be eye marann for a year or two and wait upon she fast-ripening womanhood with intention that he believe to be hide in he own breast though he have take less pain to conceal they from marann than from the rest of he acquaintance not that he have ever tell she of they in so many word but -- oh i need not stop here in the midst of this narration to explain how such intention become know or at least strongly suspect by girl even those less bright than marann fluker simeon have not cordially indorse the movement into town though of course know it be none of he business he have never so much as hint opposition i would not be surprise also if he reflect that there might be some selfishness in he hostility or at least that it be heighten by apprehension personal to himself consider the want of experience in the new tenant matter go on remarkably well mr fluker accustomed to rise from she couch long before the lark manage to the satisfaction of all -- regular boarder single-meal taker and transient people marann go to the village school she mother dress she though with prudent economy as neatly and almost as tastefully as any of she schoolmate while as to study deportment and general progress there be not a girl in the whole school to beat she i do not care who she be ii during a not inconsiderable period mr fluker indulge the honorable conviction that at last he have find the vein in which he best talent lay and he be happy in foresight of the prosperity and felicity which that discovery promise to himself and he family he native activity find many more object for its exertion than before he ride out to the farm not often but sometimes as a matter of duty and be force to acknowledge that sam be manage better than could have be expect in the absence of he own continuous guidance in town he walk about the hotel entertain the guest carve at the meal hover about the store the doctor ' office the wagon and blacksmith shop discuss mercantile medical mechanical question with specialist in all these department throw into they all more and more of politics as the intimacy between he and he patron and chief boarder increase now as to that patron and chief boarder the need of extend he acquaintance seem to press upon mr pike with ever-increasing weight he be here and there all over the county at the county-seat at the county village at justice ' court at executor ' and administrator ' sale at quarterly and protracted religious meeting at barbecue of every dimension on hunting excursion and fishing frolic at social party in all neighborhood it get to be say of mr pike that a freer acceptor of hospitable invitation or a better appreciator of hospitable intention be not and need not to be find possibly in the whole state nor be this admirable deportment confine to the county in which he hold so high official position he attend among other occasion less public the spring session of the supreme and county court in the four adjoining county : the guest of acquaintance old and new over there when start upon such travels he would sometimes breakfast with he travel companion in the village and if somewhat belated in the return sup with he also yet when at fluker ' no man could have be a more cheerful and otherwise satisfactory boarder than mr matt pike he praise every dish set before he brag to they very face of he host and hostess and in spite of he absence be the oftenest to sit and chat with marann when she mother would let she go into the parlor here and everywhere about the house in the dining-room in the passage at the foot of the stair he would joke with marann about she country beau as he style poor sim marchman and he would talk as though he be rather ashamed of sim and want marann to string she bow for higher game brer sam do manage well not only the field but the yard every Saturday of the world he send in something or other to he sister i do not know whether i ought to tell it or not but for the sake of what be due to pure veracity i will on as many as three different occasion sim marchman as if he have lose all self-respect or have not a particle of tact bring in himself instead of send by a negro a bucket of butter and a coop of spring chicken as a free gift to mr fluker i do think on my soul that mr matt pike be much amuse by such degradation -- however he must say that they be all first-rate as for marann she be very sorry for sim and wish he have not bring these good thing at all nobody know how it come about but when the fluker have be in town somewhere between two and three month sim marchman who -lrb- to use he own word -rrb- have never bother she a great deal with he visit begin to suspect that what few he make be receive by marann lately with less cordiality than before and so one day know no better in he awkward straightforward country manners he want to know the reason why then marann grow distant and ask sim the follow question : you know where mr pike 's go mr marchman now the fact be and she know it that marann fluker have never before not since she be bear address that boy as _ mister _ the visitor 's face redden and redden no he falter in answer no -- no -- _ ma'am _ i should say i -- i do not know where mr pike

omission of the shake of sim 's and marann 's hand be compensate at they parting that afternoon i be more confident on this point because at the end of the year those hand be join inseparably by the preacher but this be when they have all go back to they old home for if mr fluker do not become fully convince that he mathematical education be not advance quite enough for all the exigency of hotel-keep he wife declare that she have have enough of it and that she and marann be go home mr fluker may be say therefore to have follow rather than lead he family on the return as for the deputy

english and i 'll bet that they three child be better bring up than most of -- _ two _ child correct my wife three he tell I my dear she say there be _ two _ he say three you have simply forget i be _ sure _ she tell I they have only two -- a boy and a girl well i do not enter into particulars no dear and you could not have understand he two child all right i say but i do not think it be all right as a near-sighted man learn by enforced observation to recognize person at a distance when the face be not visible to the normal eye so the man with a bad memory learn almost unconsciously to listen carefully and report accurately my memory be bad but i have not have time to forget that mr brewster brede have tell I that afternoon that he have three child at present leave in the care of he mother-in-law while he and mr brede take they summer vacation two child repeat my wife and they be stay with he aunt jenny he tell I with he mother-in-law i put in my wife look at I with a serious expression man may not remember much of what they be tell about child but any man know the difference between a aunt and a mother-in-law but do not you think they be nice people ask my wife oh certainly i reply only they seem to be a little mixed up about they child that be not a nice thing to say return my wife i could not deny it \* \* \* \* \* and yet the next morning when the brede come down and seat themselves opposite we at table beam and smile in they natural pleasant well-bred fashion i know to a social certainty that they be nice people he be a fine-looking fellow in he neat tennis-flannel slim graceful twenty-eight or thirty year old with a frenchy point beard she be nice in all she pretty clothes and she herself be pretty with that type of prettiness which outwear most other type -- the prettiness that lie in a round figure a dusky skin plump rosy cheek white tooth and black eye she might have be twenty-five you guess that she be prettier than she be at twenty and that she would be prettier still at forty and nice people be all we want to make we happy in mr jacobus 's summer boarding-house on top of orange mountain for a week we have come down to breakfast each morning wonder why we waste the precious day of idleness with the company gather around the jacobus board what joy of human companionship be to be have out of mr tabb and miss hoogencamp the two middle-aged gossip from scranton pa -- out of mr and mr biggle a indurated head-bookkeeper and he prim and censorious wife -- out of old major halkit a retired business man who have once sell a few share on commission write for circular of every stock company that be start and try to induce every one to invest who would listen to he we look around at those dull face the truthful index of mean and barren mind and decide that we would leave that morning then we eat mr jacobus 's biscuit light as aurora 's cloudlet drink she honest coffee inhale the perfume of the late azalea with which she deck she table and decide to postpone we departure one more day and then we wander out to take we morning glance at what we call we view and it seem to we as if tabb and hoogencamp and halkit and the bigglese could not drive we away in a year i be not surprise when after breakfast my wife invite the brede to walk with we to we view the hoogencamp-biggle-tabb-halkit contingent never stir off jacobus 's veranda but we both feel that the brede would not profane that sacred scene we stroll slowly across the field pass through the little belt of wood and as i hear mr brede 's little cry of startled rapture i motioned to brede to look up by jove he cry heavenly we look off from the brow of the mountain over fifteen mile of billow green to where far across a far stretch of pale blue lay a dim purple line that we know be staten island town and village lay before we and under we there be ridge and hill upland and lowland wood and plain all mass and mingle in that great silent sea of sunlit green for silent it be to we stand in the silence of a high place -- silent with a Sunday stillness that make we listen without take thought for the sound of bell come up from the spire that rise above the tree-top -- the tree-top that lay as far beneath we as the light cloud be above we that drop great shadow upon we head and faint speck of shade upon the broad sweep of land at the mountain 's foot and so that be _ you _ view ask mr brede after a moment you be very generous to make it ours too then we lay down on the grass and brede begin to talk in a gentle voice as if he feel the influence of the place he have paddle a canoe in he earlier day he say and he know every river and creek in that vast stretch of landscape he find he landmark and point out to we where the passaic and the hackensack flow invisible to we hide behind great ridge that in we sight be but combing of the green wave upon which we look down and yet on the further side of those broad ridge and rise be score of village -- a little world of country life lie unseen under we eye a good deal like look at humanity he say there be such a thing as get so far above we fellow man that we see only one side of they ah how much better be this sort of talk than the chatter and gossip of the tabb and the hoogencamp -- than the major 's dissertation upon he everlasting circular my wife and i exchange glance now when i go up the matterhorn mr brede begin why dear interrupted he wife i do not know you ever go up the matterhorn it -- it be five year ago say mr brede hurriedly i -- i do not tell you -- when i be on the other side you know -- it be rather dangerous -- well as i be say -- it look -- oh it do not look at all like this a cloud float overhead throw its great shadow over the field where we lay the shadow pass over the mountain 's brow and reappear far below a rapidly decrease blot fly eastward over the golden green my wife and i exchange glance once more somehow the shadow linger over we all as we go home the brede go side by side along the narrow path and my wife and i walk together _ should you think _ she ask I that a man would climb the matterhorn the very first year he be marry i do not know my dear i answer evasively this be not the first year i have be marry not by a good many and i would not climb it -- for a farm you know what i mean she say i do \* \* \* \* \* when we reach the boarding-house mr jacobus take I aside you know he begin he discourse my wife she uset to live in n ' york i do not know but i say yes she say the number on the street run criss-cross-like thirty-four 's on one side o ' the street a ' thirty-five on t ` other how 's that that be the invariable rule i believe then -- i say -- these here new folk that you 'n' you wife seem so mighty take up with -- d'ye know anything about 'em i know nothing about the character of you boarder mr jacobus i reply conscious of some irritability if i choose to associate with any of they -- jess so -- jess so break in jacobus i hai not nothin ' to say ag ` inst yer sosherbil ` ty but do ye _ know _ they why certainly not i reply well -- that be all i wuz askin ' ye ye see when _ he _ come here to take the room -- you be not here then -- he tell my wife that he live at number thirty-four in he street a ' yistiddy _ she _ tell she that they live at number thirty-five he say he live in a apartment-house now there can not be no apartment-house on two side of the same street kin they what street be it i inquire wearily hundred 'n' twenty-first street may be i reply still more wearily that be harlem nobody know what people will do in harlem i go up to my wife 's room do not you think it be queer she ask I i think i 'll have a talk with that young man to-night i say and see if he can give some account of himself but my dear my wife say gravely _ she _ do not know whether they have have the measles or not why great scott i exclaimed they must have have they when they be child please do not be stupid say my wife i mean _ they _ child after dinner that night -- or rather after supper for we have dinner in the middle of the day at jacobus 's -- i walk down the long verandah to ask brede who be placidly smoking at the other end to accompany I on a twilight stroll half way down i meet major halkit that friend of yours he say indicate the unconscious figure at the further end of the house seem to be a queer sort of a dick he tell I that he be out of business and just look round for a chance to invest he capital and i have be tell he what a everlasting big show he have to take stock in the capitoline trust company -- start next month -- four million capital -- i tell you all about it ` oh well ' he say ` let 's wait and think about it ' ` wait ' say i ` the capitoline trust company will not wait for _ you _ my boy this be let you in on the ground floor ' say i ` and it be now or never ' ` oh let it wait ' say he i do not know what be in - _ to _ the man i do not know how well he know he own business major i say as i start again for brede 's end of the veranda but i be trouble none the less the major could not have influence the sale of one share of stock in the capitoline company but that stock be a great investment a rare chance for a purchaser with a few thousand dollar perhaps it be no more remarkable that brede should not invest than that i should not -- and yet it seem to add one circumstance more to the other suspicious circumstance \* \* \* \* \* when i go upstairs that evening i find my wife put she hair to bed -- i do not know how i can better describe a operation familiar to every married man i wait until the last tress be coil up and then i speak : i have talk with brede i say and i do not have to catechize he he seem to feel that some sort of explanation be look for and he be very outspoken you be right about the child -- that be i must have misunderstand he there be only two but the matterhorn episode be simple enough he do not realize how dangerous it be until he have get so far into it that he could not back out and he do not tell she because he would leave she here you see and under the circumstance -- leave she here cry my wife i have be sit with she the whole afternoon sewing and she tell I that he leave she at geneva and come back and take she to basle and the baby be bear there -- now i be sure dear because i ask she perhaps i be mistake when i think he say she be on this side of the water i suggest with bitter bite irony you poor dear do i abuse you say my wife but do you know mr tabb say that _ she _ do not know how many lump of sugar he take in he coffee now that seem queer do not it it do it be a small thing but it look queer very queer \* \* \* \* \* the next morning it be clear that war be declare against the brede they come down to breakfast somewhat late and as soon as they arrive the bigglese swoop up the last fragment that remain on they plate and make a stately march out of the dining-room then miss hoogencamp arise and depart leave a whole fish-ball on she plate even as atalanta might have drop a apple behind she to tempt she pursuer to check he speed so miss hoogencamp leave that fish-ball behind she and between she maiden self and contamination we have finish we breakfast my wife and i before the brede appear we talk it over and agree that we be glad that we have not be oblige to take side upon such insufficient testimony after breakfast it be the custom of the male half of the jacobus household to go around the corner of the building and smoke they pipe and cigar where they would not annoy the lady we sit under a trellis cover with a grapevine that have bear no grape in the memory of man this vine however bear leaf and these on that pleasant summer morning shield from we two person who be in earnest conversation in the straggle half-dead flower-garden at the side of the house i do not want we hear mr jacobus say to enter in no man 's _ pry _ - vacy but i do want to know who it may be like that i hev in my house now what i ask of _ you _ and i do not want you to take it as in no way _ personal _ be -- hev you you merridge-license with you no we hear the voice of mr brede reply have you yours i think it be a chance shot but it tell all the same the major -lrb- he be a widower -rrb- and mr biggle and i look at each other and mr jacobus on the other side of the grape-trellis look at -- i do not know what -- and be as silent as we be where be _ you _ marriage-license married reader do you know four man not include mr brede stand or sit on one side or the other of that grape-trellis and not one of they know where he marriage-license be each of we have have one -- the major have have three but where be they where be _ yours _ tuck in you best-man 's pocket deposit in he desk -- or wash to a pulp in he white waistcoat -lrb- if white waistcoat be the fashion of the hour -rrb- wash out of existence -- can you tell where it be can you -- unless you be one of those people who frame that interesting document and hang it upon they drawing-room wall mr brede 's voice arise after a awful stillness of what seem like five minute and be probably thirty seconds : mr jacobus will you make out you bill at once and let I pay it i shall leave by the six o'clock train and will you also send the wagon for my trunk i hai not say i want to hev ye leave -- begin mr jacobus but brede cut he short bring I you bill but remonstrate jacobus ef ye be not -- bring I you bill say mr brede \* \* \* \* \* my wife and i go out for we morning 's walk but it seem to we when we look at we view as if we could only see those invisible village of which brede have tell we -- that other side of the ridge and rise of which we catch no glimpse from lofty hill or from the height of human self-esteem we mean to stay out until the brede have take they departure but we return just in time to see pete the jacobus darkey the blacker of boot the brasher of coat the general handy-man of the house load the brede trunk on the jacobus wagon and as we step upon the verandah down come mr brede lean on mr brede 's arm as though she be ill and it be clear that she have be cry there be heavy ring about she pretty black eye my wife take a step toward she look at that dress dear she whisper she never think anything like this be go to happen when she put _ that _ on it be a pretty delicate dainty dress a graceful narrow-striped affair she hat be trim with a narrow-striped silk of the same color -- maroon and white -- and in she hand she hold a parasol that match she dress she be have a new dress on twice a day say my wife but that be the prettiest yet oh somehow -- i be _ awfully _ sorry they be go but go they be they move toward the step mr brede look toward my wife and my wife move toward mr brede but the ostracize woman as though she feel the deep humiliation of she position turn sharply away and open she parasol to shield she eye from the sun a shower of rice -- a half-pound shower of rice -- fall down over she pretty hat and she pretty dress and fall in a spatter circle on the floor outline she skirt -- and there it lay in a broad uneven band bright in the morning sun mr brede be in my wife 's arm sob as if she young heart would break oh you poor dear silly child my wife cry as mr brede sob on she shoulder why _ do not _ you tell we w-w-w-we do not want to be t-t-taken for a b-b-b-b-bridal couple sob mr brede and we d-d-didn ' t _ dream _ what awful lie we would have to tell and all the aw-awful mixed-up-ness of it oh dear dear dear \* \* \* \* \* pete command mr jacobus put back they trunk these folk stay here 's long 's they want ter mr brede -- he hold out a large hard hand -- i would orter have know better he say and my last doubt of mr brede vanish as he shake that grimy hand in manly fashion the two woman be walk off toward we view each with a arm about the other 's waist -- touch by a sudden sisterhood of sympathy gentleman say mr brede address jacobus biggle the major and I there be a hostelry down the street where they sell honest new jersey beer i recognize the obligation of the situation we five man file down the street the two woman go toward the pleasant slope where the sunlight gilded the forehead of the great hill on mr jacobus 's veranda lay a spattered circle of shine grain of rice two of mr jacobus 's pigeon fly down and pick up the shine grain make grateful noise far down in they throat the buller-podington compact by frank richard stockton -lrb- 1834-1902 -rrb- -lrb- from _ scribner 's magazine _ August 1897 republish in _ afield and afloat _ by frank richard stockton copyright 1900 by charle scribner 's son reprint by permission of the publisher -rrb- i tell you william say thoma buller to he friend mr podington i be truly sorry about it but i can not arrange for it this year now as to _ my _ invitation -- that be very different of course it be different be the reply but i be oblige to say as i say before that i really can not accept it remark similar to these have be make by thoma buller and william podington at least once a year for some five year they be old friend they have be schoolboy together and have be associate in business since they be young man they have now reach a vigorous middle age they be each marry and each have a house in the country in which he reside for a part of the year they be warmly attach to each other and each be the best friend which the other have in this world but during all these year neither of they have visit the other in he country home the reason for this avoidance of each other at they respective rural residence may be briefly state mr buller 's country house be situate by the sea and he be very fond of the water he have a good cat-boat which he sail himself with much judgment and skill and it be he greatest pleasure to take he friend and visitor upon little excursion on the bay but mr podington be desperately afraid of the water and he be particularly afraid of any craft sail by a amateur if he friend buller would have employ a professional mariner of year and experience to steer and manage he boat podington might have be willing to take a occasional sail but as buller always insist upon sail he own boat and take it ill if any of he visitor doubt he ability to do so properly podington do not wish to wind the self-love of he friend and he do not wish to be drown consequently he could not bring himself to consent to go to buller 's house by the sea to receive he good friend buller at he own house in the beautiful upland region in which he live would have be a great joy to mr podington but buller could not be induce to visit he podington be very fond of horse and always drive himself while buller be more afraid of horse than he be of elephant or lion to one or more horse drive by a coachman of year and experience he do not always object but to a horse drive by podington who have much experience and knowledge regard mercantile affair but be merely a amateur horseman he most decidedly and strongly object he do not wish to hurt he friend 's feeling by refuse to go out to drive with he but he would not rack he own nervous system by accompany he therefore it be that he have not yet visit the beautiful upland country residence of mr podington at last this state of thing grow awkward mr buller and mr podington often with they family visit each other at they country house but the fact that on these occasion they be never accompany by they husband cause more and more gossip among they neighbor both in the upland country and by the sea one day in spring as the two sit in they city office where mr podington have just repeat he annual invitation he friend reply to he thus : william if i come to see you this summer will you visit I the thing be begin to look a little ridiculous and people be talk about it mr podington put he hand to he brow and for a few moment close he eye in he mind he see a cat-boat upon its side the sail spread out over the water and two man almost entirely immerse in the wave make effort to reach the side of the boat one of these be get on very well -- that be buller the other seem about to sink he arm be uselessly wave in the air -- that be himself but he open he eye and look bravely out of the window it be time to conquer all this it be indeed grow ridiculous buller have be sail many year and have never be upset yes say he i will do it i be ready any time you name mr buller rise and stretch out he hand good say he it be a compact buller be the first to make the promise country visit he have not mention the subject of horse to he friend but he know through mr buller that podington still continue to be he own driver she have inform he however that at present he be accustom to drive a big black horse which in she opinion be as gentle and reliable as these animal ever become and she could not imagine how anybody could be afraid of he so when the next morning after he arrival mr buller be ask by he host if he would like to take a drive he suppress a certain rise emotion and say that it would please he very much when the good black horse have jog along a pleasant road for half a hour mr buller begin to feel that perhaps for all these year he have be labor under a misconception it seem to be possible that there be some horse to which surround circumstance in the shape of sight and sound be so irrelevant that they be to a certain degree entirely safe even when guide and control by a amateur hand as they pass some meadow-land somebody behind a hedge fire a gun mr buller be frightened but the horse be not william say buller look cheerfully around he i have no idea that you live in such a pretty country in fact i might almost call it beautiful you have not any wide stretch of water such as i like so much but here be a pretty river those roll hill be very charming and beyond you have the blue of the mountain it be lovely say he friend i never get tire of drive through this country of course the seaside be very fine but here we have such a variety of scenery mr buller could not help think that sometimes the seaside be a little monotonous and that he have lose a great deal of pleasure by not vary he summer by go up to spend a week or two with podington william say he how long have you have this horse about two year say mr podington before i get he i use to drive a pair heaven think buller how lucky i be not to come two year ago and he regret for not sooner visit he friend greatly decrease now they come to a place where the stream by which the road run have be dam for a mill and have widen into a beautiful pond there now cry mr buller that be what i like william you seem to have everything this be really a very pretty sheet of water and the reflection of the tree over there make a charming picture you can not get that at the seaside you know mr podington be delighted he face glow he be rejoice at the pleasure of he friend i tell you thoma say he that -- william exclaimed buller with a sudden squirm in he seat what be that i hear be that a train yes say mr podington that be the ten-forty up do it come near here ask mr buller nervously do it go over that bridge yes say podington but it can not hurt we for we road go under the bridge we be perfectly safe there be no risk of accident but you horse you horse exclaim buller as the train come nearer and nearer what will he do do say podington he 'll do what he be do now he do not mind train but look here william exclaimed buller it will get there just as we do no horse could stand a roar up in the air like that podington laugh he would not mind it in the least say he come come now cry buller really i can not stand this just stop a minute william and let I get out it set all my nerve quiver mr podington smile with a superior smile oh you need not get out say he there be not the least danger in the world but i do not want to make you nervous and i will turn around and drive the other way but you can not scream buller this road be not wide enough and that train be nearly here please stop the imputation that the road be not wide enough for he to turn be too much for mr podington to bear he be very proud of he ability to turn a vehicle in a narrow place turn say he that be the easiest thing in the world see a little to the right then a back then a sweep to the left and we will be go the other way and instantly he begin the maneuver in which he be such a adept oh thomas cry buller half rise in he seat that train be almost here and we be almost -- mr podington be about to say turn around but he stop mr buller 's exclamation have make he a little nervous and in he anxiety to turn quickly he have pull upon he horse 's bit with more energy than be actually necessary and he nervousness be communicate to the horse that animal back with such extraordinary vigor that the hind wheel of the wagon go over a bit of grass by the road and into the water the sudden jolt give a new impetus to mr buller 's fear you 'll upset he cry and not thinking of what he be about he lay hold of he friend 's arm the horse startle by this sudden jerk upon he bit which combine with the thundering of the train which be now on the bridge make he think that something extraordinary be about to happen give a sudden and forcible start backward so that not only the hind wheel of the light wagon but the fore wheel and he own hind leg go into the water as the bank at this spot slope steeply the wagon continue to go backward despite the effort of the agitate horse to find a footing on the crumble edge of the bank whoa cry mr buller get up exclaimed mr podington apply he whip upon the plunge beast but exclamation and castigation have no effect upon the horse the original bed of the stream run close to the road and the bank be so steep and the earth so soft that it be impossible for the horse to advance or even maintain he foot back back he go until the whole equipage be in the water and the wagon be afloat this vehicle be a road wagon without a top and the joint of its box-body be tight enough to prevent the water from immediately enter it so somewhat deeply sunken it rest upon the water there be a current in this part of the pond and it turn the wagon downstream the horse be now entirely immerse in the water with the exception of he head and the upper part of he neck and unable to reach the bottom with he foot he make vigorous effort to swim mr podington the rein and whip in he hand sit horrify and pale the accident be so sudden he be so startled and so frightened that for a moment he could not speak a word mr buller on the other hand be now lively and alert the wagon have no sooner float away from the shore than he feel himself at home he be upon he favorite element water have no fear for he he see that he friend be nearly frighten out of he wit and that figuratively speak he must step to the helm and take charge of the vessel he stand up and gaze about he put she across stream he shout she can not make headway against this current head she to that clump of tree on the other side the bank be lower there and we can beach she move a little the other way we must trim boat now then pull on you starboard rein podington obey and the horse slightly change he direction you see say buller it will not do to sail straight across because the current would carry we down and land we below that spot mr podington say not a word he expect every moment to see the horse sink into a watery grave it be not so bad after all be it podington if we have a rudder and a bit of a sail it would be a great help to the horse this wagon be not a bad boat the despairing podington look at he foot it be come in he say in a husky voice thoma the water be over my shoe that be so say buller i be so use to water i do not notice it she leak do you carry anything to bail she out with bail cry podington now find he voice oh thomas we be sink that be so say buller she leak like a sieve the weight of the running-gear and of the two man be entirely too much for the buoyancy of the wagon body the water rapidly rise toward the top of its side we be go to drown cry podington suddenly rise lick he lick he exclaim buller make he swim faster there be nothing to lick cry podington vainly lash at the water for he could not reach the horse 's head the poor man be dreadfully frightened he have never even imagine it possible that he should be drown in he own wagon whoop cry buller as the water rise over the side steady yourself old boy or you 'll go overboard and the next moment the wagon body sink out of sight but it do not go down very far the deepest part of the channel of the stream have be pass and with a bump the wheel strike the bottom heaven exclaim buller we be aground aground exclaimed podington heaven be praise as the two man stand up in the submerge wagon the water be above they knee and when podington look out over the surface of the pond now so near he face it seem like a sheet of water he have never see before it be something horrible threaten to rise and envelop he he tremble so that he could scarcely keep he footing william say he companion you must sit down if you do not you 'll tumble overboard and be drown there be nothing for you to hold to sit down say podington gaze blankly at the water around he i can not do that at this moment the horse make a slight movement have touch bottom after he effort in swim across the main bed of the stream with a float wagon in tow he have stand for a few moment he head and neck well above water and he back barely visible beneath the surface have recover he breath he now think it be time to move on at the first step of the horse mr podington begin to totter instinctively he clutch buller sit down cry the latter or you 'll have we both overboard there be no help for it down sit mr podington and as with a great splash he come heavily upon the seat the water rise to he waist ough say he thoma shout for help no use do that reply buller still stand on he nautical leg i do not see anybody and i do not see any boat we 'll get out all right just you stick tight to the thwart the what feebly ask the other oh the seat i mean we can get to the shore all right if you steer the horse straight head he more across the pond i can not head he cry podington i have drop the rein good gracious cry mr buller that be bad can not you steer he by shout ` gee ' and ` haw ' no say podington he be not a ox but perhaps i can stop he and with as much voice as he could summon he call out : whoa and the horse stop if you can not steer he any other way say buller we must get the rein lend I you whip i have drop that too say podington there it float oh dear say buller i guess i 'll have to dive for they if he be to run away we should be in a awful fix do not get out do not get out exclaimed podington you can reach over the dashboard as that be under water say buller it will be the same thing as diving but it be get to be do and i 'll try it do not you move now i be more use to water than you be mr buller take off he hat and ask he friend to hold it he think of he watch and other contents of he pocket but there be no place to put they so he give they no more consideration then bravely get on he knee in the water he lean over the dashboard almost disappear from sight with he disengaged hand mr podington grasp the submerge coat-tail of he friend in a few seconds the upper part of mr buller rise from the water he be drip and puff and mr podington could not but think what a difference it make in the appearance of he friend to have he hair plaster close to he head i get hold of one of they say the sputter buller but it be fast to something and i could not get it loose be it thick and wide ask podington yes be the answer it do seem so oh that be a trace say podington i do not want that the rein be thinner and lighter now i remember they be say buller i 'll go down again again mr buller lean over the dashboard and this time he remain down longer and when he come up he puff and sputter more than before be this it say he hold up a strip of wet leather yes say podington you have get the rein well take they and steer i would have find they sooner if he tail have not get into my eye that long tail 's float down there and spread itself out like a fan it tangle itself all around my head it would have be much easier if he have be a bob-tailed horse now then say podington take you hat thoma and i 'll try to drive mr buller put on he hat which be the only dry thing about he and the nervous podington start the horse so suddenly that even the sea-leg of buller be surprised and he come very near go backward into the water but recover himself he sit down i do not wonder you do not like to do this william say he wet as i be it be ghastly encourage by he master 's voice and by the feeling of the familiar hand upon he bit the horse move bravely on but the bottom be very rough and uneven sometimes the wheel strike a large stone terrifying mr buller who think they be go to upset and sometimes they sink into soft mud horrifying mr podington who think they be go to drown thus proceed they present a strange sight at first mr podington hold he hand above the water as he drive but he soon find this awkward and drop they to they usual position so that nothing be visible above the water but the head and neck of a horse and the head and shoulder of two man now the submarine equipage come to a low place in the bottom and even mr buller shudder as the water rise to he chin podington give a howl of horror and the horse with high uplifted head be oblige to swim at this moment a boy with a gun come stroll along the road and hearing mr podington 's cry he cast he eye over the water instinctively he raise he weapon to he shoulder and then in a instant perceive that the object he behold be not aquatic bird he drop he gun and run yell down the road toward the mill but the hollow in the bottom be a narrow one and when it be pass the depth of the water gradually decrease the back of the horse come into view the dashboard become visible and the body and the spirit of the two man rapidly rise now there be vigorous splashing and tug and then a jet black horse shine as if he have be newly varnish pull a drip wagon contain two well-soaked man upon a shelve shore oh i be chill to the bone say podington i should think so reply he friend if you have get to be wet it be a great deal pleasanter under the water there be a field-road on this side of the pond which podington well know and proceed along this they come to the bridge and get into the main road now we must get home as fast as we can cry podington or we shall both take cold i wish i have not lose my whip hi now get along podington be now full of life and energy he wheel be on the hard road and he be himself again when he find he head be turn toward he home the horse set off at a great rate hi there cry podington i be so sorry i lose my whip whip say buller hold fast to the side of the seat surely you do not want he to go any faster than this and look here william he add it seem to I we be much more likely to take cold in we wet clothes if we rush through the air in this way really it seem to I that horse be run away not a bit of it cry podington he want to get home and he want he dinner be not he a fine horse look how he step out step out say buller i think i would like to step out myself do not you think it would be wiser for I to walk home william that will warm I up it will take you a hour say he friend stay where you be and i 'll have you in a dry suit of clothes in less than fifteen minute i tell you william say mr buller as the two sit smoking after dinner what you ought to do you should never go out drive without a life-preserver and a pair of oar i always take they it would make you feel safer mr buller go home the next day because mr podington 's clothes do not fit he and he own outdoor suit be so shrunken as to be uncomfortable besides there be another reason connect with the desire of horse to reach they home which prompt he return but he have not forget he compact with he friend and in the course of a week he write to podington invite he to spend some day with he mr podington be a man of honor and in spite of he recent unfortunate water experience he would not break he word he go to mr buller 's seaside home at the time appoint early on the morning after he arrival before the family be up mr podington go out and stroll down to the edge of the bay he go to look at buller 's boat he be well aware that he would be ask to take a sail and as buller have drive with he it would be impossible for he to decline sailing with buller but he must see the boat there be a train for he home at a quarter past seven if he be not on the premise he could not be ask to sail if buller 's boat be a little flimsy thing he would take that train -- but he would wait and see there be only one small boat anchor near the beach and a man -- apparently a fisherman -- inform mr podington that it belong to mr buller podington look at it eagerly it be not very small and not flimsy do you consider that a safe boat he ask the fisherman safe reply the man you could not upset she if you try look at she breadth of beam you could go anywhere in that boat be you think of buy she the idea that he would think of buy a boat make mr podington laugh the information that it would be impossible to upset the little vessel have greatly cheer he and he could laugh shortly after breakfast mr buller like a nurse with a dose of medicine come to mr podington with the expect invitation to take a sail now william say he host i understand perfectly you feeling about boat and what i wish to prove to you be that it be a feeling without any foundation i do not want to shock you or make you nervous so i be not go to take you out today on the bay in my boat you be as safe on the bay as you would be on land -- a little safer perhaps under certain circumstance to which we will not allude -- but still it be sometimes a little rough and this at first might cause you some uneasiness and so i be go to let you begin you education in the sailing line on perfectly smooth water about three mile back of we there be a very pretty lake several mile long it be part of the canal system which connect the town with the railroad i have send my boat to the town and we can walk up there and go by the canal to the lake it be only about three mile if he have to sail at all this kind of sailing suit mr podington a canal a quiet lake and a boat which could not be upset when they reach the town the boat be in the canal ready for they now say mr buller you get in and make yourself comfortable my idea be to hitch on to a canal-boat and be tow to the lake the boat generally start about this time in the morning and i will go and see about it mr podington under the direction of he friend take a seat in the stern of the sailboat and then he remark : thoma have you a life-preserver on board you know i be not use to any kind of vessel and i be clumsy nothing might happen to the boat but i might trip and fall overboard and i can not swim all right say buller here be a life-preserver and you can put it on i want you to feel perfectly safe now i will go and see about the tow but mr buller find that the canal-boat would not start at they usual time the loading of one of they be not finish and he be inform that he might have to wait for a hour or more this do not suit mr buller at all and he do not hesitate to show he annoyance i tell you sir what you can do say one of the man in charge of the boat if you do not want to wait till we be ready to start we 'll let you have a boy and a horse to tow you up to the lake that will not cost you much and they 'll be back before we want 'em the bargain be make and mr buller joyfully return to he boat with the intelligence that they be not to wait for the canal-boat a long rope with a horse attach to the other end of it be speedily make fast to the boat and with a boy at the head of the horse they start up the canal now this be the kind of sailing i like say mr podington if i live near a canal i believe i would buy a boat and train my horse to tow i could have a long pair of rope-line and drive he myself then when the road be rough and bad the canal would always be smooth this be all very nice reply mr buller who sit by the tiller to keep the boat away from the bank and i be glad to see you in a boat under any circumstance do you know william that although i do not plan it there could not have be a better way to begin you sailing education here we glide along slowly and gently with no possible thought of danger for if the boat should suddenly spring a leak as if it be the body of a wagon all we would have to do would be to step on shore and by the time you get to the end of the canal you will like this gentle motion so much that you will be perfectly ready to begin the second stage of you nautical education yes say mr podington how long do you say this canal be about three mile answer he friend then we will go into the lock and in a few minute we shall be on the lake so far as i be concern say mr podington i wish the canal be twelve mile long i can not imagine anything pleasanter than this if i live anywhere near a canal -- a long canal i mean this one be too short -- i would -- come come now interrupted buller do not be content to stay in the primary school just because it be easy when we get on the lake i will show you that in a boat with a gentle breeze such as we be likely to have today you will find the motion quite as pleasing and ever so much more inspiriting i should not be a bit surprised william if after you have be two or three time on the lake you will ask I -- yes positively ask I -- to take you out on the bay mr podington smile and lean backward he look up at the beautiful blue sky you can not give I anything better than this thoma say he but you need not think i be weaken you drive with I and i will sail with you the thought come into buller 's mind that he have do both of these thing with podington but he do not wish to call up unpleasant memory and say nothing about half a mile from the town there stand a small cottage where house-cleaning be go on and on a fence not far from the canal there hang a carpet gaily adorn with stripe and spot of red and yellow when the drowsy tow-horse come abreast of the house and the carpet catch he eye he suddenly stop and give a start toward the canal then impressed with a horror of the glaring apparition he gather himself up and with a bind dash along the tow-path the astounded boy give a shout but be speedily leave behind the boat of mr buller shot forward as if she have be strike by a squall the terrify horse speed on as if a red and yellow demon be after he the boat bound and plunge and frequently strike the grassy bank of the canal as if it would break itself to piece mr podington clutch the boom to keep himself from be throw out while mr buller both hand upon the tiller frantically endeavor to keep the boat from the bank william he scream he be run away with we we shall be dash to piece can not you get forward and cast off that line what do you mean cry podington as the boom give a great jerk as if it would break its fastening and drag he overboard i mean untie the tow-line we 'll be smash if you do not i can not leave this tiller do not try to stand up hold on to the boom and creep forward steady now or you 'll be overboard mr podington stumble to the bow of the boat he effort greatly impede by the big cork life-preserver tie under he arm and the motion of the boat be so violent and erratic that he be oblige to hold on to the mast with one arm and to try to loosen the knot with the other but there be a great strain on the rope and he could do nothing with one hand cut it cut it cry mr buller i have not a knife reply podington mr buller be terribly frightened he boat be cut through the water as never vessel of she class have speed since sail-boat be invent and bump against the bank as if she be a billiard-ball rebound from the edge of a table he forget he be in a boat he only know that for the first time in he life he be in a runaway he let go the tiller it be of no use to he william he cry let we jump out the next time we be near enough to shore do not do that do not do that reply podington do not jump out in a runaway that be the way to get hurt stick to you seat my boy he can not keep this up much longer he 'll lose he wind mr podington be greatly excited but he be not frighten as buller be he have be in a runaway before and he could not help think how much better a wagon be than a boat in such a case if he be hitch up shorter and i have a snaffle-bit and a stout pair of rein think he i could soon bring he up but mr buller be rapidly lose he wit the horse seem to be go faster than ever the boat bump harder against the bank and at one time buller think they could turn over suddenly a think strike he william he shout tip that anchor over the side throw it in any way mr podington look about he and almost under he foot see the anchor he do not instantly comprehend why buller want it throw overboard but this be not a time to ask question the difficulty impose by the life-preserver and the necessity of hold on with one hand interfere very much with he get at the anchor and throw it over the side but at last he succeed and just as the boat throw up she bow as if she be about to jump on shore the anchor go out and its line shot after it there be a irregular tremble of the boat as the anchor struggle along the bottom of the canal then there be a great shock the boat run into the bank and stop the tow-line be tighten like a guitar-string and the horse jerk back with great violence come tumble in a heap upon the ground instantly mr podington be on the shore and run at the top of he speed toward the horse the astounded animal have scarcely begin to struggle to he foot when podington rush upon he press he head back to the ground and sit upon it hurrah he cry wave he hat above he head get out buller he be all right now presently mr buller approach very much shake up all right he say i do not call a horse flat in a road with a man on he head all right but hold he down till we get he loose from my boat that be the thing to do william cast he loose from the boat before you let he up what will he do when he get up oh he 'll be quiet enough when he get up say podington but if you have get a knife you can cut he trace -- i mean that rope -- but no you need not here come the boy we 'll settle this business in very short order now when the horse be on he foot and all connection between the animal and the boat have be sever mr podington look at he friend thoma say he you seem to have have a hard time of it you have lose you hat and you look as if you have be in a wrestling-match i have reply the other i wrestle with that tiller and i wonder it do not throw I out now approach the boy shall i hitch he on again sir say he he be quiet enough now no cry mr buller i want no more sailing after a horse and besides we can not go on the lake with that boat she have be batter about so much that she must have open a dozen seam the best thing we can do be to walk home mr podington agree with he friend that walk home be the best thing they could do the boat be examine and find to be leak but not very badly and when she mast have be unshipped and everything have be make tight and right on board she be pull out of the way of tow-line and boat and make fast until she could be send for from the town mr buller and mr podington walk back toward the town they have not go very far when they meet a party of boy who upon see they burst into unseemly laughter mister cry one of they you need not be afraid of tumble into the canal why do not you take off you life-preserver and let that other man put it on he head the two friend look at each other and could not help join in the laughter of the boy by george i forget all about this say podington as he unfasten the cork jacket it do look a little super-timid to wear a life-preserver just because one happen to be walk by the side of a canal mr buller tie a handkerchief on he head and mr podington roll up he life-preserver and carry it under he arm thus they reach the town where buller buy a hat podington dispense with he bundle and arrangement be make to bring back the boat runaway in a sailboat exclaim one of the canal boatman when he have hear about the accident upon my word that beat anything that could happen to a man no it do not reply mr buller quietly i have go to the bottom in a founder road-wagon the man look at he fixedly be you ever strike in the mud in a balloon he ask not yet reply mr buller it require ten day to put mr buller 's sailboat into proper condition and for ten day mr podington stay with he friend and enjoy he visit very much they stroll on the beach they take long walk in the back country they fish from the end of a pier they smoke they talk and be happy and content thoma say mr podington on the last evening of he stay i have enjoy myself very much since i have be down here and now thoma if i be to come down again next summer would you mind -- would you mind not -- i would not mind it a bit reply buller promptly i 'll never so much as mention it so you can come along without a thought of it and since you have allude to the subject william he continue i would like very much to come and see you again you know my visit be a very short one this year that be a beautiful country you live in such a variety of scenery such a opportunity for walk and ramble but william if you could only make up you mind not to -- oh that be all right exclaimed podington i do not need to make up my mind you come to my house and you will never so much as hear of it here be my hand upon it and here 's mine say mr buller and they shake hand over a new compact colonel starbottle for the plaintiff by bret harte -lrb- 1839-1902 -rrb- -lrb- from _ harper 's magazine _ march 1901 republish in the volume _ opening in the old trail _ -lrb- 1902 -rrb- by bret harte copyright 1902 by houghton mifflin company the authorize publisher of bret harte 's complete work reprint by they permission -rrb- it have be a day of triumph for colonel starbottle first for he personality as it would have be difficult to separate the colonel 's achievement from he individuality second for he oratorical ability as a sympathetic pleader and third for he function as the leading counsel for the eureka ditch company _ versus _ the state of californium on he strictly legal performance in this issue i prefer not to speak there be those who deny they although the jury have accept they in the face of the ruling of the half-amused half-cynical judge himself for a hour they have laugh with the colonel weep with he be stir to personal indignation or patriotic exaltation by he passionate and lofty period -- what else could they do than give he they verdict if it be allege by some that the american eagle thoma jefferson and the resolution of '98 have nothing whatever to do with the contest of a ditch company over a doubtfully word legislative document that wholesale abuse of the state attorney and he political motive have not the slightest connection with the legal question raise -- it be nevertheless generally accept that the lose party would have be only too glad to have the colonel on they side and colonel starbottle know this as perspire florid and panting he rebutton the lower button of he blue frock-coat which have become loose in a oratorical spasm and readjust he old-fashioned spotless shirt frill above it as he strut from the court-room amidst the hand-shaking and acclamation of he friend and here a unprecedented thing occur the colonel absolutely decline spirituous refreshment at the neighbor palmetto saloon and declare he intention of proceed directly to he office in the adjoining square nevertheless the colonel quit the building alone and apparently unarmed except for he faithful gold-headed stick which hang as usual from he forearm the crowd gaze after he with undisguised admiration of this new evidence of he pluck it be remember also that a mysterious note have be hand to he at the conclusion of he speech -- evidently a challenge from the state attorney it be quite plain that the colonel -- a practice duellist -- be hasten home to answer it but herein they be wrong the note be in a female hand and simply request the colonel to accord a interview with the writer at the colonel 's office as soon as he leave the court but it be a engagement that the colonel -- as devote to the fair sex as he be to the code -- be no less prompt in accept he flick away the dust from he spotless white trousers and varnished boot with he handkerchief and settle he black cravat under he byron collar as he near he office he be surprised however on open the door of he private office to find he visitor already there he be still more startle to find she somewhat past middle age and plainly attire but the colonel be bring up in a school of southern politeness already antique in the republic and he bow of courtesy belong to the epoch of he shirt frill and strapped trousers no one could have detect he disappointment in he manner albeit he sentence be short and incomplete but the colonel 's colloquial speech be apt to be fragmentary incoherency of he larger oratorical utterance a thousand pardon -- for -- er -- have keep a lady wait -- er but -- er -- congratulation of friend -- and -- er -- courtesy due to they -- er -- interfere with -- though perhaps only heighten -- by procrastination -- pleasure of -- ha and the colonel complete he sentence with a gallant wave of he fat but white and well-kept hand yes i come to see you along o ' that speech of yours i be in court when i hear you gettin ' it off on that jury i say to myself that be the kind o ' lawyer _ i _ want a man that be flowery and convincin ' just the man to take up we case ah it be a matter of business i see say the colonel inwardly relieved but externally careless and -- er -- may i ask the nature of the case well it be a breach-o ' - promise suit say the visitor calmly if the colonel have be surprise before he be now really startle and with a add horror that require all he politeness to conceal breach-of-promise case be he peculiar aversion he have always hold they to be a kind of litigation which could have be obviate by the prompt killing of the masculine offender -- in which case he would have gladly defend the killer but a suit for damages -- _

he she look more like a child than ever the colonel spend that afternoon in make diplomatic inquiry he find he youthful client be the daughter of a widow who have a small ranch on the cross-road near the new free-will baptist church -- the evident theater of this pastoral they lead a secluded life the girl be little known in the town and she beauty and fascination apparently not yet be a recognize fact the colonel feel a pleasurable relief at this and a general satisfaction he could not account for he few inquiry concern mr hotchkiss only confirm he own impression of the alleged lover -- a serious-minded practically abstracted man -- abstentive of youthful society and the last man apparently capable of levity of the affection or serious flirtation the colonel be mystify -- but determine of purpose -- whatever that purpose might have be the next day he be at he office at the same hour he be alone -- as usual -- the colonel 's office really be he private lodgings dispose in connect room a single apartment reserve for consultation he have no clerk he papers and briefs be take by he faithful body-servant and ex-slave jim to another firm who do he office-work since the death of major stryker -- the colonel 's only law partner who fall in a duel some year previous with a fine constancy the colonel still retain he partner 's name on he door-plate -- and it be allege by the superstitious keep a certain invincibility also through the _ mane _ of that lament and somewhat fear man the colonel consult he watch whose heavy gold case still show the mark of a providential interference with a bullet destine for its owner and replace it with some difficulty and shortness of breath in he fob at the same moment he hear a step in the passage and the door open to adoniram k hotchkiss the colonel be impressed he have a duellist 's respect for punctuality the man enter with a nod and the expectant inquire look of a busy man as he foot cross that sacred threshold the colonel become all courtesy he place a chair for he visitor and take he hat from he half-reluctant hand he then open a cupboard and bring out a bottle of whiskey and two glass a -- er -- slight refreshment mr hotchkiss he suggest politely i never drink reply hotchkiss with the severe attitude of a total abstainer ah -- er -- not the finest bourbon whiskey select by a kentucky friend no pardon I a cigar then -- the mildest havana i do not use tobacco nor alcohol in any form repeat hotchkiss ascetically i have no foolish weakness the colonel 's moist beady eye sweep silently over he client 's sallow face he lean back comfortably in he chair and half close he eye as in dreamy reminiscence say slowly : you reply mr hotchkiss remind I of -- er -- sing ` lar circumstance that -- er -- occur in point of fact -- at the st charle hotel new orlean pinkey hornblower -- personal friend -- invite senator doolittle to join he in social glass receive sing ` larly enough reply similar to yours ` do not drink nor smoke ' say pinkey ` gad sir you must be mighty sweet on the lady ' ha the colonel pause long enough to allow the faint flush to pass from hotchkiss 's cheek and go on half close he eye : ' i allow no man sir to discuss my personal habit ' say doolittle over he shirt collar ` then i reckon shootin ' must be one of those habit ' say pinkey coolly both man drive out on the shell road back of cemetery next morning pinkey put bullet at twelve pace through doolittle 's temple poor doo never speak again leave three wife and seven child they say -- two of 'em black i get a note from you this morning say hotchkiss with badly conceal impatience i suppose in reference to we case you have take judgment i believe the colonel without reply slowly fill a glass of whiskey and water for a moment he hold it dreamily before he as if still engage in gentle reminiscence call up by the act then toss it off he wipe he lip with a large white handkerchief and lean back comfortably in he chair say with a wave of he hand the interview i request mr hotchkiss concern a subject -- which i may say be -- er -- er -- at present _ not _ of a public or business nature -- although _ later _ it might become -- er -- er -- both it be a affair of some -- er -- delicacy the colonel pause and mr hotchkiss regard he with increase impatience the colonel however continue with unchanged deliberation : it concern -- er -- a young lady -- a beautiful high-souled creature sir who apart from she personal loveliness -- er -- er -- i may say be of one of the first family of missourus and -- er -- not -- remotely connect by marriage with one of -- er -- er -- my boyhood 's dearest friend the latter i grieve to say be a pure invention of the colonel 's -- a oratorical addition to the scanty information he have obtain the previous day the young lady he continue blandly enjoy the further distinction of be the object of such attention from you as would make this interview -- really -- a confidential matter -- er -- er -- among friend and -- er -- er -- relation in present and future i need not say that the lady i refer to be miss zaidee juno hooker only daughter of almira ann hooker relict of jefferson brown hooker formerly of boone county kentucky and latterly of -- er -- pike county missourus the sallow ascetic hue of mr hotchkiss 's face have pass through a livid and then a greenish shade and finally settle into a sullen red what be all this about he demand roughly the least touch of belligerent fire come into starbottle 's eye but he bland courtesy do not change i believe he say politely i have make myself clear as between -- er -- gentleman though perhaps not as clear as i should to -- er -- er -- jury mr hotchkiss be apparently strike with some significance in the lawyer 's reply i do not know he say in a lower and more cautious voice what you mean by what you call ` my attention ' to -- any one -- or how it concern you i have not exhaust half a dozen word with -- the person you name -- have never write she a line -- nor even call at she house he rise with a assumption of ease pull down he waistcoat button he coat and take up he hat the colonel do not move i believe i have already indicate my meaning in what i have call ` you attention ' say the colonel blandly and give you my ` concern ' for speak as -- er -- er mutual friend as to _ you _ statement of you relation with miss hooker i may state that it be fully corroborate by the statement of the young lady herself in this very office yesterday then what do this impertinent nonsense mean why be i summon here say hotchkiss furiously because say the colonel deliberately that statement be infamously -- yes damnably to you discredit sir mr hotchkiss be here seize by one of those important and inconsistent rage which occasionally betray the habitually cautious and timid man he catch up the colonel 's stick which be lie on the table at the same moment the colonel without any apparent effort grasp it by the handle to mr hotchkiss 's astonishment the stick separate in two piece leave the handle and about two foot of narrow glitter steel in the colonel 's hand the man recoil drop the useless fragment the colonel pick it up fitting the shine blade in it click the spring and then rise with a face of courtesy yet of unmistakably genuine pain and with even a slight tremor in he voice say gravely : mr hotchkiss i owe you a thousand apology sir that -- er -- a weapon should be draw by I -- even through you own inadvertence -- under the sacred protection of my roof and upon a unarmed man i beg you pardon sir and i even withdraw the expression which provoke that inadvertence nor do this apology prevent you from hold I responsible -- personally responsible -- _ elsewhere _ for a indiscretion commit in behalf of a lady -- my -- er -- client you client do you mean you have take she case you the counsel for the ditch company say mr hotchkiss in tremble indignation have win _ you _ case sir say the colonel coolly the -- er -- usage of advocacy do not prevent I from espouse the cause of the weak and unprotected we shall see sir say hotchkiss grasp the handle of the door and backing into the passage there be other lawyer who -- permit I to see you out interrupted the colonel rise politely -- will be ready to resist the attack of blackmail continued hotchkiss retreat along the passage and then you will be able to repeat you remark to I _ in the street _ continue the colonel bow as he persist in follow he visitor to the door but here mr hotchkiss quickly slam it behind he and hurry away the colonel return to he office and sit down take a sheet of letter paper bear the inscription starbottle and stryker attorney and counsellor and write the follow line : hooker _ versus _ hotchkiss dear madam -- have have a visit from the defendant in above we should be please to have a interview with you at 2 pm to-morrow you obedient servant starbottle and stryker this he seal and despatch by he trust servant jim and then devote a few moment to reflection it be the custom of the colonel to act first and justify the action by reason afterwards he know that hotchkiss would at once lay the matter before rival counsel he know that they would advise he that miss hooker have no case -- that she would be non-suited on she own evidence and he ought not to compromise but be ready to stand trial he believe however that hotchkiss fear that exposure and although he own instinct have be at first against that remedy he be now instinctively in favor of it he remember he own power with a jury he vanity and he chivalry alike approve of this heroic method he be bind by the prosaic fact -- he have he own theory of the case which no mere evidence could gainsay in fact mr hooker 's own word that he be to tell the story in he own way actually appear to he a inspiration and a prophecy perhaps there be something else due possibly to the lady 's wonderful eye of which he have think much yet it be not she simplicity that affect he solely on the contrary it be she apparent intelligent reading of the character of she recreant lover -- and of he own of all the colonel 's previous light or serious love none have ever before flattered he in that way and it be this combine with the respect which he have hold for they professional relation that preclude he have a more familiar knowledge of he client through serious question or playful gallantry i be not sure it be not part of the charm to have a rustic _ femme incomprise _ as a client nothing could exceed the respect with which he greet she as she enter he office the next day he even affect not to notice that she have put on she best clothes and he make no doubt appear as when she have first attract the mature yet faithless attention of deacon hotchkiss at church a white virginal muslin be belt around she slim figure by a blue ribbon and she leghorn hat be draw around she oval cheek by a bow of the same color she have a southern girl 's narrow foot encase in white stocking and kid slipper which be cross primly before she as she sit in a chair support she arm by she faithful parasol plant firmly on the floor a faint odor of southernwood exhale from she and oddly enough stir the colonel with a far-off recollection of a pine-shaded Sunday school on a georgium hillside and of he first love aged ten in a short starched frock possibly it be the same recollection that revive something of the awkwardness he have feel then he however smile vaguely and sit down cough slightly and place he fingertip together i have have a -- er -- interview with mr hotchkiss but -- i -- er -- regret to say there seem to be no prospect of -- er -- compromise he pause and to he surprise she listless company face light up with a adorable smile of course -- ketch he she say be he mad when you tell he she put she knee comfortably together and lean forward for a reply for all that wild horse could not have tear from the colonel a word about hotchkiss 's anger he express he intention of employ counsel -- and defend a suit return the colonel affably bask in she smile she drag she chair nearer he desk then you 'll fight he tooth and nail she say eagerly you 'll show he up you 'll tell the whole story you own way you 'll give he fit -- and you 'll make he pay sure she go on breathlessly i -- er -- will say the colonel almost as breathlessly she catch he fat white hand which be lie on the table between she own and lift it to she lip he feel she soft young finger even through the lisle-thread glove that encase they and the warm moisture of she lip upon he skin he feel himself flushing -- but be unable to break the silence or change he position the next moment she have scuttle back with she chair to she old position i -- er -- certainly shall do my best stammer the colonel in a attempt to recover he dignity and composure that be enough you 'll _ do _ it say the girl enthusiastically lordy just you talk for _ I _ as ye do for _ he _ old ditch company and you 'll fetch it -- every time why when you make that jury sit up the other day -- when you get that off about the merrikan flag wave equally over the rights of honest citizen band together in peaceful commercial pursuit as well as over the fortress of official proflig -- oligarchy murmur the colonel courteously oligarchy repeat the girl quickly my breath be just take away i say to maw ` be not he too sweet for anything ' i do honest injin and when you roll it all off at the end -- never miss a word -- -lrb- you do not need to mark 'em in a lesson-book but have 'em all ready on you tongue -rrb- and walk out -- well i do not know you nor the ditch company from adam but i could have just run over and kiss you there before the whole court she laugh with she face glowing although she strange eye be cast down alack the colonel 's face be equally flush and he own beady eye be on he desk to any other woman he would have voice the banal gallantry that he should now himself look forward to that reward but the word never reach he lip he laugh cough slightly and when he look up again she have fall into the same attitude as on she first visit with she parasol point on the floor i must ask you to -- er -- direct you memory -- to -- er -- another point the break off of the -- er -- er -- er -- engagement do he -- er -- give any reason for it or show any cause no he never say anything return the girl not in he usual way -- er -- no reproach out of the hymn-book -- or the sacred writings no he just _ quit _ er -- cease he attention say the colonel gravely and naturally you -- er -- be not conscious of any cause for he do so the girl raise she wonderful eye so suddenly and so penetratingly without reply in any other way that the colonel could only hurriedly say : i see none of course at which she rise the colonel rise also we -- shall begin proceedings at once i must however caution you to answer no question nor say anything about this case to any one until you be in court she answer he request with another intelligent look and a nod he accompany she to the door as he take she proffer hand he raise the lisle-thread finger to he lip with old-fashioned gallantry as if that act have condone for he first omission and awkwardness he become he old-fashioned self again button he coat pull out he shirt frill and strut back to he desk a day or two later it be know throughout the town that zaidee hooker have sue adoniram hotchkiss for breach of promise and that the damages be lay at five thousand dollar as in those bucolic day the western press be under the secure censorship of a revolver a cautious tone of criticism prevail and any gossip be confine to personal expression and even then at the risk of the gossiper nevertheless the situation provoke the intensest curiosity the colonel be approach -- until he statement that he should consider any attempt to overcome he professional secrecy a personal reflection withhold further advance the community be leave to the more ostentatious information of the defendant 's counsel messr kitcham and bilser that the case be ridiculous and rotten that the plaintiff would be nonsuited and the fire-eating starbottle would be teach a lesson that he could not bully the law -- and there be some dark hint of a conspiracy it be even hint that the case be the revengeful and preposterous outcome of the refusal of hotchkiss to pay starbottle a extravagant fee for he late service to the ditch company it be unnecessary to say that these word be not report to the colonel it be however a unfortunate circumstance for the calmer ethical consideration of the subject that the church side with hotchkiss as this provoke a equal adherence to the plaintiff and starbottle on the part of the larger body of non-church-goer who be delight at a possible exposure of the weakness of religious rectitude i have allus have my suspicion o ' they early candle-light meeting down at that gospel shop say one critic and i reckon deacon hotchkiss do not rope in the gal to attend jest for psalm-singing then for he to get up and leave the board afore the game 's finish and try to sneak out of it say another i suppose that be what they call _ religious _ it be therefore not remarkable that the courthouse three week later be crowd with a excited multitude of the curious and sympathize the fair plaintiff with she mother be early in attendance and under the colonel 's advice appear in the same modest garb in which she have first visit he office this and she downcast modest demeanor be perhaps at first disappointing to the crowd who have evidently expect a paragon of loveliness -- as the circe of the grim ascetic defendant who sit beside he counsel but presently all eye be fix on the colonel who certainly make up in _ he _ appearance any deficiency of he fair client he portly figure be clothe in a blue dress-coat with brass button a buff waistcoat which permit he frilled shirt front to become erectile above it a black satin stock which confine a boyish turned-down collar around he full neck and immaculate drill trousers strap over varnished boot a murmur run round the court old ` personally responsible ' have get he war-paint on the old war-horse be smell powder be whisper comment yet for all that the most irreverent among they recognize vaguely in this bizarre figure something of a honor past in they country 's history and possibly feel the spell of old deed and old name that have once thrill they boyish pulse the new district judge return colonel starbottle 's profoundly punctilious bow the colonel be follow by he negro servant carry a parcel of hymn-book and bible who with a courtesy evidently imitate from he master place one before the opposite counsel this after a first curious glance the lawyer somewhat superciliously toss aside but when jim proceed to the jury-box place with equal politeness the remain copy before the jury the opposite counsel spring to he foot i want to direct the attention of the court to this unprecedented tamper with the jury by this gratuitous exhibition of matter impertinent and irrelevant to the issue the judge cast a inquire look at colonel starbottle may it please the court return colonel starbottle with dignity ignore the counsel the defendant 's counsel will observe that he be already furnish with the matter -- which i regret to say he have treat -- in the presence of the court -- and of he client a deacon of the church -- with -- er -- great superciliousness when i state to you honor that the book in question be hymn-books and copy of the _ holy scripture _ and that they be for the instruction of the jury to whom i shall have to refer they in the course of my opening i believe i be within my rights the act be certainly unprecedented say the judge dryly but unless the counsel for the plaintiff expect the jury to _ sing _ from these hymn-book they introduction be not improper and i can not admit the objection as defendant 's counsel be furnish with copy also they can not plead ` surprise ' as in the introduction of new matter and as plaintiff 's counsel rely evidently upon the jury 's attention to he open he would not be the first person to distract it after a pause he add address the colonel who remain stand the court be with you sir proceed but the colonel remain motionless and statuesque with fold arm i have overrule the objection repeat the judge you may go on i be wait you honor for the -- er -- withdrawal by the defendant 's counsel of the word ` tamper ' as refer to myself and of ` impertinent ' as refer to the sacred volume the request be a proper one and i have no doubt will be accede to return the judge quietly the defendant 's counsel rise and mumble a few word of apology and the incident close there be however a general feeling that the colonel have in some way score and if he object have be to excite the greatest curiosity about the book he have make he point but impassive of he victory he inflate he chest with he right hand in the breast of he buttoned coat and begin he usual high color have pale slightly but the small pupil of he prominent eye glitter like steel the young girl lean forward in she chair with a attention so breathless a sympathy so quick and a admiration so artless and unconscious that in a instant she divide with the speaker the attention of the whole assemblage it be very hot the court be crowd to suffocation even the open window reveal a crowd of face outside the building eagerly follow the colonel 's word he would remind the jury that only a few week ago he stand there as the advocate of a powerful company then represent by the present defendant he speak then as the champion of strict justice against legal oppression no less should he to-day champion the cause of the unprotected and the comparatively defenseless -- save for that paramount power which surround beauty and innocence -- even though the plaintiff of yesterday be the defendant of to-day as he approach the court a moment ago he have raise he eye and behold the starry flag fly from its dome -- and he know that glorious banner be a symbol of the perfect equality under the constitution of the rich and the poor the strong and the weak -- a equality which make the simple citizen take from the plough in the veld the pick in the gulch or from behind the counter in the mining town who serve on that jury the equal arbiter of justice with that highest legal luminary whom they be proud to welcome on the bench to-day the colonel pause with a stately bow to the impassive judge it be this he continue which lift he heart as he approach the building and yet -- he have enter it with a uncertain -- he might almost say -- a timid step and why he know gentleman he be about to confront a profound -- aye a sacred responsibility those hymn-book and holy writings hand to the jury be _ not _ as he honor surmise for the purpose of enable the jury to indulge in -- er -- preliminary choral exercise he might indeed say alas not they be the damning incontrovertible proof of the perfidy of the defendant and they would prove as terrible a warn to he as the fatal character upon belshazzar 's wall there be a strong sensation hotchkiss turn a sallow green he lawyer assume a careless smile it be he duty to tell they that this be not one of those ordinary breach-of-promise case which be too often the occasion of ruthless mirth and indecent levity in the courtroom the jury would find nothing of that here there be no love-letter with the epithet of endearment nor those mystic cross and cipher which he have be credibly inform chastely hide the exchange of those mutual caress know as kiss there be no cruel tear of the veil from those sacred privacy of the human affection -- there be no forensic shout out of those fond confidence mean only for _ one _ but there be he be shock to say a new sacrilegious intrusion the weak piping of cupid be mingle with the chorus of the saint -- the sanctity of the temple know as the meeting-house be desecrate by proceedings more in keep with the shrine of venus -- and the inspired writings themselves be use as the medium of amatory and wanton flirtation by the defendant in he sacred capacity as deacon the colonel artistically pause after this thunderous denunciation the jury turn eagerly to the leaf of the hymn-book but the larger gaze of the audience remain fix upon the speaker and the girl who sit in rapt admiration of he period after the hush the colonel continue in a lower and sadder voice : there be perhaps few of we here gentleman -- with the exception of the defendant -- who can arrogate to themselves the title of regular churchgoer or to whom these humbler function of the prayer-meeting the sunday-school and the bible class be habitually familiar yet -- more solemnly -- down in you heart be the deep conviction of we short-coming and failing and a laudable desire that other at least should profit by the teaching we neglect perhaps he continue close he eye dreamily there be not a man here who do not recall the happy day of he boyhood the rustic village spire the lesson share with some artless village maiden with whom he later saunter hand in hand through the wood as the simple rhyme rise upon they lip always make it a point to have it a rule never to be late at the sabbath-school he would recall the strawberry feast the welcome annual picnic redolent with hunk of gingerbread and sarsaparilla how would they feel to know that these sacred recollection be now forever profane in they memory by the knowledge that the defendant be capable of use such occasion to make love to the larger girl and teacher whilst he artless companion be innocently -- the court will pardon I for introduce what i be credibly inform be the local expression ` do gooseberry ' the tremulous flicker of a smile pass over the face of the listen crowd and the colonel slightly wince but he recover himself instantly and continue : my client the only daughter of a widow mother -- who have for year stem the vary tide of adversity -- in the western precinct of this town -- stand before you today invest only in she own innocence she wear no -- er -- rich gift of she faithless admirer -- be panoply in no jewel ring nor memento of affection such as lover delight to hang upon the shrine of they affection hers be not the glory with which solomon decorate the queen of sheba though the defendant as i shall show later clothe she in the less expensive flower of the king 's poetry no gentleman the defendant exhibit in this affair a certain frugality of -- er -- pecuniary investment which i be willing to admit may be commendable in he class he only gift be characteristic alike of he method and he economy there be i understand a certain not unimportant feature of religious exercise know as ` take a collection ' the defendant on this occasion by the mute presentation of a tip plate cover with baize solicit the pecuniary contribution of the faithful on approach the plaintiff however he himself slip a love-token upon the plate and push it towards she that love-token be a lozenge -- a small disk i have reason to believe concoct of peppermint and sugar bearing upon its reverse surface the simple word ' i love you ' i have since ascertain that these disk may be buy for five cent a dozen -- or at considerably less than one half-cent for the single lozenge yes gentleman the word ' i love you ' -- the oldest legend of all the refrain ` when the morning star sing together ' -- be present to the plaintiff by a medium so insignificant that there be happily no coin in the republic low enough to represent its value i shall prove to you gentleman of the jury say the colonel solemnly draw a _ bible _ from he coat-tail pocket that the defendant for the last twelve month conduct a amatory correspondence with the plaintiff by means of underline word of sacred writ and church psalmody such as ` beloved ' ` precious ' and ` dearest ' occasionally appropriate whole passage which seem apposite to he tender passion i shall call you attention to one of they the defendant while profess to be a total abstainer -- a man who in my own knowledge have refuse spirituous refreshment as a inordinate weakness of the flesh with shameless hypocrisy underscore with he pencil the following passage and present it to the plaintiff the gentleman of the jury will find it in the _ song of solomon _ page 548 chapter ii verse 5 after a pause in which the rapid rustling of leaf be hear in the jury-box colonel starbottle declaim in a plead stentorian voice ` stay I with -- er -- _ flagon _ comfort I with -- er -- apple -- for i be -- er -- sick of love ' yes gentleman -- yes you may well turn from those accuse page and look at the double-faced defendant he desire -- to -- er -- be -- ` stay with flagon ' i be not aware at present what kind of liquor be habitually dispense at these meeting and for which the defendant so urgently clamor but it will be my duty before this trial be over to discover it if i have to summon every barkeeper in this district for the moment i will simply call you attention to the _ quantity _ it be not a single drink that the defendant ask for -- not a glass of light and generous wine to be share with he inamorata -- but a number of flagon or vessel each possibly hold a pint measure -- _ for himself _ the smile of the audience have become a laugh the judge look up warningly when he eye catch the fact that the colonel have again wince at this mirth he regard he seriously mr hotchkiss 's counsel have join in the laugh affectedly but hotchkiss himself be ashy pale there be also a commotion in the jury-box a hurry turn over of leaf and a excited discussion the gentleman of the jury say the judge with official gravity will please keep order and attend only to the speech of counsel any discussion _ here _ be irregular and premature -- and must be reserve for the jury-room -- after they have retire the foreman of the jury struggle to he foot he be a powerful man with a good-humored face and in spite of he unfelicitous nickname of the bone-breaker have a kindly simple but somewhat emotional nature nevertheless it appear as if he be labor under some powerful indignation can we ask a question judge he say respectfully although he voice have the unmistakable western-american ring in it as of one who be unconscious that he could be address any but he peer yes say the judge good-humoredly we be find in this yere piece out of which the kernel he just bin a-quotin ' some language that I and my pardner allow have not orter to be read out afore a young lady in court -- and we want to know of you -- ez a fair-minded and impartial man -- ef this be the reg ` lar kind o ' book give to gal and baby down at the meetin ' - house the jury will please follow the counsel 's speech without comment say the judge briefly fully aware that the defendant 's counsel would spring to he foot as he do promptly the court will allow we to explain to the gentleman that the language they seem to object to have be accept by the best theologian for the last thousand year as be purely mystic as i will explain later those be merely symbol of the church -- of wot interrupt the foreman in deep scorn of the church we be not askin ' any question o ' _ you _ -- and we be not takin ' any answer say the foreman sit down promptly i must insist say the judge sternly that the plaintiff 's counsel be allow to continue he opening without interruption you -lrb- to defendant 's counsel -rrb- will have you opportunity to reply later the counsel sink down in he seat with the bitter conviction that the jury be manifestly against he and the case as good as lose but he face be scarcely as disturbed as he client 's who in great agitation have begin to argue with he wildly and be apparently press some point against the lawyer 's vehement opposal the colonel 's murky eye brighten as he still stand erect with he hand thrust in he breast it will be put to you gentleman when the counsel on the other side refrain from mere interruption and confines himself to reply that my unfortunate client have no action -- no remedy at law -- because there be no speak word of endearment but gentleman it will depend upon _ you _ to say what be and what be not articulate expression of love we all know that among the lower animal with whom you may possibly be call upon to classify the defendant there be certain signal more or less harmonious as the case may be the ass bray the horse neigh the sheep bleat -- the feathered denizen of the grove call to they mate in more musical roundelay these be recognize fact gentleman which you yourselve as dweller among nature in this beautiful land be all cognizant of they be fact that no one would deny -- and we should have a poor opinion of the ass who at -- er -- such a supreme moment would attempt to suggest that he call be unthinking and without significance but gentleman i shall prove to you that such be the foolish self-convicting custom of the defendant with the greatest reluctance and the -- er -- greatest pain i succeed in wrest from the maidenly modesty of my fair client the innocent confession that the defendant have induce she to correspond with he in these method picture to yourself gentleman the lonely moonlight road beside the widow 's humble cottage it be a beautiful night sanctify to the affection and the innocent girl be lean from she casement presently there appear upon the road a slink stealthy figure -- the defendant on he way to church true to the instruction she have receive from he she lip part in the musical utterance -lrb- the colonel lower he voice in a faint falsetto presumably in fond imitation of he fair client -rrb- ` kerree ' instantly the night become resonant with the impassioned reply -lrb- the colonel here lift he voice in stentorian tone -rrb- ` kerrow ' again as he pass rise the soft ` kerree ' again as he form be lose in the distance come back the deep ` kerrow ' a burst of laughter long loud and irrepressible strike the whole courtroom and before the judge could lift he half-composed face and take he handkerchief from he mouth a faint kerree from some unrecognized obscurity of the courtroom be follow by a loud kerrow from some opposite locality the sheriff will clear the court say the judge sternly but alas as the embarrassed and choke official rush hither and thither a soft kerree from the spectator at the window _ outside _ the courthouse be answer by a loud chorus of kerrow from the opposite window fill with onlooker again the laughter arise everywhere -- even the fair plaintiff herself sit convulse behind she handkerchief the figure of colonel starbottle alone remain erect -- white and rigid and then the judge look up see what no one else in the court have see -- that the colonel be sincere and in earnest that what he have conceive to be the pleader 's most perfect acting and most elaborate irony be the deep serious mirthless _ conviction _ of a man without the least sense of humor there be a touch of this respect in the judge 's voice as he say to he gently you may proceed colonel starbottle i thank you honor say the colonel slowly for recognize and do all in you power to prevent a interruption that during my thirty year ' experience at the bar i have never yet be subject to without the privilege of hold the instigator thereof responsible -- _ personally _ responsible it be possibly my fault that i have fail oratorically to convey to the gentleman of the jury the full force and significance of the defendant 's signal i be aware that my voice be singularly deficient in produce either the dulcet tone of my fair client or the impassioned vehemence of the defendant 's repose i will continue the colonel with a fatigued but blind fatuity that ignore the hurriedly knit brow and warn eye of the judge try again the note utter by my client -lrb- lower he voice to the faintest of falsetto -rrb- be ` kerree ' the response be ` kerrow ' -- and the colonel 's voice fairly shake the dome above he another uproar of laughter follow this apparently audacious repetition but be interrupt by a unlooked-for incident the defendant rise abruptly and tear himself away from the withhold hand and plead protestation of he counsel absolutely flee from the courtroom he appearance outside be recognize by a prolonged kerrow from the bystander which again and again follow he in the distance in the momentary silence which follow the colonel 's voice be hear say we rest here you honor and he sit down no less white but more agitate be the face of the defendant 's counsel who instantly rise for some unexplained reason you honor my client desire to suspend further proceedings with a view to effect a peaceable compromise with the plaintiff as he be a man of wealth and position he be able and willing to pay liberally for that privilege while i as he counsel be still convince of he legal irresponsibility as he have choose however to publicly abandon he rights here i can only ask you honor 's permission to suspend further proceedings until i can confer with colonel starbottle as far as i can follow the pleading say the judge gravely the case seem to be hardly one for litigation and i approve of the defendant 's course while i strongly urge the plaintiff to accept it colonel starbottle bent over he fair client presently he rise unchanged in look or demeanor i yield you honor to the wish of my client and -- er -- lady we accept before the court adjourn that day it be know throughout the town that adoniram k hotchkiss have compromise the suit for four thousand dollar and cost colonel starbottle have so far recover he equanimity as to strut jauntily towards he office where he be to meet he fair client he be surprised however to find she already there and in company with a somewhat sheepish-looking young man -- a stranger if the colonel have any disappointment in meet a third party to the interview he old-fashioned courtesy do not permit he to show it he bow graciously and politely motion they each to a seat i reckon i would bring hiram round with I say the young lady lift she search eye after a pause to the colonel 's though he be awful shy and allow that you do not know he from adam -- or even suspect he existence but i say ` that be just where you slip up hiram a pow ` ful man like the colonel know everything -- and i have see it in he eye ' lordy she continue with a laugh lean forward over she parasol as she eye again seek the colonel 's do

not eat you -- though he be kill many a better man come have _ i _ get to do _ all _ the kissin ' it be of record that the colonel bow so courteously and so profoundly that he manage not merely to evade the proffer hand of the shy hiram but to only lightly touch the franker and more impulsive fingertip of the gentle zaidee i -- er -- offer my sincerest congratulation -- though i think you -- er -- overestimate -- my -- er -- power of penetration unfortunately a press engagement which may oblige I also to leave town to-night forbid my say more i have -- er -- leave the -- er -- business

a board place a house that stand fifty yard back from one of the quietest avenue it be a old-fashioned brick building with a portico uphold by tall white pillar the yard be shaded by stately locust and elm and a catalpa tree in season rain its pink and white blossom upon the grass row of high box bush line the fence and walk it be the southern style and aspect of the place that please the eye of the talbot in this pleasant private board house they engage room include a study for major talbot who be add the finish chapter to he book _ anecdote and reminiscence of the alabama army bench and bar _ major talbot be of the old old south the present day have little interest or excellence in he eye he mind live in that period before the civil war when the talbot own thousand of acre of fine cotton land and the slave to till they when the family mansion be the scene of princely hospitality and draw its guest from the aristocracy of the south out of that period he have bring all its old pride and scruple of honor a antiquated and punctilious politeness and -lrb- you would think -rrb- its wardrobe such clothes be surely never make within fifty year the major be tall but whenever he make that wonderful archaic genuflexion he call a bow the corner of he frock coat sweep the floor that garment be a surprise even to washington which have long ago cease to shy at the frock and broad-brimmed hat of southern congressman one of the boarder christen it a father hubbard and it certainly be high in the waist and full in the skirt but the major with all he queer clothes he immense area of plaited ravel shirt bosom and the little black string tie with the bow always slip on one side both be smile at and like in mr vardeman 's select board house some of the young department clerk would often string he as they call it get he start upon the subject dearest to he -- the tradition and history of he beloved southland during he talk he would quote freely from the _ anecdote and reminiscence _ but they be very careful not to let he see they design for in spite of he sixty-eight year he could make the boldest of they uncomfortable under the steady regard of he piercing gray eye miss lydium be a plump little old maid of thirty-five with smoothly draw tightly twist hair that make she look still older old-fashioned too she be but antebellum glory do not radiate from she as it do from the major she possess a thrifty common sense and it be she who handle the finances of the family and meet all comer when there be bill to pay the major regard board bill and wash bill as contemptible nuisance they keep come in so persistently and so often why the major want to know could they not be file and pay in a lump sum at some convenient period -- say when the _ anecdote and reminiscence _ have be publish and pay for miss lydium would calmly go on with she sewing and say we 'll pay as we go as long as the money last and then perhaps they 'll have to lump it most of mr vardeman 's boarder be away during the day be nearly all department clerk and business man but there be one of they who be about the house a great deal from morning to night this be a young man name henry hopkin hargrave -- every one in the house address he by he full name -- who be engage at one of the popular vaudeville theater vaudeville have rise to such a respectable plane in the last few year and mr hargrave be such a modest and well-mannered person that mr vardeman could find no objection to enrol he upon she list of boarder at the theater hargrave be know as a all-round dialect comedian have a large repertoire of german irish swede and black-face specialty but mr hargrave be ambitious and often speak of he great desire to succeed in legitimate comedy this young man appear to conceive a strong fancy for major talbot whenever that gentleman would begin he southern reminiscence or repeat some of the liveliest of the anecdote hargrave could always be find the most attentive among he listener for a time the major show a inclination to discourage the advance of the play actor as he privately term he but soon the young man 's agreeable manner and indubitable appreciation of the old gentleman 's story completely win he over it be not long before the two be like old chum the major set apart each afternoon to read to he the manuscript of he book during the anecdote hargrave never fail to laugh at exactly the right point the major be move to declare to miss lydium one day that young hargrave possess remarkable perception and a gratifying respect for the old régime and when it come to talk of those old day -- if major talbot like to talk mr hargrave be entrance to listen like almost all old people who talk of the past the major loved to linger over detail in describe the splendid almost royal day of the old planter he would hesitate until he have recall the name of the negro who hold he horse or the exact date of certain minor happening or the number of bale of cotton raise in such a year but hargrave never grow impatient or lost interest on the contrary he would advance question on a variety of subject connect with the life of that time and he never fail to extract ready reply the fox hunt the ` possum supper the hoe-downs and jubilee in the negro quarter the banquet in the plantation-house hall when invitation go for fifty mile around the occasional feud with the neighbor gentry the major 's duel with rathbone culbertson about kitty chalmer who afterward marry a thwaite of south carolina and private yacht race for fabulous sum on mobile bay the quaint belief improvident habit and loyal virtue of the old slave -- all these be subject that hold both the major and hargrave absorb for hour at a time sometimes at night when the young man would be come upstairs to he room after he turn at the theater be over the major would appear at the door of he study and beckon archly to he go in hargrave would find a little table set with a decanter sugar bowl fruit and a big bunch of fresh green mint it occur to I the major would begin -- he be always ceremonious -- that perhaps you might have find you duty at the -- at you place of occupation -- sufficiently arduous to enable you mr hargrave to appreciate what the poet might well have have in he mind when he write ` tired nature 's sweet restorer ' -- one of we southern julep it be a fascination to hargrave to watch he make it he take rank among artist when he begin and he never vary the process with what delicacy he bruise the mint with what exquisite nicety he estimate the ingredient with what solicitous care he cap the compound with the scarlet fruit glowing against the dark green fringe and then the hospitality and grace with which he offer it after the select oat straw have be plunge into its tinkling depths after about four month in washington miss lydium discover one morning that they be almost without money the _ anecdote and reminiscence _ be complete but publisher have not jump at the collect gem of alabama sense and wit the rental of a small house which they still own in mobile be two month in arrears they board money for the month would be due in three day miss lydium call she father to a consultation no money say he with a surprised look it be quite annoying to be call on so frequently for these petty sum really i -- the major search he pocket he find only a two-dollar bill which he return to he vest pocket i must attend to this at once lydium he say kindly get I my umbrella and i will go downtown immediately the congressman from we district general fulghum assure I some day ago that he would use he influence to get my book publish at a early date i will go to he hotel at once and see what arrangement have be make with a sad little smile miss lydium watch he button he father hubbard and depart pause at the door as he always do to bow profoundly that evening at dark he return it seem that congressman fulghum have see the publisher who have the major 's manuscript for read that person have say that if the anecdote etc be carefully prune down about one-half in order to eliminate the sectional and class prejudice with which the book be dye from end to end he might consider its publication the major be in a white heat of anger but regain he equanimity accord to he code of manners as soon as he be in miss lydium 's presence we must have money say miss lydium with a little wrinkle above she nose give I the two dollar and i will telegraph to uncle ralph for some to-night the major draw a small envelope from he upper vest pocket and toss it on the table perhaps it be injudicious he say mildly but the sum be so merely nominal that i buy ticket to the theater to-night it be a new war drama lydium i think you would be please to witness its first production in washington i be tell that the south have very fair treatment in the play i confess i should like to see the performance myself miss lydium throw up she hand in silent despair still as the ticket be buy they might as well be use so that evening as they sit in the theater listen to the lively overture even miss lydium be mind to relegate they trouble for the hour to second place the major in spotless linen with he extraordinary coat show only where it be closely button and he white hair smoothly roach look really fine and distinguish the curtain go up on the first act of _ a magnolia flower _ reveal a typical southern plantation scene major talbot betray some interest oh see exclaimed miss lydium nudge he arm and point to she program the major put on he glass and read the line in the cast of character that she finger indicate col webster calhoun mr hopkin hargrave it be we mr hargrave say miss lydium it must be he first appearance in what he call ` the legitimate ' i be so glad for he not until the second act do col webster calhoun appear upon the stage when he make he entry major talbot give a audible sniff glare at he and seem to freeze solid miss lydium utter a little ambiguous squeak and crumple she program in she hand for colonel calhoun be make up as nearly resemble major talbot as one pea do another the long thin white hair curly at the end the aristocratic beak of a nose the crumpled wide ravel shirt front the string tie with the bow nearly under one ear be almost exactly duplicated and then to clinch the imitation he wear the twin to the major 's suppose to be unparalleled coat high-collared baggy empire-waisted ample-skirted hang a foot lower in front than behind the garment could have be design from no other pattern from then on the major and miss lydium sit bewitch and see the counterfeit presentment of a haughty talbot drag as the major afterward express it through the slanderous mire of a corrupt stage mr hargrave have use he opportunity well he have catch the major 's little idiosyncrasy of speech accent and intonation and he pompous courtliness to perfection -- exaggerate all to the purpose of the stage when he perform that marvelous bow that the major fondly imagine to be the pink of all salutation the audience send forth a sudden round of hearty applause miss lydium sit immovable not daring to glance toward she father sometimes she hand next to he would be lay against she cheek as if to conceal the smile which in spite of she disapproval she could not entirely suppress the culmination of hargrave audacious imitation take place in the third act the scene be where colonel calhoun entertain a few of the neighbor planter in he den standing at a table in the center of the stage with he friend group about he he deliver that inimitable rambling character monologue so famous in _ a magnolia flower _ at the same time that he deftly make julep for the party major talbot sit quietly but white with indignation hear he best story retell he pet theory and hobby advance and expand and the dream of the _ anecdote and reminiscence _ serve exaggerated and garbled he favorite narrative -- that of he duel with rathbone culbertson -- be not omit and it be deliver with more fire egotism and gusto than the major himself put into it the monologue conclude with a quaint delicious witty little lecture on the art of concoct a julep illustrate by the act here major talbot 's delicate but showy science be reproduce to a hair 's breadth -- from he dainty handling of the fragrant weed -- the one-thousandth part of a grain too much pressure gentleman and you extract the bitterness instead of the aroma of this heaven-bestowed plant -- to he solicitous selection of the oaten straw at the close of the scene the audience raise a tumultuous roar of appreciation the portrayal of the type be so exact so sure and thorough that the lead character in the play be forget after repeat call hargrave come before the curtain and bow he rather boyish face bright and flush with the knowledge of success at last miss lydium turn and look at the major he thin nostril be work like the gill of a fish he lay both shake hand upon the arm of he chair to rise we will go lydium he say chokingly this be a abominable -- desecration before he could rise she pull he back into he seat we will stay it out she declare do you want to advertise the copy by exhibit the original coat so they remain to the end hargrave 's success must have keep he up late that night for neither at the breakfast nor at the dinner table do he appear about three in the afternoon he tap at the door of major talbot 's study the major open it and hargrave walk in with he hand full of the morning papers -- too full of he triumph to notice anything unusual in the major 's demeanor i put it all over 'em last night major he begin exultantly i have my inning and i think score here be what _ the post _ say : ` he conception and portrayal of the old-time southern colonel with he absurd grandiloquence he eccentric garb he quaint idiom and phrase he motheaten pride of family and he really kind heart fastidious sense of honor and lovable simplicity be the best delineation of a character role on the board to-day the coat worn by colonel calhoun be itself nothing less than a evolution of genius mr hargrave have capture he public ' how do that sound major for a first-nighter i have the honor -- the major 's voice sound ominously frigid -- of witness you very remarkable performance sir last night hargrave look disconcerted you be there i do not know you ever -- i do not know you care for the theater oh i say major talbot he exclaim frankly do not you be offend i admit i do get a lot of pointer from you that help out wonderfully in the part but it be a type you know -- not individual the way the audience catch on show that half the patron of that theater be southerner they recognize it mr hargrave say the major who have remain stand you have put upon I a unpardonable insult you have burlesque my person grossly betray my confidence and misuse my hospitality if i think you possess the faintest conception of what be the sign manual of a gentleman or what be due one i would call you out sir old as i be i will ask you to leave the room sir the actor appear to be slightly bewildered and seem hardly to take in the full meaning of the old gentleman 's word i be truly sorry you take offense he say regretfully up here we do not look at thing just as you people do i know man who would buy out half the house to have they personality put on the stage so the public would recognize it they be not from alabama sir say the major haughtily perhaps not i have a pretty good memory major let I quote a few line from you book in response to a toast at a banquet give in -- milledgeville i believe -- you utter and intend to have print these word : ` the northern man be utterly without sentiment or warmth except in so far as the feeling may be turn to he own commercial profit he will suffer without resentment any imputation cast upon the honor of himself or he loved one that do not bear with it the consequence of pecuniary loss in he charity he give with a liberal hand but it must be herald with the trumpet and chronicle in brass ' do you think that picture be fairer than the one you see of colonel calhoun last night the description say the major frowning be -- not without grounds some exag -- latitude must be allow in public speaking and in public act reply hargrave that be not the point persist the major unrelent it be a personal caricature i positively decline to overlook it sir major talbot say hargrave with a win smile i wish you would

behind the cloud that have frown all the way and the passenger cheer up a bit the two richly dress matron who have be so utterly and unnecessarily oblivious to the presence of each other now suspend hostility for the moment by mutual and unspoken consent and view with relief the little golden-tinted valley and the tree-clad road just beyond the respective husband of these two lady exchange a mere glance no more of comfort they too be relieved though more by the momentary truce than by anything else they regret very much to be compel to hate each other for each have reckon up he vis-à-vi as a rather proper sort of fellow probably a man of some achievement use to good living and good company extreme iciness be unavoidable between they however when one stranger have a splendidly preserved blonde wife and the other a splendidly preserved brunette wife both of whom have win social prominence by year of hard fighting and aloofness there remain nothing for the two man but to follow the lead especially when directly under the eye of the leader the son of the blonde matron smile cheerfully as the welcome light flood the coach he be a nice-looking young man of about twenty-two one might judge and he do he smile though in a perfectly impersonal and correct sort of manner at the pretty daughter of the brunette matron the pretty daughter also smile but she smile be demurely direct at the tree outside clothe as they be in all the flaming glory of they autumn tint glisten with the recent rain and drip with gem that sparkle and flash in the noonday sun as they fall it be marvelous how much one can see out of the corner of the eye while seem to view mere scenery the driver look down as he drive safely off the bridge and shake he head at the swirl of water that rush and eddy dark and muddy close up under the rotten plank then he crack he whip and the horse sturdily attack the little hill thick overhang tree on either side now dim the light again and the two plump matron once more glare past the opposite shoulder profoundly unaware of each other the husband take on the politely surly look require of they the blonde son 's eye still seek the brunette daughter but it be furtively do and quite unsuccessfully for the daughter be now do a little glaring on she own account the blonde matron have just sweep she eye across the daughter 's skirt estimate the fit and material of it with contempt so artistically veil that it could almost be understand in the dark ii the big bay swing to the brow of the hill with ease and dash into a small circular clearing where a quaint little two-story building with a mossy watering-trough out in front nestle under the shade of majestic old tree that rear they brown and scarlet crown proudly into the sky a long low porch run across the front of the structure and a complain sign hang out announce in dim weather-flecked letter on a crack board that this be the tutt house a gray-headed man in brown overalls and fade blue jumper stand on the porch and shake he fist at the stage as it whirl by what a delightfully old-fashioned inn exclaim the pretty daughter how i should like to stop there over night you would probably wish yourself away before morning evelyn reply she mother indifferently no doubt it would be a mere siege of discomfort the blonde matron turn to she husband the pretty daughter have be look at the picturesque inn between the head of this lady and she son edward please pull down the shade behind I she direct there be quite a draught from that break window the pretty daughter bit she lip the brunette matron continue to stare at the shade in the exact spot upon which she gaze have be before direct and she never quiver a eyelash the young man seem very uncomfortable and he try to look he apology to the pretty daughter but she could not see he now not even if she eye have be all corner they be bowl along through another avenue of tree when the driver suddenly shout whoa there the horse be bring up with a jerk that be well nigh fatal to the assortment of dignity inside the coach a loud roaring could be hear both ahead and in the rear a sharp splitting like a fusillade of pistol shot then a creaking and tear of timber the driver bent suddenly forward gid ap he cry and the horse spring forward with a lurch he swing they around a sharp bend with a skillful hand and poise he weight above the brake as they plunge at terrific speed down a steep grade the roaring be louder than ever now and it become deafening as they suddenly emerge from the thick underbrush at the bottom of the declivity catch by gravy ejaculate the driver and for the second time he bring the coach to a abrupt stop do see what be the matter ralph say the blonde matron impatiently thus command the young man swing out and ask the driver about it paintsville dam 's bust he be inform i be a-lookin ' fer it this many a year a ' this here freshet do it you see the holler there well they 's ten foot o ' water

place and ralph get back in the coach we be practically on a flood-made island he exclaim with one eye on the pretty daughter and we shall have to stop over night at that quaint old-fashioned inn we pass a few moment ago the pretty daughter 's eye twinkle and he think he catch a swift direct gleam from under the long lash -- but he be not sure dear I how annoying say the blonde matron but the brunette matron still stare without the slightest trace of interest in anything else at the infinitesimal spot she have select on the affront window-shade the two man give sigh of resignation and cast carefully conceal glance at each other speculate on the possibility of a cigar and a glass and maybe a good story or two or possibly even a game of poker after the evening meal who could tell what

either side of it let 'em bring in they own trap he comment and aunt margaret flee ashamed and conscience-smitten to the kitchen it seem awful the first one out of the coach be the husband of the brunette matron and proceeding under instruction he wait neither for luggage nor woman folk but hurry straight into the tutt house the other man would have be neck and neck with he in the race if it have not be that he pause to seize two suitcase and have the misfortune to drop one which burst open and scatter a choice assortment of lingerie from one end of the dingy coach to the other in the confusion of rescue the fluffery the owner of the suitcase have to sacrifice she hauteur and help she husband and son block up the aisle while the other matron have the ineffable satisfaction of be _

of fine horseflesh if deacon hawkin have one insatiable ambition it be to own a horse which could fling its heel in the face of the best that squire hopkin drive in he early manhood the deacon be no deacon by a great deal but as the year gather in behind he he put off most of the frivolity of youth and hold now only to the one of drive a fast horse no other man in the county drive anything faster except squire hopkin and he the deacon have not be able to throw the dust over the deacon would get good one but somehow never could he find one that the squire do not get a better the squire have also in the early day beat the deacon in the race for a certain pretty girl he dream about but the girl and the squire have live happily ever after and the deacon be a philosopher might have forget the squire 's superiority have it be manifest in this one regard only but in horse too -- that gravel the deacon how much do you give for he be the widow 's first query after they have reach a stretch of road that be good go and the deacon have let he out for a length or two well what do you suppose you be a judge more than i would give i 'll bet a cookie not if you be as anxious as i be to show hopkin that he can not drive by everything on the pike i think you love a good horse because he be a good horse say the widow rather disapprovingly i do but i could love he a good deal harder if he would stay in front of hopkin 's best do he know you have get this one yes and he be be blow round town that he be wait to pick I up on the road some day and make my five hundred dollar look like a pewter quarter so you give five hundred dollar for he do you laugh the widow be it too much um-er hesitate the widow glance along the graceful line of the powerful trotter i suppose not if you can

the widow almost apprehensively because you know deacon i have always want you to beat squire hopkin the deacon look at she sharply there be a softness in she tone that appeal to he even if she have not express such agreeable sentiment just what the deacon might have say or do after the impulse have be set go must remain unknown for at the crucial moment a sound of militant bell bell of defiance jangle up behind they disturb they personal absorption and they look around simultaneously behind the bell be the squire in he sleigh draw by he fastest stepper and he be alone as the deacon be not the widow weigh one hundred and sixty pound net -- which be weighting a horse in a race rather more than the law allow but the deacon never think of that forget everything except he cherish ambition he brace himself for the contest take a twist hold on the line send a sharp quick call to he horse and let he out for all that be in he the squire follow suit and the deacon the road be wide and the snow be wear down smooth the track could not have be in better condition the hopkin color be not five rod behind the hawkin color as they get away for half a mile it be nip and tuck the deacon encourage he horse and the widow encourage the deacon and then the squire begin creep up the deacon 's horse be a good one but he be not accustom to haul freight in a race a half-mile of it be as much as he could stand and he weaken under the strain not handicap the squire 's horse forge ahead and as he nose push up to the dashboard of the deacon 's sleigh that good man groan in agonized disappointment and bitterness of spirit the widow be mad all over that squire hopkin should take such a mean advantage of he rival why do not he wait till another time when the deacon be alone as he be if she have she way she never would speak to squire hopkin again nor to he wife either but she resentment be not help the deacon 's horse to win slowly the squire pull closer to the front the deacon 's horse realize what it mean to he master and to he spurt bravely but struggle as gamely as he might the odds be too many for he and he drop to the rear the squire shout in triumph as he draw past the deacon and the dejected hawkin shrivel into a heap on the seat with only he hand sufficiently alive to hold the line he have be beat again humiliate before a woman and that too with the best horse that he could hope to put against the ever-conquering squire here sink he fondest hope here end he ambition from this on he would drive a mule or a automobile the fruit of he desire have turn to ash in he mouth but no what of the widow she realize if the deacon do not that she not the squire 's horse have beat the deacon 's and she be ready to make what atonement she could as the squire pass ahead of the deacon she be stir by a noble resolve a deep bed of drift snow lay close by the side of the road not far in front it be soft and safe and she smile as she look at it as though wait for she without a hint of she purpose or a sign to disturb the deacon in he final throe she rise as the sleigh run near its edge and with a spring which have many a time send she lightly from the ground to the bare back of a horse in the meadow she clear the robe and light plump in the drift the deacon 's horse know before the deacon do that something have happen in he favor and be quick to respond with he first jump of relief the deacon suddenly revive he hope come fast again he blood retingle he gather himself and crack he line he shoot forward and three minute later he have pass the squire as though he be hitch to the fence for a quarter of a mile the squire make heroic effort to recover he vanish prestige but effort be useless and finally conclude that he be practically leave standing he veer off from the main road down a farm lane to find some spot in which to hide the humiliation of he defeat the deacon still go at a clipping gait have one eye over he shoulder as wary driver always have on such occasion and when he see the squire be off the track he slow down and jog along with the apparent intention of continue indefinitely presently a idea strike he and he look around for the widow she be not where he have see she last where be she in the enthusiasm of victory he have forget she he be so dejected at the moment she have leap that he do not realize what she have do and two minute later he be so elated that shame on he he do not care with she all be lose without she all be win and the deacon 's greatest ambition be to win but now with victory perch on he horse-collar success he at last he think of the widow and he do care he care so much that he almost throw he horse off he foot by the abrupt turn he give he and back down the pike he fly as if a legion of squire be after he he do not know what injury she might have sustain she might have be seriously hurt if not actually kill and why simply to make it possible for he to win the deacon shiver as he think of it and urge he horse to greater speed the squire down the lane see he whiz along and accept it profanely as a exhibition for he especial benefit the deacon now have forget the squire as he have only so shortly before forget the widow two hundred yard from the drift into which she have jump there be a turn in the road where some tree shut off the sight and the deacon 's anxiety increase momentarily until he reach this point from here he could see ahead and down there in the middle of the road stand the widow wave she shawl as a banner of triumph though she could only guess at result the deacon come on with a rush and pull up alongside of she in a condition of nervousness he do not think possible to he hooray hooray shout the widow toss she shawl into the air you beat he i know you do do not you i see you pull ahead at the turn yonder where be he and he old plug oh bother take he and he horse and the race and everything be you hurt gasp the deacon jump out but mindful to keep the line in he hand be you hurt he repeat anxiously though she look anything but a hurt woman if i be she chirp cheerily i be not hurt half as bad as i would have be if the squire have beat you deacon now do not you worry about I let 's hurry back to town so the squire will not get another chance with no place for I to jump and the deacon well well with the line in the crook of he elbow the deacon hold out he

amply supply with jewelry in which he feel perfect satisfaction he present want be positive if nebulous he desire a fortune in he pocket bulky tangible evidence of he miraculous success ever since stuhk have find he life have have a unreal quality for he he monte cristo wealth be too much like a fabulous dream-found treasure money that could not be spend without danger of awakening and he have drop into the habit of store it about he so that in any pocket into which he plunge he hand he might find a roll of crisp evidence of reality he like he bill to be of all denomination and some so large as exquisitely to stagger imagination other charming by they number and crispness -- the dignified orange paper of a man of assure position and wealth-crackling greenback the design of which tinge the whole with actuality he be specially partial to engraving of president lincoln the particular savior and patron of he race this five hundred dollar he be add to a unreckoned sum of about two thousand merely as extra fortification against a grow sense of gloom he wish to brace he flagging spirit with the gay wine of possession and he be glad when the money come that it be in a elastic-bound roll so bulky that it be pleasantly uncomfortable in he pocket as he leave he manager as he turn into the brilliantly light street from the somber alleyway of the stage entrance he pause for a moment to glance at he own name in three-foot letter of red before the door of the theater he could read and the large block type always please he this week : gideon that be all none of the fulsome praise the superlative necessary definition give to lesser performer he have be he remember gideon america 's foremost native comedian a title that be at once boast and challenge that necessity be now past for he be a national character any explanatory qualification would have be a insult to the public intelligence to the world he be just gideon that be enough it give he pleasure as he saunter along to see the announcement repeat on window card and hoarding presently he come to a window before which he pause in delighted wonder it be not a large window to the casual eye of the passer-by there be little to draw attention by day it light the fractional floor space of a little stationer who supplement a slim business by a sub-agency for railroad and steamship line but to-night this window seem the framework of a marvel of coincidence on the broad dusty sill inside be prop two card : the one on the left be he own red-lettered announcement for the week the one at the right -- oh world of wonder -- be a photogravure of that exact stretch of the inner coast of florida which gideon know best which be home there it be the indian river ripple idly in full sunlight palmetto lean over the water palmetto standing as irregular sentry along the low reeflike island which stretch away out of the picture there be the gigantic lonely pine he know well and yes -- he could just make it out -- there be he own ramshackle little pier which stretch in undulating fashion like a long-legged wade caterpillar from the abrupt shore-line of erode coquina into deep water he think at first that this picture of he home be some new and delicate device put forth by he press-agent he name on one side of a window he birthplace upon the other -- what could be more tastefully appropriate therefore as he spell out the reading-matter beneath the photogravure he be sharply disappointed it read : spend this winter in balmy florida come to the land of perpetual sunshine golf tennis drive shooting boat fishing all of the best there be more but he have no heart for it he be disappointed and puzzle this picture have after all nothing to do with he it be a chance and yet what a strange chance it trouble and upset he he black round-featured face take on deep wrinkle of perplexity the misery which have hang darkly on he horizon for week engulf he without warn but in the very bitterness of he melancholy he know at last he disease it be not champagne or recreation that he need not even a po ` k-chop although he desire for it have be a symptom a grope for a too homeopathic remedy : he be homesick easy childish tear come into he eye and run over he shine cheek he shiver forlornly with a sudden sense of cold and absently clutch at the lapel of he gorgeous fur-lined ulster then in abrupt reaction he laugh aloud so that the shrill musical falsetto startle the passer-by and in another moment a little semicircle of the curious watch spellbound as a black man exquisitely apparele dance in wild loose grace before the dull background of a somewhat grimy and apparently vacant window a newsboy recognize he he hear he name be pass from mouth to mouth and come partly to he sens he stop dance and grin at they say you be gideon be not you he discoverer demand with a sort of reverent audacity yaa _ seh _ say gideon that be I yo ' shu get it right he break into a joyous peal of laughter -- the laughter that have make he famous and bow deeply before he gideon -- posi - _ tive _ - ly he las ' puffawmunce turn he dash for a pass trolley and still laugh swing aboard he be naturally honest in a land of easy morality he friend have account he something of a paragon nor have stuhk ever have anything but praise for he but now he crush aside the ethic of he intent without a single troubled thought run away have always be inherent in the negro he give one regretful thought to the gorgeous wardrobe he be leave behind he but he dare not return for it stuhk might have take it into he head to go back to they room he must content himself with the reflection that he be at that moment wear he best the trolley seem too slow for he and as always happen nowadays he be recognize he hear he name whisper and be aware of the admiring glance of the curious even popularity have its drawback he get down in front of a big hotel and choose a taxicab from the wait rank exhort the driver to make he best speed to the station lean back in the soft depths of the cab he savor he independence cheer already by the sway lurch speed at the station he tip the driver in lordly fashion very much pleased with himself and anxious to give pleasure only the sternest prudence and a unconquerable awe of uniform have keep he from toss bill to the various traffic policeman who have seem to smile upon he hurry no through train leave for hour but after the first disappointment of momentary check he decide that he be more pleased than otherwise it would save embarrassment he be go south where he color would be more consider than he reputation and on the little local he choose there be a jim crow car -- one that be specially set aside for those of he race that it prove crowded and full of smoke do not trouble he at all nor do the admiring pleasantry which the splendor of he apparel immediately call forth no one know he indeed he be naturally enough mistaken for a prosperous gambler a not unflattering supposition in the yard after the train pull out he see he private car under a glaring arc light and grin to see it leave behind he spend the night pleasantly in a noisy game of high-low-jack and the next morning sleep more soundly than he have sleep for week hunch upon a wooden bench in the boxlike station of a north carolina junction the express would have bring he to jacksonville in twenty-four hour the journey as he take it board any local that happen to be go south and leave it for meal or sometimes for sleep or often as the whim possess he fill five happy day there he take a night train and doze from jacksonville until a little north of new smyrna he awake to find it broad daylight and the car half empty the train be on a siding with news of a freight wreck ahead gideon stretch himself and look out of the window and emotion seize he for all he journey the south have seem to welcome he but here at last be the country he know he go out upon the platform and throw back he head sniff the soft breeze heavy with the mysterious thrill of unplowed acre the wondrous existence of primordial jungle where life have riot unceasingly above unceasing decay it be dry with the fine dust of waste place and wet with the warm mist of slumber swamp it seem to gideon to tremble with the song of bird the dry murmur of palm leave and the almost inaudible whisper of the gray moss that festoon the live-oaks um-m-m he murmur apostrophize it yo ' 's the right kind o ' breeze yo ' be yo ' - all 's healthy still sniff he climb down to the dusty road-bed the negro who have ride with he be sprawl about he on the ground one of they lay sleep face up in the sunlight the train have evidently be there for some time and there be no sign of a immediate departure he buy some orange of a little bowlegged black boy and sit down on a log to eat they and to give up he mind to enjoyment the sun be hot upon he and he thought be vague and drowsy he be glad that he be alive glad to be back once more among familiar scene down the length of the train he see white passenger from the pullman restlessly pacing up and down get into they car and out of they consult watch attach themselves with gesticulatory expostulation to various official but they impatience find no echo in he thought what be the hurry there be plenty of time it be sufficient to have come to he own land the actual wall of home could wait the delay be pleasant with its opportunity for drowsy sun its relief from the grimy monotony of travel he glance at the orange-colored jim crow with distaste and inspiration dawn slowly upon he sweep all other thought before it in its great and grow glory a brakeman pass and gideon leap to he foot and pursue he misteh how long yo ' - all reckon this train goin ' to be about a hour the question have be a mere matter of form gideon have make up he mind and if he have be tell that they start in five minute he would not have change it he climb back into the car for he coat and he hat and then almost furtively steal down the step again and slip quietly into the palmetto scrub ` most make the mistake of ma life he chuckle stickin ' to that ol' train foheveh ' t be not the right way at all foh gideon to come home the river be not far away he could catch the dancing blue of it from time to time in ragged vista and for this beacon he steer directly he coat be heavy on he arm he thin patent-leather tie pinch and burn and demand detour around swampy place but he be happy as he go along he plan perfect itself he would get into loose shoe again old one if money could buy they and old clothes too the bull-brier snatch at he tailor splendor suggest that he laugh when the florida partridge a small quail whir up from under he foot he pause to exchange affectionate mockery with red squirrel and once even when he be bring up suddenly to a familiar and ominous dry reverberation the small crisp sound of the roll drum of death he do not look about he for some instrument of destruction as at any other time he would have do but instead peer cautiously over the log before he and speak in tolerant admonition : now misteh rattlesnake yo ' je min ' yo ' own business nobody 's goin ' step on yo ' ner go triflin ' roun ' yo ' in no way whatsomeveh yo ' je lay there in the sun a ' git 's fat 's yo ' please don ' yo ' tu 'n yo ' week li'l ' eye on gideon he be je goin ' ` long home a ' ain ' lookin ' foh no muss he come presently to the water and as luck would have it to a little group of negro cabin where he be able to buy old clothes and after much dicker a long and somewhat leaky rowboat rig out with a tattered leg-of-mutton sail this he provision with a jug of water a starch box full of white corn-meal and a wide strip of lean razorback bacon as he push out from shore and set he sail to the small breeze that blow down from the north a absolute contentment possess he the idle water of the lagoon lie without tide or current in eternal indolence ripple and sparkle in breeze and sunlight with a merry surface activity and seem to lap the leaky little boat more swiftly on its way mosquito inlet open broadly before he and skirt the end of merritt 's island he come at last into that longest lagoon with which he be most familiar the indian river here the wind die down to a mere breath which barely keep he boat in motion but he make no attempt to row as long as he move at all he be satisfied he be live the fulfilment of he dream in exile lounging in the stern in the ancient clothes he have purchase he foot stretch comfortably before he in they broken shoe one foot upon a thwart the other hang overside so laxly that occasional ripple lap the run-over heel from time to time he scan shore and river for familiar point of interest -- some remembered snag that show the tip of one gnarled branch or he mark a newly fall palmetto already rot in the water which must be add to that map of vast detail that he carry in he head but for the most part he broad black face be turn up to the blue brilliance above he in unblinking contemplation he keen eye brilliant despite they sun-muddied whites revel in the height above he swing from horizon to horizon in the wake of a orderly file of little bluebill duck wing they way across the river or brighten with interest at the rarer sight of a pair of mallard or redhead lift with the soar circle of the great bald-headed eagle or follow the scatter squadron of heron -- white heron blue heron young and old trail sunlit brilliant patch clear even against the bright white and blue of the sky above they often he laugh aloud send a great shout of mirth across the water in fresh relish of those comedy best know and best enjoy it be as excruciatingly funny as it have ever be when he boat nose its way into a great flock of duck idle upon the water to see the mad paddling haste of those nearest he the reproachful turn of they head or if he come too near they spatter run out of water foot and wing pump together as they rise from the surface look for all the world like fat little woman scurry with clutch skirt across city street the pelican too delighted he as they perch with pedantic solemnity upon wharf-pile or sail in hunch and huddle gravity twenty foot above the river 's surface in swift dignified flight which always end suddenly in a abrupt up-ended plunge that throw dignity to the wind in its greedy haste and drop they crash into the water when darkness come suddenly at last he make in toward shore mooring to the warm-fretted end of a fall and forget landing a straggle orange-grove be here broken line of vanquished cultivation struggle little tree swathe and choke in the festoon gray moss still show here and there the valiant golden gleam of fruit gideon have see many such place have see settler come and clear themselves a space in the jungle plant they grove and live for a while in lazy independence and then for some reason or other they would go and before they have scarcely turn they back the jungle have creep in again patiently restore its ancient sovereignty the place be eery with the ghost of dead effort but it please he he make a fire and cook supper eating enormously and with relish he conscience do not trouble he at all stuhk and he own career seem already distant they take small place in he thought and serve merely as a background for he present absolute content he pick some orange and eat they in meditative enjoyment for a while he nod half asleep beside he fire watch the darkened river where the mullet shimmering with phosphorescence still leap starkly above the surface and fall in spatter brilliance midnight find he sprawl asleep beside he fire once he awake the moon have rise and a little breeze wave the
