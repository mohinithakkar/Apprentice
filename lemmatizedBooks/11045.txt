produce by tom harri the ghost-ship by richard middleton thanks be due to the editor of _ the century _ _ english review _ _ vanity fair _ and _ the academy _ for permission to reproduce most of the story in this volume preface the other day i say to a friend i have just be read in proof a volume of short story by a author name richard middleton he be dead it be a extraordinary book and all the work in it be full of a quite curious and distinctive quality in my opinion it be very fine work indeed it would be so simple if the business of the introducer or preface-writer be limit to such a straightforward honest and direct expression of opinion unfortunately that be not so for most of we the happier one of the world it be enough to say i like it or i do not like it and there be a end : the critic have to answer the everlasting why and so i suppose it be my office in this present instance to say why i like the collection of tale that follow i think that i have find a hint as to the right answer in two of these story one be call the story of a book the other the biography of a superman each be rather a essay than a tale though the form of each be narrative the first relate the sad bewilderment of a successful novelist who feel that after all he great work be something less than nothing he could not help notice that london have discover the secret which make he intellectual life a torment the street be more than a mere assemblage of house london herself be more than a tangled skein of street and overhead heaven be more than a meeting-place of individual star what be this secret that make word into a book house into city and restless and measurable star into a unchanging and immeasurable universe then from the biography of a superman i select this very striking passage : -- possess of a intellect of great analytic and destructive force he be almost entirely lack in imagination and he be therefore unable to raise he work to a plane in which the mutually combative element of he nature might have be reconcile he light moment of envy anger and vanity pass into the crucible to come forth unchanged he lack the magic wand and he work never take wing above he conception now compare the two place the street be more than a mere assemblage of house he light moment pass into the crucible to come forth unchanged he lack the magic wand i think these two passage indicate the answer to the why that i be force to resolve show something of the secret of the strange charm which the ghost-ship possess it delight because it be significant because it be no mere assemblage of word and fact and observation and incident it delight because its matter have not pass through the crucible unchanged on the contrary the jumble of experience and impression which fall to the lot of the author as to we all have assuredly be place in the athanor of art in that furnace of the sage which be say to be govern with wisdom lead enter the burning of the fire gold come forth from it this analogy of the process of alchemy which richard middleton have himself suggest be one of the finest and the fittest for we purpose but there be many other the magic wand analogy come to much the same thing there be the like notion of something ugly and insignificant change to something beautiful and significant something ugly shall we not say rather something formless transmute into form after all the latin dictionary declare solemnly that beauty be one of the meaning of forma and here we be away from alchemy and the magic wand idea and pass to the thought of the first place that i have quote : the street be more than a mere assemblage of house the puzzle be solve the jig-saw -- i think they call it -- have be successfully fit together there in a box lay all the jagged irregular piece each in itself crazy and meaningless and irritating by its very lack of meaning : now we see each part adapt to the other and the whole be one picture and one purpose but the first thing necessary to this achievement be the recognition of the fact that there be a puzzle there be many people who go through life persuade that there be not a puzzle at all that it be only the infancy and rude childhood of the world which dream a vain dream of a picture to be make out of the jagged bit of wood there never have be a picture these person say and there never will be a picture all we have to do be to take the bit out of the box look at they and put they back again or return to richard middleton 's excellent example : there be no such thing as london there be only house no man have see london at any time the very word -lrb- mean the fort on the lake -rrb- be nonsensical no human eye have ever behold aught else but a number of house it be clear that this london be as mythical and monstrous and irrational a concept as many other of the same class well people who talk like that be doubtless send into the world for some useful but mysterious process but they can not write real book richard middleton know that there be a puzzle in other word that the universe be a great mystery and this consciousness of he be the source of the charm of the ghost ship i have compare this orthodox view of life and the universe and the fine art that result from this view to the solve of a puzzle but the analogy be not a absolutely perfect one for if you buy a jig-saw in a box in the haymarket you take it home with you and begin to put the piece together and sooner or later the toil be over and the difficulty be overcome : the picture be clear before you yes the toil be over but so be the fun it be but poor sport to do the trick all over again and here be the vast inferiority of the thing they sell in the shop to the universe : we great puzzle be never perfectly solve we come across marvellous hint we join line to line and we heart beat with the rapture of a great surmise we follow a certain track and know by sure sign and signal that we be not mistake that we be on the right road we be furnish with certain chart which tell we here there be water-pool here be a waste place here a high hill riseth and we find as we journey that so it be but happily by the very nature of the case we can never put the whole of the picture together we can never recover the perfect utterance of the lose word we can never say here be the end of all the journey man be so make that all he true delight arise from the contemplation of mystery and save by he own frantic and invincible folly mystery be never take from he it rise within he soul a well of joy unending hence it be that the consciousness of this mystery resolve into the form of art express itself usually -lrb- or always -rrb- by symbol by the part put for the whole now and then as in the case of dante as it be with the great romance-cycle of the holy graal we have a sense of completeness with the vision of the angelic rose and the sentence concern that love which move the sun and the other star there be the shadow of a catholic survey of all thing and so in a less degree it be as we read of the translation of galahad still the rose and the graal be but symbol of the eternal verity not those verity themselves in they essence and in these later day when we have become clever -- with the cleverness of the perform pig -- it be a great thing to find the most obscure and broken indication of the thing which really be there be the true enchantment of true romance in the don quixote -- for those who can understand -- but it be deliver in the mode of parody and burlesque and so it be with the extraordinary fantasy the ghost-ship which give its name to this collection of tale take this story to bit as it be analyze it you will be astonish at its frantic absurdity : the ghostly galleon blow in by a great tempest to a turnip-patch in fairfield a little village lie near the portsmouth road about half-way between london and the sea the farmer grumble at the loss of so many turnip the captain of the weird vessel acknowledge the justice of the claim and toss a great gold brooch to the landlord by way of satisfy the debt the deplorable fact that all the decent village ghost learn to riot with captain bartholomew robert the visit of the parson and he godly admonition to the captain on the evil work he be do mere craziness you will say yes but the strange thing be that as in spite of all jocose trick and low-comedy misadventure don quixote depart from we with a great light shine upon he so this ghost-ship of richard middleton 's somehow or other sail and anchor and re-sail in a unearthly glow and captain bartholomew 's rum that be like hot oil and honey and fire in the vein of the mortal who drink of it have become for I one of the _ nobilium poculorum _ of story and thus do the ship put forth from the village and sail away in a great tempest of wind -- to what unimaginable sea of the spirit the wind that have be howl outside like a outrageous dog have all of a sudden turn as melodious as the carol-boy of a christmas eve we go to the door and the wind burst it open so that the handle be drive clean into the plaster of the wall but we do not think much of that at the time for over we head sail very comfortably through the windy star be the ship that have pass the summer in landlord 's field she porthole and she bay-window be blaze with light and there be a noise of singing and fiddle on she deck he be go shout landlord above the storm and he be take half the village with he i could only nod in answer not have lung like bellows of leather i declare i would not exchange this short crazy enchanting fantasy for a whole wilderness of seemly novel proclaim in decorous accent the undoubted truth that there be milestone on the portsmouth road arthur machen the ghost-ship fairfield be a little village lie near the portsmouth road about half-way between london and the sea stranger who find it by accident now and then call it a pretty old-fashioned place we who live in it and call it home do not find anything very pretty about it but we should be sorry to live anywhere else we mind have take the shape of the inn and the church and the green i suppose at all event we never feel comfortable out of fairfield of course the cockney with they vasty house and noise-ridden street can call we rustic if they choose but for all that fairfield be a better place to live in than london doctor say that when he go to london he mind be bruise with the weight of the house and he be a cockney bear he have to live there himself when he be a little chap but he know better now you gentleman may laugh -- perhaps some of you come from london way -- but it seem to I that a witness like that be worth a gallon of argument dull well you might find it dull but i assure you that i have listen to all the london yarn you have spin tonight and they be absolutely nothing to the thing that happen at fairfield it be because of we way of think and mind we own business if one of you londoner be set down on the green of a Saturday night when the ghost of the lad who die in the war keep tryst with the lass who lie in the church-yard he could not help be curious and interfere and then the ghost would go somewhere where it be quieter but we just let they come and go and do not make any fuss and in consequence fairfield be the ghostiest place in all england why i have see a headless man sit on the edge of the well in broad daylight and the child play about he foot as if he be they father take my word for it spirit know when they be well off as much as human being still i must admit that the thing i be go to tell you about be queer even for we part of the world where three pack of ghost-hounds hunt regularly during the season and blacksmith 's great-grandfather be busy all night shoe the dead gentleman 's horse now that be a thing that would not happen in london because of they interfere way but blacksmith he lie up aloft and sleep as quiet as a lamb once when he have a bad head he shout down to they not to make so much noise and in the morning he find a old guinea leave on the anvil as a apology he wear it on he watch-chain now but i must get on with my story if i start tell you about the queer happening at fairfield i 'll never stop it all come of the great storm in the spring of '97 the year that we have two great storm this be the first one and i remember it very well because i find in the morning that it have lift the thatch of my pigsty into the widow 's garden as clean as a boy 's kite when i look over the hedge widow -- tom lamport 's widow that be -- be prod for she nasturtium with a daisy-grubber after i have watch she for a little i go down to the fox and grape to tell landlord what she have say to I landlord he laugh be a married man and at ease with the sex come to that he say the tempest have blow something into my field a kind of a ship i think it would be i be surprise at that until he explain that it be only a ghost-ship and would do no hurt to the turnip we argue that it have be blow up from the sea at portsmouth and then we talk of something else there be two slate down at the parsonage and a big tree in lumley 's meadow it be a rare storm i reckon the wind have blow we ghost all over england they be come back for day afterwards with founder horse and as footsore as possible and they be so glad to get back to fairfield that some of they walk up the street cry like little child squire say that he great-grandfather 's great-grandfather have not look so dead-beat since the battle of naseby and he be a educate man what with one thing and another i should think it be a week before we get straight again and then one afternoon i meet the landlord on the green and he have a worried face i wish you would come and have a look at that ship in my field he say to I it seem to I it be lean real hard on the turnip i can not bear think what the missus will say when she see it i walk down the lane with he and sure enough there be a ship in the middle of he field but such a ship as no man have see on the water for three hundred year let alone in the middle of a turnip-field it be all paint black and cover with carving and there be a great bay window in the stern for all the world like the squire 's drawing-room there be a crowd of little black cannon on deck and look out of she port-hole and she be anchor at each end to the hard ground i have see the wonder of the world on picture-postcard but i have never see anything to equal that she seem very solid for a ghost-ship i say see the landlord be bother i should say it be a betwixt and between he answer puzzling it over but it be go to spoil a matter of fifty turnip and missus she 'll want it move we go up to she and touch the side and it be as hard as a real ship now there be folk in england would call that very curious he say now i do not know much about ship but i should think that that ghost-ship weigh a solid two hundred ton and it seem to I that she have come to stay so that i feel sorry for landlord who be a married man all the horse in fairfield will not move she out of my turnip he say frowning at she just then we hear a noise on she deck and we look up and see that a man have come out of she front cabin and be look down at we very peaceably he be dress in a black uniform set out with rusty gold lace and he have a great cutlass by he side in a brass sheath i be captain bartholomew robert he say in a gentleman 's voice put in for recruit i seem to have bring she rather far up the harbor harbor cry landlord why you be fifty mile from the sea captain robert do not turn a hair so much as that be it he say coolly well it be of no consequence landlord be a bit upset at this i do not want to be unneighbourly he say but i wish you have not bring you ship into my field you see my wife set great store on these turnip the captain take a pinch of snuff out of a fine gold box that he pull out of he pocket and dust he finger with a silk handkerchief in a very genteel fashion i be only here for a few month he say but if a testimony of my esteem would pacify you good lady i should be content and with the word he loose a great gold brooch from the neck of he coat and toss it down to landlord landlord blush as red as a strawberry i be not deny she be fond of jewellery he say but it be too much for half a sackful of turnip and indeed it be a handsome brooch the captain laugh tut man he say it be a forced sale and you deserve a good price say no more about it and nod good-day to we he turn on he heel and go into the cabin landlord walk back up the lane like a man with a weight off he mind that tempest have blow I a bit of luck he say the missus will be much pleased with that brooch it be better than blacksmith 's guinea any day ninety-seven be jubilee year the year of the second jubilee you remember and we have great doings at fairfield so that we have not much time to bother about the ghost-ship though anyhow it be not we way to meddle in thing that do not concern we landlord he see he tenant once or twice when he be hoe he turnip and pass the time of day and landlord 's wife wear she new brooch to church every Sunday but we do not mix much with the ghost at any time all except a idiot lad there be in the village and he do not know the difference between a man and a ghost poor innocent on jubilee day however somebody tell captain robert why the church bell be ring and he hoist a flag and fire off he gun like a loyal englishman ` tis true the gun be shot and one of the round shot knock a hole in farmer johnstone 's barn but nobody think much of that in such a season of rejoice it be not till we celebration be over that we notice that anything be wrong in fairfield 'twa shoemaker who tell I first about it one morning at the fox and grape you know my great great-uncle he say to I you mean joshua the quiet lad i answer know he well quiet say shoemaker indignantly quiet you call he come home at three o'clock every morning as drunk as a magistrate and wake up the whole house with he noise why it can not be joshua i say for i know he for one of the most respectable young ghost in the village joshua it be say shoemaker and one of these night he 'll find himself out in the street if he be not careful this kind of talk shock I i can tell you for i do not like to hear a man abuse he own family and i could hardly believe that a steady youngster like joshua have take to drink but just then in come butcher aylwin in such a temper that he could hardly drink he beer the young puppy the young puppy he keep on say and it be some time before shoemaker and i find out that he be talk about he ancestor that fall at senlac drink say shoemaker hopefully for we all like company in we misfortune and butcher nod grimly the young noodle he say empty he tankard well after that i keep my ear open and it be the same story all over the village there be hardly a young man among all the ghost of fairfield who do not roll home in the small hour of the morning the worse for liquor i use to wake up in the night and hear they stumble past my house singing outrageous song the worst of it be that we could not keep the scandal to ourselves and the folk at greenhill begin to talk of sodden fairfield and teach they child to sing a song about we : sodden fairfield sodden fairfield have no use for bread-and-butter rum for breakfast rum for dinner rum for tea and rum for supper we be easy-going in we village but we do not like that of course we soon find out where the young fellow go to get the drink and landlord be terribly cut up that he tenant should have turn out so badly but he wife would not hear of parting with the brooch so that he could not give the captain notice to quit but as time go on thing grow from bad to worse and at all hour of the day you would see those young reprobate sleep it off on the village green nearly every afternoon a ghost-wagon use to jolt down to the ship with a lading of rum and though the older ghost seem incline to give the captain 's hospitality the go-by the youngster be neither to hold nor to bind so one afternoon when i be take my nap i hear a knock at the door and there be parson look very serious like a man with a job before he that he do not altogether relish i be go down to talk to the captain about all this drunkenness in the village and i want you to come with I he say straight out i can not say that i fancy the visit much myself and i try to hint to parson that as after all they be only a lot of ghost it do not very much matter dead or alive i be responsible for the good conduct he say and i be go to do my duty and put a stop to this continued disorder and you be come with I john simmon so i go parson be a persuasive kind of man we go down to the ship and as we approach she i could see the captain tasting the air on deck when he see parson he take off he hat very politely and i can tell you that i be relieve to find that he have a proper respect for the cloth parson acknowledge he salute and speak out stoutly enough sir i should be glad to have a word with you come on board sir come on board say the captain and i could tell by he voice that he know why we be there parson and i climb up a uneasy kind of ladder and the captain take we into the great cabin at the back of the ship where the bay-window be it be the most wonderful place you ever see in you life all full of gold and silver plate sword with jewelled scabbard carve oak chair and great chest that look as though they be burst with guinea even parson be surprised and he do not shake he head very hard when the captain take down some silver cup and pour we out a drink of rum i tasted mine and i do not mind say that it change my view of thing entirely there be nothing betwixt and between about that rum and i feel that it be ridiculous to blame the lad for drinking too much of stuff like that it seem to fill my vein with honey and fire parson put the case squarely to the captain but i do not listen much to what he say i be busy sip my drink and look through the window at the fish swim to and fro over landlord 's turnip just then it seem the most natural thing in the world that they should be there though afterwards of course i could see that that prove it be a ghost-ship but even then i think it be queer when i see a drowned sailor float by in the thin air with he hair and beard all full of bubble it be the first time i have see anything quite like that at fairfield all the time i be regard the wonder of the deep parson be tell captain robert how there be no peace or rest in the village owe to the curse of drunkenness and what a bad example the youngster be set to the older ghost the captain listen very attentively and only put in a word now and then about boy be boy and young man sowing they wild oats but when parson have finish he speech he fill up we silver cup and say to parson with a flourish i should be sorry to cause trouble anywhere where i have be make welcome and you will be glad to hear that i put to sea tomorrow night and now you must drink I a prosperous voyage so we all stand up and drink the toast with honor and that noble rum be like hot oil in my vein after that captain show we some of the curiosity he have bring back from foreign part and we be greatly amaze though afterwards i could not clearly remember what they be and then i find myself walk across the turnip with parson and i be tell he of the glory of the deep that i have see through the window of the ship he turn on I severely if i be you john simmon he say i should go straight home to bed he have a way of put thing that would not occur to a ordinary man have parson and i do as he tell I well next day it come on to blow and it blow harder and harder till about eight o'clock at night i hear a noise and look out into the garden i dare say you will not believe I it seem a bit tall even to I but the wind have lift the thatch of my pigsty into the widow 's garden a second time i think i would not wait to hear what widow have to say about it so i go across the green to the fox and grape and the wind be so strong that i dance along on tiptoe like a girl at the fair when i get to the inn landlord have to help I shut the door it seem as though a dozen goat be push against it to come in out of the storm it be a powerful tempest he say draw the beer i hear there be a chimney down at dickory end it be a funny thing how these sailor know about the weather i answer when captain say he be go tonight i be think it would take a capful of wind to carry the ship back to sea but now here be more than a capful ah yes say landlord it be tonight he go true enough and mind you though he treat I handsome over the rent i be not sure it be a loss to the village i do not hold with gentrice who fetch they drink from london instead of help local trader to get they living but you have not get any rum like he i say to draw he out he neck grow red above he collar and i be afraid i would go too far but after a while he get he breath with a grunt john simmon he say if you have come down here this windy night to talk a lot of fool 's talk you have waste a journey well of course then i have to smooth he down with praise he rum and heaven forgive I for swearing it be better than captain 's for the like of that rum no living lip have taste save mine and parson 's but somehow or other i bring landlord round and presently we must have a glass of he best to prove its quality beat that if you can he cry and we both raise we glass to we mouth only to stop half-way and look at each other in amaze for the wind that have be howl outside like a outrageous dog have all of a sudden turn as melodious as the carol-boy of a christmas eve surely that be not my martha whisper landlord martha be he great-aunt that live in the loft overhead we go to the door and the wind burst it open so that the handle be drive clean into the plaster of the wall but we do not think about that at the time for over we head sail very comfortably through the windy star be the ship that have pass the summer in landlord 's field she porthole and she bay-window be blaze with light and there be a noise of singing and fiddle on she deck he be go shout landlord above the storm and he be take half the village with he i could only nod in answer not have lung like bellows of leather in the morning we be able to measure the strength of the storm and over and above my pigsty there be damage enough work in the village to keep we busy true it be that the child have to break down no branch for the firing that autumn since the wind have strew the wood with more than they could carry away many of we ghost be scatter abroad but this time very few come back all the young man have sail with captain and not only ghost for a poor half-witted lad be miss and we reckon that he have stow himself away or perhaps ship as cabin-boy not know any better what with the lamentation of the ghost-girl and the grumbling of family who have lose a ancestor the village be upset for a while and the funny thing be that it be the folk who have complain most of the carryings-on of the youngster who make most noise now that they be go i have not any sympathy with shoemaker or butcher who run about say how much they miss they lad but it make I grieve to hear the poor bereaved girl call they lover by name on the village green at nightfall it do not seem fair to I that they should have lose they man a second time after give up life in order to join they as like as not still not even a spirit can be sorry for ever and after a few month we make up we mind that the folk who have sail in the ship be never come back and we do not talk about it any more and then one day i dare say it would be a couple of year after when the whole business be quite forget who should come trapesing along the road from portsmouth but the daft lad who have go away with the ship without wait till he be dead to become a ghost you never see such a boy as that in all you life he have a great rusty cutlass hang to a string at he waist and he be tattoo all over in fine color so that even he face look like a girl 's sampler he have a handkerchief in he hand full of foreign shell and old-fashioned piece of small money very curious and he walk up to the well outside he mother 's house and draw himself a drink as if he have be nowhere in particular the worst of it be that he have come back as soft-headed as he go and try as we might we could not get anything reasonable out of he he talk a lot of gibberish about keel-hauling and walk the plank and crimson murder -- thing which a decent sailor should know nothing about so that it seem to I that for all he manners captain have be more of a pirate than a gentleman mariner but to draw sense out of that boy be as hard as pick cherry off a crab-tree one silly tale he have that he keep on drift back to and to hear he you would have think that it be the only thing that happen to he in he life we be at anchor he would say off a island call the basket of flower and the sailor have catch a lot of parrot and we be teach they to swear up and down the deck up and down the deck and the language they use be dreadful then we look up and see the mast of the spanish ship outside the harbor outside the harbor they be so we throw the parrot into the sea and sail out to fight and all the parrot be drownd in the sea and the language they use be dreadful that be the sort of boy he be nothing but silly talk of parrot when we ask he about the fighting and we never have a chance of teach he better for two day after he run away again and have not be see since that be my story and i assure you that thing like that be happen at fairfield all the time the ship have never come back but somehow as people grow older they seem to think that one of these windy night she 'll come sailing in over the hedge with all the lose ghost on board well when she come she 'll be welcome there be one ghost-lass that have never grow tired of wait for she lad to return every night you 'll see she out on the green strain she poor eye with look for the mast-light among the star a faithful lass you would call she and i be think you would be right landlord 's field be not a penny the worse for the visit but they do say that since then the turnip that have be grow in it have taste of rum a drama of youth i for some day school have seem to I even more tedious than usual the long train journey in the morning the walk through farringdon meat market which æsthetic butcher make hideous with mosaic of the intestine of animal as if the horror of suety pavement and bloody sawdust do not suffice the weariness of invent lie that no one believe to account for my lateness and neglect homework and the monotonous lesson that hold I from my dream without ever for a single instant capture my interest -- all these thing make I ill with repulsion worst of all be the society of my cheerful contented comrade to avoid which i be compel to mope in desert corridor the prey of a sorrow that could not be enjoy a hatred that be in no way stimulate at the best of time the atmosphere of the place disgust I desk window and floor and even the grass in the quadrangle be greasy with london soot and there be nowhere any clean air to breathe or smell i hate the gritty asphalt that give no peace to my foot and cut my knee when my clumsiness make I fall i hate the long stone corridor whose echo seem to I to mock my hesitating footstep when i pass from one dull class to another i hate the stuffy malodorous classroom with they whistle gas-jet and noise of inharmonious life i would have hate the yellow fog have they not sometimes shorten the hour of my bondage that five hundred boy share this horrible environment with I do not abate my suffering a jot for it be clear that they do not find it distasteful and they therefore become as unsympathetic for I as the smell and noise and rot stone of the school itself the master move as it be in another world and as the class be large they understand I as little as i understand they they know that i be idle and untruthful and they could not know that i be as full of nerve as a girl and that the mere task of get to school every morning make I physically sick they punish I repeatedly and in vain for i find every hour i pass within the wall of the school a overwhelming punishment in itself and nothing i make any difference to I i lie to they because they expect it and because i have no word in which to express the truth if i know it which be doubtful for some reason i could not tell they at home why i get on so badly at school or no doubt they would have take I away and send I to a country school as they do afterwards nearly all the real sorrow of childhood be due to this dumbness of the emotion we teach child to convey fact by means of word but we do not teach they how to make they feeling intelligible unfortunately perhaps i be very happy at night with my story-book and my dream so that the real misery of my day escape the attention of the grown-up people of course i never even think of do my homework and the labor of invent new lie every day to account for my negligence become so wearisome that once or twice i tell the truth and simply say i have not do it but the master hold that this frankness aggravate the offence and i have to take up anew my tiresome tale of improbable calamity sometimes my story be so wild that the whole class would laugh and i would have to laugh myself yet on the strength of this elaborate politeness to authority i come to believe myself that i be untruthful by nature the boy dislike I because i be not sociable but after a time they grow tired of bully I and leave I alone i detest they because they be all so much alike that they number fill I with horror i remember that the first day i go to school i walk round and round the quadrangle in the luncheon-hour and every boy who pass stop I and ask I my name and what my father be when i say he be a engineer every one of the boy reply oh the man who drive the engine the reiteration of this childish joke make I hate they from the first and afterwards i discover that they be equally unimaginative in everything they do sometimes i would stand in the midst of they and wonder what be the matter with I that i should be so different from all the rest when they tease I repeat the same question over and over again i cry easily like a girl without quite know why for they stupidity could not hurt my reason but when they bully I i do not cry because the pain make I forget the sadness of my heart perhaps it be because of this that they think i be a little mad gray day follow gray day and i might in time have abandon all effort to be faithful to my dream and achieve a kind of beast-like submission that be all the authority expect of notorious dunce i might have teach my sens to accept the evil condition of life in that unclean place i might even have succeed in make myself one with the army of shadow that throng in the quadrangle and fill the air with meaningless noise but one evening when i reach home i saw by the face of the grown-up people that something have upset they elaborate precaution for a order life and i discover that my brother who have stay at home with a cold be ill in bed with the measles for a while the significance of the news escape I then with a sudden movement of my heart which make I feel ill i realize that probably i would have to stay away from school because of the infection my foot tap on the floor with joy though i try to appear unconcerned then as i nurse my sudden hope of freedom a little fearfully lest it should prove a illusion a new and enchanting idea come to I i slip from the room run upstairs to my bedroom and standing by the side of my bed tear open my waistcoat and shirt with clumsy tremble finger one two three four five i count the spot in a triumphant voice and then with a sudden revulsion sit down on the bed to give the world a opportunity to settle back in its place i have the measles and therefore i should not have to go back to school i shut my eye for a minute and open they again but still i have the measles the cup of happiness be at my lip but i sip delicately because it be full to the brim and i would not spill a drop this mood do not last long i have to run down the house and tell the world the good news the grown-up people rebuke my joyousness while admit that it might be as well that i should have the measles then as later on in spite of they air of resignation i could hardly sit still for excitement i want to go into the kitchen and show my measles to the servant but i be tell to stay where i be in front of the fire while my bed be move into my brother 's room so i stare at the glowing coal till my eye smart and dream long dream i would be in bed for day all warm from head to foot and no one would interrupt my pleasant excursion in the world i prefer to this if i have hear of the beneficent microbe to which low my happiness i would have mention it in my prayer late that night i call over to my brother to ask how long measles last he tell I to go to sleep so that i know he do not know the answer to my question i lay at ease tranquilly turn the problem over in my mind four week six week eight week why if i be lucky it would carry I through to the holiday at all event school be already very far away like a nightmare remember at noon i say good-night to my brother and receive a irritated grunt in reply i do not mind he surliness tomorrow when i wake up i would begin my dream ii when i find myself in bed in the morning already sick at heart because even while i sleep i could not forget the long torment of my life at school i would lie still for a minute or two and try to concentrate my shudder mind on something pleasant some little detail of the moment that seem to justify hope perhaps i have some money to spend or a holiday to look forward to though often enough i would find nothing to save I from realize with childish intensity the greyness of the world in which it be my fate to move i do not want to go out into life it be dull and gruel and greasy with soot i only want to stop at home in any little quiet corner out of everybody 's way and think my long heroic thought but even while i mumble my hasty breakfast and run to the station to catch my train the atmosphere of the school be all about I and my dreamer 's courage tremble and vanish when i wake from sleep the morning after my good fortune i do not at first realize the extent of my happiness i only know that deep in my heart i be conscious of some great cause for joy then my eye still dim with sleep discover that i be in my brother 's bedroom and in a flash the joyful truth be reveal to I i sit up and hastily examine my body to make sure that the rash have not disappear and then my spirit sing a song of thanksgiving of which the refrain be i have the measles i lay back in bed and enjoy the exquisite luxury of thinking of the evil that i have escape for once my morbid sense of atmosphere be a desirable possession and helpful to my happiness it be delightful to pull the bedclothes over my shoulder and conceive the feeling of a small boy who should ride to town in a jolting train walk through a hundred kind of dirt and a hundred disgusting smell to win to prison at last where he should perform meaningless task in the distressing society of five hundred mock ape it be pleasant to see the morning sun and feel no sickness in my stomach no sense of depression in my tired brain across the room my brother gurgle and choke in he sleep and in some subtle way contribute to my ecstasy of tranquillity i be no longer concern for the duration of my happiness i feel that this peace that i have desire so long must surely last for ever to the grown-up folk who come to see we during the day -- the doctor certain germ-proof unmarried aunt truculently maternal and the family itself -- my brother 's case be far more interesting than mine because he have catch the measles really badly i just have they comfortably enough to be infectious but not enough to feel ill so i be leave in pleasant solitude while the woman compete for the honor of smooth my brother 's pillow and tiptoe in a fidget manner round he bed i lay on my back and look with placid interest at the crack in the ceiling they be like the main road in a map and i amuse myself by build little house beside they -- house full of book and warm hearthrug and with a nice pond lively with tadpole in the garden of each from the window of the house you could watch all the traffic that go along the road man and woman and horse and best of all the boy go to school in the morning -- boy who have not do they homework and who would be late for prayer when i talk about the crack to my brother he say that perhaps the ceiling would give way and fall on we head i think about this too and find it quite easy to picture myself lie in the bed with a smash head and blood all over the pillow then it occur to I that the plaster might smash I all over and my impression of farringdon meat market add a gruesome vividness to my conception of the consequence i always find it pleasant to imagine horrible thing it be only the reality that make I sick towards nightfall i become a little feverish and i hear the grown-up say that they would give I some medicine later on medicine for I signify the nauseous powder of dr gregory so i pretend to be asleep every time anyone come into the room in order to escape my destiny until at last some one stand by my bedside so long that i become cramped and have to pretend to wake up then i be give the medicine and find to my surprise that it be delicious and taste of orange i feel that there have be a mistake somewhere but my head sit a little heavily on my shoulder and i would not trouble to fix the responsibility this time i fall asleep in earnest and wake in the middle of the night to find my brother standing by my bed make noise with he mouth i think that he have go mad and would kill I perhaps but after a time he go back to bed say all the bad word he know the excitement have make I wide awake and i toss about thinking of the crack ceiling above my head the room be quite dark and i could see nothing so that it might be bulge over I without my know it i stand up in bed and stretch up my arm but i could not reach the ceiling yet when i lay down again i feel as though it have sink so far that it be touch my hair and i find it difficult to breathe in such a small space i be afraid to move for fear of bring it down upon I and in a short while the pressure upon my body become unbearable and i shriek out for help some one come in and light the gas and find I look very foolish and my brother delirious i fall asleep almost immediately but be conscious through my dream that the gas be still alight and that they be watch by my brother 's bedside in the morning he be very ill and i be no longer feverish so it be decide to move I back into my own bedroom i be wrap up in the bedclothes and tell to sit still while the bed be move i sit in a armchair feeling like a bundle of old clothes and look at the crack in the ceiling which seem to I like road i know that i have already lose all importance as a invalid but i be very happy nevertheless for from the window of one of my little house i be watch the boy go to school and my heart be warm with the knowledge of my own emancipation as my leg hang down from the chair i find it hard to keep my slipper on my stockingless foot iii there follow for I a period of deep and unbroken satisfaction i be soon consider well enough to get up and i live pleasantly between the sofa and the fireside wait on my brother 's convalescence for it have be settle that i should go away with he to the country for a change of air i read dickens and duma in english and make up long story in which i myself play important but not always heroic part by means of intellectual exercise of this kind i achieve a tranquillity like that of a old man fear nothing desire nothing regret nothing i no longer reckon the day or the hour i content to enjoy a passionless condition of be that ask no question and seek none of I nor do i trouble to number my journey in the world of infinite shadow but in that long hour of peace i realize that in some inexplicable way i be interested in the body of a little boy whose hand obey my unspoken wish whose leg sprawl before I on the sofa i know that before i meet he this boy whose littleness surprise I have suffer ill dream in a nameless world and now wear out with tear and humiliation and dread of life he sleep and while he sleep i watch he dispassionately as i would have look at a cripple daddy-long-leg to have feel compassion for he would have disturb the tranquillity that be a necessary condition of my existence so i contented myself with notice he presence and give he a small part in the pageant of my dream he be not so beautiful as i wish all my comrade to be and he be besides very small but shadow be amiable play-friend and they do not blame he because he cry when he be tease and do not cry when he be beat or because the wild unreason of he sorrow make he find cause for tear in the very fullness of he rare enjoyment for the first time in my life it seem to I i see this little boy as he be squat-bodied big-headed thick-lipped and with a face sweep clean of all emotion save where he two great eye glow with a sulky fire under exaggerated eyebrow i notice he grimy nail he soil collar he unbrushed clothes the patent sign of defeat change to utter rout and from the height of my great peace i be not sorry for he he be like that other boy be different that be all and then on a day fear return to my heart and my newly discover utopia be no more i do not know what chance word of the grown-up people or what random thought of mine do the mischief but of a sudden i realize that for all my dream i be only separate by a measurable number of day from the horror of school already i be sick with fear and in place of my dream i distressed myself by visualise the scene of the life i dread -- the meat market the dusty shadow of the gymnasium the sombre reticence of the great hall all that my lose tranquillity have give I be a keener sense of my own be my smallness my ugliness my helplessness in the face of the great cruel world before i have sometimes be able to dull my emotion in unpleasant circumstance and thus achieve a dogged calm now i be horribly conscious of my physical sensation and above all of that deadly sinking in my stomach call fear i clenched my hand tell myself that i be happy and try to force my mind to pleasant thought but though my head swam with the effort i continue to be conscious that i be afraid in the midst of my mental struggle i discover that even if i succeed in think happy thing i should still have to go back to school after all and the knowledge that think could not avert calamity be like a bruise on my mind i pinched my arm and leg with the idea that immediate pain would make I forget my fear for the future but i be not brave enough to pinch they really hard and i could not forget the motive for my action i lay back on the sofa and kick the cushion with my foot in a kind of forlorn anger thought be no use nothing be any use and my stomach be sick sick with fear and suddenly i become aware of a immense fatigue that overwhelm my mind and my body and make I feel as helpless as a little child the tear that be always near my eye stream down my face make my cheek sore against the wet cushion and my breath come in painful ridiculous gulp for a moment i make a effort to control my grief and then i give way utterly cry with my whole body like a little child until like a little child i fall asleep when i awake the room be gray with dusk and i sit up with a sway head glad to hide the shame of my foolish swollen face amongst the shadow my mouth be still salt with tear and i be very thirsty but i be always anxious to hide my weakness from other people and i be afraid that if i ask for something to drink they would see that i have be cry the fire have go out while i sleep and i feel cold and stiff but my abandonment of restraint have relieve I and my fear be now no more than a vague unrest my mind think slowly but very clearly i see that it be a pity that i have not be more ill than i be for then like my brother i should have go away for a month instead of a fortnight as it be everybody laugh at I because i look so well and say they do not believe that i have be ill at all if i have think of it earlier i might have be able to make myself worse somehow or other but now it be too late when the maid come in and light the gas for tea she blame I for let the fire out and tell I that i have a dirty face i be glad of the chance to slip away and wash my burning cheek in cold water when i have finish and dry my face on the rough towel i look at myself in the glass i look as if i have be to the seaside for a holiday my cheek be so red that night as i lay sleepless in my bed seek for a cool place between the sheet in which to rest my hot foot the sickness of fear return to I and i know that i be lose i shut my eye tightly but i could not shut out the vivid picture of school life that my memory have store up for my torment i beat my head against the pillow but i could not change my thought i recall all the possible event that might interfere with my return to school a new illness a railway accident even suicide but my reason would not accept these romantic issue i be helpless before my destiny and my destiny make I i afraid and then perhaps i be half asleep or fond with fear i leap out of bed and stand in the middle of the room to meet life and fight it the hem of my nightshirt tickle my shin and my foot grow cold on the carpet but though i stand ready with my fist clench i could see no adversary among the friendly shadow i could hear no sound but the i drum of the blood against the wall of my head i get back into bed and pull the bedclothes about my chill body it seem that life would not fight fair and be only a little boy and not wise like the grown-up people i could find no way in which to outwit it iv my grow panic in the face of my imminent return to school spoilt my holiday and i watch my brother 's careless delight in the surrey pine-wood with keen envy it seem to I that it be easy for he to enjoy himself with he month to squander and in any case he be a healthy cheerful boy who like school well enough when he be there though of course he like holiday better he have scant patience with my mood and secretly i too think they be wicked we have be teach to believe that we alone be responsible for we sin and it do not occur to I that the cause of my wickedness might lie beyond my control the beauty of the scented pine and the new green of the bracken take my breath and fill my heart with a joy that change immediately to overwhelming grief for i could not help contrast this glorious kind of life with the squalid existence to which i must return so soon i realize so fiercely the force of the contrast that i be afraid to make friend with the pine and admire the palm-like beauty of the bracken lest i should increase my subsequent anguish and i hide myself in dark corner of the wood to fight the grow sickness of my body with the feeble weapon of my panic-stricken mind there follow moment of bitter sorrow when i blame myself for not take advantage of my hour of freedom and i hurry along the sandy lane in a desolate effort to enjoy myself before it be too late in spite of the miserable manner in which i spend my day the fortnight seem to pass with extraordinary rapidity as the end approach the people around I make it difficult for I to conceal my emotion the grown-up deduce from my melancholy that i be tire of holiday and would be glad to get back to school and my brother burden I with idle message to the other boys-message that shatter my hardly form hope that school do not really exist i stand ever on the verge of tear and i dread meal-time when i have to leave my solitude lest some turn of the conversation should set I weep before they all and i should hear once more what i know very well myself that it be a shameful thing for a boy of my age to cry like a little girl yet the tear be there and the hard lump in my throat and i could not master they though i stand in the wood while the sun set with a splendor that chill my heart and try to drain my eye dry of they rebellious bitter water i would choke over my tea and be rebuke for bad manners when the last day come that i have fear most of all i succeed in say goodbye to the people at the house where i have stop and in make the mournful train journey home without disgrace myself it seem as though a merciful stupor have dull my sens to a mute acceptance of my purgatory i sleep in the train and arrive home so sleepy that i be allow to go straight to bed without comment for once my body dominate my mind and i slip between the sheet in a ecstasy of fatigue and fall asleep immediately something of this rare mood linger with I in the morning and it be not until i reach the meat market that i realize the extent of my misfortune i see the greasy red-faced man with they hand and apron stain with blood i see the hideous carcase of animal the mass of entrails the heap of repulsive hide but most clearly of all i see a ugly sad little boy with a satchel of book on he back set down in the midst of a enormous and hostile world the window and stone of the house be black with soot and before I there lay school the place that have never bring I anything but sorrow and humiliation i go on but as i slide on the cobble my mind catch a echo of peace the peace of pine-wood and heather the peace of the library at home and my body tremble with revulsion i lean against a lamp-post deadly sick then i turn on my heel and walk away from the meat market and the school for ever as i go i cry sometimes openly before all man sometimes furtively before shop-window dab my eye with a wet pocket-handkerchief and gasp for breath i do not care where my foot lead I i would go back to school no more i have play truant for three day before the grown-up discover that i have not return to school they treat I with that extraordinary consideration that they always extend to we great crime and never to we little sin of thoughtlessness or high spirit the doctor see I i be tell that i would be send to a country school after the next holiday and meanwhile i be allow to return to my sofa and my dream i lay there and read dickens and be very happy as a rule the cat keep I company and i be please with he placid society though he make my leg cramp i think that i too would like to be a cat the new boy i when i leave home to go to boarding-school for the first time i do not cry like the little boy in the story-book though i have never be away from home before except to spend holiday with relative this be not due to any extraordinary self-control on my part for i be always ready to shed tear on the most trivial occasion but as a fact i have other thing to think about and do not in the least realize the significance of my journey i have lot of new clothes and more money in my pocket than i have ever have before and in the guard 's van at the back of the train there be a large box that i have pack myself with jam and potted meat and cake in this as in other matter i have be aid by the expert advice of a brother who be himself at a school in the north and it be perhaps natural that in the comfortable security of the holiday he should have give I a almost lyrical account of the joy of life at a boarding-school moreover my existence as a day-boy in london have be so unhappy that i be prepare to welcome any change so at most i feel only a vague unease as to the future after i have glance at my papers i sit back and stare at my eldest brother who have be tell off to see I safely to school at that time i do not like he because he seem to I unduly insistent on he rights and i could not help wonder at the tactlessness of the grown-up people in choose he as my travel companion with any one else this journey might have be a joyous affair but there be incident between we that neither of we would forget so that i could find nothing better than a awkward politeness with which to meet he strained amiability he feign a intense interest in he magazine while i look out of window with one finger in my waistcoat pocket scratch the comfortable milled edge of my money when i see little farm-house forget in the green dimple of the kentish hill i think that it would be nice to live there with a room full of story-book away from the discomfort and difficulty of life like a cat i want to dream somewhere where i would not be trodden on somewhere where i would be neglect by friend and foe alike this be my normal desire but side by side with my craving for peace i be aware of a new and interesting emotion that suggest the possibility of a life even more agreeable the excitement of packing my box with provender like a sailor who be go on a long voyage the unwonted thrill of have a large sum of money conceal about my person and above all the imaginative yarn of my elder brother have fire I with the thought of adventure he story have be fill with a utter contempt for lesson and a superb defiance of the authority and have range from desperate rabbit-shooting party on the yorkshire wold to illicit feast of eccle cake and tinned lobster in moonlit dormitory i think that it would be pleasant to experience this romantic kind of life before settle down for good with my dream the train wander on and my eldest brother and i look at each other constrainedly he have already ask I twice whether i have my ticket and i realize that he could not think of any other neutral remark that fit the occasion it occur to I to say that the train be slow but i remember with a glow of anger how he have once rub a strawberry in my face because i have take the liberty of offer it to one of he friend and i hold my peace i have pray for he death every night for three week after that and though he be still alive the knowledge of my unconfessed and unrepented wickedness prevent I from be more than conveniently polite he think i be a cheeky little toad and i think he be a bully so we look at each other and do not speak we be both glad therefore when the train pull up at the station that bear the name of my new school my first emotion be a keen regret that my parent have not send I to a place where the sun shone as we sit in the little omnibus that carry we from the station to the town with my precious box safely store on the roof we pass between gray field whose featureless expanse melt changelessly into the gray sky overhead the prospect alarm I for it seem to I that this be not a likely world for adventure nor be i reassure by the sight of the town whose one long street of low old-fashioned house strike I as be mean and sordid i be conscious that the place have a unpleasant smell and i be already drive to thinking of my pocket-money and my play-box -- agreeable thought which i have make up my mind in the train to reserve carefully for possible hour of unhappiness but the low roof of the omnibus be like a limit to my imagination and my body be trouble by the displease contact of the velvet cushion i be still wonder why this make my wrist ache when the omnibus lurch from the cobble on to a gravel drive and i see the school building tower all about I like the wall of a prison i jump out and stretch my leg while the driver climb down to collect the fare he look at I without a jot of interest and i know that he must have drive a great many boy from the station to the school in the course of he life a man appear in shirt-sleeve of gray flannel and wheel my box away on a little truck and after a while a master come down and show we in a perfunctory manner over the more presentable quarter of the school my brother be anxious to get away because he have not be emancipate long enough to find the atmosphere of dormitory and class-room agreeable i be naturally interested in my new environment but the presence of the master constrain I and i be afraid to speak in front of this unknown man whom it be my lot to obey so we be all relieve when we hurry inspection be over he tell I that i be at liberty to do what i pleased till seven o'clock so i go for a walk through the town with my brother the day be draw to a chill gray close and the town be fill with a clammy mist taint with the odour of sewage due i afterwards discover to the popular abuse of the little stream that give the place its name even my brother could not entirely escape the melancholy influence of the hour and the place and he be glad to take I into a baker 's shop and have tea by now the illusion of adventure that have reconcile I to leave home be in a desperate state and i drink my tea and consume my cake without enjoyment if life be always go to be the same -- if in flee one misfortune i have merely bring on myself the pain of become accustomed to another -- i feel sure that my meager stoicism would not suffice to carry I through with credit i have fail once i would fail again i look forward with a sink heart to a tearful and uncomfortable future there be only a very poor train service so my brother have plenty of time to walk back to the station and it be settle that i should go part of the way with he as we walk along the white road that stretch between uniform hedgerow of a shadowy greyness i see that he have something on he mind in this hour of my trial i be willing to forget the past for the sake of talk for a few minute with some human being whom i know but he return only vague answer to my eager question at last he stop in the middle of the road and say i have better turn back i would like to have walk farther with he but i be above all thing anxious to keep up appearance so i say goodbye in as compose a voice as i could find my brother hesitate for a minute then with a timid glance at heaven he put he hand in he pocket pull out half a crown which he give I and walk rapidly away i saw in a flash that for he too it have be a important moment he have tip he first schoolboy and henceforth he be beyond all question grow up i do not like he but i watch he disappear in the dusk with a desolate heart at that moment he stand for a great many thing that seem valuable to I and i would have give much to have be walk by he side with my face towards home and my back turn to the gray and unsavoury town to which i have to bear my despondent loneliness nevertheless i step out staunchly enough in order that my mind should take courage from the example of my body i think strenuously of my brother 's story of my play-box packed for a voyage of the money in my pocket increase now by my eldest brother 's unexpected generosity and by dint of these violent mental exercise i have reduce my mind to a comfortable stupor by the time i reach the school gate there i be overcome by shyness and although i see light in the form-room and hear the voice of boy i stand awkwardly in the playground not know where i ought to go the mist in the air surround the light with a halo and my nostril be fill with the acrid smell of burn leaf i have stand there a quarter of a hour perhaps when a boy come up and speak to I and the sound of he voice give I a shock i think it be the first time in my life a boy have speak kindly to I he ask I my name and tell I that it would be supper-time in five minute so that i could go and sit in the dining-hall and wait you 'll be all right you know he say as he pass on they be not a bad lot of chap the revulsion nearly bring on a catastrophe for the tear rise to my eye and i gaze after he with a swimming head i have prepare myself to receive blow and insult with a calm brow but i have no armor with which to oppose the noble weapon of sympathy and good fellowship they overcome the stubborn hatred with which i be accustom to meet life and leave I defenceless i feel as if i have be face to face with the hero of a dream as i sit at supper before a long table decorate with plate of bread-and-butter and cheese i see my friend sit at the other end of the room so i ask the boy next to I to tell I he name oh he say look curiously at my blush you mean old mother f -- he be pious you know read the bible and funk at game and all that there be some thing which no self-respecting schoolboy can afford to forgive i have make up my mind that it be not pleasant to be a ishmael that as far as possible i would try to be a ordinary boy at my new school my experience in london have teach I caution and i be anxious not to compromise my position at the outset by make a unpopular friend so i nod my head sagely in reply and look at my new-discovered hero with a air of profound contempt ii the day that follow be not so uncomfortable as my first gray impression of the place have lead I to expect i prove to my own intense astonishment to be rather good at lesson so that i get on well with the master and the boy be kind enough in they careless way i have plenty of pocket-money and though i do not shine at association football for in london i have only watch the big boy play rugby i be not afraid of be knock about which be all that be expect of a new boy most of my embarrassment be due to the sensitiveness that make I dislike ask question -- a weakness that be always place I in false position but my effort to make myself agreeable to the boy be not unsuccessful and while i look in vain for anything like the romantic adventure of which my brother have speak i sometimes find myself almost enjoy my new life and then as the child say in the street of london i wake up and discover that i be desperately home-sick partly no doubt this be due to a natural reaction but there be other more obvious cause for one thing my lavish hospitality have exhaust my pocket-money in the first three week and i be ashamed to write home for more so soon this speedy end to my apparent wealth certainly make it easier for the boy to find out that i be not one of themselves and they begin to look at I askance and leave I out of they conversation i be make to feel once more that i have be bear under a malignant star that do not allow I to speak or act as they do i have not they common sense they blunt cheerfulness they complete lack of sensibility and while they resent my queerness they could not know how anxious i be to be a ordinary boy when i see that they mistrust I i be too proud to accept the crumb of they society like poor mother f -- and i withdraw myself into a solitude that give I far too much time in which to examine my emotion i find out all the remote corner of the school in which it be possible to be alone and when the other boy go for walk in the field i stay in the churchyard close to the school disturb the sheep in they meditation among the tomb-stone and think what a long time it would be before i be old enough to die now that the first freshness of my new environment have wear off i be able to see my life as a series of gray picture that repeat themselves day by day in my mind these picture be mark off from each other by a sound of bell i wake in the morning in a bed that be like all the other bed and lay on my back listen to the soft noise of sleep that fill the air with rumor of healthy boy the bell would ring and the dormitory would break into a uproar splashing of water drop of hair-brush and shout of laughter for these super-boy could laugh before breakfast then we all troop downstairs and i force myself to drink bad coffee in a room that smell of herring the next bell call we to chapel and at interval during the morning other bell call we from one class to another dinner be the one square meal we have during the day and as it be always very good and there be nothing morbid about my appetite i look forward to it with interest after dinner we play football i like the game well enough but the atmosphere of mud and forlorn gray field make I shudder and as i keep goal i spend my leisure moment in harden my æesthetic impression i never see the word football today without recall the curious sensation cause by the mud dry on my bare knee after football be other class class in which it be sometimes very hard to keep awake for the school be old and the badly ventilate class-room be stuffy after the fresh air then the bell summon we to evening chapel and tea -- a meal which we be allow to improve with sardine and egg and jam if we have money to buy they or a hamper from home after tea we have about two hour to ourselves and then come preparation and supper and bed everything be herald by a bell and now and again even in the midst of lesson i would hear the church-bell toll for a funeral i think my hatred of bell date back to my early childhood when the village church have only three bell play the first bar of three blind mouse a million time every Sunday evening till i could have cry for monotony and the vexation of the thwart tune but at school i have to pay the penalty for my prejudice every hour of the day especially i suffer at night during preparation when they ring the curfew on the church bell at intolerable length for these be tranquil hour to which i look forward eagerly we prepare we lesson for the morrow in the great hall and i would spread my book out on the desk and let my leg dangle from the form in a spirit of contentment for the troubled day happily past over my head the gas star burn quietly and all about I i hear the restrained breathing of comrade like a noise of flutter moth and then suddenly the first stroke of the curfew would snarl through the air fill the roof with nasal echo and trouble the quietude of my mind with insistent vibration i derive small satisfaction from cursing william the conqueror who the history book tell I be responsible for this ingenious tyranny the long pause between the stroke hold I in a state of strained expectancy until i want to howl i would look about I for sympathy and see the boy at they lesson and the master on duty reading quietly at he table the curfew ring every night and they do not notice it at all the only bell i like to hear be the last bell that call we to we brief supper and to bed for once the light be out and my body be between the sheet i be free to do what i would free to think or to dream or to cry there be no real difference between be in bed at school or anywhere else and sometimes i would fill the shadow of the dormitory with the familiar furniture of my little bedroom at home and pretend that i be happy but as a rule i come to bed brimming over with the day 's tear and i would pull the bedclothes over my head so that the other boy should not know that i be homesick and cry until i be sticky with tear and perspiration the discipline at school do not make we good boy but it make we civilised it teach we to conceal we crime and as home-sickness be justly regard as a crime of ingratitude to the authority and to society in general i have to restrain my physical weakness during the day and the reaction from this restraint make my tear at night almost a luxury my longing for home be found on trifle but it be not the less passionate i hate this life spend in walk on bare board and the blank wall and polished form of the school appear to I to be sordid when now and again i go into one of the master 's study and feel a carpet under my foot and see a pleasant litter of pipe and novel lie on the table it seem to I that i be in a holy place and i look at the hearthrug the wallpaper and the upholstered chair with a kind of desolate love for thing that be nice to see and touch i suppose that if we have be in a workhouse a prison or a lunatic asylum we æesthetic environment would have be very much the same as it be at school and afterwards when i go with the cricket and football team to other grammar school they all give I the same impression of clean ugliness it be not surprising that few boy emerge from they school life with that feeling for color and form which be common to nearly all child there be something very unpleasant to I in the fact that we all wash with the same kind of soap drink out of the same kind of cup and in general do the same thing at the same time the school timetable rob life of all those accidental variation that make it interesting we meal we game even we hour of freedom seem only like subtle lesson we have to eat at a certain hour whether we be hungry or not we have to play at a certain hour when perhaps we want to sit still and be quiet the whole school discipline tend to the formation of habit at the expense of we reasoning faculty yet the astonishing thing to I be that the boy themselves set up standard of conduct that still further narrow the possibility of we life it be bad form to read too much to write home except on sunday to work outside the appoint hour to talk to the day-boys to cultivate social relationship with the master to be cambridge in the boat-race and in fine to hold any opinion or follow any pursuit that be not approve by the majority it be only by hide myself away in corner that i could enjoy any liberty of spirit and though my thought be often cheerless when i remember the relative freedom of home life i prefer to linger with they rather than to weary myself in break the little law of a society for which i be in no way fit these be black day render blacker by my morbid fear of the physical weakness that make I liable to cry at any moment sometimes even without in the least know why i be often on the brink of disaster but my fear of the boy ' ridicule prevent I from publicly disgrace myself once the headmaster call a boy into he study and he come out afterwards with red eyelid and a puffed face when they hear that he mother have die suddenly in indium all the boy think that these manifestation of sorrow be very creditable and in the best of taste especially as he do not let anybody see he cry for my part i look at he with a kind of envy this boy who could flaunt he woe where he would i too have my unassuageable sorrow for the home that be dead to I those forlorn day but i could only express it among the tomb in the churchyard or at night muffle between the blanket when the silent dormitory seem to listen with suspicious ear iii a console scrap of wisdom which unfortunately child do not find written large in they copybook be that sorrow be as transitory as happiness although my childhood be strew with the memorial wreath of dead misery i always have a morbid sense that my present discomfort be immortal so i have quite make up my mind that i would continue to be unhappy at school when the intervention of two being whom i have think utterly remote from I give I a new philosophy and reconcile I to life the first be a master who find I grieve in one of my oubliette and take I into he study and try to draw I out kindness always make I ineloquent and as i sit in he big basket chair and sniff the delightful odour of he pipe i express myself chiefly in woe-begone monosyllable and hiccough nevertheless he seem to understand I very well and though he do not say much i feel by the way in which he puff out great generous cloud of smoke that he sympathise with I he tell I to come and see he twice a week and that i be at liberty to read any of he book and in general give I a sense that i be unfortunate rather than criminal this do I good because a large part of my unhappiness be due to the fact that constant suppression by majority have rob I of my self-respect it be better for a boy to be conceit than to be ashamed of he own nature and to shudder when he see he face reflect in a glass my second benefactor be nominally a boy though in reality he be nearly as old as the master and be leave at the end of the term to go up to oxford he take I by the shoulder one evening in the dusk and walk I round and round the big clump of rhododendron that stand in the drive in front of the school i do not understand half he say but to my great astonishment i hear he confess that he have always be unhappy at school although at the end he be captain in lesson in game in everything i be of course highly flatter that this giant should speak to I as a equal and admit I to he confidence but i be even more delighted with the encouraging light he throw on school life you be only here for a little spell you know you 'll be surprised how short it be and do not be miserable just because you be different i be different it be a jolly good thing to be different i be not use to people who take this wide view of circumstance and he voice in the shadow sound like some one speaking in a story-book yet although he monologue give I a entirely new conception of life no more of it linger in my mind save he last reflective criticism all the same i do not see why you should always have dirty nail he never confide in I again and i would have die rather than have remind he of he kindly indiscretion but when he pass I in the playground he seem to look at I with a kind of reticent interest and it occur to I that after all my queerness might not be such a bad thing might even be something to be proud of the value of this discovery to I can hardly be exaggerated hitherto in my relationship with the boy i have fight nothing but lose battle for i have take it for grant that they be right and i be wrong but now that i have hit on the astonishing theory that the individual have the right to think for himself i see quite clearly that most of they standard of conduct spring from they sheep-like stupidity they move in flock because they have not the courage to choose a line for themselves the material result of this new theory of life be to make I enormously conceit and i move among my comrade with a mysterious confidence and give myself the air of a byron in knickerbockers my unpopularity increase by leap and bound but so do my moral courage and i accept the belated effort of my school-fellow to knock the intelligence out of I as so many tribute to the force of my individuality i no longer cry in my bed at night but lay awake enrapture at the profundity of my thought after year of unquestioning humility i enjoy a prolonged debauch of intellectual pride and i marvelled at the little boy of yesterday who have weep because he could not be a imbecile it be the apotheosis of the ugly duckling and i see my swan 's plumage reflect in the placid face of the boy around I as in the vacant water of a pool as yet i do not dream of a moulting season still less that a day would come when i should envy the duck they domestic ease and the unthinking tranquillity of they life a little boy may be excuse for not realize that han andersen 's story be only the prelude to a sadder story that he have not the heart to write my new freedom of spirit give I courage to re-examine the emotional and æesthetic value of my environment i could not persuade myself that i like the sound of bell and the greyness of the country in winter-time still revolt I as though i have not yet forget the cheerful red and green and blues of the picture-book that fill my mind as a child with dream of a delightful world but now that i be wise enough to make the best of my unboyish emotionalism i begin to take pleasure in certain phase of school-life though i be devoid of any recognisable religious sense i like the wide word in the psalm that we read at night in the school chapel this be not due to any precocious recognition of they poetry but to the fact that they intense imagery conjure up all sort of precious vision in my mind i could see the hart panting after the water-brook in the valley of exmoor where i have once spend a enchanted holiday i could see the man go down to the sea in ship and the stormy wave and the staggering fearful mariner for i have witness a great tempest off flamborough head even such vague phrase as the hill give I a intense joy i could see they so clearly those hill chalky hill cover with wild pansy and with a all-blue sky overhead like the lid of a chocolate-box i like too the service in the old church on Sunday night when the light be lower for the sermon and i would put my hand over my ear and hear the voice of the preacher like the drone of a distant bee after church the choral society use to practice in the great hall and as i walk round the school building snatch of they singing would beat against my face like sudden gust of wind when i listen at the door of my form-room i hear the boy talk about football match or indulge they tireless passion for unimaginative personality i would stand on the mat outside wonder whether i would be allow to read if i go in i look forward to Tuesday night which be my bath-night almost as much as to Sunday the school sanitary arrangement be primitive and all the water have to be fetch in pail and i use to like to see the man tip the hot water into the bath and fling he great body back to avoid the steam that make he gray flannel shirt-sleeve cling to he hairy arm most of the boy add a lot of cold water but i like to boil myself because the subsequent languor be so pleasant the matron would bring we own bath towel warm from the fire and i would press mine against my face because it smell of childhood and of home i always think my body look pretty after a really hot bath its rosiness enable I to forgive myself for be fat one very strong impression be connect with the only master in the school whom i do not like he be a german and as be the case with other of he nationality a spray of saliva fly from he lip when he be angry and see this i would edge away from he in alarm perhaps it be on this account that he treat I with systematic unfairness and set himself the unnecessary task of make I ridiculous in the eye of the other boy one night i be wander in the playground and hear he play the violin in he study my taste in music be barbarian i like comic song which i use to sing to myself in a lugubrious voice and in london the plaintive clamor of the street-organ have help to make my sorrow rhythmical but now perhaps for the first time i become aware of the illimitable melancholy that lie at the heart of all great music it seem to I that the german master the man whom i hate have shut himself up alone in he study and be cry aloud i know that if he be unhappy it must be because he too be a ishmael a personality one of the different one a great sympathy wake within I and i peep through the window and see he play with he face all shiny with perspiration and a silk handkerchief tuck under he chin i would have like to have knock at he door and tell he that i know all about these thing but i be afraid that he would think I cheeky and splutter in my face the next day in he class i look at he hopefully in the light of my new understanding but it do not seem to make any difference he only tell I to get on with my work the term draw to a close and most of the boy in my form-room tick off the day on list in which the sunday be write in red ink to show that they do not really count as time go on they grow more and more boisterous and wherever i go i hear they tell one another how they be go to spend they holiday it be surprising to I that these boy who be so ordinary during term-time should lead such adventurous life in the holiday and i feel a little envious of they good fortune they talk of visit the theater and foreign travel in a matter-of-fact way that make I think that perhaps after all my home-life be incomplete i have never be out of england and my dramatic knowledge be limit to pantomime for which these enthusiastic student of musical comedy express a large contempt some of they be allow to shoot with real gun in the holiday which remind I of the worst excess of my brother in yorkshire examine my own life i have often come to the conclusion that adventure do not exist outside book but the boy shake this comforting theory with they boastful prophecy and i think once more that perhaps it be my misfortune that they do not happen to I i begin to fear that i would find the holiday tame there be other consideration that make I look forward to the end of the term with misgiving since it have be make plain to I that i be a remarkable boy i have rather enjoy my life at school i have conceive myself as strut with a measure dignity before a background of the other boy -- a background that move and do not change like a wind-swept tapestry but i be quite sure that i would not be allow to give myself air at home it seem to I that a youngest brother 's portion of freedom would compare but poorly with the measure of intellectual liberty that i have secure for myself at school my brother be all very well in they way but i would be expect to take my place in the background and do what i be tell i should miss my sense of be superior to my environment and my intensely emotional sunday would no longer divide time into week the more i thought of it the more i realize that i do not want to go home on the last night of the term when the dormitory have at length become quiet i consider the whole case dispassionately in my bed the labor of packing my play-box and write label for my luggage have give I a momentary thrill but for the rest i have move among my insurgent comrade with a chill heart i know now that i be too greedy of life that i always think of the pleasant side of thing when they be no longer within my grasp but at the i same time my discontent be not wholly unreasonable i have learn more of myself in three month than i have in all my life before and from be a nervous hysterical boy i have arrive at a complete understanding of my emotion which i study with a almost adult calmness of mind i know that in return to the society of my healthy boyish brother i be go back to a kind of life for which i be no longer fit i have change but i have the sense to see that it be a change that would not appeal to they and that in consequence i would have another and harder battle to fight before i be allow to go my own way i see further still i see that after a month at home i would not want to come back to school and that i should have to endure another period of despondency i see that my whole school life would be punctuate by these violent uprooting that the alternation of term-time and holiday would make it impossible for I to change life into a comfortable habit and that even to the end of my school-day it would be necessary for I to preserve my new-found courage as i lay think in the dark i be proud of the clarity of my mind and glad that i have at last outwit the tear that have make my childhood so unhappy i hear the boy breathe softly around I -- those wonderful boy who could sleep even when they be excite -- and i feel that i be get the better of they in think while they sleep i remember the prefect who have tell I that we be there only for a spell but i do not speculate as to what would follow afterwards all that i have to do be to watch myself ceaselessly and be able to explain to myself everything that i feel i and do in that way i should always be strong i enough to guard my weakness from the eye of the jealous world in which i move the church bell chime the hour and i turn over and go to sleep on the brighton road slowly the sun have climb up the hard white downs till it break with little of the mysterious ritual of dawn upon a sparkling world of snow there have be a hard frost during the night and the bird who hop about here and there with scant tolerance of life leave no trace of they passage on the silver pavement in place the sheltered cavern of the hedge break the monotony of the whiteness that have fall upon the color earth and overhead the sky melt from orange to deep blue from deep blue to a blue so pale that it suggest a thin paper screen rather than illimitable space across the level field there come a cold silent wind which blow a fine dust of snow from the tree but hardly stir the crested hedge once above the skyline the sun seem to climb more quickly and as it rise higher it begin to give out a heat that blended with the keenness of the wind it may have be this strange alternation of heat and cold that disturb the tramp in he dream for he struggle tor a moment with the snow that cover he like a man who find himself twisted uncomfortably in the bed-clothes and then sit up with stare question eye lord i think i be in bed he say to himself as he take in the vacant landscape and all the while i be out here he stretch he limb and rise carefully to he foot shake the snow off he body as he do so the wind set he shiver and he know that he bed have be warm come i feel pretty fit he think i suppose i be lucky to wake at all in this or unlucky -- it be not much of a business to come back to he look up and see the downs shine against the blue like the alp on a picture-postcard that mean another forty mile or so i suppose he continue grimly lord know what i do yesterday walk till i be do and now i be only about twelve mile from brighton damn the snow damn brighton damn everything the sun creep higher and higher and he start walk patiently along the road with he back turn to the hill be i glad or sorry that it be only sleep that take I glad or sorry glad or sorry he thought seem to arrange themselves in a metrical accompaniment to the steady thud of he footstep and he hardly seek a answer to he question it be good enough to walk to presently when three milestone have loiter past he overtake a boy who be stoop to light a cigarette he wear no overcoat and look unspeakably fragile against the snow be you on the road guv ` nor ask the boy huskily as he pass i think i be the tramp say oh then i 'll come a bit of the way with you if you do not walk too fast it be bit lonesome walk this time of day the tramp nod he head and the boy start limp along by he side i be eighteen he say casually i bet you think i be younger fifteen i would have say you would have back a loser eighteen last August and i have be on the road six year i run away from home five time when i be a little ` un and the police take I back each time very good to I the police be now i have not get a home to run away from nor have i the tramp say calmly oh i can see what you be the boy pant you be a gentleman come down it be harder for you than for I the tramp glance at the limp feeble figure and lessen he pace i have not be at it as long as you have he admit no i could tell that by the way you walk you have not get tired yet perhaps you expect something at the other end the tramp reflect for a moment i do not know he say bitterly i be always expect thing you 'll grow out of that the boy comment it be warmer in london but it be harder to come by grub there be not much in it really still there be the chance of meeting somebody there who will understand -- country people be better the boy interrupt last night i take a lease of a barn for nothing and sleep with the cow and this morning the farmer route I out and give I tea and toke because i be so little of course i score there but in london soup on the embankment at night and all the rest of the time copper move you on i drop by the roadside last night and sleep where i fall it be a wonder i do not die the tramp say the boy look at he sharply how do you know you do not he say i do not see it the tramp say after a pause i tell you the boy say hoarsely people like we can not get away from this sort of thing if we want to always hungry and thirsty and dog-tired and walk all the while and yet if anyone offer I a nice home and work my stomach feel sick do i look strong i know i be little for my age but i have be knock about like this for six year and do you think i be not dead i be drowned bathing at margate and i be kill by a gypsy with a spike he knock my head and yet i be walk along here now walk to london to walk away from it again because i can not help it dead i tell you we can not get away if we want to the boy break off in a fit of cough and the tramp pause while he recover you would better borrow my coat for a bit tommy he say you cough 's pretty bad you go to hell the boy say fiercely puff at he cigarette i be all right i be tell you about the road you have not get down to it yet but you 'll find out presently we be all dead all of we who be on it and we be all tired yet somehow we can not leave it there be nice smell in the summer dust and hay and the wind smack in you face on a hot day -- and it be nice wake up in the wet grass on a fine morning i do not know i do not know -- he lurch forward suddenly and the tramp catch he in he arm i be sick the boy whisper -- sick the tramp look up and down the road but he could see no house or any sign of help yet even as he support the boy doubtfully in the middle of the road a motor car suddenly flash in the middle distance and come smoothly through the snow what be the trouble say the driver quietly as he pull up i be a doctor he look at the boy keenly and listen to he strained breathing pneumonia he comment i 'll give he a lift to the infirmary and you too if you like the tramp thought of the workhouse and shake he head i would rather walk he say the boy wink faintly as they lift he into the car i 'll meet you beyond reigate he murmur to the tramp you 'll see and the car vanish along the white road all the morning the tramp splash through the thawing snow but at midday he beg some bread at a cottage door and creep into a lonely barn to eat it it be warm in there and after he meal he fall asleep among the hay it be dark when he wake and start trudge once more through the slushy road two mile beyond reigate a figure a fragile figure slip out of the darkness to meet he on the road guv ` nor say a husky voice then i 'll come a bit of the way with you if you do not walk too fast it be a bit lonesome walk this time of day but the pneumonia cry the tramp aghast i die at crawley this morning say the boy a tragedy in little i jack the postmaster 's little son stand in the bow-window of the parlor and watch he mother water the nasturtium in the front garden a certain intensity of purpose be express by the manner in which she handle the water-pot for though it be a fine afternoon the carrier 's man have call over the hedge to say that there would be a thunderstorm during the night and every one know that he never make a mistake about the weather nevertheless jack 's mother water the plant as if he have not speak for it seem to she that this meteorological gift smack a little of sorcery and black magic but in spite of herself she feel sure that there would be a thunderstorm and that she labor be therefore vain save perhaps as a protest against idle superstition it be in the same spirit that she carry a umbrella on the brightest summer day jack have be send indoors because he would get he leg in the way of the watering-pot in order to cool they so now he have to be content to look on with he nose press so tightly against the pane that from outside it look like the base of a sea-anemone grow in a glass tank he could no longer hear the glad chuckle of the watering-pot when the water run out but on the other hand he could write he name on the window with he tongue which he could not have do if he have be in the garden also he have some sweet in he pocket buy with a halfpenny steal from he own money-box and as the window do not taste very nice he slip one into he mouth and suck it with enjoyment he do not like be in the parlor because he have to sit there with he best clothes on every Sunday afternoon and read the parish magazine to he sleepy parent but the front window be lovely like a picture and indeed he think that he mother with the flower all about she and the red sky overhead be like a lady on one of the beautiful calendar that the grocer give away at christmas he finish he sweet and start another he always mean to suck they right through to make they last longer but when the sweet be half finish he invariably crunch it up he father have do the same thing as a boy the room behind he be get dark but outside the sky seem to be grow lighter and mother still stoop from bed to bed move placidly like a cow sometimes she put the watering-pot down on the gravel path and bent to uproot a microscopic weed or to pull the head off a dead flower sometimes she go to the well to get some more water and then jack be sorry that he have be shut indoors for he like let the pail down with a run and hear it bump against the brick side once he tap upon the window for permission to come out but mother shake she head vigorously without turn round and yet he stocking be hardly wet at all suddenly mother straighten herself and jack look up and see he father lean over the gate he seem to be make grimace and jack make haste to laugh aloud in the empty room because he know that he be good at see he father 's joke indeed it be a funny thing that father should come home early from work and make face at mother from the road mother too be willing to join in the fun for she kneel down among the wet flower and as she head droop lower and lower it look for one ecstatic moment as though she be go to turn head over heel but she lay quite still on the ground and father come half-way through the gate and then turn and run off down the hill towards the station jack stand in the window clap he hand and laugh it be a strange game but not much harder to understand than most of the amusement of the grown-up people and then as nothing happen as mother do not move and father do not come back jack grow frightened the garden be queer and the room be full of darkness so he beat on the window to change the game then since mother do not shake she head he run out into the garden smile carefully in case he be be silly first he go to the gate but father be quite small far down the road so he turn back and pull the sleeve of he mother 's dress to wake she after a dreadful while mother get up off the ground with she skirt all cover with wet earth jack try to brush it off with he hand and make a mess of it but she do not seem to notice look across the garden with such a desolate face that when he see it he burst into tear for once mother let he cry himself out without seek to comfort he when he sniff dolefully he nostril be full of the scent of crushed marigold he could not help watch she hand through he tear it seem as though they be play together at cat 's - cradle they be not still for a moment but it be she face that at once frightened and interested he one minute it look smooth and white as if she be very cross and the next minute it be gather up in little fold as if she be go to sneeze deep down in he something chuckle and he jump for fear that the cross part of she have hear it at interval during the evening while mother be get he he supper this chuckle return to he between unnoticed fit of cry once she stand hold a plate in the middle of the room for quite five minute and he find it hard to control he mirth if father have be there they would have have good fun together tease mother but by himself he be not sure of he ground and father do not come back and mother do not seem to hear he question he have some tomato and rice-pudding for he supper and as mother leave he to help himself to brown sugar he enjoy it very much carefully leave the skin of the rice-pudding to the last because that be the part he like best after supper he sit nod at the open window look out over the plum-tree to the sky beyond where the black cloud be put out the star one by one the garden smell stuffy but it be nice to be allow to sit up when you feel really sleepy on the whole he feel that it have be a pleasant exciting sort of day though once or twice mother have frighten he by look so strange there have be other mysterious day in he life however perhaps he be go to have another little dead sister presently he discover that it be delightful to shut you eye and nod you head and pretend that you be go to sleep it be like be in a swing that go up and up and never come down again it be like be in a rowing-boat on the river after a steamer have go by it be like lie in a cradle under a lamplit ceiling a cradle that rock gently to and fro while mother sing far-away song he be still a baby when he wake up and he slip off he chair and stagger blindly across the room to he mother with he knuckle in he eye like a little little boy he climb into she lap and settle himself down with a grunt of contentment there be a mutter of thunder in he ear and he feel great warm drop of rain fall on he face and into he dream he carry the dim consciousness that the thunderstorm have begin ii the next morning at breakfast-time father have not come back and mother say a lot of thing that make jack feel very uncomfortable she herself have teach he that any one who say bad thing about he father be wicked but now it seem that she be try to tell he something about father that be not nice she speak so slowly that he hardly understand a word she say though he gather that father have steal something and would be put in prison if he be catch with a guilty pang he remember he own dealings with he money-box and he determine to throw away the rest of the sweet when nobody be look then mother make the astounding statement that he be not to go to school that day but he sudden joy be check a little when she say he be not to go out at all except into the back garden it seem to jack that he must be ill but when he make this suggestion to mother she give up she explanation with a sigh afterwards she keep on say aloud i must think i must think she say it so often that jack start keep count on he finger the day go slowly enough for the garden be wet after the thunderstorm and mother would not play any game just before tea-time two gentleman call and talk to mother in the parlor and after a while they send for jack to answer some question about father though mother be there all the time they seem nice gentleman but mother do not ask they to stop to tea as jack expect he think that perhaps she be sorry that she have not do so for she be very sad all tea-time and let he spread he own bread and jam when tea be over thing be very dull and at last jack start cry because there be nothing else to do presently he hear a little noise and find that mother be cry as well this seem to he so extraordinary that he stop cry to watch she the tear run down she cheek very quickly and she keep on wipe they away with she handkerchief but if she hold she handkerchief to she eye perhaps they would not be able to come out at all it occur to he that possibly she be sorry she have say wicked thing about father and to comfort she for it make he feel fidgety to see she cry he whisper to she that he would not tell but she stare at he hopelessly through she red eyelid and he feel that he have not say the right thing she call he she poor boy and yet it appear that he be not ill it be all very mysterious and uncomfortable and it would be a good thing when father come back and everything go on as before even though he have to go back to school later on the woman from the mill come in to sit with mother she bring jack some sweet but instead of play with he she burst into tear she make more noise when she cry than mother in fact he be afraid that in a minute he would have to laugh at she snorting so he go into the parlor and sit there in the dark eat he sweet and knit he brow over the complexity of life he could see five star and there be a light behind the red curtain of the front bedroom at arber 's farm it be about twelve time as large as a star and a much prettier color by nearly close he eye he could see everything double so that there be ten star and two red light he be try to make everything come treble when the gate click and he see he father 's shadow he be delighted with this happy end to a tiresome day and as he run through the passage he call out to mother to say that father be back mother do not answer but he hear a bit of noise in the kitchen as he open the front door he say good evening in the grown-up voice that father encourage but father slip in and shut the door without say a word every night when he come back from the post-office he bring jack the gummed edging off the sheet of stamp and jack hold out he hand for they as a matter of course automatically father feel in he overcoat pocket and pull out a great handful take care of they they be the last you 'll get he say but when jack ask why he father look at he with the same hopeless expression that he have find in he mother 's eye a short while before jack feel a little cross that every one should be so stupid when they go into the kitchen everybody look very strange and jack sit down in the corner and listen for a explanation as a rule the conversation of the grown-up people do not amuse he but tonight he feel that something have happen and that if he keep quiet he might find out what it be he have notice before that when the grown-up talk they always say the same thing over and over again and now they be worse than usual father say it be no good i have get to go through it the mill-woman say whatever make you do it george and mother say nothing will ever happen to I again they all go on say these thing till jack grow tired of listen and start plait he stamp-paper into a mat if you do it very neatly it be almost as good as a ordinary sheet of paper by the time you have finish by and by while he be still at work the mill-woman bring he he supper on a plate and raise he head he see that father and mother be sit close together look at each other and say nothing at all he be very disappointed that although father have come home they have not have any joke all the evening and as they be all so dull he do not very much mind be send to bed when he have finish he supper when he say good-night to father he notice that he boot be very muddy as if he have walk a long way like a common postman he make a joke about this but they all look at he as if he have say something wrong so he hurry out of the room glad to get away from these people whose look have no reasonable significance and whose word have no discoverable meaning it have be a bad day and he hope mother would let he go back to school the next morning and yet though he take off he clothes and get into bed the day be not quite over he have only doze for a few minute when he be rouse by a noise down below and slip out on to the staircase he hear the mill-woman say good-night in the passage when she have go and the door have bang behind she he listen still and hear he mother cry and he father talk on and on in a strange hoarse voice somehow these incomprehensible sound make he feel lonely and he would have like to have go downstairs and sit on he mother 's lap and blink drowsily in he father 's face as he have do often enough before but he be always shy in the presence of stranger and he feel that he do not know this woman who weep and this man who do not laugh he father be he play-friend the sharer of all he fun he mother be a quiet woman who sit and sew and sometimes tell they not to be silly which be the best joke of all it be not right for people to alter but the thought of he bedroom make he desolate and at last he pluck up he courage and creep downstairs on bare foot father and mother have go back into the kitchen and he peep through the crack of the door to see what they be do mother be still cry always cry but he have to change he position before he could see father then he turn on he heel and run upstairs tremble with fear and disgust for father the man of all the joke the man of whom burglar be afraid and compare with whom all other little boy ' father be as dirt be cry like a little girl he jump into bed and pull the bedclothes over he face to shut out the ugliness of the world iii when jack wake up the next morning he find that the room be full of sunshine and that father be stand at the end of the bed the moment jack open he eye he begin tell he something in a serious voice which be alone sufficient to prevent jack from understand what he say besides he use a lot of long word and jack think that it be silly to use long word before breakfast when nobody could be expect to remember what they mean father 's body neatly fit the square of the window and the sunbeam shine in all round it and make it look splendid and if jack have not already forget the unfortunate impression of the night before this would have enable he to overcome it every now and then father stop to ask he if he understand and he say he do hope to find out what it be all about later on it seem however that father be not go to the post-office any more and this cause jack to picture a series of delightfully amusing day when father have finish talk he appear to expect jack to say something but jack contented himself with try to look interested for he know that it be always very stupid of little boy not to understand thing they do not understand in reality he feel as if he have be listen while he father argue aloud with himself talk up and down like a earthquake map at breakfast they be still subdue but afterwards as the morning wear on father become livelier and help jack to build a hut in the back garden they build it of bean-stick against the wall at the end and father break up a packing-case to get plank for the roof only mother still have a sad face and it make jack angry with she that she should be such a spoil-fun after dinner while jack be play in the hut mr simmon of the police-station and another gentleman call to take father for a walk and jack go down to the front to see they off jack know mr simmon very well he have be to tea with he little boy but though he think he a fine sort of man he could not help feeling proud of he father when he see they side by side mr simmon look as if he be ashamed of himself while father walk along with square shoulder and a high head as if he have just do something splendid the other gentleman look like nothing at all beside father when they be out of sight jack go into the house and find mother cry in the kitchen as he feel more tolerant in he after-dinner mood he try to cheer she up by tell she how fine father have look beside the other two man mother raise she face all swollen and spoilt with weep and gaze at she son in astonishment they be take he to prison she wail and god know what will become of we for a moment jack feel alarmed then a thought come to he and he smile like a little boy who have just find a new and delightful game never mind mother he say we 'll help he to escape but mother would not stop cry shepherd 's boy the path climb up and up and threaten to carry I over the highest point of the downs till it falter before a sudden outcrop of chalk and swerve round the hill on the level i be grateful for the respite for i have be walk all day and my knapsack be grow heavy above I in the blue pasture of the sky the cloud-sheep be grazing with the sun on they snowy back and all about I the gray sheep of earth be crop the wild pansy that grow wherever the chalk have win a covering of soil presently i come upon the shepherd standing erect by the path a tall spare man with a face that the sun and the wind have rob of all expression the dog at he foot look more intelligent than he you have come up from the valley he say as i pass perhaps you 'll have see my boy i be sorry i have not i say pause sorrow break no bone he mutter and stride away with he dog at he heel it seem to I that the dog be apologetic for he master 's rudeness i walk on to the little hill-girt village where i have make up my mind to pass the night the man at the village shop say he would put I up so i take off my knapsack and sit down on a sackful of cattle cake while the bacon be cooking if you come over the hill you 'll have meet shepherd say the man and he 'll have ask you for he boy yes but i have not see he the shopman nod there be clever folk who say you can see he and clever folk who say you can not the simple one like you and I we say nothing but we do not see he shepherd have not get no boy what be it a joke well of course it may be say the shop-man guardedly though i can not say i have hear many people laugh at it yet you see shepherd 's boy he break he neck that be in the day before they build the fence above the big chalk-pit that you pass on you left come down a dangerous place it use to be for the sheep so shepherd 's boy he use to lie along there to stop they drop into it while shepherd 's dog he stop they from go too far and shepherd he use to come down here and have he glass for he take it then like you or I he be blue ribbon now it be one night when the mist be out on the hill and maybe shepherd have have a glass too much or maybe he get a bit lose in the smoke but when he go up there to bring they home he start drive they into the pit as straight as could be shepherd 's boy he holler out and run to stop they but four-and-twenty of they go over and the lad he go with they you may not believe I but five of they be not so much as scratch though it be a sixty foot drop likely they fall soft on top of the other but shepherd 's boy he be do shepherd he be a bit spotty now and most time he think the boy 's still with he and there be clever folk who 'll tell you that they have see the boy help shepherd 's dog with the sheep that would be a ghost now i should not wonder i have never see it but then i be simple as you might say but i have have two boy myself and it seem to I that a boy like that who do not eat and do not get into mischief and do he work would be the handiest kind of boy to have about the place the passing of edward i find dorothy sit sedately on the beach with a mass of black seaweed twine in she hand and she bare foot sparkling white in the sun even in the first glow of recognition i realize that she be paler than she have be the summer before and yet i can not blame myself for the tactlessness of my question where 's edward i say and i look about the sand for a sailor suit and a little pair of prance leg while i look dorothy 's eye watch mine inquiringly as if she wonder what i might see edward 's dead she say simply he die last year after you leave for a moment i could only gaze at the child in silence and ask myself what reason there be in the thing that have hurt she so now that i know that edward play with she no more i could see that there be a shadow upon she face too dark for she year and that she have lose to some extent that exquisite carelessness of poise which make child so young she voice be so calm that i might have think she forgetful have i not see a instant of patent pain in she wide eye i be sorry i say at length very very sorry indeed i have bring down my car to take you for a drive as i promise oh edward _ would _ have like that she answer thoughtfully he be so fond of motor she swing round suddenly and look at the sand behind she with stare eye i think i hear -- she break off in confusion i too have believe for a instant that i have hear something that be not the wind or the distant child or the smooth sea hiss along the beach during that golden summer which link I with the dead edward have be wont in moment of elation to puff up and down the sand in artistic representation of a nobby noisy motor-car but the dead may play no more and there be nothing there but the sand and the hot sky and dorothy you have better let I take you for a run dorothy i say the man will drive and we can talk as we go along she nod gravely and begin pull on she sandy stocking it do not hurt he she say inconsequently the restraint in she voice pained I like a blow oh do not dear do not i cry there be nothing to do but forget i have forget quite she answer pull at she shoe-lace with calm finger it be ten month ago we walk up to the front where the car be wait and dorothy settle herself among the cushion with a little sigh of contentment the human quality of which bring I a certain relief if only she would laugh or cry i sit down by she side but the man wait by the open door what be it i ask i be sorry sir he answer look about he in confusion i think i see a young gentleman with you he shut the door with a bang and in a minute we be run through the town i know that dorothy be watch my face with she wounded eye but i do not look at she until the green field leap up on either side of the white road it be only for a little while that we may not see he i say all this be nothing i have forget she repeat i think this be a very nice motor i have not previously complain of the motor but i be wish then that it would cease its poignant imitation of a little dead boy a boy who would play no more by the touch of dorothy 's sleeve against mine i know that she could hear it too and the mile fly by green and brown and golden while i wonder what use i might be in the world who could not help a child to forget possibly there be another way i think tell I how it happen i say dorothy look at I with inscrutable eye and speak in a voice without emotion he catch a cold and be very ill in bed i go in to see he and he be all white and fade i say to he ` how be you edward ' and he say ` i shall get up early in the morning to catch beetle ' i do not see he any more poor little chap i murmured i go to the funeral she continue monotonously it be very rainy and i throw a little bunch of flower down into the hole there be a whole lot of flower there but i think edward like apple better than flower do you cry i say cruelly she pause i do not know i suppose so it be a long time ago i think i have forget even while she speak i hear edward puff along the sand : edward who have be so fond of apple i can not stand this any longer i say aloud let 's get out and walk in the wood for a change she agree with a depth of comprehension that terrify I and the motor pull up with a jerk at a spot where hardly a post serve to mark where the wood commence and the wayside grass stop we take one of the dim path which the rabbit have make and force we way through the undergrowth into the peaceful twilight of the tree you have not get very sunburnt this year i say as we walk i do not know why i have be out on the beach all the day sometimes i have play too i do not ask she what game she have play or who have be she play-friend yet even there in the quiet wood i know that edward be hold she back from I it be true that in he boy 's way he have be fond of I but i should not have dare to take she out without he in the day when he live lip have fill the beach with song and he small brown body have dance among the surf now it seem that i have be disloyal to he and presently we come to a clearing where the leaf of forget year lay brown and rotten beneath we foot and the air be full of the dryness of death let 's be go back what do you think dorothy i say i think she say slowly -- i think that this would be a very good place to catch beetle a wood be full of secret noise and that be why i suppose we hear a pair of small quick foot come with a dance of triumph through the rustling bracken for a minute we listen deeply and then dorothy break from my side with a pierce call on she lip oh edward edward she cry edward but the dead may play no more and presently she come back to I with the tear that be the riches of childhood streaming down she face i can hear he i can hear he she sob but i can not see he never never again and so i lead she back to the motor but in she tear i seem to find a promise of peace that she have not know before now edward be no very wonderful little boy it may be that he be jealous and vain and greedy yet now it seem as he lay in he small grave with the memory of dorothy 's flower about he he have work this kindness for he sister yes even though we hear no more than the bird in the branch and the wind sway the scented bracken even though he have pass with another summer and the dead and the love of the dead may rise no more from the grave the story of a book i the writer the history of a book must necessarily begin with the history of its author for surely in these enlighten day neither the youngest nor the oldest of critic can believe that work of art be find under gooseberry-bush or in the nest of stork in truth i be by no means sure that everybody know this before the publication of the man shakespeare and for the sake of a mystified posterity it may be well to explain that there be once a school of criticism that think it indecent to pry into that treasure-house of individuality from which if we reject the nursery hypothesis mention above it be clearly obvious that author derive they work that the drama must need be closely related to the dramatist be just one of those simple discovery that invariably elude the subtle professional mind but in this wiser hour i may be permit to assume that the author be the conscious father of he novel and that he do not find it surprisingly in he pocket one morning like a bad shilling take in change from the cabman overnight before he publish he novel at the ripe age of thirty-seven the author have live a irreproachable and gentlemanly life bear with at least a german-silver spoon in he mouth he pass after a normally eventful childhood through a respectable public school and spend several agreeable year at cambridge without take a degree he then go into he uncle 's office in the city where he idle daily from ten to four till in due course he be admit to a partnership which enable he to reduce he hour of idleness to eleven to three these detail become important when we reflect that from he childhood on the author have a great deal of time at he disposal if he have be entirely normal he would have accept the convention of the society to which he belong and devoted himself to motor bridge and the encouragement of the lighter drama but some deep-rooted habit of he childhood or even perhaps some remote hereditary taint lead he to spend a appreciable fraction of he leisure time in the reading of work of fiction unlike most lover of light literature he read with a certain mental concentration and be broad-minded enough to read good novel as well as bad one it be a pleasant fact that it be impossible to concentrate one 's mind on anything without in time become wiser and in the course of year the author become quite a skilful critic of novel from the first he have allow he reading to color he impression of life and have obediently live in a world of black and whites of hero and heroine of villain and adventuress until the grateful discovery of the realistic school of fiction permit he to believe that man and woman be for the most part neither good nor bad but tabby moreover the leisurely reading of many sentence have give he some understanding of the element of style he perceive that some combination of word be illogical and that other be unlovely to the ear and at the same time he acquire a vocabulary and a knowledge of grammar and punctuation that he earlier education have fail to give he he read new novel at he writing-table and take pleasure in correct the mistake of they author in ink when he have do this he would hand they to he wife who always read the end first and indeed rarely pursue she investigation of a book beyond the last chapter we buy knowledge with illusion and pay a high price for it for the acquirement of quite a small degree of wisdom will deprive we of a large number of pleasant fancy so it be with the author who find he joy in novel-reading diminish rapidly as he critical knowledge increase he be no longer able to lose himself between the cover of a romance but slide he paper-knife between the page of a book with a unwholesome readiness to be irritated by the ignorance and folly of the novelist he destructive criticism of work of fiction become so acute that it be natural that he unlettered friend should suggest that he himself ought to write a novel for a long while he be content to receive the flattering suggestion with a reticent smile that mask he conviction that there be a difference between criticism and creation but as he grow older the imperfection in the book he read cease to give he the thrill of the successful explorer in sight of the expect and time begin to trickle too slowly through he idle finger one day he sit down and write chapter i at the head of a sheet of quarto paper it seem to he that the difficulty be only one of selection and he write two-third of a novel with a breathless ease of creation that make he marvel at himself and the pitiful struggle of less gifted novelist then in a moment of insight he pick up he manuscript and realize that what he have write be childishly crude he have feel he story while he write it but somehow or other he have fail to get he emotion on paper and he see quite clearly that it be worse and not better than the majority of the book which he have hold up to ridicule there be a certain doggedness in he character that might have make he a useful citizen but for that unfortunate hereditary spoon and he write chapter i at the head of a new sheet of quarto paper long before the library fire have reach the heart of he first luckless manuscript this time he write more slowly and with a wane confidence that fail he altogether when he be about half-way through read the fragment dispassionately he think there be good page in it but take as a whole it be unequal and move forward only by fit and start he begin again with he late manuscript spread about he on the table for reference at the fifth attempt he succeed in write a whole novel in the course of he struggle he have acquire a philosophy of composition especially he have learn to shun those enchanted hour when the labor of creation become suspiciously easy for he have find by experience that the work he do in these moment of inspiration be either bad in itself or out of key with the precede chapter he think that inspiration might be useful to poet or writer of short story but personally as a novelist he find it a nuisance by dint of hard work however he succeed in eliminate its evil influence from he final draft he tell himself that he have no illusion as to the merit of he book he know he be not a man of genius but he know also that the grammar and the punctuation of he novel be far above the average of such work and although he could not read sir thoma browne or walter pater with pleasure he feel sure that he book be write in a straightforward and gentlemanly style he be prepare to be tell that he use of the colon be audacious and look forward with pleasure to a agreeable controversy on the question he read he book to he friend who make suggestion that would have involve its rewrite from one end to the other he read it to he enemy who tell he that it be nearly good enough to publish he read it to he wife who say that it be very nice and that it be time to dress for dinner no one seem to realize that it be the most important thing he have ever do in he life this quicken he eagerness to get it publish -- a eagerness only temper by a very real fear of those know dog the critic he could not forget that he have criticise a good many book himself in term that would have make the author abandon they profession if they have but hear he stricture and he have read notice in the papers that would have make he droop with shame if they have refer to any work of he when these sombre thought come to he he would pick up he book and read it again and in common fairness he have to admit to himself that he find it uncommonly good one day after a whole batch of ungrammatical novel have reach he from the library he post he manuscript to he favorite publisher he have hear story of masterpiece many time reject so he do not tell he wife what he have do ii the sleepy publisher the publisher to whom we author have confide he manuscript stand like all publisher at the very head of he profession he business be conduct on sound conservative line which mean that though he have regretfully abandon the three-volume novel for the novel publish at six shilling he be not among the intrepid revolutionary who be begin to produce new fiction at a still lower price besides novel he publish solid work of biography at thirty-one and six art book at a guinea travel book at fifteen shilling flighty historical work at twelve-and-sixpence and cheap edition of montaigne 's essay and robinson crusoe at a shill some idea of he business method may be derive from the fact that it please he to reflect that all the other publisher be produce exactly the same book as he be and though he would admit that the trade have be ruin by competition and the outrageous royalty demand by successful author and further that he make a loss on every separate department of he business in some mysterious fashion the business as a whole continue to pay he very well he leave the active part of the management to a confidential clerk and contented himself with sign cheque and interview author with such a publisher the fate of we author 's book be never in doubt if it be lack in those quality that might be expect to commend it to the read public it be conspicuously rich in those merit that determine the favourable judgment of publisher ' reader it be above all thing a gentlemanly book without violence and without eccentricity it be carefully and grammatically write but it have not that exotic literary flavor which be so tiresome on a long railway journey it could be put into the hand of any schoolgirl and at most would merely send she to sleep the only thing that could be say against it be that the author 's dread of inspiration have make it grievously dull but it be the publisher 's opinion that after a glut of sensational fiction the six-shilling public have come to regard dullness as the hall-mark of literary merit he have no illusion as to its possible success but on the other hand he know that he could not lose any money on it so he write a letter to the author invite he to a interview as soon as he have read the letter the author tell himself that he have be certain all along that he book would be accept nevertheless he go to the interview move by certain emotional fluttering against which circumstance have guard he ever since he boyhood he find this mild excitation of the nervous system by no means unpleasant it be like digest a new and subtle liqueur that make he light-footed and tingled in the tip of he finger he recall a phrase that have greatly pleased he in the early day of he novel as the sun color flower so art color life it seem to he that this be begin to come true and that life be already present itself to he in a gayer brighter dress he reach the publisher 's office therefore in a unwontedly receptive mood and be tremendously impress by the rudeness of the clerk who treat author as mendicant and express they opinion of literature by handle book as if they be bundle of firewood the publisher look at he under heavy eyelid recognize he position in the social scale and reflect with satisfaction that he acquaintance could be rely on to purchase at least a hundred copy the interview do not at all take the line that the author in he innocence have expect and in a surprisingly short space of time he find himself bow out with the duplicate of a contract in the pocket of he overcoat in the outer office the confidential clerk take he in hand and lead he to the door of a enormous cellar light by electricity and fill from one end to the other with bale and heap of book book say the confidential clerk with the smile of a gamekeeper display he hand-reared pheasant there be a great many the author say timidly of course we do not keep we stock here the clerk explain these be just sample it be sometimes necessary to remind inexperienced writer that the publication of they first book be only a trivial incident in the history of a great publishing house the author have a sad vision of he novel as a little brick in a monstrous pyramid build of book and the clerk mentally decide that he be not the kind of man to turn up every day at the office to ask they how they be get on the author be a little dazed when he emerge into the street and the sunshine he book which a hour before have seem the most important thing in the world have become almost insignificant in the light of that vast collection of print matter and in some subtle way he feel that he have dwindle with it the publisher have praise it without enthusiasm and have not specify any of its merit he have not even comment on he fantastic use of the colon the author have live with it now for many month -- it have become a part of he personality and he feel that he have betray himself in deliver it into the hand of stranger who could not understand it he have the reticence of the well-bred englishman and though he tell himself reassuringly that he novel in no way reflect he private life he could not quite overcome the sentiment that it be a little vulgar to allow alien eye to read the product of he most intimate thought he have really be shock at the matter-of-fact way in which every one at the office have speak of he book and the sight of all the other book with which it would soon be inextricably confuse have emphasise the painful impression this all seem to rob the author 's calling of its presumed distinction and he look at the man and woman who pass he on the pavement and wonder whether they too have write book this mood last for some week at the end of which time he receive the proof which he read and re-read with real pleasure before set himself to correct they with meticulous care he perform this task with such conscientiousness and make so many minor alteration -- he change most of those flighty colon to more conventional semicolon -- that the confidential clerk swear terribly when he glance at the proof before hand they to a boy with instruction to remove three-quarter of the offend emendation a week or two later there happen one of those strange little incident that make modern literary history it be a bright sunny afternoon the publisher have be lunch with the star author of the firm a novelist whose book be read wherever the british flag wave and there be a circulate library to distribute they and now in the warm twilight of the lowered blind he be enjoy profound thought delicately tint by burgundy and old port the shrewdest man make mistake and certainly it be hardly wise of the confidential clerk to choose this peaceful moment to speak about we author 's book i suppose we shall print a thousand he say five thousand ejaculate the publisher what be he think about be he fill up a imaginary income-tax statement or be he try to estimate the number of butterfly that seem to float in the amber shadow of the room the clerk do not know i suppose you mean one thousand sir he say gently the publisher be now wide awake he have lose all he butterfly and he be not the man to allow himself to be sleepy in the afternoon i say five thousand the clerk bit he lip and leave the room the author never hear of this brief dialogue probably if he have be present he would have miss its significance he would never have connect it with the flood of paragraph that appear in the press announce that the acumen of the publisher have discover a new author of genius -- paragraph wherein he be compare with dickens thackeray flaubert richardson sir walter besant thoma browne and the author of a englishwoman 's love-letter as it be it do not occur to he to wonder why the publisher should spend so much money on advertise a book of which he have seem to have but a half-hearted appreciation after all it be he book and the author feel that it be only natural that as the hour of publication draw near the world of letter should show sign of a dignified excitement iii the critic errant there be some emotion so intimate that the most intrepid writer hesitate to chronicle they lest it should be infer that he himself be in the confessional we have endeavor to show we author as a level-headed english-man with he nerve well under control and a honest contempt for emotionalism in the stronger sex but he feeling in the face of the first little bundle of review send he by the press-cutting agency would prove this portrait incomplete he notice with a vague astonishment that the flimsy scrap of paper be tremble in he finger like banknote in the hand of a gambler and he lay they down on the breakfast-table in disgust of the feminine weakness this unmistakable proof that he have write a book a real book make he at once happy and uneasy these fragment of smudged print be he passport into a new and delightful world they be it might be say the name of he destination in the great republic of letter and yet he hesitate to look at they he hear of the curious blindness of author that make it impossible for they to detect the most egregious failing in they own work and it occur to he that this might be he malady why : have he publish he book he feel at that moment that he have take too great a risk it would have be so easy to have have it privately print and contented himself with distribute it among he friend but these people be pay for write about book these critic who have send keat to he gallipot and swinburne to he fig-tree might well have fail to have recognize that he book be sacred because it be he own when he have at last achieve a fatalistic tranquillity he once more pick up the notice and this time he read they through carefully the _ rutlandshire gazette _ quote shakespeare the _ thrum time _ compare he with christopher north the _ stamford-bridge herald _ think that he style resemble that of macaulay but they be unanimous in praise he book without reservation it seem to the author that he be listen to the authentic voice of fame he rest he chin on he hand and dream long dream he could afford in this hour of he triumph to forget the annoyance he have undergo since he book be first accept the publisher with a large first edition to dispose of have be rather more than firm with the author he have change the title of the book from earth 's return -- a title that have seem to the author dignified and pleasantly literary -- to the improbable marquis which seem to he to mean nothing at all moreover instead of give the book a quiet and scholarly exterior he have bind it in board of a injudicious heliotrope inset with a nasty little colored picture of a young woman with a st bernard dog this binding revolt the author who object with some reason that in all he book there be no mention of a dog of that description or indeed of any dog at all the book be wrap in a outer cover that bear a recommendation of its contents start with a hideous split infinitive and describe it as a exquisite social comedy write from within on the whole it seem to the author that he book be fly false and undesirable color and since art lie outside the domesticity he be hardly relieve when he wife tell he that she think the binding be very pretty the author have shudder no less at the little paragraph that the publisher have insert in the newspaper concern he birth and education wherein he be bracket with other well-known writer whose career at the university have be equally undistinguished but now that like byron he find himself famous among the bacon and egg he be in no mood to remember these past vexation as soon as he have finish breakfast he withdraw himself to he study and write half a essay on the republic of letter in a country wherein fifteen novel -- or be it fifty -- be publish every day of the year the publisher 's account of the goods he sell be bind to have a certain value money talk as mr arnold bennett once observe -- indeed today it be grow quite garrulous -- and when a publisher spend a lot of money on advertise a book the inference be that some one believe the book to be good this will not secure a book good notice but it will secure it notice of some kind or other and that as every publisher know be three-quarter of the battle the average critic today be a old young man who have not fail in literature or art possibly because he have not try to accomplish anything in either by the time he have acquire some skill in criticism he have generally cease to be a critic through no fault of he own but through sheer weariness of spirit when a man be very young he can dance upon everyone who have not write a masterpiece with a light heart but after this period of joyous savagery there follow fatigue and a certain pity the critic lose sight of he first magnificent standard and become grateful for even the smallest merit in the book he be compel to read like a mother give a powder to she child he be at pain to disguise he timid censure with a teaspoonful of jam as the year pass by he become afraid of these book that continue to appear in unreasonable profusion and that have long ago destroy he faith in literature he love of read he sense of humor and the color matter of he hair he realize with a dreadful sense of the infinite that when he be dead and bury this torrent of book will overwhelm the individuality of he successor bind like himself to a lifelong examination of the insignificant timidity be certainly the note of modern criticism which be rarely rouse to indignation save when confront by the infrequent outrage of some intellectual anarchist if the critic of the more important journal be not so enthusiastic as they provincial confreres they be at least gentle with the improbable marquis a critic of genius would have say that such book be not worth write still less worth read a outspoken critic would have say that it be too dull to be a acceptable presentation of a life that we all find interesting as it be most of the critic praise the style in which it be write because it be quite impossible to call it a enthralling or even a entertaining book some of the younger critic who still retain a interest in they own personality discover that its vacuity make it a convenient mirror by means of which they would display the progress of they own genius in common gratitude they have to close these manifestation of they merit with a word or two in praise of the book they be profess to review the improbable marquis be very favourably receive by the press in general it be as the publisher make haste to point out in he advertisement a book of the year and reassure by its flippant exterior the library and the public buy it with avidity the author paste he swollen collection of newspaper-cutting into a album and carefully revise he novel in case a second edition should be call for there be one review which he have read more often than any of the other and nevertheless he hesitate to include it in he collection this book write the anonymous reviewer be as nearly faultless a book may be that possess no positive merit it differ only from seven-eighths of the novel that be produce today in be more carefully write the author have nothing to say and he have say it that be all three malignant line in a paper of no commercial importance the sort of thing that be pass round the publisher 's office with a appreciative chuckle in the face of the general amiability of the press such a notice in a obscure journal could do the book no harm only the author sit hour after hour in he study with that diminutive scrap of paper before he on the table and wonder if it be true iv fame it be some little time before the public the mysterious section of the public that read work of fiction discover that the publisher aid by the normal good-humour of the critic have persuade they to sacrifice some of they scant hour of intellectual recreation on a work of portentous dullness therefor the literary audience have its sense of humor -- they amuse themselves for a while by recommend the book to they friend and the sale creep steadily up to four thousand and there stay with a unmistakable air of finality if the book have have any real literary merit its life would have start at that point for the weary comment of reviewer and the strident outcry of publisher tend to obscure rather than reveal the permanent value of a book but six month after publication the improbable marquis be completely forget save by the second-hand bookseller who find themselves embarrass with a number of book for which no one seem anxious to pay six-penny in spite of the striking heliotrope bind the publisher who be aware of this circumstance offer the author five hundred copy at cost price and the author buy they and send they to public library without examine the motive for he action too closely there be moment when he regard the success of he book with suspicion he would have prefer the praise that have greet it to have be less violent and more clearly define of all the criticism the only one that linger in he mind be the curt comment the author have nothing to say and he have say it he think it be unfair but he have remember it at the same time in examine he own character he could not find that masterfulness that seem to he necessary in a great man but for the most part he be content to accept he new honor with a placid satisfaction and to smile genially upon a world that be eager to credit he with quality that possibly he do not possess for if he book be no longer read he fame as a author seem to be establish on a rock society with a larger s than that which he have hitherto adorn be delighted to find after two notable failure that genius could still be presentable and the author be rather more than that he be rich he have that air of the distinguished army officer which fall so easily to those who occupy the pleasant position of sleep partner in the city and he have just the right shade of amuse modesty with which to meet inquiry as to he literary intention in a word he be a author of whom any country -- even france that prolific parent of presentable author -- would have be proud even he wife who have think it a excellent joke that she husband should have write a book have to take he seriously as a author when she find that they social position be steadily improve with feminine tact she give he a fountain-pen on he birthday from which he be mean to conclude that she believe in he mission as a artist meanwhile with the world at he foot the author spend a appreciable part of he time in visit the second-hand bookshop and buy copy of he book absurdly cheap he carry these waif home and store they in a attic secretly for he would have find it hard to explain he motive to the intellectually childless in the first flush of authorship he have send a number of presentation copy of he book to writer whom he admire and he notice without bitterness that some of these volume with they neatly turn inscription be come back to he through this channel at all the second-hand bookshop he see long-haired young man look over the book without buy they and he think these must be author but he be too shy to speak to they though he have a great longing to know other writer he want to ask they question concern they method of work for he be have trouble with he second book he have read a article in which the writer say that the great fault of modern fiction be that author be more concerned to produce good chapter than to produce good book it seem to he that in he first book he have only aim at good sentence but he know no one with whom he could discuss such matter one day he find a copy of the improbable marquis in the chare cross road and be glance through it with absent-minded interest when a voice at he elbow say i should not buy that if i be you sir it be no good he look up and see a wild young man with bright eye and a untidy black beard but it be mine i write it cry the author the young man stare at he in dismay i be sorry i do not know he blurt out and fade away into the crowd the author gaze after he wistfully regret that he have not have presence of mind enough to ask he to lunch perhaps the young man could have tell he how he ought to write he second book for somehow or other at the very moment when he literary position seem most secure in the eye of he wife and he friend the author have lose all confidence in he own power he shut himself up in he study every night and be suppose by a admiring and almost timorous household to be produce masterpiece when in reality he be conduct a series of barren skirmish between the critical and the creative element of he nature he would write a chapter or two in a fine fury of composition and then would read what he have write with intense disgust he feel that he second book ought to be better than he first and he doubt whether he would even be able to write anything half so good in he hour of disillusionment he recall the anonymous critic who have treat the improbable marquis with such scant respect and he write to he ask he to expand he judgment he be prepare to be wound by the answer but the form it take surprised he in reply to he temperate and courteous letter the critic send a postcard bear only five short word -- why do you write it this be bad manners but the author be sensible enough to see that it might be good criticism especially as he find some difficulty in answer the question why have he write a book not for money or for fame or to express a personality of which he see no reason to be proud all he friend have say that he ought to write a novel and he have think that he could write a better one than the average but he have to admit that such motive seem to he insufficient there be perhaps some mysterious force that drive man to create work of art and the critic have see that he book have lack this necessary impulse in the light of this new theory the author be rouse by a sense of injustice he feel that it should be possible for anyone to write a good book if they take sufficient pain and he set himself to work again with a savage and unproductive energy it seem to he that in spite of he effort to bear in mind that the whole should be greater than any part he chapter break up into sentence and he sentence into forlorn and ungregarious word when he look to he first book for comfort he find the same horrid phenomenon take place in its familiar page sometimes when he be dishearten by he fruitless effort he slip out into the street fix he attention on concrete object to rest he tired mind but he could not help notice that london have discover the secret which make he intellectual life a torment the street be more than a mere assemblage of house london herself be more than a tangled skein of street and overhead heaven be more than a meeting-place of individual star what be this secret that make word into a book house into city and restless and measurable star into a unchanging and immeasurable universe the bird in the garden the room in which the burchell family live in love street se be underground and depend for light and air on a grate let into the pavement above uncle john who be a queer one have fill the area with green plant and creeper in box and tin hang from the grate so that the room itself obtain very little light indeed but there be always a nice bright green place for the people sit in it to look at toby who have peep into the area of other little boy know that he be of quite exceptional beauty and it be with a certain awe that he help uncle john to tend the plant in the morning water they and take the piece of paper and straw that have fall through the grate from they hair it be a great mistake to have straw in one hair uncle john would say gravely and toby know that it be true it be in the morning after they have just be water that the plant look and smell best and when the sun shone through the grate and the diamond be shine and fall through the forest toby would tell the baby about the great bird who would one day come fly through the tree -- a bird of all color ugly and beautiful with a harsh sweet voice and that will be the end of everything say toby though of course he be only repeat a story he uncle john have tell he there be other people in the big dark room besides toby and uncle john and the baby dark people who flit to and fro about secret matter people call father and mother and mr hearn who be apt to kick if they find you in they way and who never laugh except at night and then they laugh too loudly they will frighten the bird think toby but they be kind to uncle john because he have a pension toby sleep in a corner on the ground beside the baby and when father and mr hearn fight at night he would wake up and watch and shiver but when this happen it seem to he that the baby be laugh at he and he would pinch she to make she stop one night when the man be fight very fiercely and mother have fall asleep on the table uncle john rise from he bed and begin singing in a great voice it be a song toby know very well about trafalgar 's bay but it frighten the two man a great deal because they think uncle john would be too mad to fetch the pension any more next day he be quite well however and he and toby find a large green caterpillar in the garden among the plant this be a fact of great importance say uncle john stroke it with a little stick it be a sign toby use to lie awake at night after that and listen for the bird but he only hear the clatter of foot on the pavement and the scream of engine far away later there come a new young woman to live in the cellar -- not a dark person but a person you could see and speak to she pat toby on the head but when she see the baby she catch it to she breast and cry over it call it pretty name at first father and mr hearn be both very kind to she and mother use to sit all day in the corner with burn eye but after a time the three use to laugh together at night as before and the woman would sit with she wet face and wait for the come of the bird with toby and the baby and uncle john who be a queer one all we have to do uncle john would say be to keep the garden clean and tidy and to water the plant every morning so that they may be very green and toby would go and whisper this to the baby and she would stare at the ceiling with large stupid eye there come a time when toby be very sick and he lay all day in he corner wonder about wonder sometimes the room in which he lay become so small that he be choke for lack of air sometimes it be so large that he scream out because he feel lonely he could not see the dark people then at all but only uncle john and the woman who tell he in whisper that she name be mummie she call he sonny which be a very pretty name and when toby hear it he feel a tickle in he side which he know to be gladness mummie 's face be wet and warm and soft and she be very fond of kiss every morning uncle john would lift toby up and show he the garden and toby would slip out of he arm and walk among the tree and plant and the place would grow bigger and bigger until it be all the world and toby would lose himself amongst the tangle of tree and flower and creeper he would see butterfly there and tame animal and the sky be full of bird of all color ugly and beautiful but he know that none of these be the bird because they voice be only sweet sometimes he show these wonder to a little boy call toby who hold he hand and call he uncle john sometimes he show they to he mummie and he himself be toby but always when he come back he find himself lie in uncle john 's arm and weary from he walk would fall into a pleasant dreamless sleep it seem to toby at this time that a veil hang about he which dim and unreal in itself serve to make all thing dim and unreal he do not know whether he be asleep or awake so strange be life so vivid be he dream mummie uncle john the baby toby himself come with a flicker of the veil and disappear vaguely without cause it would happen that toby would be speak to uncle john and suddenly he would find himself look into the large eye of the baby turn stupidly towards the ceiling and again the baby would be toby himself a hot dry little body without leg or arm that sway suspend as if by magic a foot above the bed then there be the vision of two small foot that move a long way off and toby would watch they curiously as kitten do they tail without know the cause of they motion it be all very wonderful and very strange and day by day the veil grow thicker there be no need to wake when the sleeptime be so pleasant there be no dark people to kick you in that dreamy place and yet toby wake -- wake to a life and in a place which he have never know before he find himself on a heap of rag in a large cellar which depend for its light on a grate let into the pavement of the street above on the stone floor of the area and swing from the grating be a few sickly grimy plant in pot there must have be a fine sunset up above for a faint red glow come through the bar and touch the leaf of the plant there be a light candle standing in a bottle on the table and the cellar seem full of people at the table itself two man and a woman be drink though they be already drunk and beyond in a corner toby could see the head and shoulder of a tall old man beside he there crouch a woman with a fade pretty face and between toby and the rest of the room there stand a box in which lay a baby with large wakeful eye toby 's body tingle with excitement for this be a new thing he have never see it before he have never see anything before the voice of the woman at the table rise and fall steadily without a pause she be abuse the other woman and the two drunken man be laugh at she and shout she on toby think the other woman lack spirit because she stay crouch on the floor and say nothing at last the woman stop she abuse and one of the man turn and shout a order to the woman on the floor she stand up and come towards he hesitate this annoy the man and he swear at she brutally when she come near enough he knock she down with he fist and all the three burst out laugh toby be so excited that he kneel up in he corner and clap he hand but the other do not notice because the old man be up and sway wildly over the woman he seem to be threaten the man who have strike she and that one be evidently afraid of he for he rise unsteadily and lift the chair on which he have be sit above he head to use as a weapon the old man raise he fist and the chair fall heavily on to he wrinkled forehead and he drop to the ground the woman at the table cry out the pension in she shrill voice and then they be all quiet look then it seem to toby that through the forest there come fly with a harsh sweet voice and a tumult of wing a bird of all color ugly and beautiful and he know though later there might be people to tell he otherwise that that be the end of everything child of the moon the boy stand at the place where the park tree stop and the smooth lawn slide away gently to the great house he be dress only in a pair of ragged knickerbockers and a gaping buttonless shirt so that he leg and neck and chest shine silver bare in the moonlight by day he have a mass of rough golden hair but now it seem to brood above he head like a black cloud that make he face deathly white by comparison on he arm there lay a great heap of gleam dew-wet rose and lily spoil of the park flower-bed they cool petal touch he cheek and fill he nostril with ache scent he feel he arm smart here and there where the thorn of the rose have tear they in the dark but these delicate caress of pain only serve to deepen to he the wonder of the night that wrap he about like a cloak behind he there dream the black wood and over he head multitudinous star quiver and balance in space but these thing be nothing to he for far across the lawn that be spread knee-deep with a web of mist there gleam for he eager eye the splendor of a fairy palace red and orange and gold the light of the fairy revel shine from a hundred window and fill he with wonder that he should see with wakeful eye the jewel that he have desire so long in sleep he could only gaze and gaze until he strain eye fill with tear and set the enchanted light dance in the dark on he ear that hear no more the cry of the night-bird and the quick stir of the rabbit in the brake there fall the strain of far music the flower in he arm seem to sway to it and he heart beat to the deep pulse of the night so enraptured be he sens that he do not notice the come of the girl and she be able to examine he closely before she call to he softly through the moonlight boy boy at the sound of she voice he swing round and look at she with startle eye he see she excited little face and she white dress be you a fairy he ask

seem the light of the moon break through the tree by the wayside and light up he figure for a moment it fall upon he head like a halo and touch the knapsack of dream with glory then all be lose in the blackness of night as he turn homeward the boy feel a cold wind upon he cheek it be the first breath of dawn the coffin merchant i london on a November Sunday inspire eustace reynold with a melancholy too insistent to be ignore and too causeless to be enjoy the gray sky overhead between the house-top the cold wind round every street-corner the sad face of the man and woman on the pavement combine to create a atmosphere of ineloquent misery eustace be sensitive to impression and in spite of a half-conscious effort to remain a dispassionate spectator of the world 's melancholy he feel the chill of the aimless day creep over he spirit why be there no sun no warmth no laughter on the earth what have become of all the child who keep laughter like a mask on the face of disillusioned man the wind blow down southampton street and chill eustace to a shiver that pass away in a shudder of disgust at the sombre color of life a windy Sunday in london before the lamp be light tempt a man to believe in the nobility of work at the corner by chare cross telegraph office a man thrust a handbill under he eye but he shake he head impatiently the blueness of the finger that offer he the paper be alone sufficient to make he disincline to remove he hand from he pocket even for a instant but the man would not be dismiss so lightly excuse I sir he say follow he you have not look to see what my bill be whatever they be i do not want they that be where you be wrong sir the man say earnestly you will never find life interesting if you do not lie in wait for the unexpected as a matter of fact i believe that my bill contain exactly what you do want eustace look at the man with quick curiosity he clothes be ragged and the visible part of he flesh be blue with cold but he eye be bright with intelligence and he speech be that of a educate man it seem to eustace that he be be regard with a keen expectancy as though he decision i on the trivial point be of real importance i do not know what you be drive at he say but if it will give you any pleasure i will take one of you bill though if you argue with all you client as you have with I it must take you a long time to get rid of they i only offer they to suitable person the man say folding up one of the handbill while he speak and i be sure you will not regret take it and he slip the paper into eustace 's hand and walk rapidly away eustace look after he curiously for a moment and then open the paper in he hand when he eye comprehend its significance he give a low whistle of astonishment you will soon be warn a coffin it read at 606 gray 's inn road you order will be attend to with civility and despatch call and see we eustace swing round quickly to look for the man but he be out of sight the wind be grow colder and the lamp be begin to shine out in the greying street eustace crumple the paper into he overcoat pocket and turn homewards how silly he say to himself in conscious amusement the sound of he footstep on the pavement ring like a echo to he laugh ii eustace be impressionable but not temperamentally morbid and he be trouble a little by the fact that the gruesomely bizarre handbill continue to recur to he mind the thing be so manifestly absurd he tell himself with conviction that it be not worth a second thought but this do not prevent he from think of it again and again what manner of undertaker could hope to obtain business by give away foolish handbill in the street really the whole thing have the air of a brainless practical joke yet he intellectual fairness force he to admit that as far as the man who have give he the bill be concerned brainlessness be out of the question and joke improbable there have be depths in those little bright eye which he glance have not be able to sound and the man 's manner in make he accept the handbill have give the whole transaction a kind of ludicrous significance you will soon be want a coffin -- eustace find himself turn the word over and over in he mind if he have have any near relation he might have construe the thing as a elaborate threat but he be practically alone in the world and it seem to he that he be not likely to want a coffin for anyone but himself oh damn the thing he say impatiently as he open the door of he flat it be not worth worry about i must not let the whim of some mad tradesman get on my nerve i have get no one to bury anyhow nevertheless the thing linger with he all the evening and when he neighbor the doctor come in for a chat at ten o'clock eustace be glad to show he the strange handbill the doctor who have experience the queer magic that be practice to this day on the west coast of africa and who therefore have no nerve be delighted with so strike a example of british commercial enterprise though mind you he add gravely smooth the crumpled paper on he knee this sort of thing might do a lot of harm if it fall into the hand of a nervous subject i should be incline to punch the head of the ass who perpetrate it have you turn that address up in the post office directory eustace shake he head and rise and fetch the fat red book which make london a english city together they find the gray 's inn road and run they eye down to no 606 ` harding g j coffin merchant and undertaker ' not much information there mutter the doctor coffin merchant 's a bit unusual be not it query eustace i suppose he manufacture coffin wholesale for the trade still i do not know they call themselves that anyhow it seem as though that handbill be a genuine piece of downright foolishness the idiot ought to be stop advertise in that way i 'll go and see he myself tomorrow say eustace bluntly well he be give you a invitation say the doctor so it be only polite of you to go i 'll drop in here in the evening to hear what he be like i expect that you 'll find he as mad as a hatter something like that say eustace or he would not give handbill to people like I i have no one to bury except myself no say the doctor in the hall i suppose you have not do not let he measure you for a coffin reynold eustace laugh we never know he say sententiously iii next day be one of those gorgeous blue day of which November give but few and eustace be glad to run out to wimbledon for a game of golf or rather for two it be therefore dusk before he make he way to the gray 's inn road in search of the unexpected he attitude towards he errand despite the doctor 's laughter and the prosaic entry in the directory be a little confused he could not help reflect that after all the doctor have not see the man with the little wise eye nor could he forget that mr g j harding 's description of himself as a coffin merchant to say the least of it approach the unusual yet he feel that it would be intolerable to chop the whole business without find out what it all mean on the whole he would have prefer not to have discover the riddle at all but have find it he could not rest without a answer no 606 gray 's inn road be not like a ordinary undertaker 's shop the window be heavily drape with black cloth but be otherwise unadorned there be no letter from grateful mourner no little model coffin no photograph of marble memorial even more surprising be the absence of any name over the shop-door so that the uninformed stranger could not possibly tell what trade be carry on within or who be responsible for the management of the business this uncommercial modesty do not tend to remove eustace 's doubt as to the sanity of mr g j harding but he open the shop-door which start a large bell swing noisily and step over the threshold the shop be hardly more expressive inside than out a broad counter run across it cut it in two and in the partial gloom overhead a naked gas-burner whistle a noisy song beyond this the shop contain no furniture whatever and no stock-in-trade except a few plank lean against the wall in one corner there be a large ink-stand on the counter eustace wait patiently for a minute or two and then as no one come he begin stamp on the floor with he foot this prove efficacious for soon he hear the sound of footstep ascend wooden stair the door behind the counter open and a man come into the shop he be dress quite neatly now and he hand be no longer blue with cold but eustace know at once that it be the man who have give he the handbill nevertheless he look at eustace without a sign of recognition what can i do for you sir he ask pleasantly eustace lay the handbill down on the counter i want to know about this he say it strike I as be in pretty bad taste and if a nervous person get hold of it it might be dangerous you think so sir yet we representative he linger affectionately on the word we representative tell you i believe that the handbill be only distribute to suitable case that be where you be wrong say eustace sharply for i have no one to bury except yourself say the coffin merchant suavely eustace look at he keenly i do not see -- he begin but the coffin merchant interrupt he you must know sir he say that this be no ordinary undertaker 's business we possess information that enable we to defy competition in we special class of trade information well if you prefer it you may say intuition if we representative handed you that advertisement it be because he know you would need it excuse I say eustace you appear to be sane but you word do not convey to I any reasonable significance you give I that foolish advertisement yourself and now you say that you do so because you know i would need it i ask you why the coffin merchant shrug he shoulder ours be a sentimental trade he say i do not know why dead man want coffin but they do for my part i would wish to be cremate dead man ah i be come to that you see mr -- reynold thank you my name be harding -- g j harding you see mr reynold we intuition be of a very special character and if we say that you will need a coffin it be probable that you will need one you mean to say that i -- precisely in twenty-four hour or less mr reynold you will need we service the revelation of the coffin merchant 's insanity come to eustace with a certain relief for the first time in the interview he have a sense of the dark empty shop and the whistle gas-jet over he head why it sound like a threat mr harding he say gaily the coffin merchant look at he oddly and produce a print form from he pocket if you would fill this up he say eustace pick it up off the counter and laugh aloud it be a order for a hundred-guinea funeral i do not know what you game be he say but this have go on long enough perhaps it have mr reynold say the coffin merchant and he lean across the counter and look eustace straight in the face for a moment eustace be amuse then he be suddenly afraid i think it be time i -- he begin slowly and then he be silent he whole will intent on fight the eye of the coffin merchant the song of the gas-jet wane to a point in he ear and then rise steadily till it be like the beating of the world 's heart the eye of the coffin merchant grow larger and larger till they blended in one great circle of fire then eustace pick a pen off the counter and fill in the form thank you very much mr reynold say the coffin merchant shake hand with he politely i can promise you every civility and despatch good-day sir outside on the pavement eustace stand for a while try to recall exactly what have happen there be a slight scratch on he hand and when he automatically touch it with he lip it make they burn the light lamp in the gray 's inn road seem to he a little unsteady and the passer-by show a disposition to blunder into he queer business he say to himself dimly i would better have a cab he reach home in a dream it be nearly ten o'clock before the doctor remember he promise and go upstairs to eustace 's flat the outer door be half-open so that he think he be expect and he switch on the light in the little hall and shut the door behind he with the simplicity of habit but when he swing round from the door he give a cry of astonishment eustace be lie asleep in a chair before he with he face flush and droop on he shoulder and he breath hiss noisily through he parted lip the doctor look at he quizzically if i do not know you my young friend he remark i should say that you be as drunk as a lord and he go up to eustace and shake he by the shoulder but eustace do not wake queer the doctor mutter sniff at eustace 's lip he have not be drink the soul of a policeman i outside above the uneasy din of the traffic the sky be glorious with the far peace of a fine summer evening through the upper pane of the station window police-constable bennett who feel that he sens at the moment be abnormally keen recognize with a sink heart such red and yellow as bedecked the best patchwork quilt at home by contrast the light of the superintendent 's office be subdue so that within the wall of the police-station sound seem of greater importance somewhere a drunkard deprive of he boot be drum he criticism of authority on the wall of he cell from the next room where the man off duty be amusing themselves there come a steady clicking of billiard-ball and domino break now and again by gruff burst of laughter and at he very elbow the superintendent be speak in that suave voice that remind bennett of gray velvet you see bennett how matter stand i have nothing at all against you conduct you be steady and punctual and i have no doubt that you be try to do you duty but it be very unfortunate that as far as result go you have nothing to show for you effort during the last three week you have not bring in a charge of any description and during the same period i find that you colleague on the beat have be exceptionally busy i repeat that i do not accuse you of neglect you duty but these thing tell with the magistrate and convey a general suggestion of slackness bennett look down at he brightly polished boot he finger be sandy and there be soft feel beneath he foot i have be afraid of this for some time sir he say very much afraid the superintendent look at he questioningly you have nothing to say he say i have always try to do my duty sir i know i know but you must see that a certain number of charge if not of conviction be the mark of a smart officer surely you would not have I arrest innocent person that be a most improper observation say the superintendent severely i will say no more to you now but i hope you will take what i have say as a warning you must bustle along bennett bustle along outside in the street police-constable bennett be free to reflect on he unpleasant interview the superintendent be ambitious and therefore pompous he himself be unambitious and therefore modest leave to himself he might have be content to triumph in the reflection that he have fail to say a number of foolish thing but the welfare of he wife and child bind he tiresomely enough for a dreamer tightly to the practical it be clear that if he do not forthwith produce sign of he efficiency as a promoter of the peace that welfare would be imperil yet he do not condemn the chance that have make he a policeman or even the mischance that bring no guilty person to he hand rather he look with a gentle curiosity into the face of the people who pass he and wonder why he could not detect trace of the generally assume wickedness of the neighborhood these unkempt man and woman be thief and even murderer it appear but to he they shine as happy youth and maiden joyous victim of love 's tyranny as he draw near the street in which he live this sense of universal love quicken in he blood and stir he strangely it do not escape he eye that to the general he uniform be a unfriendly thing man and woman pause in they animated chatter till he have pass and even the child falter in they game to watch he with doubtful eye and yet he heart be warm for they he know that he wish they well nevertheless when he see he house shine in a row of similar house he realize that they attitude be wiser than he if he be to be a success as a breadwinner he must wage a sterner war against these happy lovable people it be easy he have be long enough in the force to know how easy to get case a intolerant manner a little provocative harshness and the thing be do yet with all he heart he admire the poor for they resentful independence of spirit to he this have always be the supreme quality of the english character how could he make use of it to fill english gaol he open the door of he house with a sigh on he lip there come forth the merry shouting of he child ii above the telephone wire the star dip at anchor in the cloudless sky down below in one of the dark empty street police-constable bennett turn the handle of door and test the fastening of window with a complete scepticism as to the value of he labor gradually he be come to see that he be not one of the few who be bear to rule -- to control -- they simple neighbor ambitious only for breath where if he have possess this mission he would have be eager to punish he now feel no more than a sympathy that charge he with some responsibility for the sin of other he share the uneasy conviction of the multitude that human justice as interpret by the inspired minority be more than a little unjust the very unpopularity with which he uniform endowed he seem to he to express a severe criticism of the system of which he be a unwilling supporter he wish these people to regard he as a kind of official friend to advise and settle difference yet shrewder than he they consider he as a enemy who live on they mistake and the collapse of they social relationship there remain he duty to he wife and child and this render the problem infinitely perplexing why should he punish other because of he love for he child or again why should he child suffer for he scruple yet it be clear that unless fortune permit he to accomplish some notable yet honorable arrest he would either have to cheat and tyrannise with he colleague or leave the force and what employment be available for a discharge policeman as he go systematically from house to house the consideration of these thing mar the normal progress of he dream conscious as he be of the star and the great width of heaven that make the world so small he nevertheless feel that he love for he family and the wider love that determine he honor be somehow intimately connect with this greatness of the universe rather than with the world of little street and little motive and so be not lightly to be put aside yet how can one measure one love against another when all be true when the door of gurney ' the moneylender open to he touch and draw he abruptly from he speculation he first emotion be a quick irritation that chance should interfere with he thought but when he lantern show he that the lock have be tamper with he annoyance change to a thrill of hopeful excitement what if this be the way out what if fate have grant he compromise the opportunity of pit he official virtue against official crime those shadowy force in the existence of which he do not believe but which lay on he life like cloud he be not a physical coward and it seem quite simple to he to creep quietly through the open door into the silent office without wait for possible reinforcement he know that the safe which would be the natural goal of the presumed burglar be in mr gurney 's private office beyond and while he stand listen intently he seem to hear dim sound come from the direction of that room for a moment he pause frown slightly as a man do when he be try to catalogue a impression when he achieve perception it come oddly mingled with recollection of the little tragedy of he child at home for some one be cry like a child in the little room where mr gurney brow-beat recalcitrant borrower dangerous burglar do not weep and bennett hesitate no longer but step past the open flap of the counter and throw open the door of the inner office the electric light have be switch on and at the table there sit a slight young man with he face bury in he hand cry bitterly behind he the safe stand open and empty and the grate be fill with smoulder ember of burnt paper bennett go up to the young man and place he hand on he shoulder but the young man weep on and do not move try as he might bennett could not help relax the grip of outraged law and pat the young man 's shoulder soothingly as it rise and fall he have no fit weapon of roughness and oppression with which to oppose this child-like grief he could only fight tear with tear come he say gently you must pull yourself together at the sound of he voice the young man give a great sob and then be silent shiver a little that be better say bennett encouragingly much better i have burn everything the young man say suddenly and now the place be empty i be nearly sick just now bennett look at he sympathetically as one dreamer may look at another who be sad with action dream too often for scatheless accomplishment i be afraid you 'll get into serious trouble he say i know reply the young man but that blackguard gurney -- he voice rise to a shrill scream and choke he for a moment then he go on quietly but it be all over now finish do with i suppose you owe he money the young man nod he live on fool like I but he threaten to tell my father and now i have just about ruin he pah swine this will not be much better for you father say bennett gravely no it be worse but perhaps it will help some of the other he keep on threatening and i could not wait any longer can not you see over the young man 's shoulder the star beck and nod to bennett through the blindless window i see he say i see so now you can take I bennett look doubtfully at the outstretched wrist you be only a fool he say a dream fool like I and they will give you year for this i do not see why they should give a man year for be a fool the young man look up take with a sudden hope you will let I go he say in astonishment i know i be a ass just now i suppose i be a bit shake but you will let I go i wish to god i have never see you say bennett simply you have you father and i have a wife and three little child who shall judge between we my father be a old man and my child be little you have better go before i make up my mind without another word the young man creep out of the room and bennett follow he slowly into the street this gallant criminal whose capture would have be honorable have dwindle to a hysterical foolish boy and aid by he own strange impulse this boy have ruin he the burglary have take place on he beat there would be a inquiry it do not need that to secure he expulsion from the force once in the street he look up hopefully to the heaven but now the star seem unspeakably remote though as he pass along he beat he wife and he three little child be walk by he side iii bennett have develop mentally without realize the logical result of he development until it smite he with calamity of he betrayal of trust as a guardian of property he think nothing of the possibility of poverty for he family he think a great deal -- all the more that he dreamer 's mind be little accustomed to grip the practical it be strange he think that he final declaration of war against he position should have be a little lack in dignity he have not take the decisive step through any deep compassion of utter poverty bravely bear he have be no more than trivial pity of a young man 's folly and this be a frail thing on which to make so great a sacrifice yet he regret nothing he task of moral guardian of man and woman have become impossible to he and sooner or later he must have give it up and there be also he family i must come to some decision he say to himself firmly and then the great scream fall upon he ear and echo through he brain for ever and ever it come from the house before which he be stand and he expect the whole street to wake aghast with the horror of it but there follow a silence that seem to emphasise the ugliness of the sound far away a engine scream as if in mock imitation and that be all bennett have count up to a hundred and seventy before the door of the house open and a man come out on to the step oh constable he say coolly come inside will you i have something to show you bennett mount the step doubtfully there be a scream he say the man look at he quickly so you hear it he say it be not pretty no it be not reply bennett the man lead he down the dim passage into the back sitting-room the body of a man lay on the sofa it be curl like a dry leaf that be my brother say the man with a little emphatic nod i have kill he he be my enemy bennett stare dully at the body without believe it to be really there dead he say mechanically and anything i say will be use against I in evidence as if you could compress my hatred into one little lie notebook i do not care a damn about you hatred say bennett with heat a hour ago perhaps i might have arrest you now i only find you uninterest the man give a long low whistle of surprise a philosopher in uniform he say god sir you have my sympathy and you have my pity you have steal you idea from cheap melodrama and you make tragedy ridiculous be i a policeman i would lock you up with pleasure be i a man i should thrash you joyfully as it be i can only share you infamy i too i suppose be a murderer you be in a low nervous state say the man and you be do I some injustice it be true that i be a poor murderer but it appear to I that you be a worse policeman i shall wear the uniform no more from tonight i think you be wise and i shall mar my philosophy with no more murder if indeed i have kill he for i assure you that beyond administer the poison to he wretched body i have do nothing perhaps he be not dead can you hear he heart beat i can hear the spoon of my child beat on they empty platter be it like that with you poor devil oh poor poor devil philosopher should have no wife no child no home and no heart bennett turn from the man with unspeakable loathing i hate you and such as you he cry weakly you justify the existence of the police you make I despise myself because i realize that you crime be no less mine than yours i do not ask you to defend the deadness of that thing lie there i shall stir no finger to have you hang for the thought of suicide repel I and i can not separate you blood and mine we be common child of a noble mother and for we mother 's sake i say farewell and without wait for the man 's answer he pass from the house to the street iv haggard and with rebellious limb police-constable bennett stagger into the superintendent 's office in the early morning i have pay careful attention to you advice he say to the superintendent and i have pass across the city in search of crime in its place i have find but folly -- such folly as you have such folly as i have myself -- the common heritage of we blood it seem that in some way i have bind myself to bring criminal to justice i have pass across the city and i have find no man worse than myself do what you will with I the superintendent clear he throat there have be too many complaint concern the conduct of the police he say it be time that a example be make you will be charge with be drunk and disorderly while on duty i have a wife and three little child say bennett softly -- and three pretty little child and he cover he tired face with he hand the conjurer certainly the audience be restive in the first place it feel that it have be defraud see that cissie bradford whose smile face adorn the bill outside have fail to appear and secondly it consider that the deputy for that famous lady be more than inadequate to the little man who sweat in the glare of the limelight and juggle desperately with glass ball in a vain effort to steady he nerve it be apparent that he turn be a failure and as he work he could have cry with disappointment for he be a trial performance and a year 's engagement in the henning ' group of music-hall would have reward success yet he trick thing that he have do with the utmost ease a thousand time have be a succession of blunder rather mirth-provoking than mystify to the audience presently one of the glass ball fall crash on the stage and amidst the jeer of the gallery he turn to he wife who serve as he assistant i have lose my chance he say with a sob i can not do it never mind dear she whisper there be a nice steak and onion at home for supper it be no use he say despairingly i 'll try the disappear trick and then get off i be do here he turn back to the audience lady and gentleman he say to the mocker in a waver voice i will now present to you the conclude item of my entertainment i will cause this lady to disappear under you very eye without the aid of any mechanical contrivance or artificial device this be the merest showman 's patter for as a matter of fact it be not a very wonderful illusion but as he lead he wife forward to present she to the audience the conjurer be wonder whether the mishap that have ruin he chance would meet he even here if something should go wrong -- he feel he wife 's hand tremble in he and he press it tightly to reassure she he must make a effort a effort of will and then no mistake would happen for a second the light dance before he eye then he pull himself together if a earthquake should disturb the curtain and show molly creep ignominiously away behind he would still meet he fate like a man he turn round to conduct he wife to the little alcove from which she should vanish she be not on the stage for a minute he do not guess the greatness of the disaster then he realize that the theater be intensely quiet and that he would have to explain that the last item of he program be even more of a fiasco than the rest owe to a sudden indisposition -- he skin tingle at the thought of the hoot he tongue rasp upon crack lip as he brace himself and bow to the audience then come the applause again and again it break out from all over the house while the curtain rise and fall and the conjurer stand on the stage mute uncomprehend what have happen at first he have think they be mock he but it be impossible to misjudge the nature of the applause besides the stage-manager be allow he call after call as if he be a star when at length the curtain remain down and the orchestra strike up the opening bar of the next song he stagger off into the wing as if he be drunk there he meet mr jame hennings himself you 'll do say the great man that last trick be neat you ought to polish up the other though i suppose you do not want to tell I how you do it well well come in the morning and we 'll fix up a contract and so without have say a word the conjurer find himself hustle off by the vaudeville napoleon mr henning have something more to say to he manager bit rum he say do you see it queerest thing we have strike how be it do do you think can not imagine there one minute on he arm go the next no trap or curtain or anything money in it eh biggest hit of the century i should think i 'll go and fix up a contract and get he to sign it tonight get on with it and mr jame hennings flee to he office meanwhile the conjurer be wander in the wing with the drooping heart of a lose child what have happen why be he a success and why do people stare so oddly and what have become of he wife when he ask they the stage hand laugh and say they have not see she why should they laugh he want she to explain thing and hear they good luck but she be not in she dressing-room she be not anywhere for a moment he feel like cry then for the second time that night he pull himself together after all there be no reason to be upset he ought to feel very pleased about the contract however it have happen it seem that he wife have leave the stage in some queer way without be see probably to increase the mystery she have go straight home in she stage dress and have succeed in dodge the stage-door keeper it be all very strange but of course there must be some simple explanation like that he would take a cab home and find she there already there be a steak and onion for supper as he drive along in the cab he become convinced that this theory be right molly have always be clever and this time she have certainly succeed in surprising everybody at the door of he house he give the cabman a shilling for himself with a light heart he could afford it now he run up the step cheerfully and open the door the passage be quite dark and he wonder why he wife have not light the gas molly he cry molly the small weary-eyed servant come out of the kitchen on a savoury wind of onion have not missus come home with you sir she say the conjurer thrust he hand against the wall to steady himself and the pattern of the wall-paper seem to burn he finger-tip not here he gasp at the frightened girl then where be she where be she i do not know sir she begin stutter but the conjurer turn quickly and run out of the house of course he wife must be at the theater it be absurd ever to have suppose that she could leave the theater in she stage dress unnoticed and now she be probably worry because he have not wait for she how foolish he have be it be a quarter of a hour before he find a cab and the theater be dark and empty when he get back to it he knock at the stage door and the night watchman open it my wife he cry there be no one here now sir the man answer respectfully for he know that a new star have rise that night the conjurer lean against the doorpost faintly take I up to the dressing-room he say i want to see whether she have be there while i be away the watchman lead the way along the dark passage i should not worry if i be you sir he say she can not have go far he do not know anything about it but he want to be sympathetic god know the conjurer mutter i can not understand this at all in the dressing-room molly 's clothes still lay neatly fold as she have leave they when they go on the stage that night and when he see they he last hope leave the conjurer and a strange thought come into he mind i should like to go down on the stage he say and see if there be anything to tell I of she the night watchman look at the conjurer as if he think he be mad but he follow he down to the stage in silence when he be there the conjurer lean forward suddenly and he face be fill with a wistful eagerness molly he call molly but the empty theater give he nothing but echo in reply the poet 's allegory i the boy come into the town at six o'clock in the morning but the baker at the corner of the first street be up as be the way of baker and when he see the boy pass he hail he with a jolly shout hullo boy what be you after i be go about my business the boy say pertly and what might that be young fellow i might be a good tinker and worship god pan or i might grind scissors as sharp as the nose of baker but as a matter of fact i be a piper not a rat-catcher you understand but just a simple singer of sad song and a mad singer of merry one oh say the baker dully for he have hope the boy be in search of work then i suppose you have a message i sing song the boy say emphatically i do not run errand for anyone save it be for the fairy well then you have come to tell we that we be bad that we life be corrupt and we home sordid nowadays there be money in that if you can do it well you wit get up too early in the morning for I baker say the boy i tell you i sing song aye i know but there be something in they i hope perhaps you bring news they be not so popular as the other sort but still as long as it be bad news -- be it the flour that have change he brain to dough or the heat of the oven that have make they like dead grass but you must have some news -- news it be a fine morning of summer and i see a kingfisher across the watermeadow come along oh and there be a cuckoo back in the fir plantation singing with a may voice it must have be asleep all these month but my dear boy these thing happen every day be there no battle or earthquake or famine in the world have no man murder he wife or rob he neighbor be no one oppress by tyrant or lie to by they officer the boy shrug he shoulder i hope not he say but if it be so and i know i should not tell you i do not want to make you unhappy but of what use be you then if it be not to rouse in we the discontent that be alone divine would you have I go fat and happy listen to you babble of kingfisher and cuckoo while my brother and sister in the world be starve the boy be silent for a moment i give my song to the poor for nothing he say slowly certainly they be not much use to empty belly but they be all i have to give and i take it since you speak so feelingly that you too do you best and these other these people who must be remind hourly to throw they crust out of window for the poor -- would you have I sing to they they must be tell that life be evil and i find it good that man and woman be wretched and i find they happy that food and cleanliness order and knowledge be the essence of content while i only ask for love would you have I lie to cheat mean folk out of they scrap the baker scratch he head in astonishment certainly you be very mad he say but you will not get much money in this town with that sort of talk you have better come in and have breakfast with I but why do you ask I say the boy in surprise well you have a decent honest sort of face although you tongue be disorder i have rather it have be because you like my song say the boy and he go in to breakfast with the baker ii over he breakfast the boy talk wisely on art as be the wont of young singer and afterwards he go on he way down the street it be a great pity say the baker he seem a decent young chap he have nice eye say the baker 's wife as the boy pass down the street he frown a little what be the matter with they he wonder they be pleasant people enough and yet they do not want to hear my song presently he come to the tailor 's shop and as the tailor have sharper eye than the baker he see the pipe in the boy 's pocket hullo piper he call my leg be stiff come and sing we a song the boy look up and see the tailor sit cross-legged in the open window of he shop what sort of song would you like he ask oh the latest reply the tailor we do not want any old song here so the boy sing he new song of the kingfisher in the water-meadow and the cuckoo who have oversleep itself and what do you call that ask the tailor angrily when the boy have finish it be my new song but i do not think it be one of my best but in he heart the boy believe it be because he have only just make it i should hope it be you worst the tailor say rudely what sort of stuff be that to make a man happy to make a man happy echo the boy he heart sink within he if you have no news to give I why should i pay for you song i want to hear about my neighbor about they life and they wife and they sin there be the fat baker up the street -- they say he cheat the poor with light bread make I a song of that and i 'll give you some breakfast or there be the magistrate at the top of the hill who make the girl drown herself last week that be a poetic subject what be all this say the boy disdainfully can not you make dirt enough for yourself you with you stuff about bird shout the tailor you be a rank impostor that be what you be they say that you be the ninth part of a man but i find that they have grossly exaggerated cry the boy in retort but he have a heavy heart as he make off along the street by noon he have interview the butcher the cobbler the milkman and the maker of candlestick but they treat he no better than the tailor have do and as he be feel tired he go and sit down under a tree i begin to think that the baker be the best of the lot of they he say to himself ruefully as he roll he empty wallet between he finger then as the folly of singer provide they in some measure with a philosophy he fall asleep iii when he wake it be late in the afternoon and the child fresh from school have come out to play in the dusk far and near across the town-square the boy could hear they merry voice but he feel sad for he stomach have forget the baker 's breakfast and he do not see where he be likely to get any supper so he pull out he pipe and make a mournful song to himself of the dancing gnat and the bitter odour of the bonfire in the townsfolk 's garden and the child draw near to hear he sing for they think he song be pretty until they father drive they home say that stuff have no educational value why have not you a message they ask the boy i come to tell you that the grass be green beneath you foot and that the sky be blue over you head oh i but we know all that they answer do you do you scream the boy do you think you could stop over you absurd labor if you know how blue the sky be you would be out singing on the hill with I then who would do we work they say mock he then who would want it do he retort but it be ill argue on a empty stomach but when they have tire of tell he what a fool he be and go away the tailor 's little daughter creep out of the shadow and pat he on the shoulder i say boy she whisper i have bring you some supper father do not know the boy bless she and eat he supper while she watch he like he mother and when he have do she kiss he on the lip there boy she say you have nice golden hair the boy say see it shine in the dusk it strike I it be the only gold i shall get in this town still it be nice do not you think the girl whisper in he ear she have she arm round he neck i love it the boy say joyfully and you like my song do not you oh yes i like they very much but i like you better the boy put she off roughly you be as bad as the rest of they he say indignantly i tell you my song be everything i be nothing but it be you who eat my supper boy say the girl the boy kiss she remorsefully but i wish you have like I for my song he sigh you be better than any silly old song as bad as the rest of they the boy say lazily but somehow pleasant the shadow flock to they evening meeting in the square and overhead the star shine out in a sky that be certainly exceedingly blue iv next morning they arrest the boy as a rogue and a vagabond and in the afternoon they bring he before the magistrate and what have you to say for yourself say the magistrate to the boy after the second policeman like a faithful echo have finish read he note well say the boy i may be a rogue and a vagabond indeed i think that i probably be but i would claim the license that have always be allow to singer oh say the magistrate so you be one of those be you and what be you message i think if i could sing you a song or two i could explain myself better say the boy well reply the magistrate doubtfully you can try if you like but i warn you that i write song myself when i be a boy so that i know something about it oh i be glad of that say the boy and he sing he famous song of the grass that be so green and when he have finish the magistrate frown i know that before he say so then the boy sing he wonderful song of the sky that be so blue and when he have finish the magistrate scowl and what be we to learn from that he say so then the boy lose he temper and sing some naughty doggerel he have make up in he cell that morning he abuse the town and townsman but especially the townsman he damned they moral they custom and they institution he say that they have ugly face raucous voice and that they body be unclean he say they be thief and liar and murderer that they have no ear for music and no sense of humor oh he be bitter good god say the magistrate that be what i call real improve poetry why do not you sing that first there might have be a miscarriage of justice then the baker the tailor the butcher the cobbler the milkman and the maker of candlestick rise in court and say -- ah but we all know there be something in he so the magistrate give the boy a certificate that show that he be a real singer and the tradesman give he a purse of gold but the tailor 's little daughter give he one of she golden ringlet you will not forget boy will you she say oh no say the boy but i wish you have like my song presently when he have come a little way out of the town he put he hand in he wallet and draw out the magistrate 's certificate and tear it in two and then he take out the gold piece and throw they into the ditch and they be not half as bright as the buttercup but when he come to the ringlet he smile at it and put it back yet she be as bad as the rest of they he think with a sigh and he go across the world with he song and who shall say -- it be a dull November day and the window be heavily curtain so that the room be very dark in front of the fire be a large arm-chair which shut whatever light there might be from the two child a boy of eleven and a girl about two year younger who sit on the floor at the back of the room the boy be the better look but the girl have the better face they be both gaze at the arm-chair with the utmost excitement it be all right he be asleep say the boy oh do be careful you 'll wake he whisper the girl be you afraid no why should i be afraid of my father stupid i tell you he be not father any more he be a murderer the boy say hotly he tell I i tell you he say ` i have kill you mother ray ' and i go and look and mother be all red i simply shout and she would not answer that mean she be dead he hand be all red too be it paint no of course it be not paint it be blood and then he come down here and go to sleep poor father so tired he be not poor father he be not father at all he be a murderer and it be very wicked of you to call he father say the boy father mutter the girl rebelliously you know the sixth commandment say ` thou shalt do no murder ' and he have do murder so he 'll go to hell and you 'll go to hell too if you call he father it be all in the bible the boy end vaguely but the little girl be quite overcome by the thought of she badness oh i be wicked she cry and i do so want to go to heaven she have a stout and materialistic belief in it as a place of sheeted angel and harp where it be easy to be good you must do as i tell you then he say because i know i have learn all about it at school and you never tell I say she reproachfully ah there be lot of thing i know he reply nod he head what must we do say the girl meekly shall i go and ask mother the boy be sick at she obstinacy mother 's dead i tell you that mean she can not hear anything it be no use talk to she but i know you must stop here and if father wake you run out of the house and call ` police ' and i will go now and tell a policeman now and what happen then she ask with round eye at she brother 's wisdom oh they come and take he away to prison and then they put a rope round he neck and hang he like haman and he go to hell wha-at do they kill he because he be a murderer they always do oh do not let 's tell they do not let 's tell they she scream shut up say the boy or he 'll wake up we must tell they or we go to hell -- both of we but he sister do not collapse at this awful threat as he expect though the tear be roll down she face do not let 's tell they she sob you be a horrid girl and you 'll go to hell say the boy in disgust but the silence be only break by she sobbing i tell you he kill mother dead you do not cry a bit for mother i do oh let 's ask mother let 's ask mother i know she will not want father to go to hell let 's ask mother mother 's dead and can not hear you stupid say the boy i keep on tell you come up and look they be both a little awed in mother 's room it be so quiet and mother look so funny and first the girl shout and then the boy and then they shout both together but nothing happen the echo make they frightened perhaps she be asleep the girl say so she brother pinch one of mother 's hand -- the white one not the red one -- but nothing happen so mother be dead have she go to hell whisper the girl no she be go to heaven because she be good only wicked people go to hell and now i must go and tell the policeman do not you tell father where i have go if he wake up or he 'll run away before the policeman come why so as not to go to hell say the boy with certainty and they go downstairs together the little mind of the girl be much perturb because she be so wicked what would mother say tomorrow if she have do wrong the boy put on he sailor hat in the hall you must go in there and watch he say nodding in the direction of the sitting-room i shall run all the way the door bang and she hear he step down the path and then everything be quiet she tiptoe into the room and sit down on the floor and look at the back of the chair in utter distress she could see she father 's elbow project on one side but nothing more for a instant she hope that he be not there -- hope that he have go -- but then terrify she know that this be a piece of extreme wickedness so she lay on the rough carpet sob hopelessly and see real and vicious devil of she brother 's imagine in all the corner of the room presently in she misery she remember a packet of acid-drop that lay in she pocket and draw they forth in a sticky mass which part from its paper with regret so she choke and suck she sweet at the same time and find they salt and tasteless ray be go a long time and she be a wicked girl who would go to hell if she do not do what he tell she those be she prevailing idea and presently there come a third ray have say that if she father wake up he would run away and not go to hell at all now if she wake he up -- she know this be dreadfully naughty but she mind cling to the idea obstinately you see father have always be so fond of mother and he would not like to be in a different place mother would not like it either she be always so sorry when father do not come home or anything and hell be a dreadful place full of thing she half convinced herself and start up but then there come a awful thought if she do this she would go to hell for ever and ever and all the other would be in heaven she hang there in suspense suck she sweet and puzzling it over with knit brow how can one be good she swing round and look in the dark corner by the piano but the devil be not there and then she run across the room to she father and shake he arm shout tremulously -- wake up father wake up the police be come and when the police come ten minute later accompany by a very proud and virtuous little boy they hear a small shrill voice cry despairingly -- the police father the police but father would not wake the biography of a superman o limèd soul that struggle to be free art more engage charle stephen dale the subject of my study be a dramatist and indeed something of a celebrity in the early year of the twentieth century that he should be already completely forget be by no means astonishing in a age that elect its great man with a charming indecision of touch the general prejudice against the grant of freehold have spread to the desire land of fame and where we profligate ancestor be willing to call a man great in perpetuity we with more shrewdness prefer to name he a genius for seven year we know that before that period may have expire fate will have grant we a sea-serpent with yet more coil with a yet more bewildering arrangement of marine and sunset tint and the conclusion of previous lease will enable we to grant he undisputed possession of parnassus if we ancestor be more generous they be certainly less discriminate and it can not be doubt that many of they go to they grave under the impression that it be possible for there to be more than one great man at a time we have alter all that for two year dale be a great man or rather the great man and it be probable that if he have not die he would have hold he position for a longer period when he death be announce although the notice of he life and work be of a flattering length the leaderwriter be not unnaturally aggrieved that he should have resign he post before the popular interest in he personality be exhaust the censor might do he best by prohibit the performance of all the play that the dead man have leave behind he but as the author neglect to express he view in they column and the common sense of they reader forbid the publication of interview with he the journal could draw but a poor satisfaction from condemn or uphold the official action dale 's regrettable absence reduce what might have be a agreeable clash of personality to a arid discussion on art the consequence be obvious the end of the week see the elevation of jame macintosh the great scotch comedian to the vacant post and dale be completely forget that this oblivion be merit in term of he work i be not prepare to admit that it be merit in term of he personality i indignantly wish to deny whatever dale may have be as a artist he be perhaps in spite of himself a man and a man moreover possess of many striking and unusual trait of character it be to the man dale that i offer this tribute spring from a old yorkshire family charle stephen dale be yet sufficient of a cockney to justify both he friend and he enemy in credit he with the celtic temperament nevertheless he be essentially a modern insomuch that he contempt for the writings of dead man surpass he dislike of live author to these two central influence we may trace most of the peculiarity that render he notorious and ultimately great thus while he celtic æstheticism permit he to eat nothing but raw meat because he mistrust alike the reek product of the manure-heap and the barbaric finger of cook it be surely he modernity that make he a agnostic because bishop sit in the house of lord smaller man might dislike vegetable and bishop without allow it to affect they conduct but dale be careful to observe that every slightest conviction should have its place in the formation of he character conversely he be nothing without a reason these may seem small thing to which to trace the motive force of a man 's life but if we add to they a third find where the truth about a man not infrequently lie in the rag-bag of he enemy we material will be nearly complete dale hate he fellow-human - being write some anonymous scribbler and even express thus baldly the statement be not wholly false but he hate they because of they imperfection and it would be truer to say that he love of humanity amount to a positive hatred of individual and _ pace _ the critic the love be no less sincere than the hatred he have draw from the mental confusion of the darker german philosopher a image of the perfect man -- a image differ only in inessential from the idol worship by the imperialist as efficiency he do not find -- it be hardly likely that he would find -- that he contemporary fulfil this perfect conception and he therefore feel it necessary to condemn they for the possession of those weakness or as some would prefer to say quality of which the sum be human nature i now approach a quality or rather the lack of a quality that be in itself of so debatable a character that be it not of the utmost importance in consider the life of charle stephen dale i should prefer not to mention it i refer to he complete lack of a sense of humor the consciousness of which deficiency go so far to detract from he importance as a artist and a man the difficulty which i mention above lie in the fact that while every one have a clear conception of what they mean by the phrase no one have yet succeed in define it satisfactorily here i would venture to suggest that it be a kind of magnificent sense of proportion a sense that relate the infinite greatness of the universe to the finite smallness of man and draw the inevitable conclusion as to the importance of we joy and sorrow and labor i be aware that this definition err on the side of vagueness but possibly it may be find to include the truth obviously the nature of those who possess this sense will tend to be static rather than dynamic and it be therefore against the limit impose by this sense that intellectual anarchist among whom i would number dale and poet primarily rebel but -- and it be this rather than he undoubted intellectual gift or he dogmatic definition of good and evil that definitely separate dale from the normal man -- there can be no doubt that he feel he lack of a sense of humor bitterly in every word he ever say in every line he ever write i detect a painful strive after this mysterious sense that enable he neighbor fool as he undoubtedly think they to laugh and weep and follow the faith of they heart without conscious realisation of they own existence and the problem it induce by dint of study and strenuous observation he achieve as any man may achieve a considerable degree of wit though to the last he ignorance of the audience whom he serve and despise prevent he from judge the effect of he sally without experiment but try as he might the finer jewel lay far beyond he reach strong man fight themselves when they can find no fitter adversary but in all the history of literature there be no stranger spectacle than this lifelong contest between dale the intellectual anarch and pioneer of superman and dale the poor lonely devil who wonder what make people happy i have say that the struggle be lifelong but it must be add that it be always unequal the knowledge that in he secret heart he desire this quality the imperfection of imperfection only serve to make dale 's attack on the complacency of he contemporary more bitter he ridicule they achievement they ambition and they love with a fury that awaken in they a mild curiosity but by no means affect they comfort moreover the very vehemence with which he demand they contempt deprive he of much of he force as a critic for they justly wonder why a man should waste he lifetime in attack they if they be indeed so worthless actually they feel dale be a great deal more engage with he audience than many of the imaginative writer whom he affect to despise for they sycophancy and especially towards the end of he life when he power perhaps be weaken the device which he use to arouse the irritation of he contemporary become more and more childishly artificial less and less effective he be like one of those actor who feel that they can not hold the attention of they audience unless they be always do something though nothing be more monotonous than mannered vivacity dale then be a man who be very anxious to be modern but at the same time have not wholly succeed in conquer he æesthetic sense he have constitute himself high priest of the most puritanical and remote of all creed yet there be that in he blood that rebel ceaselessly against the intellectual limit he have voluntarily accept the result in term of art be chaos possess of a intellect of great analytic and destructive force he be almost entirely lack in imagination and he be therefore unable to raise he work to a plane in which the mutually combative element of he nature might have be reconcile he light moment of envy anger and vanity pass into the crucible to come forth unchanged he lack the magic wand and he work never take wing above he conception it be in vain to seek in any of he play or novel tract or preface for the product of inspiration the divine gift that enable one man to write with the common pen of humanity he could only employ he curiously perfect technique in reproduce the wayward flash of a mind incapable of consecutive thought he never attempt -- and this be a hard say -- to produce any work beautiful in itself while the confusion of he mind and the vanity that never allow he to ignore the effect he work might produce on he audience prevent he from give clear expression to he creed he work will appeal rather to the student of man than to the student of art and wantonly incoherent though it often be must be hold to constitute a remarkable human document it be strange to reflect that among he contemporary admirer dale be credit with a intellect of unusual clarity for the examination of any of he play impress one with the number and mutual destructiveness of he motive for artistic expression a note debater he make frequent use of the device of attack the weakness of the other man 's speech rather than the weakness of the other man 's argument he prose be good though at its best so impersonal that it recall the manner of a exceptionally well-written lead article at its worst it be mar by numerous vulgarity and error of taste not always it be to be fear intentional he attitude on this point be typical of he strange blindness to the necessity of a pure artistic ideal he commit these extravagance he would say in order to irritate he audience into a condition of mental alertness as a matter of fact he generally make he reader more sorry than angry and he do not realize that even if he have be successful it be but a poor reward for the wanton spoiling of much good work he proclaim himself to be above criticism but he be only too often beneath it revolt against the dignity not infrequently pompous of he fellow-man of letter he play the part of clown with more enthusiasm than skill it be intellectual arrogance in a clever man to believe that he can play the fool with success merely because he wish it there be no need for I to enter into detail with regard to dale 's personal appearance the caricaturist do he rather more than justice the photographer rather less in he younger day he suggest a gingerbread man that have be leave too long in the sun towards the end he affect a culture and elaborate ruggedness that make he look like a duke or a market gardener like most clever man he have good eye nor be it my purpose to add more than a word to the publish account of he death there be something strangely pitiful in that last desperate effort to achieve humor we have all read the account of he own death that he dictate from the sick-bed -- cold epigrammatic and alas characteristically lack in taste and once more it be he fate to make we rather sorry than angry in the third scene of the second act of henry v a play write by a author whom dale pretend to despise dame quickly describe the death of falstaff in word that be too well know to need quotation it be thus and no otherwise that dale die it be thus that every man die blue blood he sit in the middle of the great café with he head support on he hand miserable even to bitterness inwardly he curse the ancestor who have leave he little but a great name and a small and ridiculous body he think of he father whose expensive eccentricity have amuse he fellow-countryman at the cost of he fortune he mother for whom death have be a blessing he grandparent and he uncle in whom no man have find any good but most of all he curse himself for whose folly even heredity might not wholly account he recall the school where he have make no friend the university where he have take no degree since he have leave oxford he aimless hopeless life profligate but dishonourable perhaps only by accident have deprive even he title of any social value and one by one he very acquaintance have leave he to the society of broken man and the woman who be anything but light and these and here perhaps the root of he bitterness lay even these recognize he only as a victim for they mockery a thing more poor than themselves whereon they could satisfy the anger of they tortured soul and he last misery lay in this : that he himself could find no day in he life to admire no one past dream to cherish no inmost corner of he heart to love the lowest tramp the least-heeded waif of the night might have some ultimate pride but he himself have nothing nothing whatever he be a dream-pauper a emotional bankrupt with a choke sob he drain he brandy and tell the waiter to bring he another there have be a period in he life when he have be able to find some measure of sentimental satisfaction in the stupor of drunkenness in those day through the veil of illusion which alcohol have fling across he brain he have be able to regard the contempt of the man as the intimacy of friendship the scorn of the woman as the laughter of light love but now drink give he nothing but the mordant insight of morbidity which cut through he rotten soul like cheese yet night after night he come to this place to be tortured afresh by the ridicule of the sordid frequenter and by the careless music of the orchestra which tell he of a flowerless spring and of a morning which hold for he no hope for he last emotion rest in this self-inflicted pain he could only breathe freely under the lash of he own contempt idly he let he dull eye stray about the room from table to table from face to face many there he know by sight from none could he hope for sympathy or even companionship in he bitterness he envy the courage of the coward who be brave enough to seek oblivion or punishment in death drop he eye to he soft unlovely hand he marvel that anything so useless should throb with life and yet he realize that he be afraid of physical pain terrify at the thought of death there be dim ancestor of he whose valor have thrill the song of minstrel and make he name lovely in the glowing folly of battle but now he know that he be a coward and even in the knowledge he could find no comfort it be not give to every man to hate himself gladly the music and the laughter beat on he sullen brain with a mock insistence and he tremble with impotent anger at the apparent happiness of humanity why should these people be merry when he be miserable what right have the orchestra to play a chorus of triumph over the stinging emblem of he defeat he drink brandy after brandy vainly seek to dull the nausea of disgust which have stricken he worn nerve but the adulterated spirit merely madden he brain with the vision of new depths of horror while he body lay below a mean detestable thing have he known how to pray he would have beg that something might snap but no man may win to faith by means of hatred alone and he heart be cold as the marble table against which he lean there be no more hope in the world when he come out of the café the air of the night be so pure and cool on he face and the light of the square be so tender to he eye that for a moment he harsh mood be soften and in that moment he seem to see among the crowd that flock by a beautiful face a face touch with pearl and the inner leaf of pink rosebud he lean forward eagerly christine he cry christine then the illusion pass and smite by the anger of the pitiless star he see that he be look upon a mere woman a woman of the earth he flee from she smile with a shudder as he go it seem to he that the sway house buffet he about as a child might play with a ball sometimes they throw he against man who curse he and bruise he soft body with they fist sometimes they trip he up and hurl he upon the stone of the pavement still he hold on till the embankment break before he with the sudden peace of space and he lean against the parapet panting and sick with pain but free from the tyranny of the house beneath he the river roll towards the sea reticent but more alive it seem than the deeply painful thing which fate have attach to he brain he picture himself tangle in the dark perplexity of its water he fancy they fall upon he face like a girl 's hair till they darken he eye and choke the mouth which even now could not breathe fast enough to satisfy he the thought displeased he and he turn away from the place that hold peace for other man but not for he from the shadow of one of the seat a woman 's voice reach he beg peevishly for money i have none he say automatically then he remember and fling coin all the money he have into she lap i give it to you because i hate you he shriek and hurry on lest she thanks should spoil he spite then the black house and the warped street have he in they grip once more and sport with he till he consciousness wax to one white-hot point of pain overhead the star be laugh quietly in the field of space and sometimes a policeman or a chance passer-by look curiously at he lurch figure but he only know that life be hurt he beyond endurance and that he yet endure up and down the ice-cold corridor of he brain think formless and timeless pass like a rodent flame now he be the universe a vast thing loathsome with agony now he be a speck of dust a atom whose infinite torment be imperceptible even to god always there be something -- something conscious of the intolerable evil call life something that cry bitterly to be uncreated always while he soul beat against the bar he body stagger along the street a thing helpless unguided there be a hour before dawn when tire man and woman die and with the come of this hour he spirit find a strange release from pain once more he realize that he be a man and bruise and weary as he be he try to collect the lose thread of reason which the night have tear from he face he he see a vast building dimly outline against the darkness and in some way it serve to touch a faint memory in he die brain for a while he wander amongst the shadow and then he know that it be the keep of a castle he castle and that high up where a window shone upon the night a girl be wait for he a girl with a face of pearl and rose presently she come to the window and look out dress all in white for she love 's sake he stand up in he armor and flash he sword towards the envy star it be i my love he cry i be here and there before the dawn have make the shadow of the law court gray they find he bruise and muddy and daubed with blood without the sword and spur of he honor lack the scented token of he love a thing in no way tragic for here be no misfortune but merely the conclusion of nature 's remorseless logic for century after century those of he name have live sheltered by the prowess of they ancestor from the trivial hardship and affliction that make we man and now he lay on the pavement stiff and cold a babe that have cry itself to sleep because it could not understand silent until the morning fate and the artist the workman 's dwelling stand in the northwest of london in quaint rivalry with the comfortable ugliness of the maida vale block of flat they be fairly new and very well build with wide stone staircase that echo all day to the impatient footstep of child and with a flat roof that serve at once as a playground for they and a drying-ground for they mother ' wash in hot weather it be pleasant enough to play hide-and-seek or follow-my-leader up and down the long alley of cool white linen and if a sudden gust of wind or some unexpected turn of the game set the wet sheet flap in the child 's face they sens be rather tickled than annoyed to george moon in a corner of the railing that seem to keep all london in a cage these game be hardly more important than the shouting and whistling that rise from the street below it seem to he that all he life -- he have live eleven year -- he have be stand in a corner watch other people engage in meaningless ploy and antic the sun be hot and yet the child run about and make themselves hotter and he wonder as when he have be in bed with one of he frequent illness he have wonder at the grown-up folk who come and go move they arm and leg and speak with they mouth when it be possible to lie still and quiet and feel the moment tick themselves off in one 's forehead as he rest in he corner he be conscious of the sharp edge of the narrow stone ledge on which he be sit and the thin iron railing that press into he back he smell the evil smell of hot london and the soapy odour of the wash he see the glitter of the dust and the noise of the place beat harshly upon he ear but he could find no meaning in it all life speak to he with a hundred tongue and all the while he be longing for silence to the older inhabitant of the tenement he seem a morbid little boy unhappily too delicate for sense to be safely knock into he he fellow-child would have ignore he completely if he have not have strange fancy that make interesting story and sometimes inspire game on the whole george be lonely without know what loneliness mean all day long the voice of london throb up beyond the bar and george would regard the chimney and the housetops and the section of lively street that fall within he range with he small keen eye and wonder why the world do not forthwith crumble into silent peaceful dust instead of groan and quiver in continual unrest but when twilight fall and the child be tire of play they would gather round he in he corner by the tank and ask he to tell they story this tank be large and open and held rain water for the use of the tenant and originally it have be cut off from the rest of the roof by some special railing of its own but two of the railing have be break and now the child could creep through and sit round the tank at dusk like eastern villager round the village well and george would tell they story -- queer story with twisted face and broken back that dance and caper merrily enough as a rule but sometimes stand quite still and make horrible grimace the child like the cheerful moral story better such as arthur 's boot once upon a time george would begin there be a boy call arthur who live in a house like this and always tie he bootlace with knot instead of bow one night he stand on the roof and wish he have wing like a sparrow so that he could fly away over the house and a great wind begin so that everybody say there be a storm and suddenly arthur find he have a little pair of wing and he fly away with the wind over the house and presently he get beyond the storm to a quiet place in the sky and arthur look up and see all the star tie to heaven with little bit of string and all the string be tie in bow and this be do so that god could pull the string quite easily when he want to and let the star fall on fine night you can see they drop arthur think that the angel must have very neat finger to tie so many bow but suddenly while he be look he foot begin to feel heavy and he stoop down to take off he boot but he could not untie the knot quick enough and soon he start fall very fast and while he be fall he hear the wind in the telegraph wire and the shout of the boy who sell papers in the street and then he fall on the top of a house and they take he to the hospital and cut off he leg and give he wooden one instead but he could not fly any more because they be too heavy for day afterwards all the child would tie they bootlace in bow sometimes they would all look into the dark tank and george would tell they about the splendid fish that live in its depths if the tank be only half full he would whisper to the fish and the child would hear its indistinct reply but when the tank be full to the brim he say that the fish be too happy to talk and he would describe the beauty of its appearance so vividly that all the child would lean over the tank and strain they eye in a desperate effort to see the wonderful fish but no one ever see it clearly except george though most of the child think they have see its tail disappear in the shadow at one time or another it be doubtful how far the child believe he story probably not have acquire the habit of examine evidence they be content to accept idea that throw a pleasant glamour on life but the come of jimmy simpson alter this agreeable condition of mind jimmy be one of those masterful stupid boy who excel at game and physical contest and triumph over intellectual problem by sheer braggart ignorance from the first he regard george with contempt and when he hear he tell he story he do not conceal he disbelief it be a lie he say there be not no fish in the tank i have see it i tell you say george jimmy spat on the asphalt rudely i bet no one else have he say george look round he audience but they eye do not meet he they feel that they might have be mistake in believe that they have see the tail of the fish and jimmy be a very good man with he fist liar say jimmy at last triumphantly and walk away be masterful he lead the other with he and george brooded by the tank for the rest of the evening in solitude next day george go up to jimmy confidently i be right about the fish he say i dream about it last night rot say jimmy dream be only made-up thing they do not mean anything george creep away sadly how could he convince such a man all day long he worry over the problem and he wake up in the middle of the night with it throb in he brain and suddenly as he lay in he bed doubt come to he suppose he have be wrong suppose he have never see the fish at all this be not to be bear he creep quietly out of the flat and tiptoe upstairs to the roof the stone be very cold to he foot there be so many thing in the tank that at first george could not see the fish but at last he see it gleam below the moon and the star larger and even more beautiful than he have say i know i be right he whisper as he creep back to bed in the morning he be very ill meanwhile blue day succeed blue day and while the water grow lower in the tank the child with jimmy for leader have almost forget the boy who have tell they story now and again one or other of they would say that george be very very ill and then they would go on with they game no one look in the tank now that they know there be nothing in it till it occur one day to jimmy that the dry weather should have bring final confirmation of he scepticism leave he comrade at the long jump he go to george 's neglect corner and peep into the tank sure enough it be almost dry and he nearly shout with surprise in the shallow pool of sooty water there lay a large fish dead but still gleam with rainbow color jimmy be strong and stupid but not ill-natured and recall george 's illness it occur to he that it would be a decent thing to go and tell he he be right he run downstairs and knock on the door of the flat where george live george 's big sister open it but the boy be too excite to see that she eye be wet oh miss he say breathlessly tell george he be right about the fish i have see it myself georgy 's dead say the girl the great man to the people who do not write it must seem odd that man and woman should be willing to sacrifice they life in the endeavor to find new arrangement and combination of word with which to express old thought and older emotion yet that be not a unfair statement of the task of the literary artist word -- symbol that represent the noise that human being make with they tongue and lip and tooth -- lie within we grasp like the fragment of a jig-saw puzzle and we fit they into faulty picture until we hand grow weary and we eye can no longer pretend to see the truth in order to illustrate a infinitesimal fraction of we life by means of this preposterous game we be willing to sacrifice all the rest while ordinary efficient man and woman be enjoy the promise of the morning the fulfilment of the afternoon the tranquillity of evening we be still try to discover a fitting epithet for the dew of dawn for we spring pave the wood with beautiful word rather than flower and when we look into the eye of we mistress we see nothing but adjective love be a occasion for song death but the overburdened father of all we saddest phrase we be of those who be bear cry into the world because they can not speak and we end like stevenson by look forward to we death because we have write a good epitaph sometimes in the course of we frequent descent from heaven to the waste-paper basket we feel that we lose too much to accomplish so little do a handful of love-song really outweigh the smile of a pretty girl or a hardly-written romance compensate the author for month of lose adventure we have only one life to live and we spend the greater part of it write the history of dead hour we life lack balance because we find it hard to discover a mean between the triolet we write last i night and the big book we be go to start tomorrow and also because live only with we head we tend to become top-heavy we justify we present discomfort with the promise of a bright future of flower and sunshine and gladdest life though we know that in the garden of art there be many chrysalis and few butterfly few of we be fortunate enough to accomplish anything that be in the least worth do so we fall back on the arid philosophy that it be effort alone that count luckily -- or suicide would be the rule rather than the exception for artist -- the long process of disillusionment be break by hour when even the most self-critical feel nobly and indubitably great and this be the only reward that most artist ever have for they labor if we set a higher price on art than money on the whole i be incline to think that the artist be fully reward for the common man can have no conception of the joy that be to be find in belong though but momentarily and illusively to the aristocracy of genius to find the just word for all we emotion to realize that we most trivial thought be illimitably creative to feel that it be we lot to keep life 's gladdest promise to see the great soul of man and woman steadfast in existence as star in a windless pool -- these indeed be no ordinary pleasure moreover these hour of we illusory greatness endow we in they pass with a melancholy that be not taint with bitteress we have nothing to regret we be in truth the richer for we rare adventure we have be permit to explore the ultimate possibility of we nature and if we might not keep this newly-discovered territory at least we do not return from we travels with empty hand something of the glamour linger something perhaps of the wisdom and it be with a heighten passion a fiercer enthusiasm that we set ourselves once more to we life-long task of chalk pink salmon and pinker sunset on the pavement of the world i once meet a englishman in the forest that start outside brussels and stretch for a long day 's journey across the hill we find a little café under the tree and sit in the sun talk about modern english literature all the afternoon in this way we discover that we have a common standpoint from which we judge work of art though we judgment differ pleasantly and provide we with material for agreeable discussion by the time we have divide three bottle of gueze lambic the noble beer of belgium we have already sketch out a scheme for the ideal literary newspaper in other word we have achieve friendship when the afternoon grow suddenly cold the englishman lead I off to tea at he house which be half-way up the hill out of woluwe it be one of those modern country cottage that belgian architect steal openly and without shame from they english confreres we be meet at the garden gate by he daughter a dark-haired girl of fifteen or sixteen so unreasonably beautiful that she make a disillusioned scribbler feel like a sad line out of one of the saddest poem of franci thompson in my mind i christen she monica because i do not like she real name the house with its old furniture its library where the choice of book be clearly dictate by individual prejudice and affection and its unambitious parade of domestic happiness heighten my melancholy while tea be be prepared monica show I the garden only a few daffodil and crocus be in bloom but she lead I to the rise garden and tell I that in the summer she could pick a great basket of rose every day i picture monica to myself gather she rose on a breathless summer afternoon and return to the house feeling like a batten version of the reverend laurence sterne i know that i have gather all my rose and i think regretfully of the chill loneliness of the world that lay beyond the limit of this paradise this mood linger with I during tea and it be not till that meal be over that the miracle happen i do not know whether it be the englishman or he wife that work the magic : or perhaps it be monica nibble speculation with she sharp white tooth but at all event i be lead with delicate diplomacy to talk about myself and i presently realize that i be perform the grateful labor really well my word be warm into life by a eloquence that be not ordinarily mine my adjective be neither commonplace nor far-fetched my adverb fall into they socket with a sob of joy i speak of myself with a noble sympathy a compassion so intense that it seem divinely altruistic and gradually as the spirit of creation wake in my blood i reveal tremble between a natural sensitiveness and a generous abandonment of restraint the inner life of a man of genius i pass lightly by he misunderstand childhood to concentrate my sympathy on the literary struggle of he youth i speak of the ignoble environment the material hardship the masterpiece write at night to be condemn in the morning the song of he heart that be too great for he immature voice to sing and all the while i bade they watch the fire of he faith burn with a constant and quenchless flame i trace the development of he power and instance some of he poem my poem which i recite so well that they sound to I and i swear to they also like stave from a angelic hymn-book i ask they compassion for the man who have such thing in he heart be compel to waste he hour in sordid journalistic labor so by degree i bring they to the present time when fatigue by a world that would not acknowledge the truth of he message the man of genius be prepare to retire from life in order to devote himself to the composition of five or six masterpiece i describe these masterpiece to they in outline with a suggestive detail dash in here and there to show how they would be finish nothing be easier than to describe unwritten literary masterpiece in outline but by that time i have thoroughly convinced my audience and myself and we look upon these thing as complete book the atmosphere be charge with the spirit of high endeavor of wonderful accomplishment i hear the englishman breathing deeply and through the dusk i be aware of the eye of monica the wide vague eye of a young girl in which youth can find exactly what it please it be a good thing to be great once or twice in we life and that night i be wise enough to depart before the inevitable anti-climax at the gate the englishman press I warmly by the hand and beg I to honor he house with my presence again he wife echo the wish and monica look at I with those vacant eye that but a few year ago i would have charge with the wine of my song as i stand in the tram on my way back to brussels i feel like a man recover from a terrible debauch and i know that the brief hour of my pride be over to return perhaps no more work be impossible to a man who have express considerably more than he have to express so i go into a café where there be a string band to play sentimental music over the corpse of my genius chance take I to a table preside over by a waiter i singularly detest and the last ember of my greatness enable I to order my drink in a voice so passionate that he look at I aghast and flee by the time he return with my hock the tale be finish and i try to buy he toleration with a enormous _ pourboire _ no i will return to that house on the hill above woluwe no more not even to see monica standing on tiptoe to pick she rose for i have leave a giant 's robe hanging on a peg in the hall and i would not have those amiable people see how utterly incapable i be of fill it under normal condition i feel besides a kind of sentimental tenderness for this illusion fate to have so short a life i be no herod to slaughter baby and it please I to think that it linger yet in that delightful house with the book and the old furniture and monica even though i myself shall probably never see it again even though the englishman watch the publisher ' announcement for the masterpiece that will never appear a wet day as we grow older it become more and more apparent that we moment be the ghost of old moment we day but pale repetition of day that we have know in the past it might almost be say that after a certain age we never meet a stranger or win to a new place the palace of we soul grow larger let we hope with the year be haunt by little memory that creep out of corner to peep at we wistfully when we be most sure that we be alone sometimes we can not hear the voice of the present for the whispering of the past sometimes the room be so full of ghost that we can hardly breathe and yet it be often difficult to find the significance of these dead day restore to we to disturb we sense of pass time why have we mind keep secret these trivial record so many year to give they to we at last when they have no apparent consequence perhaps it be only that we be not clever enough to read the riddle perhaps these trifle that we have remember unconsciously year after year be in truth the tremendous force that have make we life what they be stand at the window this morning and watch the rain i suddenly become conscious of a wet morning long ago when i stand as i stand now and see the drop slide one after another down the steamy pane i be a boy of eight year old dress in a sailor suit and with my hair clip quite short like a french boy 's and my right knee be stiff with a half-healed cut where i have fall on the gravel path under the schoolroom window it be a really wet gray day i could hear the rain drip from the fir-tree on to the scullery roof and every now and then a gust of wind drive the rain down on the soaked lawn with a noise like break surf i could hear the water gurgle in the pipe that be hide by the ivy and i see with interest that one of the path be flood so that a canal run between the standard rise bush and recall picture of venice i think it would be nice if it rain truly hard and flood the house so that we should all have to starve for three week and then be rescue excitingly in boat but i have not really any hope behind I in the schoolroom my two brother be play chess but have not yet start quarrel and in a corner my little sister be patiently beat a doll there be a fire in the grate but it be one of those sombre smoky fire in which it be impossible to take any interest the clock on the mantelpiece tick very slowly and i realize that a eternity of these long seconds separate I from dinner-time i think i would like to go out the enterprise present certain difficulty and danger but none that could not be surpass i would have to steal down to the hall and get my boot and waterproof on unobserved i would have to open the front door without make too much noise for the other door be well guard by underling and i would have to run down the front drive under the eye of many window once beyond the gate i would be safe for the wetness of the day would secure I from dangerous encounter walk in the rain would be pleasant than stay in the dull schoolroom where life remain unchanged for a quarter of a hour at a time and i remember that there be a little wood near we house in which i have never be when it be rain hard perhaps i would meet the magician for whom i have look so often in vain on sunny day for it be quite likely that he prefer walk in bad weather when no one else be about it would be nice to hear the drop of rain fall on the roof of the tree and to be quite warm and dry underneath perhaps the magician would give I a magic wand and i would do thing like the conjurer last christmas certainly i would be punish when i get home for even if i be not miss they would see that my boot be muddy and that my waterproof be wet i would have no pudding for dinner and be send to bed in the afternoon : but these thing have happen to I before and though i have not like they at the time they do not seem very terrible in retrospect and life be so dull in the schoolroom that wet morning when i be eight year old and yet i do not go out but stand hesitate at the window while with every gust earth seem to fling back its curl of rain from its shine forehead to stand on the brink of adventure be interesting in itself and now that i could think over the detail of my expedition be no longer bore so i stay dream till the golden moment for action be pass and a violent exclamation from one of the chess-player call I back to a prosaic world in a second the board be overturn and the player be lock in battle my little sister who have already the feminine craving for tidiness creep out of she corner and meekly gather the chessman from under the foot of the combatant i have see it all before and while i lead my force to the aid of the brother with whom at the moment i have some sort of alliance i reflect that i would have do better to dare the adventure and set forth into the rainy world and this morning when i stand at my window and my memory a little cruelly restore to this vision of a day long dead i be still of the same opinion oh i should have put on my boot and my waterproof and go down to the little wood to meet the enchanter he would have give I the cap of invisibility the purse of fortunatus and a pair of seven-league boot he would have teach I to conquer world and to leave the easy triumph of dreamer to madmen philosopher and poet he would have make I a man of action a statesman a soldier a founder of city or a digger of grave for there be two kind of man in the world when we have put aside the minor distinction of shape and color there be the man who do thing and the man who dream about they no man can be both a dreamer and a man of action and we be call upon to determine what rôle we shall play in life when we be too young to know what to do i do not believe that it be a mere wantonness of memory that preserve the image of that hour with such affectionate detail where so many brighter and more eventful hour have disappear for ever it seem to I likely enough that that moment of hesitation before the schoolroom window determine a habit of mind that have keep I dream ever since for all my life i have prefer think to action i have never run to the little wood i have never meet the enchanter and so this morning when fate play I this trick and my dream be chill for a instant by the icy breath of the past i do not rush out into the street of life and lay about I with a flaming sword no i pick up my pen and write some word on a piece of paper and lull my shocked sens with the tranquillity of the idlest dream of all end of the project gutenberg ebook of the ghost ship by richard middleton
