overwhelm its spiritual ascendancy in the first year of triumph its vitality have wane under the stress of riches then beneath lassitude and the slow decrease of power the prophet mahomet be at once the glory and bane of he people the source of they strength and the mainspring of they weakness he represent more effectively than any other religious teacher the sum of he follower ' spiritual and worldly idea he position in religion and philosophy be substantially the position of all he follower none have progress beyond the primary thesis he give to the arabian world at the close of he career he close a long line of semi-divine teacher and monitor after he the curtain of heaven close and its glory be veil from man 's eye he be the last great man who impose enthusiasm for a idea upon countless number of he fellow-creature so that whole tribe fight and die at he bidding and at the command of god through he now that the vital history of islam have be write some decision as to the position and achievement of its founder may be formulate mahomet conceive the office of prophet to be the result of a irresistible divine call verily the angel gabriel appear to he command he to arise and warn he be the vehicle through whom the will of allah be reveal the inspired character of he rule be the prime factor in its prevail by virtue of he heavenly authority he exercise he sway over the religious action of he follower they aspiration and they belief in order to promulgate the divine ordinance the kuran be send down inspire directly by the angel gabriel at the bidding of the lord upon all matter of belief and upon all other matter deal with however cursorily in the kuran mahomet speak with the power of god himself upon matter not within the scope of religion or of the sacred book he be only a human and fallible counsellor i be no more than man when i order you anything with respect to religion receive it and when i order you about the affair of the world then be i nothing more than man there be no question of he equality with the godhead or even of he share any part of the divine nature he be simply the instrument endowed with a power and authority outside himself a man who possess one cardinal thesis which all those within he faith must accept the idea which represent at once the scope of he teaching and the source of he triumph be the unity and indivisibility of the godhead this be the sole contribution he have make to the progressive thought of the world though he come later in time than the culture of greece and rome he never know they philosophy or the sum of they knowledge he religion could never he build upon such basic strength as christianity it spring too rapidly into prominence and have no foundation of slowly develop idea upon which to rest both its enthusiasm and its earthly endeavor mahomet bear closer resemblance to the ancient hebrew prophet than to any christian leader or saint he mind be akin to theirs in its denunciatory fury its prostration before the might and majesty of a single god the evolution of the tribal deity from the local wonderworker whose shrine enclose he image to the impersonal and distant but awful power who hold the earth beneath he sway be mahomet 's contribution to the mental development of he country and the achievement within those confines be wonderful but to the sum of the world 's thought he give little he central tenet have already gain its votary in other land and moreover they form of belief in one god be such that further development of thought be still possible to they the philosophy of islam block the way of evolution for itself because its system leave no room for such pregnant idea as divine incarnation divine immanence the fatherhood of god it have be content to formulate one article of faith : there be no god but god the corollary as to mahomet 's divine appointment to the office of prophet be merely a affirmation of loyalty to the particular mode of faith he impose therefore the part take by islam in the reading of the world 's mystery cease with the acceptance of that previously conceive central tenet in the sphere of idea indeed mahomet give he people nothing original for he power do not lie in intellect but in action he mind have not pass the stage that have just exchange many fetish for one spiritual god still to be propitiate not alone by sacrifice but by prayer ceremony and praise in the world of action lay the strength of islam and the genius of its founder it be therefore in the impress it make upon event and not in its theology and philosophy that its secret be to be find but besides the acceptance of one god as lord islam force upon its devotee a still more potent idea whose influence be feel both in the sphere of thought and action as a outcome of its political and military need mahomet create and establish its unassailable belief in fatality -- not the fatalism of cause and effect bearing within itself the essence of a reason too vast for humanity to comprehend but the fatalism of a omnipotent and capricious power inherent in the mahomedan conception of god with this mighty and irresponsible be nothing can prevail before every event the result of it be irrevocably decree mankind can alter no tiniest detail of he destine lot the idea correspond with mahomet 's vision of god -- a awful incomprehensible deity who dwell perpetually in the terror of earth not in its gentleness and compassion the doctrine of fatalism prove islam 's greatest asset during its first hard year of struggle for it give to its battlefield the glory of god 's surveillance : death be a favor to a muslim but with prosperity and conquest come inaction then fatalism out of the weakening of endurance create the pessimism of islam 's later year be philosophically uncreative it descend into the sloth of those who believe without exercise of reason or will in the uselessness of effort before islam decay into inertia it have experience a fierce and flaming life the impulse bestow upon it by its founder operate chiefly in the religious world and indirectly in the realm of political and military power how far the religion of islam be indebted to mahomet 's knowledge of the jewish and christian system become clear upon a study of the kuran and the muslim institution that mahomet be familiar with jewish scripture and tradition be beyond doubt the middle portion of the kuran be fill to the point of weariness with reiteration of jewish legend and hero-myth it be evident that mahomet take the god of the jew to be he own deity combine in he conception also the traditional connection of jehovah and he chosen people with the ancient faith and ceremony of mecca purge of they idolatry from the jew he take he belief in the might and terror of the lord and the admonitory character of he mission from they also he take the separatist nature of he creed the jewish teacher postulate a religion distinct from every other belief self-sufficient owning no interpreter save the law and the scripture mahomet conceive himself also as the sole vehicle during he lifetime and after he death for the command of the most high he aim at the superseding of rabbinical power and hope to win the jew into recognition of himself as successor to they own teacher and prophet but he claim be meet by a unyielding reliance upon the complete law if the jewish religion have reject a redeemer from among its own people it be impossible that it should accept a leader from a alien and despise race mahomet finding coalition impossible give free play to he separatist instinct so that in this respect and also in its fundamental conception of the deity as well as in its reliance upon inspired scripture and oral tradition mahomedanism approximate to the jewish system it miss the influence of a immemorial history and receive no help in its campaign of warfare from the traditional glory of long line of warrior king chief of all it lack the inspiration of the matchless jewish scripture and sacred book depend for instruction upon a document confine to the revelation of one man 's personality and view of life still the narrowness of the mahomedan system provoke its power its rapid rush to the height of dominion be bear of the straitening of its impulse into the channel of conquest and the forcible imposition of its faith of christianity mahomet know far less than of judaism he go to the christian doctrine as they be know in heterodox syrium far off from the main stream of christian life and teaching he go to they with a prejudiced mind full of anger against they exponent for declare the messiah to be the son of god the whole idea of the incarnation and the dogma of the trinity be thoroughly abhorrent to he and the only conception he entertain as to the personality of jesus be that of a prophet even as he be himself the receiver of divine inspiration but have no connection in essence with god whom he conceive pre-eminently as the one supreme be indivisible in nature certainly he know far less of the christian than of the jewish scripture and necessarily less of the inner meaning of the christian faith still in fluid state unconsidered of its profoundest future exponent he mind be assuredly not attuned to the reception of its more revolutionary idea very little compassion and no tenderness breathe from the page of the kuran and from a religion whose founder have labor to bring just those two element into the thorny way of the world mahomet could only turn away baffle and uncomprehend the doctrine of the non-resistance to evil and indeed all the wisdom of the sermon on the mount he pass by unsee it be useless and indeed unfair to attempt the comparison of mahomedanism with christianity see that without the preliminary culture of greece and rome modern christian doctrine would not exist in they present form and of the former mahomet have no cognisance he stand altogether apart from the christian system find no affinity in its doctrine or practice scorn its monasticism no less than its conception of the trinity he position in history lie between the warrior and the saint at the head of the prophet who go flail in hand to summon to repentance but unlike the generality bearing also the sword and sceptre of a kingdom no other religious leader have ever bind he creed so closely to definite political conception mahomet be not only the instrument of divine revelation but he be also at the end of he life the head of a temporal state with minutest law and regulation -- chaotic it may be but still bind so that islamic influence extend over the whole of the life of its adherent this constitute its strength its leader sway not only the conviction but the activity of he subject he position with regard to the political institution of other country be unique he temporal power grow almost in spite of himself and he unconsciously adopt idea in connection with it which arise out of the circumstance involve any form of government except despotism be impossible among so heterogeneous and unruly a people despotism also bear out he own idea as to the nature of god 's governance political idea be largely build upon religious conception sometimes outstrip sometimes lag behind they but always with some irrefragable connection despotism therefore be the form best suit to islam and become its chief legacy to posterity since without the religious sanction islam politically could not exist together with despotism and inextricably mingle with it be the second great islamic enthusiasm -- the belief in the supremacy of force with violence the muslim kingdom be to be attain mahomet give to the battle lust of arabium the approval of he puissant deity bidding he follower put they supreme faith in the arbitrament of the sword he know too the value of diplomacy and the use of well-calculated treachery but chief of all he bid he follower arm themselves to seize by force what they could not obtain by cunning in the insistence upon these two factor complete obedience to he will as the revelation of allah 's decree and the justification of violence to proclaim the merit of he faith we gain the nearest approach to he character and belief for these together with he conception of fate be perhaps the most personal of all he institution mahomet have suffer not a little at the hand of he immediate successor they have seek to record the full sum of he personality and find the subject elude they as the translation of action into word must ever fall short of finality they have overload they narrative with minutest and almost always apocryphal detail which leave the main outline blur only two biography can be say to be in the nature of source that of muhammad ibn hischam write on the model of a earlier biography undertake about 760 for the abbasside caliph mansur and of wakidus write about 820 which be important as contain the text of many treaty make by mahomet with various tribe al-tabari too include the life of mahomet in he extensive history of arabium but he work serve only as a check consist as it do mainly of extract from wakidus by far the more valuable be the kuran and the sunna of tradition but even these be fragmentary and confused bearing upon they the ineradicable stamp of alien writer and much second-hand thought in the dim pregnant dawn of religion by the transfuse power of a great idea seize upon and make living by a single personality the world of imagination mingle with the world of fact as we perceive it the real be feel to be merely the frail shell of force more powerful and permanent legend and myth crowd in upon actual life as imperfect vehicle for the compelling demand make by that new idea for expression moreover personality that subtle essence exercise a kind of centripetal force attract not only the devotion but the imagination of those who come within its influence mahomet together with all the man of action in history possess a energy of will so vast as to bring forth the creative faculty of he adherent and the legend that cluster round he have a special significance as the measure of he personality and influence the story for instance of he midnight journey into the seven heaven be the symbol of a intense spiritual experience that follow the mental temper of the age in which he live have to be translate into the concrete all the affirmation as to he intercourse with djinn he inspiration by the angel gabriel be inherent factor in the manifestation of he ceaseless mental activity he marvellous birth and the myth of he childhood be the sum of he follower ' devotion and reveal they reverence translate into term of the imagination character be the mysterious force that he co-religionist try unconsciously to portray in all those legend relative to he life at medina he ruthlessness and cruelty find a place no less than he humility and steadfastness under discouragement but beneath the weight of the marvellous the real man be almost bury he have stand for so long with the mist of obscure imagining about he that he true lineament be almost impossible to reproduce the western world have alternate between the conception of he as a devil almost antichrist himself and a negligible impostor whose power be transient it have seldom trouble to look for the human energy that work out he success the faith that uphold they and the enthusiasm that burn in the prophet himself with a sombre flame light he follower to prayer and conquest and indeed it be difficult if not impossible to re-create effectively the world in which he live it be so remote from the sea of the world 's progression a eddy in the tide of belief which lose itself in the larger surge that it make no appeal of familiarity but that a study of the period and mahomet 's own personality operating no less through he deed faith and institution than in the one doubtfully reliable record of he teaching will result in the perception of the prophet of islam as a man among man have be the central belief during the writing of this biography mahomet 's personality be reveal in he deal with he fellow in the belief and ritual that he impose upon arabium in the mighty achievement of a political unity and military discipline and therein he show himself inexorable cruel passionate treacherous bad subject to depression and overwhelming doubt but never weak or purposeless continually the master of he circumstance whom no emergency find unprepared whose confidence in himself nothing could shake and who by virtue of enthusiasm and resistless activity wrest he triumph from the hand of he enemy and bequeath to he follower he own unconquerable faith and the means wherewith they might attain wealth and sovereignty chapter i mahomet 's birthplace and how many city be mightier in strength than thy city that have cast thee forth -- _ the kuran _ in arabia nature can not be ignore pasture and cornland mountain slope and quiet river may be admire even reverenced but they be thing external to the gaze and make no insistent demand upon the spirit for penetration of they mystery arabium and mecca as typical of arabium be a country govern by earth 's primal force it have not yet emerge from the shadow of that early world bare and chaotic where a blind sun pour down upon dusty mountain ridge and nothing be temperate or subdue it foster a race of man whose god be relentless and inscrutable reveal themselves seldom and dwelling in a fierce splendor beyond earthly knowledge to the spirit of a seeker for truth with sens alert to the outer world this country speak of boundless force and impel into activity under the spur of conviction by its very desolation it set its ineradicable mark upon the creed build up within it mahomet spend forty year in the city of mecca watch its temple service with he grandfather take part in its mercantile life learn something of christian and jewish doctrine through the varied multitude that throng its public place in the desert beyond the city boundary he wander search for inspiration wait dumbly in the darkness until the angel gabriel descend with rush of wing through the brightness of heaven commanding : cry aloud in the name of the lord who create thee o thou enwrap in thy mantle arise and warn mecca lie in a stony valley midway between yeman the bless and syrium in the midst of the western coast-chain of arabium which slope gradually towards the red sea the height of abu kobei overlook the eastern quarter of the town whence hill of granite stretch to the holy place mina and arafat enclose by the rampart of the jebel kora range beyond these mountain to the south lie taif with its glory of garden and fruit-tree but the luxuriance of taif find no counterpart on the western side mecca be barren and treeless its sandy stretch only break here and there by low hill of quartz or gneiss scrub-covered and dusty the sun beat upon the shelterless town until it become a great cauldron within its amphitheatre of hill during the greater pilgrimage the cauldron seethe with heat and humanity and surge over into mina and arafat in the daytime mecca be limitless heat and noise but under the star it have all the magic of a dream-city in a country of wide horizon the shadow of its ancient prosperity when it be the center of the caravan trade from yeman to syrium still hang about it in the year immediately before the birth of mahomet and the legend concern the founding of the city linger in the native mind hagar in she terrible journey through the desert reach mecca and lay she son in the midst of the valley to go on the hopeless quest for water the child kick the ground in torment and god be merciful so that from he heel mark arise a spring of clear water -- the well zemzem hallowed ever after by meccan in this desolate place part of the amalekite and tribe from yeman settle the child ishmael grow up amongst they and found he race by marry a daughter of the chief abraham visit he and under he guidance the native temple of the kaaba be build and dedicate to the true god but afterwards desecrate by the worship of idol within it such be the legend surround the foundation of mecca and of the kaaba of which as of the legend concern the early day of rome it may be say that they be chiefly interesting as throw light upon the character of the race which produce they in the case of mecca they be mainly the result of a unconscious desire to associate the city as far as possible with the most renowned hero of old time and also to conciliate the jewish element within arabium now firmly plant at medina kheibar and some of the adjoining territory by insist on a jewish origin for they holy of holy and as soon as abraham and ishmael be establish as father of the race legend concern they be in perpetual creation the kaaba thus repute to be the work of abraham bear evidence of a antiquity so remote that its beginning will be forever lose to we from very early time it be a goal of pilgrimage for all arabia because of the position of mecca upon the chief trade route and unite in its ceremony the native worship of the sun and star idol and misshapen stone the black stone the kissing of which form the chief ceremonial be a relic of the rite practice by the stone-worshipper of old while the seven circuit of the kaaba obligatory on all pilgrim be probably a symbol of the course of the planet arab divinity such as alilat and uzza be associate with the kaaba before any record be available and at the time of mahomet idolatry mingle with various rite still hold sway among the meccan though the leaven of jewish tradition be of great help to he in the establishment of the monotheistic idea at mahomet 's birth the kaaba consist of a small roofless house with the black stone imbed in its wall near it lay the well zemzem and the reputed grave of ishmael the holy place of arabium hold thus within itself trace of a purer faith that be to be discover and fill in by mahomet until the kaaba become the goal of thousand the recipient of the devotion and longing of that mighty host of muslim who go forth to subdue the world mahomet 's ancestor have for some time hold a high position in the city he come of the race of hashim whose privilege it be to give service to the pilgrim come to worship at the kaaba the hashim be renown for generosity and mahomet 's grandfather abd al muttalib be revere by the kureisch inhabitant of mecca as a just and honorable man who have greatly increase they prosperity by he rediscovery of the holy well its healing water have be choke by the accumulation of year so that even the knowledge of its site be lose when a angel appear to abd al muttalib as he sleep at the gate of the temple say : dig up that which be pure three time the command fall on uncomprehending ear until the angel reveal to the sleeper where the precious water might be find and as he dig the well burst forth once more and behold within its deep lay two golden gazelle with weapon the treasure of former king and there be strife among the kureisch for the possession of these riches until they be force to draw lot so the treasure fall to abd al muttalib who melt the weapon to make a door for the kaaba and set up the golden gazelle within it abd al muttalib figure very prominently in the early legend concern mahomet because he be sole guardian of the prophet during very early childhood these legend be mainly later accretion but the kernel of truth within they be not difficult to discover like all forerunner of the great teacher he stand in communion with heavenly messenger the symbol of he purity of heart he be humble compassionate and devout living continually in the presence of he god -- a fitting guardian for the renewer of the faith of he nation most significant of the legend be the story of he vow to sacrifice a son if ten be bear to he and of the choice of abdullah mahomet 's father and the repeat staying of the father 's hand so that the sacrifice could not be accomplish until be son 's life be buy with the blood of a hundred camel this and all ally legend be fruit of a desire to magnify the divine authority of mahomet 's mission by dwelling on the intervention of a higher power in the disposal of he fate of abd al muttalib 's ten son abdallah be the most handsome in form and stature so that the fame of he beauty spread into the harem of the city and many woman covet he in they heart but he after he father have sacrifice the camel in he stead go straightway to the house of amina a maiden well-born and lovely and remain there to complete he nuptials with she then after some week he depart to gaza for the exchange of merchandise but return be overtake by sickness and die at medina amina leave thus desolate seek the house of abd al muttalib where she stay until she child be bear vision of he future greatness be vouchsafe to she before he birth by a angel who tell she the name he be to bear and he destiny as prophet of he people long before the child 's eye open to the light a brightness surround he mother so that by it might be see the far-off tower of the castle in syrian bostra a tenderness hang over the story of mahomet 's birth akin to that immortal beauty surround the come of christ we have faint glimpse of amina in the dignity of she sorrow wait for the birth of she son and in the house of mecca 's lead citizen hearing around she not alone the celestial voice of she spirit-comforter but also rumor of earthly strife and the threatening of strange army from the south at sana capital of yeman rule abraha king of the southern province he build a vast temple within its wall and purpose to make sana the pilgrim-city for all arabium but the old custom still cleave to mecca and find he could in nowise coerce the people into forsake the kaaba he determine to invade mecca itself and to destroy the rival place of worship so he gather together a great army which number amongst it a elephant a fearful sight to the meccan who have never see so great a animal with this force he march upon mecca and be about to enter the city after fruitless attempt by abd al muttalib to obtain quarter when god send down a scourge of sickness upon he army and he be force to retreat return miserably to sana with a remnant of he man but so much have the presence of the elephant alarm the meccan that the year -lrb- ad 570 -rrb- be call ever after the year of the elephant and in August thereof mahomet be bear then amina send for abd al muttalib and tell he the marvel she have see and hear and he grandfather take the child and present he in the kaaba after the manner of the jew and give he the name mahomet -lrb- the praise one -rrb- accord as the angel have command amina the countless legend surround mahomet 's birth even to the physical marvel that accompany it can not be set aside as utterly worthless they serve to show the temper of the nation produce they deeply imaginative and incoherently poetical and they indicate the weight of the personality to which they cling all the devotion of the east inform they but since the spirit that cause they to be be in its essence one of relentless activity neither contemplative nor mystic they lack that subtle sweetness that belong to the buddhist and christian history and dwell rather within the region of the marvellous than of the spiritually symbolic neither mahomet 's father nor mother be know to we in any detail they be merely the passive instrument of mahomet 's prophetic mission he real parent be he grandfather and he uncle abu talib but more than these the desert that nurture he physically and mentally that bound he horizon throughout he life and impress its mighty mystery upon he unconscious childhood and he eager imaginative youth chapter ii childhood paradise lie at the foot of mother -- mahomet no more beautiful and tender legend cluster round mahomet than those which grace he life in the desert under the loving care of he foster-mother hailima she be a woman of the tribe of benus sa'ad who for generation have roam the desert tent-dweller who visit city but rarely and keep about they the remoteness and freedom of they adventurous life beneath the sun and star about the time of mahomet 's birth a famine fall upon the benus sa'ad which leave nothing of all they store and the woman of the tribe journey -lrb- 28 -rrb- weary and stricken with hunger into the city of mecca that they might obtain foster-children whose parent would give they money and blessing if they could but get they little one take away from that unhealthy place among these be hailima who accord to tradition have leave behind she the narrative of that dreadful journey across the desert with she husband and she child and with only a ass and a she-camel for transport famine oppress they sorely together with the heat of desert sun until there be no sustenance for any live creature then faint and travel-weary they reach the city and begin they quest mahomet be offer to every woman of the tribe but they reject he as he have no father and there be little hope of much payment from the mother of these child those of rich parent be eagerly speak for but no one would care for the little fatherless child and it happen that hailima also be unsuccessful in she search and be like to have return to she people disconsolate but when she see mahomet she bethink herself and say to she husband : by the god of my father i will not go back to my companion without foster-child i will take this orphan and she husband reply : it can not harm thee to do this and if thou takest he it may be that through he god will bless we so hailima take he and she relate how good fortune attend she from that day she camel give abundant milk during the homeward journey and in the unfruitful land of the benus sa'ad she cattle be always fattest and yield most milk until she neighbor beseech she to allow they to pasture they cattle with hers but add the chronicler naively in spite of this they cattle return to they thin and yield little while hailima 's wax fat and fruitful these legend be the translation into poetic fact of the peace and love surround mahomet during the five year he spend with hailima for in all primitive community every experience must pass through transmutation into the definite and tangible and be give a local habitation and a name when mahomet be two year old and the time have come to restore he to he mother hailima take he back to mecca but he mother give he to she again because he have thrive so well under desert sky and she fear the stifle air of mecca for she only son so hailima return with he and bring he up as one of she child until he be five when the first sign of he nervous highly-strung nature show themselves in a kind of epileptic fit the arabian unskilled as they be in any medical science attribute manifestation of this kind to evil spirit and it be not surprising that we find hailima bring he back to he grandfather in great alarm so end he foster by the desert and by hailima of these five year spend among the benus sa'ad chronicler have speak in much detail but they confused account be so interwoven with legend that it be impossible to re-create event and we can only obtain a general idea of he life as a tiny child among the child of the tribe share they fortune play and quarrel with they and at moment when the spirit seem to advance beyond its dwelling-place gaze wide-eyed upon the limitless desert under the blaze of sun or below the velvet dark with swift half-conscious questioning utter the universal why and how -lrb- 31 -rrb- of childhood legend regard even this early time as one of preparation for he mission and there be story of the come of two man clothe in white and shine garment who rip open he body take out he heart and have purge it of all unrighteousness return it symbolically cleanse he of sin that he might forward the work of god it be a imaginative rightness that decree that mahomet 's most impressionable year should be spend in the great desert whose twin influence of fierceness and fatalism he feel throughout he life and which finally become the key-note of he worship of allah hailima convince that she foster-son be possess by evil spirit resolve to return he to abd al muttalib but as she journey through upper mecca the child wander away and be lose for a time hailima hurry much agitate to he grandfather who immediately send he son to search and after a short time they return with the boy unharmed and unfrightened by he adventure the legend -- it be quite a late accretion -- be interesting as show a acquaintance with and a parallelism to the story of the losing of jesus among the passover crowd and the search for he by he kindred mahomet be at last lodge with he mother who indignantly explain to hailima the real meaning of he malady and speak of he future glory as manifest to she by the light that enfold she before he birth not long after amina decide to visit she -lrb- 32 -rrb- husband 's tomb at medina and thither mahomet accompany she travel through the rocky desolate valley and hill that separate the two with just he mother and a slave girl mahomet be too young to remember much about the journey to medina except that it be hot and that he be often tired and since he father be but a name to he the visit to he tomb fade altogether from he mind but on the homeward journey a calamity overtake he which he remember all he life amina weaken by journey and much sorrow and perhaps feel she desire for life forsake she after the fulfillment of she pilgrimage sicken and die at abwa and mahomet and the slave girl continue they mournful way alone amina be draw by tradition in very vague outline and mahomet 's memory of she as give in the kuran do not throw so much light upon the woman herself as upon she child 's devotion and affectionate memory of the mother he lose almost before he know she he grief for she be very real she remain continually in he thought and in after year he pay tribute at she tomb to she tenderness and love for he this be the grave of my mother the lord have permit I to visit it i call my mother to remembrance and the tender memory of she overcome I and i weep the sensitive over-nervous child leave thus solitary away from all he kindred must have bring back with he to mecca confused but vivid impression of the long journey and of the catastrophe which lay at the end of it the uncertainty of he future and the joy of gain at last a foster-father in abd al muttalib find reflection in the kuran in one little burst of praise to god : do he not find thee a orphan and furnish thee with a refuge life for two year as the foster-child of abd al muttalib the venerable much honor chief of the house of hashim pass very pleasantly for mahomet he be the darling of he grandfather 's last year of life for perhaps have pity on he defencelessness perhaps divine with that prescience which often mark old age something of the revelation this child be to be to he countryman he protect he from the harshness of he uncle a rug use to be place in the shadow of the kaaba and there the aged ruler rest during the heat of the day and he son sit around he at respectful distance listen to he word but the child mahomet who love he grandfather run fearlessly up and would have seat himself by abd al muttalib 's side then the son seek to punish he for he lack of reverence but they father prevent they : leave the child in peace by the god of my father i swear he will one day be a mighty prophet so mahomet remain in close attendance upon the old man until he die in the eighth year after the year of the elephant and there be mourn for he in the house of he son when abd al muttalib know he end be near he send for he daughter and bid they make lamentation over he we possess traditional account of these funeral song they be representative of the wild rhetorical eloquence of the poetry of the day they lose immensely in translation and even in read with the eye instead of hearing for they be never mean to find immortality in the write word but in the speech of man when in the night season a voice of loud lament proclaim the sorrowful tiding i weep so that the tear run down my face like pearl i weep for a noble man greater than all other for sheibar the generous endowed with virtue for my beloved father the inheritor of all good thing for the man faithful in he own house who never shrink from combat who stand fast and need not a prop mighty well-favoured rich in gift if a man could live for ever by reason of he noble nature -- but to none be this lot vouchsafe -- he would remain untouched of death because of he fair fame and he good deed the song furnish ample evidence as to the high position which abd al muttalib hold among the kureisch he death be a great loss to he nation but it be a greater calamity to he little foster-child for it bring he from ease and riches to comparative poverty and obscurity with he uncle abu talib none of abd al muttalib 's son inherit the nature of they father and with he death the greatness of the house of hashim diminish until it give place to the omeyya branch with harb at its head the office at mecca be seize by the omeyya and to the descendant of abd al muttalib there remain but the privilege of care for the well zemzem and of give its water for the refreshment of pilgrim only two of he son except abu talib who earn renown chiefly as the guardian of mahomet attain anything like prominence hamza be convert at the beginning of mahomet 's mission and continue he helper and warrior until he die in battle for islam abu lahab -lrb- the flame -rrb- oppose mahomet 's teaching with a vehemence that earn he one of the fiercest denunciation in the early passionate sura of the kuran : blast be the hand of abu lahab let himself perish he wealth and he gain shall avail he not burn shall he be with the fiery flame he wife shall be laden with firewood -- on she neck a rope of palm fiber mahomet bereft a second time of one he love and on whom he depend pass into the care of he uncle abu talib this be a man of no great force of character well-disposed and kindly but of straitened means and lack in the quality that secure success later he seem to have attain a more important position mainly one would imagine through the lion courage and unfaltering faith in the prophet of he son the mighty warrior alus of whom it be write mahomet be the city of knowledge and alus be the gate thereof but although abu talib be sufficiently strong to withstand the popular fury of the kureisch against mahomet and to protect he for a time on the grounds of kinship he never finally decide upon which side he would take he stand have he be a far-seeing imaginative man able to calculate even a little the force that have enter into arabian polity the history of the foundation of islam would have be continue with mecca as its base and have probably resolve itself into the war of two faction within the city wherein the new faith be bind to the more powerful political party would have have a speedier conquest with abu talib mahomet spend the rest of he childhood and youth -- quiet year except for a journey to syrium and he insignificant part in the war against the hawazin a desert tribe that engage the kureisch for some time in abu talib 's house there be none of the ease that have surround he with abd al muttalib but mahomet be naturally a affectionate child and be equally attach to he uncle as he have be to he grandfather two year later abu talib set out on a mercantile journey and be mind to leave he small foster-child behind he but mahomet come to he as he sit on he camel equip for he journey and cling to he passionately implore he uncle not to go without he abu talib could not resist he plead and so mahomet accompany he on that magical journey through the desert so glorious yet awesome to a imaginative child bostra be the principal city of exchange for merchandise circulate between yemen northern arabium and the city of upper palestine and mahomet must thus have travel on the caravan route through the heart of syrium past jerash ammon and the site of the fate city of the plain in syrium too he first encounter the christian faith and plant those remembrance that be to be revive and strengthen upon he second journey through that wonderful land -- in religion and in a lesser degree in polity a law unto itself forge out its own history apart from the main stream of christian life and think legend concern this journey be rife and all emphasise the influence christianity have upon he mind and also the ready recognition of he come greatness by all those christian who see he on the homeward journey the monk bahirah be fabled to have meet the party and to have bid they to a feast when he see the child be not among they he be wroth and command he guest to bring every man of the company he interrogate mahomet and abu talib concern the parentage of the boy and we have here the first traditional record of mahomet 's speech ask what thou wilt he say to bahirah and i will make answer so bahirah question he as to the sign that have be vouchsafe he and look between he shoulder find the seal of the prophetic office a mole cover with hair then bahirah know this be he who be foretell and counsel abu talib to take he to he native land and to beware -lrb- 39 -rrb- of the jew for he would one day attain high honor at this time mahomet be little more than a child but although few thought of god or of human destiny can have cross he mind he retain a vivid impression of the storied place through which he pass -- jerash ammon the valley of hejr and saw in imagination the mighty stream of the tigris the ruinous city and palmyra with its golden pillar front the sun the tribe which the caravan encounter be rich in legend and myth and they influence together with the more subtle spell of the desert vastness work in he that fervor of spirit a leap troubled flame which find mortal expression in the poetry of the early part of the kuran where the vision of god 's majesty compel the gazer into speech that sweep from he mind in a stream of fire : by the sun and he noonday brightness by the moon when she followeth he by day when it revealeth he glory by the night when it enshroudeth he by the heaven and he who build it by the earth and he who spread it forth by the soul and he who balance it breathe into its good yea and its evil -- verily man 's lot be cast amid destruction save those who believe and deal justly and enjoin upon each other steadfastness and truth chapter iii strife and meditation god have treasury beneath the throne the key whereof be the tongue of poet -- mahomet the arabian calendar have always be in a distinctive manner subject to the religion of the people before mahomet impose he faith upon mecca there be four sacred month follow each other in which no war might be wage for four month therefore the tumultuous arab spirit be restrain from that most precious to it pilgrimage to holy place be undertake and there be a little leisure for the cultivation of art and learn the greater pilgrimage to mecca comprise the sevenfold circuit of the kaaba and the kissing of the sacred black stone and culminate in a procession to the holy place of mina and arafat could only be undertake in dzul-higg corresponding in the time of mahomet to we march the month precede dzul-cada be occupy in a kind of preparation and rejoice which take the form of a fair at ocatz three day ' journey east of mecca when representative of all the surround nation use to assemble to exchange merchandise to take part in the game to listen to the contest in poetry and rhetoric and sometimes to be rouse into sinister excitement at the proximity of so many tribe differ from they in nationality and often in they religion and moral code into this vast concourse come mahomet a lad of fifteen eager to see hear and know he be present at the poetic contest and catch from the protagonist a reflection of they vivid fitful eloquence with its ceaseless undercurrent of monotony romance in so far as it represent the love of the strange be a product of the west there be a rigidity in the eastern mind that do not allow of much change or seek after new thing wild and beautiful as this poetry of arabium be its theme and they manner of treatment seldom vary as the desert be changeless in contour fill with a brilliant sameness whirling at time into sombre fury and as suddenly subside so be the literature which it foster the monotony be express in a reiteration of subject barbarous to the intellect of the west endurance be bear of that monotony and strength and the acquiescence in thing as they be but not the discovery and development of idea arabia do not flash forth a new presentment of beauty follow the vivid apprehension of some lovely form but brood over it in a kind of slumbering enthusiasm that mount at last into a glory of metaphor drown the subject in intensest light the rival poet assemble to discover who could turn the deftest phrase in satire of the oppose tribe or extol most eloquently the bravery and skill of he own people the beauty and modesty of they woman and from these wild outpouring mahomet learn to clothe he thought in that splendid garment whose jewel illumine the earlier part of the kuran perhaps more important than the poetical contest be the religious aspect of the fair at ocatz here be gather jew christian and arabian worshipper of many god in a vast hostile confusion mahomet be familiar with jewish cosmogony from he knowledge of they faith within he own land and he have hear dimly of the christian principle during he syrian journey but here though both jew and christian claim to be worshipper of a single god and although the jew take for they protector abraham the mighty founder of mahomet 's own city yet there be nothing between all the sect but fruitless strife he see the jew look disdainfully upon the christian dog and the christian firmly convince that a irrevocable doom would shortly descend upon every jew both unite in condemn to eternal wrath the idol-worshipper of the kaaba it be a fiercely outspoken remorseless enmity that he see around he and the impotence bear of distrust he see also it be not possible that any hint of he future mission enlighten he as to the part he be to play in eliminate this conflict but may it not be that there be sow in he mind a seed of thought concern the uselessness of all this strife of religion and the limitless power that might accrue to he nation if it could but be persuade to become unite in allegiance to the one true god for even at that early stage mahomet with the example of judaism and christianity before he must have reject even if unthinkingly the polytheistic idea the poetic and warlike contest partook of the fiery earnestness characteristic of the combatant and it be seldom that the fair at ocatz pass by without some hostile demonstration the greatest rival be the kureisch and the hawazin a tribe dwelling between mecca and taif the hawazin be tumultuous and unruly and the kureisch ever ready to rouse they hostility by numerous small slight and taunt we read traditionally of a insult by some kureisch youth towards a girl of the hawazin this incident be close peaceably but some year later the kureisch -lrb- always the aggressive party because of they stronghold in mecca -rrb- commit a outrage that could not be pass over as the fair progress news come of the murder of a hawazin chief of a caravan and the seizure of he treasure by a ally of the kureisch that tribe know themselves at a disadvantage and fear vengeance flee back to mecca the hawazin pursue they remorselessly to the border of the sacred precinct beyond which it be sacrilegious to wage war some tradition say they follow they foe undaunted by fear of divine wrath and thus incur a double disgrace of have fight in the sacred month and within the sacred territory but they pursuit can not have last long because we find they challenge the kureisch to battle at the same time the next year all mahomet 's uncle take part in the sacrilegious war that follow and stir time continue for mahomet until a truce be make after four year he attend he uncle in warfare and we hear of he collect the enemy 's arrow that fall harmlessly into they line in order to reinforce the kureisch ammunition a vivid picture by the hand of tradition be this period in mahomet 's life for he be between eighteen and nineteen just at the age when fight would appeal to he wild yet determine nature he must have learn resource and some of the stratagem of war from this attendance upon warrior if he do not become fill with much physical daring never one of he characteristic nor indeed of any man of he nervous temperament and he imagination be certainly kindle by the spectacle of the horror and triumph of strife several battle be fight with vary success until at the end of about five year ' fight both side be weary and a truce be call it be find that twenty more hawazin have be kill than kureisch and accord to the simple yet equitable custom of the time a like number of hostage be give to the hawazin that there might not be blood feud between they the kureisch pass as suddenly into peace as they have plunge into strife after the sacrilegious war a period of prosperity begin for the city of mecca it be wealthy enough to support its population and trade flourish with the mart of bostra damascus and northern syrium its political condition have never be very stable and it seem to have preserve during the omeyyad ascendancy the same loose but roughly effective organization that it possess under the hashim branch the intellect that could see the potentiality of such a polity once it could be knit together by some common bond have not arise but the scene be prepare for he come and we have to think of the mecca of that time as offer untold suggestion for its religious and later for its political salvation to a mind anxious to produce but uncertain as yet of its medium mahomet return with abu talib and pass with he into obscurity of a poverty not too burdensome and to a quiet somewhat reflective household he live under the spell of that tranquillity until he be twenty-five and of this time there be not much notice in the tradition but its contemplation be reveal to we in the earlier chapter of the kuran at one time mahomet act as shepherd upon the meccan hill -- low rocky range cover with a dull scrub and open to the limitless vault of sky here whether under sun or star he learn that love and awe of nature that throb through the early chapter of the kuran like a deep organ note of praise dominate almost always with fear consider the heaven -- with he hand have he build it up and give it its vastness -- and the earth have he stretch out like a carpet smoothly have he spread it forth verily god be the sole sustainer possess of might the unshaken fly then to god indeed a haunting terror brood over all those soul who know the desert and this fear translate into action become fierce and terrible deed and into the world of the spirit angry dogmatic command it be the result of the knowledge that to those who stray from the well-known desert track come death equally certain be the destruction of the soul for those who transgress against the law of the ruler of the earth the god of the early kuran be the spiritual representative of the force surround mahomet whether of nature or government the country around mecca convey one central thought to one who meditate -- the sense of power not the might of one kindly and familiar but the unapproachable sovereignty of one alien and remote a dweller in far-off place who nevertheless fill the earth with he dominion mahomet pass by as he do the gaiety and temptation of youth have he mind alert for the influence of this nature full of awful power and for the contemplation of life and the universe around he in common with many enthusiast and man of action certain side of he nature especially the sexual and the practical awake late and be precede by a reflective period wherein the poet hold full sway he never desire the companionship of those of he own age and they rather debased pleasure there be legend of he be miraculously preserve from the corruption of the youthful vice of mecca but the more probable reason for he shun they be that they make no appeal to he desire some mind and taste unfold by imperceptible degree -- flower that attain fruition by the shed of they earlier petal mahomet be of this nature at this time the poet be paramount in he mental activity he love silence and solitude so that he might use those imaginative and contemplative gift of which he feel himself to possess so large a share it be not possible at this distance of time to attempt to estimate the importance of this period in mahomet 's mental development there be not sufficient datum to enable history to fill in any detailed sketch but the outline may be safely indicate by the help of he later life and the testimony of that commentary upon he feeling and action the kuran he nature now seem to be in a pause of expectation whose vain urgency last until he become convinced of he prophetic mission he must have be at this time the seeker whose youth if not he very eagerness prevent he attain what he seek he be earnest and sincere grave beyond he year and so gain from he fellow the respect always mete out in a essentially religion-loving community to any who give promise of future inspiration before its actuality have render he too uncomfortable a citizen he receive from he comrade the title of al-amin -lrb- the faithful -rrb- and continue he life apart from he kind perform he duty well but still remain aloof from other as one not of they world from he sojourn in the mountain come the inspiration that create the poetry of the kuran and the reflective interest in what he know of he world and its religion both embryo but especially the latter germinate in he mind until they emerge into full consciousness and become he fire of religious conviction and he zeal for the foundation and glory of islam chapter iv adventure and security woman be the twin-half of man -- mahomet abu talib 's straitened circumstance never prevent he from treat he foster-child with all the affection of which he kindly but somewhat weak character be capable but the care of a grow family soon become too much for he means and when mahomet be about twenty-five he uncle suggest that he should embark upon a mercantile journey for some rich trader in mecca we can imagine mahomet immerse in he solitude respond reluctantly to a call that could not be evade he be not by nature a trader and the proposal be repugnant to he except for he desire to help he uncle and more than this he curiosity to revisit at a more assimilative age the land that he remember dimly from childhood khadijah a beautiful widow daughter of a honor house and the cousin of mahomet rich and much seek after by the kureisch desire someone to accompany she trading venture to bostra and hearing of the wisdom and faithfulness of mahomet send for he ask if he would travel for she into syrium and pursue she bargain in that northern city she be willing to reward he far more generously than most merchant mahomet anxious to requite he uncle in some way and with he young imagination kindle at the prospect of new scene and idea prepare eagerly for the journey with one other man-servant meisara he set out with the merchandise to bostra traverse as a young man the same desert path he have journey along in boyhood he be of a age to appreciate all that this experience could teach in the region both of nature and religion the lonely desert only increase he pervade sense of the mystery lie beyond he immediate knowledge and its vastness confirm he vague belief in some kind of a power who alone control so mighty a creation as the abound space around he and the star-bespangled heaven above on this journey too he first see with conscious eye the desert storm in all the splendor and terror of they fury and catch the significance of those sudden squall that urge the water of the upper syrian lake into a tumult of destruction frequent allusion to sea and lake storm be to be find in the earlier part of the kuran : when the sea shall be commingle when the sea shall boil then shall man tremble before he creator by the swollen sea verily a chastisement from thy lord be imminent in every natural manifestation that strike mahomet 's imagination in these early day god appear to he as the sovereign of power as terrible and as remote as he be in the lightning on sinaus what wonder then that when the call come to he to take up he mission it become a command to arise and warn the chronicler would have we believe that he contact with christianity be more important than he communion with nature most of the legend surround he relation with christian syrium may be safely accept as later addition but it be certain that he pay some attention to the religion of those people through whose country he pass a syrian monk be say to have see mahomet sit beneath a tree and to have hail he as a prophet there be even a traditional account of a interview with nestorius but this must be set aside at once as pure fiction the kernel of these legend seem to be the desire to show that mahomet have study christianity and be not impose a new religion without have consider the potentiality of those already exist however that may be christianity certainly interested mahomet and must have influence he towards the monotheistic idea the arabian themselves be not entirely ignorant of it they witness the worship of one god by the jew and christian on the border of they territory and although it be a very debatable point how far the idea of one god have progress in arabium when mahomet begin he mission it may fairly be accept that dissatisfaction with the old tribal god be not want mahomet see the country through which he pass in a state of religious flux and hear around he diverse creed detect doubtless a undercurrent of unrest and a desire for some religion of more compelling power with the single slave he reach bostra in safety with the merchandise and have conclude he barter very successfully and retain in he mind many impression of that crowded city return to mecca by the same desert route meisara the slave relate -lrb- in what be doubtless a later addition -rrb- of the fierce noonday heat that beset the traveller and how when mahomet be almost exhaust two angel sit on he camel and protect he with they wing when they reach mecca khadijah sell the merchandise and find she wealth double so careful have mahomet be to ensure the prosperity of he client and before long love grow up in she heart for this tall grave youth who be faithful in small thing as well as in great khadijah have be much seek after by the man of mecca both for she riches and for she beauty but she have prefer to remain independent and continue she orderly life among she maiden attend to she household and finding enough occupation in the supervision of she many mercantile venture she be about forty fair of countenance and gifted with a rich nature whose lead quality be affection and sympathy she seem to have be pre-eminently one of those receptive woman who be good to consult for the clarification of idea she intelligence be quick to grasp another 's think if she do not originate think within herself she be a woman fit to be the helper and guide of such a man as mahomet eager impulsive prone to swiftly alternate extreme of depression and elation a subtle mental attraction draw they together and khadijah divine intuitively the power lie within the mind of this youth and also he need of she both mentally and materially to enable he to realize he whole self therefore as she be the first to awaken to she desire for he the first advance come from she she send she sister to mahomet to induce he to change he mind upon the subject of marriage and when he find that the rich and gracious khadijah offer he she hand he could not believe he good fortune and assure the sister that he be eager to make she he wife the alliance in spite of its personal suitability be far from be advantageous to khadijah from a worldly point of view and the tradition of how she father 's consent be obtain have all the savor of contemporary evidence the father be bid to a feast and there ply right royally with wine when he reason return he ask the meaning of the great spread of viand the canopy and the chapleted head of the guest thereupon he be tell it be the marriage-feast of mahomet and khadijah and he wrath and amazement be great for have he not by he presence give sanction to the nuptials the incident throw some light upon the marriage law current at the time khadijah though forty and a widow be still under the guardianship of she father have pass to he after the death of she husband and he consent be need before she marry again the marriage contract by mutual desire be follow by a time of leisure and happiness which mahomet remember all he life never do any man feel he marriage gift -lrb- in mahomet 's case twenty young camel -rrb- more fitly give than the youth whom khudijah rescue from poverty and to whom she give the boon of she companionship and counsel the marriage be fruitful two son be bear the eldest kasim wherefore mahomet receive the title of abu-el-kasim the father of kasim but both these die in infancy there be also four daughter bear to mahomet -- zeineb rockeya umm kolthum and fatima these be important later on for the marriage they contract with mahomet 's supporter and indeed he whole position be considerably solidify by the alliance between he daughter and he chief adherent ten year pass thus in prosperity and study mahomet be no longer obscure but the chief of a wealthy house revere for he piety and look upon already as one of those to whom god whisper in the ear he character now exhibit more than ever the mark of the poet and seer the time be at hand when all the subdue enthusiasm of he mind be to break forth in the opening sura of the kuran the inspiration have not yet descend upon he but it be imminent and the shadow of its stern requirement be about he as he attend to he work of supervise khadijah 's wealth or take part in the religious life of mecca in ad 605 when mahomet be thirty-five year old the chief man of mecca decide to rebuild the kaaba the story of its rebuilding be perhaps the most interesting of the many strange naive tale of this adventurous city valley flood have shatter the house of the god it be roofless and so insecure that its treasury have already be rifle by blasphemous man it stand only as high as the stature of a man and be make simply of stone lay one above the other rebuilding be absolutely necessary but material be need before the work could begin and this delay the kureisch until chance provide they with means of accomplish they design a grecian ship have be drive in a red sea storm upon the coast near mecca and be rapidly be break up when the kureisch hear of it they set out in a body to the seashore and take away the wood of the ship to build a roof for the kaaba it be a significant fact that tradition put a greek carpenter in mecca who be able to advise they as to the construction the meccan themselves be not sufficiently skilled in the art of building but now a great difficulty await they who be to undertake the responsibility of demolish so holy a place even if it be only that it might be rebuild more fittingly many legend cluster round the demolition it would seem that the god only understand gradually that a complete destruction of the kaaba be not intend they opposition be at first implacable the loosen stone fly back into they place and finally none could be induce to make the attempt to pull down the kaaba there be a pause in the work during which no one dare venture near the temple then al-welid be a bold and god-fearing spirit take a axe and cry : i will make a begin let no evil ensue o lord he begin to dislodge the stone then the rest of the kureisch rather cravenly wait until the next day but see that no calamity have befall al-welid they be ready to continue the work the rebuilding prosper until they come to a point where the black stone must be embed in the eastern wall at this juncture a vehement dispute arise among the kureisch as to who be to have the honor of deposit the black stone in its place they wrangle for day and finally decide to appeal to mahomet who have a reputation for wisdom and resource mahomet after carefully consider the question order a large cloth to be bring and command the representative of the four chief meccan house to hold each a corner then he deposit the black stone in the center of it and in this manner with the help of every party in the quarrel the sacred object be raise to the proper height when this be do mahomet conduct the black stone to its niche in the wall with he own hand the building of the kaaba be ultimately complete and a great festival be hold in honor many hymn of praise be sing at the accomplishment of so difficult and important a work the kaaba have remain substantially the same as it be when it be first rebuilt it be a small place of no architectural pretension merely a square with no window and a tiny door raise from the ground by which the faithful duly prepare be allow to enter upon rare occasion the sacred black stone lie embedded about three foot from the ground in the eastern wall at first a dark greenish stone of volcanic or aerolitic origin now worn black and polish by thousand of kiss there be little in the kaaba to account for the reverence bestow upon it and its insignificance bear witness to the eastern capacity for worship the idea for which its symbol stand this be the sacred temple of abraham and ishmael therefore its exterior matter little mahomet 's share in the construction of the kaaba bring he further honor among the kureisch from this time until the beginning of he mission he live a quiet easeful domestic life interrupt only by mental storm and depression he find leisure to meditate and observe and of this necessarily uneventful time there be little or no mention in the history he certainly gain a opportunity of examine somewhat closely the tenet of christianity by the entrance into he household of zeid a christian slave culture and well-informed as to the doctrine of he religion and he presence doubtless influence mahomet in the spiritual battle he encounter at a time when as yet he be certain neither of god nor himself besides zeid another important personage enter mahomet 's household alus son of abu talib and future convert and pride of islam the lion of the faith the adoption of alus be mahomet 's small recompense to abu talib for he care of he and the advantage there from to islam be inestimable alus be no statesman but he be a indomitable fighter with whose aid mahomet found he religion of the sword in such quiet manner mahomet pass the year immediately precede the discovery of he mission and as religious doubt and fear alternate in he with fervor and hopefulness so sign be not want of a spirit of inquiry find abroad in arabia discontented with the old religion seek for a clearer enthusiasm and withhold from its goal legend gather round the figure of four inquirer who be repute to have come to mahomet for enlightenment and the story be but the primitive device of render concrete and material all those vague stirring of the communal spirit towards a more convincing conception of the world -- legend that embody idea in personality mainly because they language have no word for the expression of the abstract and also that clothe in live garment they may capture the heart of man the time for the come of a prophet and a teacher could not be long delay and a foreboding of he imperious destiny dark with war and aflame with god 's judgment have already begin to steal across mahomet 's hesitant soul chapter v inspiration recite thou in the name of thy lord who create yan who have make man from clot of blood recite thou for thy lord he be most bounteous _ the kuran _ the mental growth by which mahomet attain the capacity of prophet and ruler will always have spread about it a misty veil wherein strange shape and awful vision be dimly discern do he soul face the blankness that baffle and entice the human spirit with any conviction the gradual product of thought and experience or be it with a unmeaning chaos within he that he stumble into faith and evolve he own creed he knowledge of christianity and judaism undoubtedly help to foster in he he central idea of the indivisibility of god but how be this faith work out into he conception of himself as the prophet of he people it be impossible for any decision to be make as to the mainspring of he belief except in the light of he character and development of mind he be passionate and yet practical holding within himself the element of seer and statesman prophet and law-giver as yet doubtful of the voice which inspire he but spur on in he quest for the truth by a intensity of spirit that carry he forward resistlessly as soon as conviction come to he the man who impose he dauntless determination upon a whole people who found a system of religious and social law who move army to fight primarily for a idea could not lightly gain be right to exhort and control he nature be almost cataclysmic and once fill with the fire of the lord he burst forth among he fellow-men with the right hand strike to use he own vivid metaphor but before this evidence of power have come a agonising period of doubt trace of he mental turmoil be see abundantly in he physical nature we read of he exhaustion after the inspiration come and of the terrific sura that take they toll of he vitality afterwards the mission impose upon he be no light burden and demand of he strength both of body and mind the successive stage by which he become convinced of he divine call be only detail in the history with the concurrence of the supernatural he see material vision and dream fervent dream with the ecstacy of heaven about he accord to legend he hold converse with the angel gabriel arch-messenger of god and the divine injunction must be translate into mental enthusiasm before the true evolution of mahomet 's mind can be dimly conceive when he be forty he seek solitude more constantly than formerly there be deep in he own nature of which he be only now become aware a restlessness of mind beset he and continually he retire to a cave at the base of mount hira where he could meditate undisturbed this mountain hallowed for ever by the follower of islam be now call somewhat ironically consider its natural barrenness jebel nur the mountain of light mahomet be of a nervous temperament the nature that suffer more intensely through its imaginative foresight than in actual experience he be of those who see keenly and feel towards they belief he faith in god produce none of that self-abnegating rapture to be find in the devotions of many early christian it be a personal passion sweep up he whole nature within its fold and rouse the enfold not to meditation but to instant action through all the legendary account there beat that excitement that tell of a mind work to the highest pitch afire with vision alive with desire then when he fervor attain its zenith gabriel come to he in sleep with a silken cloth in he hand cover with write and say to mahomet : read i can not read then the angel wrap the cloth about he and once more command read again come the answer i can not read and again the angel cover he still repeat read then he mouth be open and he read the first sura of the kuran : recite thou in the name of thy lord who create thee and when he awake it seem to he that these word be grave upon he heart mahomet go immediately up into the mountain and there gabriel appear to he wake and say : thou art god 's prophet and i be gabriel the archangel vanish but mahomet remain rooted to the spot until khadijah 's messenger find he and bring he to she the simple story of mahomet 's call to the prophetic office from the lip of the old chronicler be peculiarly fragrant but it leave we in considerable doubt as to the real means by which he attain he faith and be embolden to preach to he people it be certain that he have no idea at the time when he receive he inspiration of the ultimate political role in store for he he be now simply the man who warn the people of they sin and who insist upon the sovereignty of one god very little argument be ever use by mahomet to spread he faith he speak a plain message and those who disregard it be infallibly doom he see himself in the forefront as the man who know god and strove to win he countryman to right way of life he do not see himself at the head of earthly army control the nucleus of a mighty and united arabium and until he flight from mecca to medina he regard himself merely as a religious teacher the political side of he mission grow out of the exigency of circumstance almost without he own volition he exaltation upon the mountain of light soon fade into uncertainty and fearfulness before the influence of the world 's harsh wisdom mahomet enter upon a period of hesitation and dreariness doubtful of himself of he vision and of the divine favor he soul voyage on dark and troubled sea and gaze into abysmal space at one time he would receive the light of the seven heaven within he mind and feel upon he the fervor of the hebrew prophet of old and again he would call in vain upon god and and seek would be fling back upon a darkness of doubt more terrible than the lightning of divine wrath in all those exaltation and gloom khadijah have part she comfort he distress and share he elation until the sorrowful period of the fattrah the pause in the revelation be past the period be variously estimate by the chronicler and there be many nebulous and spurious legend attach to it but whatever its length it seem certain that mahomet gain within it a fuller knowledge of jewish and christian tenet probably through zeid the christian slave in he household and most account agree that the fattrah be end by the revelation of the sura entitle the enwrap the mandate of the angel gabriel : o thou enwrap in thy mantle arise and warn the explanation of the term enwrap in thy mantle show the prevail belief in good and evil spirit characteristic of mahomet 's time wander on the mountain he see in a vision the angel gabriel seat on a throne between heaven and earth and afraid before so much glory run to khadijah beseech she to cover he with he mantle that the evil spirit whom he feel so near he might be avoid thereupon gabriel come down to earth and reveal the sura of admonition this supernatural command would appear to be the translation into the imaginative world of the peace of mind that descend upon mahomet and the conviction as to the reality of he inspiration follow on a time of despair the command fall to one who be peculiarly fit by nature and circumstance to obey it effectively to mahomet who know somewhat the chaos of religion around he -- pagan jewish and christian struggle together in unholy strife -- the conception of god 's unity once it attain the strength of a conviction necessarily resolve itself into a admonitory mission there be no god but god therefore all who believe otherwise have incur he wrath hasten then to warn man of they sin so he conviction pass out of the region of think into action and receive upon it the stamp of time and place become thereby inevitably more circumscribed and intense from now onward the course of mahomet 's life be render indisputably plainer by we possession of that famous and much-maligned document the kuran virtually a record of he inspired saying as remembered and write down by he immediate successor apart from its intrinsic value as the universally recognize vehicle of the islamic creed it be of immense importance as a commentary upon mahomet 's career when allowance have be make for its numberless contradiction and repetition it still remain the best means of trace mahomet 's mental development as well as the course of he religious and political dominance although the original document be compile regardless of chronology expert scholarship have succeed in determine the order of most of it contents and if we can not say the precise sequence of every sura at least we can classify each as belong to one of the two great period the meccan and medinan and may even distinguish with comparative accuracy three division within the former after mahomet 's mandate to preach and warn he fellow-man of they peril the sura continue intermittently throughout he life those of the first period when he mission be hardly accept outside he family bear upon they the stamp of a fiery nature obsess with its one idea but behind the wild word lie a store of energy as yet undiscovered which will find no fulfilment but in action that zeal for a idea which cause the kuran to be express itself at first in word alone but later be translate into political action and it be the emptying of this vitality from he word into he work that be responsible for the contrasting prose of the later sura but no lack of poetic fire be discernible in the suras immediately follow he call to the prophetic office and from they much may be gather as to the depth and intensity of he faith they be almost strident with feel he sentence fall like blow upon a anvil crude in they emphasis and so swiftly utter forth from the flame of he zeal that they glow with reflect glory : say he be god alone god the eternal he begetteth not and be not beget there be none like to he verily we have cause it -lrb- the kuran -rrb- to descend on the night of power and who shall teach thee what the night of power be the night of power excelleth a thousand month therein descend the angel and the spirit by permission of the lord by the snort charger by those that breathe forth spark of fire and those that rush to the attack at morn and stir therein the dust aloft cleave they midmost passage through a host truly man be to he lord ungrateful and of this be himself a witness and truly he be covetous in love of this world 's good ah knoweth he not that when what lie in the grave shall be bare and that bring forth that be in man 's breast verily in that day shall the lord be make wise concern they after the first fire of prophetic zeal have illuminate he mahomet devoted himself to the conversion of he own household and family khadijah be the first convert as might have be expect from the close interdependence of they mind she have become initiate into he prophetship almost equally with she husband and it be she courage and firm trust in he inspiration that have sustain he during the terrible period of negation zeid the christian slave who have help to mould mahomet 's think by he knowledge of christian doctrine be he next convert but both of these be eclipse by the devotion to mahomet 's gospel of alus the future warrior son of abu talib and one destine to play a foremost part in the foundation of islam mahomet 's gospel then penetrate beyond the confines of he household with the conversion of he friend abu bekr a successful merchant living in the same quarter of the town as the prophet abu bekr whose honesty gain he the title of al-siddick -lrb- the true -rrb- and alus be by far the most important of mahomet 's companion they help to rule islam during mahomet 's lifetime and after he death take successive charge of its fortune alus be too young at this time to manifest he quality as warrior and ruler but abu bekr be of middle age and he nature remain substantially the same as at the inception of islam he be of short stature with deep-seated eye and a thoughtful somewhat undecided mouth by nature he be shrewd and intelligent but possess little of that original genius necessary to statesmanship in troublous time he mild sympathetic character endure he to he fellow-men and he calm reasonableness earn the gratitude of all who confide in he he be never rule by impulse and of the fire burning almost indestructibly within mahomet he know nothing it be strange to consider what agency bring these two dissimilar soul into such close relationship for the rest of he life mahomet find a never-failing friend in abu bekr and the attachment between the two apart from they common fount of zeal for islam must have be such as be inspire by those of contrasting nature for each other mahomet see a kindly almost commonplace man in whose sweet sanity he troubled soul could find a little peace he be burden at time with over-resolve that eat into he mind like acid in abu bekr he could find the soothing influence he so often need and after the death of khadijah this friend might be say in a measure to take she place abu bekr on the other hand revere he leader as a man of finer subtler stuff than himself more alive to the virtue of speed fill with a greater daring and a profounder impulse than he be mahomet in common with most man merit the title of great have a capacity for lifelong friendship as well as the power of inspiring belief and devotion in other through abu bekr five convert be gain for the new religion of whom othman be the most important he part in the establishment of the islamic dominion be no slight one but at the present he remain simply one of the early enthusiastic convert to mahomet 's evangel while he enwind himself into the fortune of he teacher by marry rockeya one of mahomet 's daughter the conversion to islam proceed slowly but surely among the kureisch several slave be win over but at the end of four year only forty convert have be make among whom however be bilal a slave who later become the first muaddzin or summoner to prayer during these four year the sura of the first meccan period be reveal and enough may be gather from they to judge both the limit of mahomet 's preach and the attitude towards it on the part of the kureisch mahomet be content at this time to emphasise in eloquent almost incoherent word he central theme -- the unity of god he call upon the people to believe and warn they of they fate if they refuse the sura indicate the attitude of indifference bear by the kureisch towards mahomet 's mission at its inception wherever there be denunciatory sura they be either for the chastisement of unbeliever or as in sura cxi in revenge for the refusal of he relation to believe in he inspiration prophecy of bliss in store for the faithful be frequent and of the corresponding woe for unbeliever the whole be permeate with the spirit of the poet and visionary a poetry tumultuous but strong a vision lurid but inspiring the little band of convert under guidance of this fierce rhetoric become unite and strengthen in its faith prepare to defend it and to spread it as far as possible throughout they kindred about three year after mahomet 's receipt of he mission in ad 618 a important change come over the attitude of the kureisch towards islam hitherto they have jeer or remain indifferent mahomet 's uncle abu talib and abu lahab represent the two pole of kureischite feeling abu talib remain untouched by the new faith but he kindly nature do not allow he to adopt any severe measure for its repression and moreover mahomet be of he kindred and he be willing to afford he protection in case of need abu lahab jeer openly and manifest he scorn by definite speech but as the band of convert grow the kureisch find it undesirable to maintain they indifferent attitude they begin to persecute first refusing to allow the believer to meet and then seek they out individually to endeavor to torture they into recant from this time date the creation of one of the foremost principle in the creed of the prophet if a believer be in danger of torture he may dissemble he faith to save himself from infamy and death though in striking contrast to the christian tenet this exhortation be neither cowardly nor imprudent in he eye reckless court of death would not avail the propagation of islam and though a man might die to some good service on the battlefield smite he enemy no wise end could be serve when he death would merely gratify the lust of he murderer the persecution continue in spite of mahomet 's attempt to withstand it until he be force to go to abu talib for protection this be accord willingly on account of kindred tie but there can have be little cordiality between uncle and nephew on the subject for mahomet be more than ever determine upon the maintenance and growth of he principle still the conversion to islam continue and the persecution of its adherent until there come to the kureisch a sharp intimation that this new sect arise in they midst be not a ephemeral affair of a few week but a prolonged endeavor to pursue the ideal of a single god in 615 the first company of muslim convert break from the confine religious area of mecca and journey into abyssinium where they could practice they faith in peace this move convince the kureisch of the sincerity of they opponent for they be almost strong enough to merit the name and compel they to believe a little in the force lie behind this strange manifestation of religious zeal in they midst mahomet do not at this time seem to have be definitely range against the kureisch he be still on negotiable term with they and they be a little distrustful of he capacity and ignorant of he power the stage by which he develop from a discredited citizen obsess by one idea into a political opponent worthy of they best steel and bravest man be necessarily gradual and indeed the prophet himself have no knowledge of the role mark out for he by he own personality and the destiny of arabium the cause of islam stand as yet in parlous condition half-formulated unwieldy await the mould hand of persecution to develop it into a political and social system chapter vi severance do you see al-lat and al-ozza and manat the third idol beside these be the exalted female and truly they intercession be to be expect -- _ the kuran _ -lrb- last two line excise later by mahomet -rrb- the little band of convert drive by the kureisch to seek peace and freedom in abyssinium remain for two year in they country of refuge but in 615 return to mecca for reason which have never be fully explain though it be easy in the light of future event to discover the motive behind such a move mahomet be not yet convince of the impossibility of compromise neither be the powerful party among the kureisch utterly indifferent to mahomet 's ancestry as a member of the house of hashim and he position as the husband of khadijah he have be respect among man for he uprightness before he affront they prejudice by scorn they god he power be daily become a source of strife and faction within the city and the kureisch be not averse from attempt to come to term mahomet for he part as far as the scanty evidence of history unfold he state of mind seem to have be almost desperately anxious to effect a understanding with the kureisch he cause still journey by perilous way and at the time hope of he future achievement be apparently dependent upon the goodwill of the dominant meccan party the story run that the chief man of mecca be discuss within the kaaba the affair of the city mahomet come to they and recite sura liii -- the star -- a fulgent psalm in praise of god and heavenly joy when he come to the verse : do you see al-lat and al-ozza and manat the third beside he insert : verily these be the exalted female and truly they intercession may be expect they kureisch be rejoice at this homage to they deity and speedily welcome mahomet 's change of front but he disquiet return moodily to he house where gabriel appear to he in stern rebuke : thou hast repeat before the people word i never give to thee and mahomet whether conscience-stricken by he lapse from the muslim faith or convince that compromise with the kureisch be impossible and also undesirable in face of he grow power quickly repudiate the whole affair which have be unquestionably bear of impulse or possibly a adventurous mood that prompt he to see what would happen if he minister to the prejudice of the kureisch it must be acknowledge however that repentance for he homage to heathen idol be the mainspring of he recantation for the period immediately follow be one of hardship and persecution for he and he transitory lapse injure he cause appreciably with the brethren of he faith the attempt be honourably make and only fail by mahomet 's swift realisation that he acknowledgment of lat and ozza as spirit sanction the worship of they image by he fellow-citizen and this he stern monotheism could not for a moment entertain the muslim with number that increase very slowly be harry afresh by the kureisch as soon as mahomet have withdraw he concession and most of they be force at length to return to abyssinia he pathetic little band wander from city to city doubtful of ever attain security and uncertain of its ultimate destiny be the prototype in its vagrancy of that larger and confident band which cast aside its tradition and the city of its birth head by a spirit heroic in disaster and supreme in faith to find its goal in the foundation of a new order for arabium chief among they be othman and rockeya and these be the only one who return to mecca for the rest remain in abyssinium until after the migration to medina in fact until after mahomet have carry out the expedition to kheibar left without any supporter within the city mahomet be expose to all the vituperation and insult which he recent refusal of compromise have bring he the kureisch now direct all they energy towards persuade abu talib to repudiate he nephew if once this could be effect the kureisch would have a free hand to pursue they desire to exterminate the muslim and to overthrow the prophet 's power he be immune from bodily attack chiefly because of abu talib 's position in the city as nominal head of the house of hashim no kureisch could run the risk of alienate so great a number of fellow-citizen and a personal attack upon abu talib 's nephew could but have that result dark and stormy as the muslim destiny appear during this period of transition from religious to political conception nevertheless it be now enrich by the conversion of two of the most influential character upon its later fortune -- hamza and omar many story have be weave round they discovery of the truth of islam and by read between the line later commentator may discover the force at work to induce they to take this dubious step it be beyond question that mahomet 's personality be the move factor in the conversion of each for each relate a incident which serve peculiarly to illustrate the prophet 's magnetism hamza the lion of god and a son of abd-al-muttalib in he old age be accost by a slave girl as he pass on he way through the city she tell he breathlessly that she have see the lord mahomet insult and revile by abu jahl and be unprotected and alone he could only suffer in silence hamza listen to she story with indignation and determine to revenge the insult to he uncle and foster-brother for by the tie of kinship they be one in the kaaba he publicly declare he allegiance to islam and revenge upon abu jahl the injury he have inflict upon he kinsman hamza never repent of he championship of mahomet the adventurous fortune of islam satisfy he warrior-spirit and under mahomet 's guidance he help to control and direct its military zeal until it have perforce establish its religion through the sword mahomet 's personal magnetism have draw he irresistibly to the religion he uphold so steadfastly and in the face of revilement and danger omar be mahomet 's bitterest enemy and have prove he ability by he persistent opposition to islam he be fear by all the company of religionist that have take up they precarious quarter near mahomet he be visit the house of he sister fatima when he hear murmur of someone recite he inquire what it be and learn with anger that it be the sacred book of the abhorred muslim sect he sister and zeid she husband tremblingly confess they adherence to islam and await in terror the probable result omar be about to fall upon zeid but he wife interpose and receive the blow herself at the sight of he sister 's blood omar pause and then ask for the volume so that he might judge the message for himself for he be a writer of no mean standing fatima insist that he should first perform ablutions so that he touch might not defile the sacred book then omar take it and read it and the strength and beauty of it smite he he feel upon he the insistence of a divine command and straightway ask to be lead before mahomet that he might unburden he conviction to he he gird on he sword and come to the prophet 's house as he rap upon the door a companion of mahomet 's look through the lattice and at the sight of omar with buckled sword flee in despair to he master but mahomet reply : let he enter if he bring good tiding we will reward he if he bring bad news we will smite he yea with he own sword so the door be open and mahomet advance ask what be he mission omar answer : o prophet of god i be come to confess that i believe in allah and in he prophet allah akbar -lrb- god be great -rrb- reply mahomet gravely and all the household know that omar have become one of themselves the conversion of omar be infinitely important to islam and the adherence of this impetuous and dauntless mind be directly due to the strength and steadfastness of mahomet 's faith in himself and he message omar be a influential personage among the kureisch quick-tempered but keen as steel and rejoice in strife he stand out among the many warrior-soul to whom islam give the opportunity of tasting in its fullness the splendor of spear mahomet have indeed gather around he a group of man who be remarkable for they character and influence upon islam ali the warrior par excellence abu bekr statesman and counsellor othman the soldier hamza and omar be not merely blind follower but forceful personality contribute each in he own manner towards those asset of endurance leadership and unshaken faith which ensure the continuance of the medinan colony and its ultimate victory over the kureisch omar 's conversion do not have the effect of soften the kureischite fury on the contrary the event seem to have stimulate they to further persecution as if they have some foreshadowing of they wane power and have determine with a desperate energy to quell for ever if it might be this discord in they midst they next step be to try a introduce the political element into this conflict of faith by put a ban upon the house of hashim and confine it to abu talib 's quarter of sheb this act instigate mainly by abu jahl who now become prominent as the most terrible of mahomet 's persecutor have a very notable effect upon he position as well as upon the quality of the cause for which he party be contend for the first time the political aspect of islam obtrude itself mahomet 's follower be now not only the opponent of the kureischite faith and the enemy of they idol but they be also they political foe and have draw the whole house of hashim into faction against the ruling power -- the omeyyad house moreover mahomet and he companion now shut up and almost besiege within a definite quarter of the city be preclude from all attempt to spread they faith mahomet have secure he little company of follower but cut off from the rest of the city he cause remain stationary neither gain nor lose adherent during the year 617-619 the sura of this period show some of the discouragement he feel at the time but through they all beat a note of endurance and confidence : god be continually behind he cause therefore that cause will prevail against all obstacle mahomet have become more familiar with the jewish scripture and many of the sura be recapitulation of the life of jewish hero especial preference be give to abraham as mythical founder of he race and to lot as the typical example of one righteous man send to warn the iniquitous the style have certainly mature and in so do have lose much of its primal fire it be still stir and vibrant but passage of almost bald narrative be interpose shadow upon the shine floor of he original zeal he have become increasingly reiterative too -- a quality easily attain by those who have but one message in this case a message of warning and exhortation and be feverishly anxious to brand its urgency upon the heart of they fellow-men confine within so limited a area he energy recoil upon itself and the despondency that so easily beset man of action when that necessity be deny they overcome he mind only at the yearly pilgrimage be he able to gain a hearing from he meccan brethren and then say the chronicler bitterly none would believe the hashim could not trade or intermarry with any outside they clan and there seem no chance of circumstance remove they disability mahomet 's hope of embrace all mecca in he faith waver and flee until it seem as if allah no longer protect he choose but after two year of negation and impotence a end to the persecution of the muslim be in sight and in 619 the ban be remove legend have it that when the chief of the kaaba go to look upon the document they find it devour by ant and take this as a sign of the displeasure of they god the ban be thus remove by supernatural agency when its prolongation would have mean final disaster for mahomet in the light of later knowledge it be evident that the removal of the ban be the result of the exertion of abu talib and it be owe to he high reputation among the kureisch that they pardon he turbulent and blasphemous nephew at the end of two year also the muslim be considerably weaken both in stay power and reputation they be now allow to go freely in the city and the immediate prospect seem certainly brighter for mahomet when there fall the greatest blow that could have afflict he sensitive spirit khadijah he companion and sustainer through so many troublous year die in 619 have bear with he all he reviling and discouragement he source of strength even when there appear no prospect of the abatement of he hardship much less for the success of he cause mahomet 's grief be too profound for the pass shadow of it even to darken the page of the kuran he pay she the compliment of silence but she memory be continually with he even when he have take many fairer woman to wife ayesha in all the insolence of beauty scoff at khadijah 's age and lack of comeliness : be i not dearer to thee than she be no by allah cry mahomet for she believe when no one else believe it be she strength of character and sweetness of mind that impel he to utter the amazing word -- amazing for he time and environment seventh-century arabium -- woman be the twin-half of man but fortune or allah have not finish the strong affliction whereby mahomet be force to cast off from he mooring and venture into strange and perilous sea five week after the death of he wife come the death of he uncle abu talib if the first have be a catastrophe affect he courage and quietude of mind this be calculate to crush both himself and he companion abu talib be well love by mahomet who manifest throughout he life the strongest capacity for friendship but more important than the personal grief be the loss of the one man whose effort bridge over the widen gulf between himself and the kureisch as such he death be irreparable damage to mahomet 's safety from they hostility abu lahab it be true touch a little by the sorrow crowd so thickly upon he nephew protect he for a time but very soon withdraw he support and join the opposition range against abu lahab and abu jahl with they influential following and lack the support hitherto provide by abu talib mahomet perceive that a crisis be fast approach he band be too numerous to be ignore or even tolerate by the kureisch but against such odds as mecca 's most powerful citizen mahomet be too wise to attempt to resist there seem no other way but the withdrawal of he little concourse to such place of safety as would enable they to strengthen themselves and prepare for the inevitable struggle for supremacy no more conversion of importance have take place since omar 's and hamza 's allegiance to islam and now three year have pass mahomet feel increasingly the need for they exodus from the city of he birth it be not evident from the chronicler that he have any definite political aim whatever when he first consider the plan of evacuation he motive be simply to obtain peace in which he might worship in he own fashion and win other to worship with he with this idea in mind he cast about for a suitable resting-place for he small flock and discover what he imagine he goal in taif a village south-east of mecca upon the eastern slope of jhebel kora taif be situate on the fertile side of this mountain range the side remote from the sea it stand amid a wealth of garden and be renown for its fruit and flower thither in 620 mahomet set out fill with the knowledge of he invincible mission strong in he power to conquer and persuade zeid he slave and foster-child be he only companion and together they have resolve to convert taif to the one true religion but they adventure be doom to failure and though we have necessarily brief description of it all mahomet 's biographer naturally pass quickly over so painful a scene there be sufficient evidence to show how really disastrous they venture prove the chief man of the city remain unconvinced and at last the populace in one of those blind fury that attack crowd at the sight of impotence egg on the rabble to stone they chase from the city sore bleeding and despairing mahomet find shelter in one of the hill garden of the locality there he be solace with fruit by some kindly owner of the place and there he remain meditate in profound dejection at he failure but still with supreme trust in the support of he god o lord i seek refuge in the light of thy countenance it be thine to cleanse away the darkness and to give peace both for this world and the next in this valley of nakhlum too so run the tale he be console by genie who refresh he after the fashion of angel uphold the weary prophet in the wilderness mahomet be now in dire strait he could not return to mecca at once because the object of he taif journey be know as taif have spurn he so he be force to halt in hira until he obtain the protection of mutaim a influential man in mecca and after some difficulty make he way back to the city discredit and solitary except for he former follower for some month he rest in obscurity and contempt at mecca gain none to he cause but still fill with the fervent conviction of he future triumph which neither waver nor falter the divine fire which uphold he during the period of he violent persecution burn within he soul and never be he steadfastness of character and faith in himself and he mission more fully manifest than during these despondent month he now begin to seek in greater measure the society of woman although the consuming sexual life of he later year have hardly awaken while khadijah be with he he remain faithful to she but she bright presence once withdraw he be impel by a kind of impassioned seek to the quest for she substitute and not find it in one woman to continue he search among other he now married sawda a nonentity with a certain physical charm but no personality and sue for the hand of ayesha the small daughter of abu bekr mahomet at this time be not bless with many riches he frugal anxious life lead he to perform many small duty of he household for himself he food be coarse and often scanty and he live among he follower as one of themselves it be no small tribute to he singleness of mind and lofty character that in the dreary intercourse of daily life live in that primitive communal fashion which admit of no illusion and scarcely any secret he retain by the force of personality the reverence of the faithful and ever in this hour of defeat and negation remain they leader and lord -- the symbol in fact of they loyalty to allah and they supreme belief in he guidance and care chapter vii the choose city medina city of exile and despairing beginning destine to achieve glory by difficult way only to be eclipse finally by its mightier neighbor and mistress become rather by chance than by design the scene of mahomet 's struggle for temporal power and he ruthless wield of the sword for god and islam the city lie north-east of mecca on the opposite side of the mountain spur that skirt the eastern boundary always weakly people it remain from immemorial time a arena of strife for it be on the borderland the boundary of several tribe and be far enough north for the outer wave of syrian disturbance to fling they vary tide upon its shore -- a meager city always fiercely at civil warfare impotent unfertile in the dark day of judaea 's humiliation at the hand of titus two jewish tribe the kainukua and the koreitza outcast and desolate even as they have be warn in they time of dominion light upon medina in desperate search for a dwelling-place and a respite from persecution and forthwith take possession of the little hill-girt town they settle there drive out or conciliate the former inhabitant until in the fourth century they tenuous prosperity be disturb by the inroad of two bedouin tribe the benus aus and the benus khazraj the desert be wide and these tribe be familiar with its manifold opportunity and devious way against such a foe who swoop down suddenly upon the city plunder and then escape into the limitless unknown the jew have no chance of reprisal before long the benus aus and khazraj have subjugate the jewish community and they dominion in medina be only weaken by they devastating quarrel among themselves the city therefore offer a peculiar opening for the teaching of islam within it its religious life indeed be vary and chaotic jew arabian idolater immigrant from christian syrium tear by schism throng its public place and this confusion of faith sharpen the religious and debate instinct of its people the ground be thus break up for the reception of the new creed of one god and of he messenger who have already divide mecca into believer and heretic and who be speak of in the city with that awe that attach itself to distant marvel intercourse with mecca be chiefly carry on at the time of the yearly pilgrimage the greater pilgrimage only undertake during dzul hijj corresponding then to we march and in dzul hijj 620 come a band of stranger over the hill along the toilsome caravan route to the kaaba the goal of they intention the shrine of all they prayer they perform all the necessary ceremony at mecca and be proceed to mina a small valley just east of mecca for the completion of they sacred duty when they be accost by mahomet the prophet be despondent and sceptical of he power to persuade though he belief in allah 's might never waver he have fail so far to produce any decisive impression upon the meccan people but might there not be another town in arabium which would receive he message the little band of pilgrim seem to he send in answer to he self-distrust and he failure at taif as eclipse by this sudden success the caravan return to its native city and there remain little for mahomet to do except to wait for the arrival of next year 's pilgrim and to keep shine and ambient the flame of he religious fervor he remain in mecca virtually on sufferance and rapidly recognize the uselessness of attempt any further conversion he hope be now definitely set on medina and to this end he seem to devoted himself more than ever to the perusal and interpretation of the jewish scripture the portion of the kuran write at this time contain little else than bible story tell and retell to the point of weariness lot of course be the characteristic figure but we also have the life story of abraham mose jonah joseph and many other the style have suffer a marked diminution in poetic quality it have become reiterative and even labor he continue he practice of allude to current event which at medina he be to pursue to the extent of make the kuran a kind of spasmodic history of he time as well as a elementary text-book of law and morality in one of the sura -- the cow -- mahomet make first mention of that comfortable doctrine of cancel by which later verse of the kuran cancel all previous revelation deal with the same subject if these prove contradictory : whatever verse we cancel or cause thee to forget we bring a better or its like knowest thou not that god have power over all thing there be not much record in the kuran of the influence of christian thought upon islam we have a few story of elizabeth and mary and scatter allusion to the despise prophet of the jew but the great body of christian think its central dogma of incarnation and redemption pass mahomet entirely by for he mind be practical and not speculative and indeed to himself no less than to he follower the fundamental of christianity be of necessity too philosophic to be realize with any intensity of belief the christian virtue of meekness and resignation too might be respect in the abstract -- passage in the kuran and tradition assure we they be -- but they be so utterly antagonistic to the fierce free nature of the arab that they never enter into he religious life mahomet revere the founder of christianity and place he with john in the second heaven of he immortal but though he be secure among the teacher of the world he can never compete with the omnipotence and glory of the prophet during the period of mahomet 's life immediately precede he departure to medina we have he personal appearance describe in detail by alus he be a man of medium stature with a magnificent head and a thick flow beard he eye be black and ardent he jaw firm but not prominent he look a upstanding man of open countenance benignant and powerful bearing between he shoulder the sign of he divine mission he have great patience say alus and in nowise despise the poor for they poverty nor honor the rich for they possession nor if any take he by the hand to salute he be he the first to relinquish he grasp he live openly among he disciple hold frequent converse with they mend he own clothes and even shoe a frugal liver and a fervent preacher of the flaming faith within he he become at this time betroth to ayesha the splendid woman now just a merry child who be to keep she reign place in he affection until the end of he life daughter of abu bekr she unite in herself for mahomet both policy and attractiveness for by this betrothal he become of blood-kin with abu bekr and thereby strengthen he friend 's allegiance the union mark the inauguration of he policy of marriage alliance by which he bind the supporter of he faith more closely to he either through he own marriage with they daughter or the bestowal of he offspring upon they ayesha be lovely and imperious with a luxurious but shrewd nature and she counsel be always seek by mahomet other woman appear frequently like comet in he sky flame for a little into brightness and disappear into conjugal obscurity but ayesha 's star remain fix even if it be transitorily eclipse by the brilliance of a new-comer sexual relation hold for mahomet towards the end of he life a peculiar potency bear of he intense energetic nature he seek the society of woman because of the mental clarity that for he follow any expression of emotion he be one of those man who must express -- the artist in fact but a artist who use the medium of action not that of literature painting or music poète il ne connut que la poésie d'action and like napoleon he introspection be completely overshadow by he consuming energy therefore emotion be to he unconsciously the means by which this immortal energy of mind could be conserve and he use it unsparingly ayesha have reveal for we the most intimate detail of mahomet 's life and it be due to she that later tradition be enable to represent he as a man among man he appear to we fierce and subtle by turn impetuous and calculate a man who never miss a opportunity and gauge exactly the effort need to compass any intention to he every fortress have its key and every man he price he be as keen a politician we he be a religious reformer but before all he pay homage to the sword prime artificer in he career of conquest but in those confidently intimate tradition hand down to we from he immediate entourage and especially from ayesha we find he alternately passionate and gentle wear he power with conscious authority mild in he treatment of the poor terrible to he enemy autocratic intolerant with a strange magnetism that bind man to he the mystery envelop great man even in they lifetime among primitive race creep down in these document to hide much of he personality from we but he work proclaim he energy and tireless organising power even if the mythical allegoric element predominate in the earlier tradition the man who undertake and achieve the gigantic task of organise a new social and political as well as religious order may be justly credit with call forth and center in himself the vivid imagination of that most credulous age the year 620-621 pass chiefly in expectation of the greater pilgrimage when the disciple from medina be to come to report progress and to confirm they faith the momentous time arrive and mahomet go almost fearfully to meet the nucleus of he future kingdom in acaba a valley near mina but he fear be groundless for the little party have be faithful to they leader and have also increase they number they meet in secret and we may picture they a little diffident in so strange a place ever expectant of the swift descent of the kureisch and they own annihilation withal they be enthusiastic and confident of they leader one be irresistibly remind in reading of this meeting of that little outcast band from judea which ultimately prevail over cæsar imperator through its mighty quality of faith the accredited word of the first pledge give at acaba be traditionally extant they combine curiously religious moral and social covenant and assert even at that early stage the headship of the prophet over he servant : we will not worship any but god we will not steal neither will we commit adultery nor kill we child we will not slander in any wise nor will we disobey the prophet in anything that be right the convert then depart to they native city for mahomet do not deem the time yet ripe enough for migration thither he possess the difficult art of wait until the effectual time should arrive and there be no doubt that by now he have form definite plan to set up he rule in medina when there should be sufficient supporter there to guarantee he success musab a meccan convert of some learning be depute to accompany the medinan citizen to they city and give instruction therein to all who be willing to study the muslim creed for yet another year mahomet be to possess he soul in patience but it be with feeling of far greater confidence that he await the passing of time more than ever he become sure of the guide hand of allah that point indisputably to the stranger city as the goal of he striving this city hold a goodly proportion of jew therefore the connection between he faith and that of judaism must be continually emphasise we have see how large a space jewish legend and history fill in the contemporary sura of the kuran and mahomet 's friendship with israel increase noticeably during he last two year at mecca he pay they the honor of take jerusalem as he kiblum or holy place to which all believer turn in prayer and the starting-place for he immortal midnight journey be the sacred city encompass the temple of the lord no account of this journey appear except in the tradition crystallize by al bokharil but there be one short mention of it in the kuran sura xviii glory be to he who carry he servant by night from the sacred temple of mecca to the temple that be more remote ie jerusalem the vision however loom so large in he follower ' mind and exercise so profound a influence over they regard for mahomet that it throw some light upon the measure of he ascendancy during he last year at mecca and establish beyond dispute the inspired character of he prophetship in the imagination of the few believer there have be solemn and wordy dispute by theologian as to whether he make the journey in the flesh or whether he spirit alone cross the dread portal divide we night from the celestial day he be lie in the kaaba so run the legend when the angel of the lord appear to he and after have purge he heart of all sin carry he to the temple at jerusalem he penetrate its sacred enclosure and see the beast borak greater than ass smaller than mule and be tell to mount the faithful still show the spot at jerusalem where he steed 's hoof mark the ground as he spurn it with fly foot with gabriel by he side mount on a beast mighty in strength mahomet scale the appalling space and come at last to the outer heaven before the gate that guard the celestial realm the angel knock upon the brazen door and a voice within cry : who art thou and who be with thee i be gabriel come the answer and this be mahomet and behold the brazen gate that may not be unclosed for mortal man be fling wide and mahomet enter alone with the angel he penetrate to the first heaven and see adam who interrogate he in the same word and receive the same reply and all the heavenly hierarchy even unto the seventh heaven john and jesus joseph enoch aaron mose abraham acknowledge mahomet in the same word until the two come to the tree call sedrat beyond which no man may pass and live whose fruit be shine serpent and whose leaf be great beast round which flow four river the nile and the euphrate guard it without and within these the celestial stream that water paradise too wondrous for a name awed but undaunted mahomet pass alone beyond the sacred tree for even the angel could not bear any longer so fierce a glory and come to al-m ` amur even the hall of heavenly audience where be seventy thousand angel he mount the step of the throne between they serried rank until at the touch of allah 's awful hand he stop and feel its icy coldness penetrate to he heart he be give milk wine or honey to drink and he choose milk hadst thou choose honey o mahomet say allah all thy people would be save now only a part shall find perfection and mahomet be trouble bid my people pray to I fifty time a day at the resistless mandate mahomet turn and retrace he step to the seventh heaven where dwelt abraham the people of the earth will be in nowise constrain to pray fifty time a day return thou and beg that the number be lessen so mahomet return again and again at abraham 's command until he have reduce the number to five which the father of he people consider be sufficient burden for he feeble subject to bear wherefore the five period set apart for prayer in the muslim faith be proportionately sacred and with this divine mandate the vision cease with he hope now set on found a earthly dominion with the help of allah he have perforce to consider the political situation and to mature he policy for deal with it as soon as event prove favourable the achievement of the persian on the greek frontier have already attract he attention in 616 there be a allusion to the battle and the greek defeat in the kuran and a vague prophecy of they ultimate success for mahomet be in sympathy with the greek empire see that from the point of view of arabia it be the less formidable enemy but really the event of such outlying territory only trouble he in regard to medina for he whole thought be centre now upon the choose city of he dream he follower become less aggressive in mecca when they know that the prophet have the nucleus of a new colony in another city persecution within mecca therefore die down considerably and the period be one of pause upon either side the kureisch watch to see what the next move be to be mahomet carefully and secretly mature he plan during this year there fall a drought upon mecca follow by a famine which the devout attribute directly to divine anger at the rejection of the prophet 's heavenly message and which mahomet interpret as the punishment of god and this doubtless add to the sum of reason which impel he to relinquish he native town from this time until the hegira or flight from the city event in the world of action move but slowly for mahomet he be careful not to excite undue suspicion among the kureisch and we can imagine he silent and preoccupy fulfil he duty among they visit the kaaba and mingle somewhat coldly with they daily life still keep he purpose immutable he seek to strengthen the faith of he follower for the trial he know must come the kuran thus become more important as the mouthpiece of he exhortation the sura of this time resound with word of encouragement and confidence he be about to become the leader of a perilous venture in honor of god the reflex of the expectancy in the heart of the muslim may be trace in he message to they they whole world as it be wait breathless quiet and tense for the record of the year 's achievement in medina and for the time appoint by god but how far they leader 's action be the result of painstaking calculation a insight into the quality and energy of man a prevision startling in its range and accuracy they never suspect but serene in they confidence they hold they magnificent faith in the divine guidance and in the inspiration of they prophet chapter viii the flight to medina knowest thou not that the dominion of the heaven and of the earth be god 's and that ye have neither patron nor helper save god -- _ the kuran _ the expectancy which burn like revivify fire in the heart of the meccan muslim kindle and nourish by they leader himself be to culminate at the time of the yearly pilgrimage in 622 in that month come the great concourse of pilgrim from yathreb to mecca among they seventy of the faithful who have receive the faith at medina head by they teacher musab and strengthen by the knowledge that they be before long to stand face to face with they prophet musab have report to mahomet the success of he mission in the city and have prepare he for the advent of the little band of follower secure for islam secrecy be essential for the muslim from medina be in heart stranger among they own people in such a precarious situation that any treachery would have mean they utter annihilation if not at the hand of they countryman who would doubtless throw in they lot with the stronger certainly at the hand of the kureisch the implacable foe of islam in whose territory they fearfully be the rite of pilgrimage be accordingly perform faithfully though many breathe more freely as they depart for the last ceremony at mina all be now complete and the medinan party prepare to return when mahomet summon the faithful by night to the old meeting-place in the gloomy valley of akaba about seventy man and two woman of both medinan tribe the benus khazraj and the benus aus assemble thus in that barren place under the brilliant night sky of arabium to pledge themselves anew to a unseen untried god and to the service of he prophet who as yet count but few among he follower and whose word carry no weight with the great one of they world to this meeting mahomet bring abba he uncle younger son of abd-al-muttalib a weak and insignificant character who have endear himself to mahomet chiefly because of he doglike devotion he be not a convert but he revere he energetic nephew too highly and be also too greatly in awe of he to imagine such a thing as treachery he be in part a guarantee to the khazraj of mahomet 's good faith in part a asset for he against the kureisch for he family be still influential in mecca the two make they way from the city unaccompanied by steep and stony way until they come to akaba and mahomet see await he that concourse summon by he persistence and tireless faith -- a concourse part of himself almost he own child upon which all he hope be now set come thus into that circle of face illumine dimly by the torch which prudence even now urge they to extinguish he could not but feel some foreshadowing of the mighty future that await this little gathering as yet impotent and tremulous but bear within itself the seed of that loyalty and courage that be to spread the faith over half the world when the greeting be over abba step forward and speak while the line of dark face close around he in earnest scrutiny ye man of the benus khazraj this my kinsman dwelleth amongst we in honor and safety he clan will defend he but he preferreth to seek protection from you wherefore ye khazraj consider the matter well and count the cost then answer bara who stand for they in position of chief : we have listen to you word we resolution be unshaken we life be at the prophet 's service it be now for he to speak mahomet step forward into the circle of they glance and with the solemnity of the occasion urgent within he recite to they verse of the kuran whose fire and eloquence kindle those passionate soul into a enthusiasm glowing with a sombre resolve and prompt they to stake all upon they enterprise at the end of those tumultuous word he assure they that he would be content if they would pledge themselves to defend he and if we die in thy defense what reward have we paradise reply mahomet exalted raise he hand in token of he belief in allah and the certitude of he cause then arise a murmur deep and long the protestation of loyalty that threaten to rise into triumphant acclamation but abba the fearful of the party stay they in dread of spy so the tumult die down and bara take upon himself the authority of he fellow stretch forth he hand to mahomet and with they clasp the second pledge of the akaba be seal they break up swiftly dread to prolong they meeting for danger be all around they and the air heavy with suspect treachery and they apprehension be not groundless for the kureisch have hear of they assembly through some secret messenger though not until the medinan caravan with its concourse of the faithful and the unbeliever be well on its homeward way across the dreary desert path which lead to mecca from medina they wrath be intense and in fury they pursue it but either they be ignorant as to which road the party have take or the medinan elude they by greater speed for they return disconsolate from the pursuit have only succeed in find two luckless man one of whom escape but the other sa would ibn obada be drag back to mecca and subject to much brutality before he ultimately make he escape to he native city the kureisch be not content with attempt reprisal against medina or possibly they be enraged because they have effect so little for they recommence the persecution of islam at mecca with much violence from march until April they harass the believer in they city impose restriction upon they and in many case inflict bodily harm upon mahomet 's unfortunate and now defenceless follower the renew persecution doubtless give a add impetus to the prophet 's resolve to quit mecca indeed the time be fully ripe and with the prescience that continually characterise he in he role of leader of a religious state he feel that now the ground be prepare at medina emigration of the muslim from mecca could not fail to be advantageous to he the command be give in April 622 and find immediate popularity except with a few malcontent who have large interest in they native city then begin the slow removal of a whole colony the family of abu talib 's quarter of mecca tranquilly forsake they birthplace in orderly group take with they they household treasure until the neighborhood show tenantless house fall into the swift decay accompany neglect in such a climate barricade door and gaping window fill only with a immense feeling of desolation and the blankness which overtake a city when its humanity have depute to another abide place weed grow in the desert street and over all lay a fine film of dust the almost impalpable effort of the desert to merge once more into itself the territory wring from it by human will the effect of this emigration upon the kureisch can hardly be estimate they be amaze and helpless before it for with they wrath hot against mahomet it be as if they antagonist have melt into insubstantial vapor to leave they enraged and breathless pursue a phantom continually elusive so silent be the emigration that they be only make aware of it when the quarter be almost desert scattered group of traveller journey along the desert track have evoke no hostility and no treachery break the loyalty to islam at mecca the kureisch be indeed outwit and only become conscious of the subtlety of they antagonist when he plan be accomplish but in spite of the seemingly favourable situation the leader tarry because the lord have not as yet give he command to emigrate the very natural hesitation of mahomet be only characteristic of he he know very well what issue be at stake and be not anxious to burn he boat rashly indeed he bear upon he shoulder at this time all the responsibility of the future of he little flock who so confidently resign they fortune into he hand if he scheme at medina should fail he know that nothing would save he from kureischite fury and he also feel great reluctance in leave mecca himself for at that time it could not but mean the knell of he hope of gain he native city to he creed he must have foresee he establishment of power in medina and possibly he have vision of its extension to neighbouring tribe but he could not have foresee the humiliation of he native city at he foot glad at last to receive the faith of one whom she now regard as the sovereign potentate of arabian territory and with they friend and guide remain abu bekr and alus -- abu bekr because he would not leave he companion in prayer and persecution and alus because he valor and enthusiasm make he a protector against possible attack here be the opportunity for the kureisch they know the extent of the emigration and that abu bekr and alus be the only muslim of importance leave except the prophet they determine to make one last attempt to coerce into submission this fantastic but resolute leader who possess in supreme measure the power of win the faith and devotion of man tradition have it that mahomet 's assassination be definitely plan and mahomet assuredly think so too when he discover that a man from each tribe have be choose to visit he home at night the motive can hardly have be assassination but doubtless the chief be prepare to take rather strong measure to restrain mahomet and this action finally decide the prophet that delay be dangerous at this crisis in he fortune he have two staunch helper who do not hesitate to risk they life in he service and with they he anticipate he foe alus be choose to represent he beloved master before the menace of the kureisch mahomet put he into he own bed and array he in he sacred green mantle then as legend have it take a handful of dust he recite the sura ya sin which he himself reverence as the heart of the kuran and scatter the dust abroad he call down confusion upon the head of the unbeliever with abu bekr he then flee swiftly and silently from the city and make he way unseen to the cave of thaur a few mile outside its boundary around the cave of thaur cluster as many and as beautiful legend as surround the stable at bethlehem the wild pigeon fly out and in unharmed screen the prophet by they untroubled presence from the searching of the kureisch and a thorn tree spread she branch across the mouth of the cave support a spider 's frail and glistening web which be renew whenever a friend visit the two prisoner to bring food and tiding here mahomet and abu bekr henceforward know as the second of two remain until the fierceness of the pursuit slacken asma abu bekr 's daughter bring they food at sundown and what news she could glean from the rumor that be abroad and from the lip of alus there be very real danger of they surprise and capture but once more mahomet 's magnificent faith in god and he cause never waver abu bekr be afraid for he master : we be but two and if the kureisch find we unarmed what chance have we we be but two reply mahomet but god be in the midst a third he look unflinchingly to allah for succor and protection and he faith be justified he thanksgiving be contain in the kuran : god assist you prophet formerly when the unbeliever drive he forth in company with a second only when they two be in the cave when the prophet say to he companion ` be not distressed verily god be with we ' and god send down he tranquillity upon he and strengthen he with host ye saw not and make the word of those who believe not the abased and the word of god be the exalt at the end of three day the kureischite search abate and that night mahomet and abu bekr decide to leave the cave two camel be bring and food load upon they by asma and she servant the fastening be not long enough to tie on the food wallet wherefore asma tear she girdle in two and bind they round it so that she be know to this day among the faithful as she of two shred after a prayer to allah in thanks for they safety mahomet and abu bekr mount the camel and sally forth to meet what unknown destiny should await they on the road to medina they rapidly gain the sea-coast near asfan in comparative safety secure from the attack of the kureisch who would not pursue they quarry so far into a strange country the kureisch have indeed considerably abate they anger against mahomet he be now safely out of they midst and possibly they think themselves well rid of a man whose only object from they point of view be to stir up strife and they feel that any resentment against either himself or he kin would be unnecessary and not worth they pain with remarkable tolerance for so revengeful a age they leave the family of mahomet and abu bekr quite free from molestation nor do they offer any opposition to ali when they find he have successfully foiled they and he make he way out of the city three day after he leader have quit it mahomet and abu bekr journey on two pilgrim make they way solitary but unappalled to a strange city whose temper and disposition they but faintly understand but evidence as to its friendliness be not want and these be renew when abu bekr 's cousin a previous emigrant to medina meet they half-way and declare that the city wait in joy and expectation for the come of its prophet after some day they cross the valley of akik in extreme heat and come at last to coba a outlying suburb at medina where weary and apprehensive mahomet rest for a while prudently desire that he welcome at medina might be assure before he venture into its confines he entry into coba savor of a triumphal procession the people throng around he camel shout the prophet he be come mingle they cry with homage and wonder awe that the divine servant of whom they have hear so much should appear to they in so human a guise a man among they verily one of themselves mahomet 's camel stop at the house of omm kolthum and there he elect to abide during he stay in coba for he possess throughout he life a reverence for the instinct in animal that characterise the eastern race of all time there dismount he address the people bid they be of good cheer and give they thanks for they joyous welcome : ye people show you joy by give you neighbor the salvation of peace send portion to the poor bind close the tie of kinship and offer up you prayer whilst other sleep thus shall ye enter paradise in peace for four day mahomet dwelt in coba where he have encounter unfailing support and friendship and there be join by alus he memory of coba be always grateful for at the outset of he doubtful and even dangerous enterprise he have receive a good augury before he set out to medina he lay the foundation of the mosque at coba where the faithful would be enable to pray accord to they fashion undisturbed and beneath the favor of allah and decree that Friday be to be set apart as a special day of prayer when address be to be give at the mosque and the doctrine of islam expound even as early as this mahomet feel the mantle of sovereignty descend upon he for we hear now of the first of those ordinance or decree by which in later time he rule the life and action of he subject to the last detail clearly he perceive himself a leader among man who have it within he power to build up a community follow he own dictate which might by consolidation even rival those already existent in arabium he be take command of a weak and factious city and he realize that in he hand lay its prosperity or downfall he be in fact the arbiter of its fate and of the fate of he colleague who have dare all with he but he could not stay long in coba while the final assay upon the medinan remain to be undertake and so we find he on the fourth day of he sojourn make preparation for the entry into the city it be undertake with some confidence of success from the message already send to coba and prove as triumphal a entry as he former one the populace await he in expectation and reverence and hail he as they prophet the mighty leader who have come to they deliverance they surround he camel al-caswa and the camel of he follower and when al-caswa stop outside the house of abu ayub mahomet once more receive the beast 's augury and sojourn there until the building of the mosque as al-caswa enter the paved courtyard mahomet dismount to receive the allegiance of abu ayub and he household then turn to the people he greet they with word of good cheer and encouragement and they respond with acclamation for seven month the prophet lodge in the house of abu ayub and he buy the yard where al-caswa halted as a token of he first entry into medina and a remembrance in later year of he abide place during the difficult time of he inception the decisive step have be take the die be now cast it be as if the little fleet of human soul have finally cast its mooring and venture into the unpathed water of temporal dominion under the command of one whose skill in pilotage be as yet unknown many change become necessary in the conduct of the enterprise of which not the least be the change of attitude between the leader and he follower mahomet heretofore religious visionary and teacher become the temporal head of a community and in time the leader of a political state the change aspect of he mission can never be over-emphasise for it alter the tenor of he thought and the progress of he word all the poetry and fire inform the early page of the kuran depart with he reception at medina except for occasional flash that illumine the chronicle of detailed ordinance that the book have now become this apparent death of poetic energy have creep gradually over the kuran help on by the controversial character of the last two meccan period when he attempt the conciliation of the jewish element within arabium with that long-sightedness which already discern medina as he possible refuge in reality the whole energy of he nature be transmute from he word to he action and therein he find he fitting sphere for he be essentially the doer one whose work be the expression of he secret whose personality in fact be only gauge by he deed as a result of he political leadership the despotism of he nature inherent in he conception of god inevitably reveal itself he have postulate a be who hold mankind in the hollow of he hand whose decree be absolute among he subject now that he be to find a earthly kingdom under the guidance of allah the majesty of divine despotism overshadow its prophet and enable he to impose upon a willing people the same obedience to authority which foster the military idea we must perforce believe in mahomet 's good faith there be a tendency in modern time to think of he as a man who knowingly play upon the credulity of he follower to establish a sovereignty whereof he should be head but no student of psychology can support this conception of the prophet of islam there be a subtle _ rapprochement _ between leader and people in all great movement that divine instinctively any imposture mahomet use and mould man by reason of he faith in he own creed the establishment of the worship of allah bring in its train the aggrandisement of he prophet but it be not achieve by profanation of the source whence he greatness come mahomet be the last of those leader who win both the religious devotion and the political trust of he follower he work out he sovereignty perforce and create he own _ milieu _ but more than all he diffuse around he the tradition of loyalty to one god and one state with sword for artificer which outlive its creator through century of arabian prosperity stone by slow stone he empire be build up a edifice owe its contour to he complete grasp of detail and he dauntless energy the last day at mecca have show he a careful schemer the early day at medina prove he capacity as leader and he skill in organization and government chapter ix the consolidation of power the infidel moreover will say : thou art not send of god say : god be witness enough betwixt I and you and whoever have knowledge of the book -- _ the kuran _ mahomet now establish at medina at once begin that careful planning of the life of he follower and the ceaseless foster of he own idea within they that endear he to the believer as leader and lord and enable he in time to prosecute he design against he opponent with a confidence in they faith and loyalty he grasp of detail be wonderful without haste and without coercion he subdue the turbulent faction within medina and he own perfervid follower to discipline as despotic as it be salutary mahomet become what circumstance make he by reason of he mighty gift of mould those man and force that come he way he impress he personality upon he age but the material fashioning of he energy the flower of he creative art draw its formative sustenance from the soil of he surroundings the time for admonition with the voice of one cry in the wilderness the time for praise and poesy for the expression of that rapt immortal passion fill he mind as he contemplate god all these be past and have become but a linger brightness upon the stormy urgency of he later life now he flock demand from he organization leadership political and social prevision therefore the full force of he nature be reveal to we not so much as heretofore in the kuran but rather in he institution and ordinance he enmity and conciliation he have become not only the prophet but the lawgiver the statesman almost the king he first act after he establishment in the house of abu ayub be the join together in brotherhood of the muhajerim and ansar these be two distinct entity within medina the muhajerim -lrb- refugee -rrb- have either accompany they master from mecca or have emigrate previously the ansar -lrb- helper -rrb- comprise all the convert to islam within the city itself these party be now join in a close bond each individual take another of the opposite party into brotherhood with himself to be accord the rights and privilege of kinship mahomet take as he brother alus who become indeed not only he kinsman but he military commander and chief of staff the wisdom of this arrangement which last about a year and a half -- until in fact its usefulness be outworn by the union of both the medinan tribe under he leadership -- be immediate and far-reaching it enable mahomet to keep a close surveillance over the medinan convert who might possibly recant when they become aware of the hazard involve in partnership with the muslim it also give a coherence to the two party and allow the muhajerim some foothold in a alien city not as yet unanimously friendly and the muhajerim have need of all the kindliness and help they could obtain for the first six month in medina be try both to they health and endurance so that many repent they venture and would have return if the ansar have not come forward with ministration and gift and also if they chance of reach mecca alive have not be so precarious the climate at medina be damp and variable hot day alternate with cold night and in winter there be almost continuous rain the meccan use to the dry hot day and night of they native city where but little rain fall and even that become absorb immediately in the parched ground endure much discomfort even pain before become acclimatised fever break out amongst they and it be some month before the epidemic be stay with the primitive medical skill at they command nevertheless in spite of they weakness and the difficulty of they position in these first seven month the mosque of mahomet be build legend say that the prophet himself take a share in the work carry stone and tool with the humblest of he follower and we can well believe that he do not look on at the labor of he fellow-believer and that he consuming zeal prompt he to forward in whatever way be necessary the work lie to he hand the medinan mosque build with fervent heart and anxious prayer by the muslim and they leader contain the embryo of all the later masterpiece of arabian architecture -- that art unique and splendid which develop with the islamic spirit until it culminate in the glorious temple at delhus whose exponent have give to the world the palace of southern spain the mysterious remote beauty of ancient granada in its embryo minaret and dome its slender arch and delicate tracery it express the latent poetry in the heart of islam which the claim of allah and the fiercely jealous worship of he have hitherto obscure for like jahweh of old allah be a exacting spirit who suffer no emotion but worship to be lord of he people 's heart the mosque be square in design make of stone and brick and work with the best skill of which they be capable the kiblum or direction of prayer be towards jerusalem symbolic of mahomet 's desire to propitiate the jew and finally to unite they with he own people in a community with himself as temporal head opposite this be the bab rahmah the gate of mercy and general entrance to the holy place range round the outer wall of the mosque be house for the prophet 's wife and daughter little stone building of two or three room almost hut where mahomet 's household have its home -- rockeya he daughter and othman she husband fatima and alus sawda and ayesha soon to be he girl-bride and who even now show exceed loveliness and force of character mahomet himself have no separate house but dwelt with each of he wife in turn favor ayesha most and as he harem increase a house be add for each wife so that he entourage be continually near he and under he surveillance on the north side the ground be open and there the poorer follower of mahomet gather live upon the never-failing hospitality of the east and its ready generosity in the necessity of life as soon as the mosque be build organised religious life at medina come into be a daily service be institute in the mosque itself and the heaven-sent command to prayer five time a day for every muslim be enforce five time in every turn of the world allah receive he supplicatory incense at dawn at noon in the afternoon at sunset and at night the muslim render he due reverence and praise to the lord of he welfare thank allah he supreme guide and votary for the gift of the prophet guide and protector of the faithful lustration before prayer be institute as symbolic of the believer ' purification of heart before enter the presence of god and provision for the ceremony make inside the mosque the public service on Friday institute at coba be continue at medina and consist chiefly of a sermon give by mahomet from a pulpit erect inside the mosque whose sanctity be proverbial and unassailed thus the seed be sow of a corporate religious life the embryo from which the arabian military organization its polity even its social system be to spring in spite of the increase number of the ansar there still remain a party in medina the disaffected who have not as yet accept the prophet or he creed over these mahomet exercise a strict surveillance in accordance with he conviction that a successful ruler leave nothing to providence that he can discover and regulate for himself trust in god but tie you camel by this mean as well as by personal influence and exhortation disaffected be control and ultimately convert into good muslim for the more cautious of they -- those who wait to see how event would shape -- soon assure themselves of mahomet 's capacity and the weakly passive be catch in the swirl of enthusiasm surround the prophet that continually draw unto itself all condition of man within its ever-widening circle have organise he own follower and secure they immunity from internal strife mahomet be force to turn he attention to the jewish element within he adopted city and to decide swiftly he policy towards the three israelite tribe who comprise the wealthier and trade population of medina from the first mahomet 's desire be in the direction of a federal union wherein each party would follow he own faith and have control of he own tribal affair and finances save when the necessity of mutual protection against enemy call for a union of force again mahomet frame he policy upon the doctrine of opportunism he ultimate aim be beyond doubt to unite both jew and medinan under he rule in a common religious and political bond but he recognize the present impossibility of such action in view of the jew ' greater stability and the weakness of he party within the city he negotiation and conciliation with the jew offer one of the many example of he supreme skill as a statesman the jews themselves take almost unawares by the suddenness of mahomet 's entry into they civic life agree to the treaty he propose and acquiesce unconsciously in he subtle attempt to merge the two faith into a whole wherein islam would be the dominant factor when mahomet make jerusalem he kiblum or direction of prayer and emphasise the connection between jewish and arabian history they suffer these advance and agree to a treaty which would have form the foundation of a political and social convergence and ultimate absorption of they own nation mahomet know that federalism with the jew be a necessary step to he desire end and therefore he draw up a treaty wherein mutual protection against outward enemy as well as against internal sedition be assure hospitality be to be freely render and demand and neither party be to support a infidel against a believer guarantee for mutual security be exchange and it be agree that each should be free to worship in he own fashion the treaty throw light upon the clan-system still obtain in seventh-century arabia the jew be they own master in the order of they life as be the medinan tribe even after many year of neighborhood and frequent interchange of commerce and mutual assurance the most significant political work achieve by mahomet the planting of the federal and later the national idea in arabium in place of the tribal one be thus inaugurate and throughout the development of he political power it will be see that the struggle between himself and the surround people virtually hinge upon the acceptance or rejection of it the jew with they narrow conception of the political unit could acquiesce neither in federalism nor in union and as soon as mahomet perceive they incapacity he become implacable and either drive they forth or compel they submission by terror and slaughter but for the present he policy and prudence dictate compromise and he be strong enough to achieve he will the political and social problem of he embryo state have find temporary solution and mahomet be free to turn he attention to external foe in he attitude towards those who have persecute he he evince more than ever he determination to build up not only a religious society but a powerful temporal state the meccan would have be content to leave matter as they stand and be quite prepared to let mahomet establish he power at medina unmolested provide they be give like immunity from attack but from the begin other plan fill the prophet 's thought and though revenge for he privation be declare to be the instigator of he attack on the kureisch trade the determine motive must be look for much more deeply the great project of the harassment and final overthrow of the kureisch be dimly foreshadow in mahomet 's mind and he become ever more deeply aware of the part that must be play therein by the sword as yet he hesitate to acclaim war as the supreme arbiter in he own and he follower ' destiny for the valor of he levy and the skill of he leader be unproved the foray undertake before the battle of bedr be really nothing more than essay by the muslim in the game of war and it be not until proof of they power against the kureisch have be give that mahomet give up he future policy into the keep of that bright disastrous deity that lure all son of man in a measure it be true that the clash between mahomet and the kureisch be unavoidable but that it loom so large upon the horizon of medina 's policy be due to the prophet 's determination to strike immediately at the wealth and security of he rival lust for plunder too add its weight to mahomet 's reprisal against mecca even if that city be content to leave he in peace still the kureischite caravan to bostra and syria pass so near to medina be too tempting to be ignore along these age-old route meccan merchandise still travel its devious way at the mercy of sun and desert storm and the unheeding fierceness of that cataclysmic country a prey to any marauding tribe and dependent for its existence upon the strength of its escort and since plunder be sweeter than labor every chief with swift rider and good spearman hope to gain he riches at meccan expense but they attempt be for the most part abortive chiefly because of the lack of cohesion and generalship until mahomet none really constitute a serious menace to the kureischite wealth in muharram 622 -lrb- April -rrb- the hegira take place and six month suffice mahomet to establish he power securely enough to be able to send out he first expedition against the kureisch in ramadan -lrb- December -rrb- of the same year the party be lead by hamza whose soldier quality be only at the beginning of they development and probably consist of a few muslim horseman on they beautiful swift mount and one or two spearman and possibly several warrior skilled in the use of arrow they sally forth from medina and go to meet the caravan as it prepare to pass by they town the kureisch have place abu jahl in command -- a man whose invincible hatred for islam and the prophet have manifest itself in the persecution at mecca and whose hostility increase as the muslim power advance the caravan be guard but none too strongly and hamza 's troop pursue and have almost attack it when a bedouin chief of the desert more powerful than either party interpose and compel the muslim to withdraw while he forbid abu jahl to pursue they or attempt revenge so the caravan continue its way unmolested into syrium and there exchange its gum leather and frankincense for the silk and precious metal the fine stuff and luxurious drapery which make the syrian market a vivid medley of sheen and gloss store with bright color and burnished surface shimmering in the hot radiance of the east in jan 623 the caravan set out homeward on its lone journey o'er the desert and again the muslim send out a attack party in the hope of secure this larger prize but the kureisch be wise and have provide themselves with a stronger escort before which the muslim could do nothing but retreat -- not however before they have send a few tentative arrow at the cavalcade obeida they leader and a cousin of mahomet give the command to shoot and be renowned henceforth as he who shoot the first arrow for islam after a month another essay be make upon a northward-bound caravan by sa would again without success for he have miscalculate date and miss he quarry by some day each leader on he return to medina be receive with honor by mahomet as one who have show he prowess in the cause of isalm and present with a white banner so far the prophet himself have not take the field now however in the summer and autumn of 623 in spite of sign that all be not well with the jewish alliance at home mahomet take the field in person and conduct three larger but still unsuccessful expedition the last attack levy of October 623 consist of 200 man but even then mahomet be able to effect nothing against the kureischite escort the attempt raid have nevertheless a important outcome for by this exhibition of strength mahomet succeed in convince a neighbor desert tribe hitherto friendly to mecca of the advisability of seek alliance with the muslim the treaty between mahomet and the bedouin tribe mark the beginning of a significant development in he foreign polity like the roman and all military nation he know the worth of make advantageous alliance while he be clear-sighted enough to realize that the struggle with mecca be inevitable during the month precede the battle of bedr he conclude several treaty with desert tribe and it be to this policy he owe in part he power to maintain he aggressive attitude towards the kureisch for with the alliance of the tribe around the caravan route mahomet could be sure of hamper the meccan trade while the prophet be in the field he leave representative to care for the affair of he city these representative be designate by he and be always member of he personal follow alus and abu bekr be most often choose until all prove he worth as a warrior and so usually accompany or command the expeditionary force the representative hold they authority direct from mahomet and have in all matter the identical power of the prophet during he absence it speak well for the loyalty and acumen of these minister that mahomet be enable to leave the city so often and so confidently and that the government continue as if under he personal supervision whether the jew be overbold because of mahomet 's frequent absence or whether they now become conscious of the trend of mahomet 's policy towards the absorption of the jewish element within the city into islam will never be make clear beyond the fact that the jewish tribe be not enthusiastic in they union with the muslim and that they national character preclude they from accept a alliance that threaten the autonomy of they religion it be however certain that the discontent of the jew voice itself more and more loudly as the year advance the sura of the period be full of reviling and threat against they and form a greater contrast come after the later meccan suras wherein israel be honor and its hero hold up as example a few jew have be win over to he cause but the mass show themselves either hostile or indifferent to the federal idea as yet no definite sundering of relationship have occur but everything point to a speedy dissolution of the treaty unless one side or the other moderate its view the autumn of 628 see mahomet fully establish in medina he have make he worth know by he energy and organise power by he devotion to allah and he zeal for the faith he have found the medinan regard he already as they natural leader and he have definitely adopt they city as he headquarters through he skill as a statesman and he loyalty to a idea he work out the foundation of he future state and if the latter month of 623 see he not yet strong enough to overcome the meccan at least he be so firmly establish that he could afford to dispense with any overture to the increasingly hostile jew and he have gain sufficient adherent to allow he to contemplate with equanimity the prospect of a sharp and prolonged struggle with the kureisch chapter x the secession of the jew _ even though thou shouldst bring every kind of sign to those who have receive the scripture yet thy kiblum they will not adopt nor shalt thou adopt they kiblum nor will one part of they adopt the kiblum of the other -- the kuran _ mahomet realize the position of affair at medina too acutely to allow of he undertaking in person any predatory expedition against the kureisch during the autumn and winter of 623 the jew be chafe under he tacit assumption of state control and although they murmuring have not reach the recklessness of strife still both they leader and the muslim perceive that they disaffection be inevitable insecurity at home however do not prevent he from send out a expedition in rajab -lrb- October -rrb- of that year under abdallah rajab be a sacred month in the mohamedan calendar one in which war be forbid strictly therefore in send out a expedition at all just then mahomet be transgress against the law of that religion which purge of its idolatry he claim as he own but it be a favourable opportunity to attack the kureischite caravan on its way to taif and therefore mahomet recked nothing of the prohibition taif be a very distant objective for a expeditionary band from medina and that mahomet contemplated attack upon he enemy by a company so far remove from its base be convince proof should any be need of he confidence in he follower ' prowess and he conciliation of the tribe lie between the two hostile city seal order be give to abdallah with instruction not to open the parchment until he be two day south of medina at sunset on the second day he come with he eight follower to a well in the midst of the desert there under the few date palm which give they rough shelter he break the seal and read : when thou readest this write depart unto nakhlum between taif and mecca there lie in wait for the kureisch and bring thy comrade news concern they as abdallah read he mind alternate between apprehension and daring and turn to he companion he take counsel of they mahomet have command I to go to nakhlum and there await the kureisch also he have command I to say unto you whoever desireth martyrdom for islam let he follow I and whoever will not suffer it let he turn back as for I i be resolve to carry out the command of god 's prophet then one and all the eight companion assure he they would not forsake he until the quest be achieve at dawn they resume they march and arrive at length at nakhlum where they encounter the kureisch caravan laden with spice and leather now it be the last day of the month of rajab wherein it be unlawful to fight wherefore the muslim take counsel say : if we fight not this day they will elude we and escape but the prophet 's imply command be strong enough to induce initiative and hardihood in the small attack party they bear down upon the kureisch showering arrow in they path so that one man be kill and several wound the rest forsake they merchandise and flee leave behind they two prisoner whose retreat have be cut off abdallah be leave in possession of the field and joyfully he return to medina bear with he the first plunder capture by the muslim but he return lead mahomet into a quandary from which there seem no escape politically he be bind to approve abdallah 's deed religiously he could neither laud it nor share the fruit of it for day the spoil remain undivided but abdallah be not punish or even reprimand meanwhile the jew and the kureisch vie with one another in execrate mahomet and even he own people murmur against he it be clearly time that a authoritative sanction should be give to the deed and accordingly in the sura the cow we have the revelation from allah proclaim the greater culpability of the infidel and of those who would stir up civil strife : they will ask thee concern war in the sacred month say : to war therein be bad but to turn aside from the cause of god and to have no faith in he and in the sacred temple and to drive out its people be worse in the sight of god civil strife be worse than bloodsh no possible doubt must be cast in this and similar case upon mahomet 's sincerity the kuran be the vehicle of the lord he have use it to proclaim he unity and power and he warning to the unrighteous now that islam have recognize he August and indissoluble majesty and have accord the throne of heaven and the governance of earth to he indivisibly the world be split up into believer and unbeliever the kuran therefore must of necessity cease to be merely the proclamation of divine unity that it have be and become the vehicle for definite order and regulation the outcome of those theocratic idea upon which mahomet 's creed be found the justification would not appeal to the people unless allah 's sanction support it and mahomet realize with all he ardor of faith that the transgression be slight compare with the result achieve towards the progress of islam the prophet therefore receive with allah 's approval a fifth of the spoil but the captive he release after receive ransom this say the historian be the first booty that mahomet obtain the first captive they seize and the first life they take the significance of the event be vividly feel throughout islam and abdallah its hero receive at mahomet 's hand the title of amir-al - momirim commander of the faithful -- a title which recall inseparably the cruelty and magnificence the glamour and rapacity of arabian bagdad under haroun-al-raschid the valorous enterprise have now be achieve the kureisch caravan be despoil and the kureisch themselves work into fury against the prophet 's insolence but more than all the channel of mahomet 's policy of warfare become thereby so deeply carve that he could not have efface it have he desire henceforth he creative genius limit itself to the deepen of its course and the direction of its outlet the jew have not rest content with murmur against mahomet 's rule they seek to embarrass he by active sedition one of they first attempt against mahomet 's regime be to stir up strife between the refugee and helper in this they would have be successful but for mahomet 's efficient system of espionage a method upon which he rely throughout he life fail to foment a rebellion in secret they proceed to open hostility and the muslim jealous for they faith retaliate by contempt and estrangement during the winter of 623 personal attack be make by the mob upon mahomet the people be hound on by they leader to stone the prophet but he be warn in time and escape they assault the popular fury be merely the reflex of a fundamental division of thought between the oppose party the jewish and muslim system could never coalesce for each claim the dominance and ignore all compromise the age-long hallowed tradition of the jew which support a theocracy as unyielding as any conception of divine sovereignty preach by mahomet find themselves face with a new creative force rapidly evolve its own legend and strong enough in its enthusiasm to overwhelm they own the rabbi feel that mahomet and he warrior hero -- alus omar othman and the rest -- would in time dislodge from they high place they own peculiar saint just as they see mahomet with abu bekr and he personnel of administrator and informer already override they own councillor in the civil and military department of they state the old regime could not amalgamate with the new for that would mean absorption by its more vigorous neighbor and the jewish spirit be exclusive in essence and separatist perforce mahomet take no pain to conciliate he ally they have make a treaty with he in the day of he insecurity and he be grateful but now he position in medina be beyond assailment and he be indifferent to they goodwill as they aggression increase he deliberately withdraw he participation in they religious life and sever he connection with they rite and ordinance the kiblum of the muslim whither at every prayer they turn they face and which he have declare to be the temple at jerusalem scene of he embarkation upon the wondrous midnight journey be now change to the kaaba at mecca what prevision or prophetic inspiration prompt mahomet to turn he follower ' eye away from the north and fix they upon they former home with its fierce and ruthless heat the materialisation it seem of he own inexorable and passionate aim henceforth mecca become unconsciously the goal of every muslim the desire city to be fight for and die for the dwelling-place of they prophet the crown of they faith the jewish fast of atonement which play so important a part in semite faith and doctrine have be make part of the muslim ritual in 622 while a federal union still seem possible but the next year such a amalgamation could not take place in ramadan -lrb- dec to January -rrb- therefore mahomet institute a separate fast for the faithful it be to extend throughout the sacred month in which the kuran have first be send down to man its sanctity become henceforth a potent reminder for the muslim of he special duty towards allah of the reverence meet to be accord to the divine upholder of islam during all the day of ramadan no food or drink might pass a muslim lip nor might he touch a woman but the moment the sun 's rim dip below the horizon he be absolved from the fast until dawn no institution in islam be so peculiarly sacred as ramadan and none so scrupulously observe even when by the revolution of the lunar year the fast fall during the bitter heat of summer it be a characteristic ordinance and one which emphasise the vivid muslim apprehension of the part play by abstention in they religious code at the end of the fast -- that be upon the sight of the next new moon -- mahomet proclaim a festival eed-al-fitr which be to take the place of the great jewish ceremony of rejoice at this time too mahomet evidently bent on consolidate he religious observance and regulate they conduct decree a fresh institution with parallel in no religion -- the adzan or call to prayer mahomet wish to summon the believer to the mosque and there be no way except to ring a bell such as the christian use which rite be displease to the faithful indeed mahomet be report later to have say the bell be the devil 's musical instrument but abdallah a man of profound faith and love for islam receive thereafter a vision wherein a spirit in the guise of man clothe in green garment appear to he and summon he to call the believer to prayer from the mosque at every time set apart for devotion call ye four time ` god be great ' and then ' i bear witness that there be no god but god and mahomet be he prophet come unto prayer come unto salvation god be great there be no god but he ' a true vision declare mahomet go and teach it to bilal that he may call to prayer for he have a better voice than thou when bilal a slave receive the command he go up to the mosque and climb its highest minaret he cry aloud he summons add at each dawn : prayer be better than sleep prayer be better than sleep and when omar hear the call he go to mahomet and declare that he have the previous night receive the same vision and mahomet answer he praise be to allah therewith be inaugurate the most characteristic observance in islam the one which impress itself very strongly upon the western traveller as he hear in the dimness of every dawn before the sun 's edge be see in the east the voice of the muezzin from each mosque in the city proclaim they changeless message they insistent command to prayer and praise he see the city leap into magical life the dark figure of the muslim hurry to the holy place that lie shimmering in the golden light of early day and know that behind this outward manifestation lie a faith at root incomprehensible by reason of its aloofness from the advance stream of modern think a faith spiritually impotent since it flee from mysticism generate a energy which have expend its vital force in conquest only to find itself too intellectually backward and physically sluggish to gather in prosperity the fruit of its attainment its lack of imagination its utter ignorance of the lure of what be strange have be responsible for its achievement of stupendous task for the drive energy behind be never appal by anticipation nor check by any realisation of come stress and terror and the same quality that lead the muslim to world-conquest thereafter cause they downfall for they mind could not visualise that world of imagination necessary for any creative science while they be not attuned in intellect for the reception of such generative idea as have contribute to the philosophic and speculative development of the western world all the characteristic which distinguish islam to the making and the blasting of its fortune may be find in embryo in the small medinan community for they leader by he own creative ardor impose upon he flock every idea which shape the form and content of its future career from its rise even to its zenith and decline chapter xi the battle of bedr _ they plot but god plot and of plotter be god the best -- the koran _ mahomet 's star now continually upon the ascendant flame into sudden glory in ramadan of the second year of the hegira its brilliance and the bewilderment cause by its triumphant continuance be reflect in all the chronicle and legend cluster around that period if nakhlu have be a achievement worthy of god 's emissary the victory which follow it be a irrefutable argument in favor of mahomet 's divinely ordain rulership of the arabian people it appear to the muslim and even to contemporary hostile tribe nothing less than a stupendous proof of they championship by god muslim poet and historian be never weary of expatiate upon the glory achieve by they tiny community with little but abide zeal and supreme faith with which to confound they foe no military event in the life of the prophet call forth such rejoicing from he own lip as the triumph at bedr : o ye meccan if ye desire a decision now have the decision come to you it will be better for you if ye give over the struggle if ye return to it we will return and you force though they be many shall never avail you aught for god be with the faithful through the whole of sura viii the strain of exultation run the presentment in dull word of fierce and splendid courage work out into victory in the midst of the storm and lightning of heaven such a earth-shaking event the effect of which reach far beyond its immediate environment receive fitting treatment at the hand of all arabian chronicle so that we be enable to reconstruct the event precede the battle itself its action and result with a vivid completeness that be often deny we in the lesser event the caravan under abu sofian about thirty or forty strong which have elude mahomet and reach syrium be now due to return to mecca with its bartered merchandise mahomet be determine that this time it should not escape and that he would exact from it full penalty of the vengeance he owe the meccan for he insult and final expulsion from they city as soon as the time for its approach draw nigh mahomet send two scout to hama north of medina who be to bring tiding to he the moment they catch sight of its advance dust but abu sofian have be warn of mahomet 's activity and turn off swiftly to the coast keep the seaward route while he send a messenger to mecca with the news that a attack by the muslim be meditate dhamdham send by he anxious leader arrive in the city after three day ' journey in desperate haste across the desert and fling himself from he camel before the kaaba there he beat the camel to its knee cut off its ear and nose and put the saddle hind foremost then rend he garment he cry with a loud voice : help o kureisch you caravan be pursue by mahomet with one accord the meccan warrior anger by the news that spread wildly among the populace assemble before they holy place and swear a great oath that they would uphold they dignity and avenge they loss upon the upstart follower of a demented leader every man who could bear arm prepare in haste for the expedition and those who could not fight find young man as they representative in the midst of all the tumult and eager resolution to exterminate the muslim so run the tale there be few who would listen to atikah the daughter of abd-al-muttalib i have dream three night ago that the kureisch will be call to arm in three day and will perish behold the fulfilment of my dream woe to the kureisch for they slaughter be foretell but she be treat as of no account a woman and frail and the army set out upon its expedition in all the bravery of that pomp-loving nation with abu jahl at its head and accompany by slave girl with lute and tabret who be to gladden the eye and minister to the pleasure of its warrior the kureisch army move on through the desert towards its destine goal but we be tell by a recorder dream of disaster accompany it nor be its sleep tranquil for the evil portent that appear therein thus apprehensive but dauntless the meccan army advance to safra one day 's march from bedr where it encounter messenger from abu sofian who announce that the caravan have elude the muslim and be safe then arise a debate among the kureisch as to they next course many desire to return to mecca deem they purpose accomplish now that the caravan be secure from attack but the bolder amongst they be anxious to advance and the more deliberative favor this also because by so do they might hope to overawe mahomet into quietude but before all there be the safety of they home to consider and they be fearful lest a attack by a hostile tribe the benus bekr might be make upon mecca in the absence of its fight man upon receive assurance of good faith from a tribe friendly to both they dismiss that fear and resolve to advance so that they might compel mahomet to abandon he attack upon they merchandise this proceeding seem a reasonable and politic measure until it be view in the light of its consequence and indeed judge from ordinary calculation such a host could have no other effect than a complete rout upon such a small and inefficient band as mahomet 's follower therefore in estimate if they do at all carefully the force match against they the kureisch find themselves materially invincible though they have not reckon the spiritual factor of enthusiasm which transcend they own physical superiority these event have take over nine day and meanwhile mahomet have not be idle he two spy have bring news of the approach of the caravan but beyond that meager information he know nothing the kureischite activity thereafter be swallow up in the vastness of the desert which draw a curtain as effective as death around the oppose army but news of the caravan 's advance be sufficient for the prophet with the greatest possible speed he collect he army -- not we be tell without some opposition from the fearful among the medinan population who be anxious to avoid any act which might bring down upon they the ruthless meccan host legend have count as she own this gathering together of the muslim before bedr and translate the engendered enthusiasm into imaginative fact have weave a pattern of barbaric color wherein deed be transform by the spirit which prompt they the hero pant for martyrdom and each crave to be among the first to pour forth he blood in the sacred cause they crowd to battle on camel and on foot abu bekr in he zeal walk every step of the way which he regard as the road to supreme benediction mahomet himself lead he valorous band mount on a camel with alus by he side have before he two black flag bear by standard-bearer whose strength and bravery be the envy of the rest he possess only seventy camel and two horse and the rider be choose by lot behind march or ride the flower of islam 's warrior and statesman -- abu bekr omar hamza and zeid whose name already resound through islam for valiant deed abdallah with mahomet 's choose leader of expedition the rank and file three hundred strong regardless of what peril might overtake they intent on plunder and the uphold of they vigorous faith sally forth from medina as soon as they could be equip and take the direct road to mecca on reach safra for reason we be not tell they turn west to bedr a halting-place on the syrian road possibly hope to catch the caravan on its journey westwards towards the sea but abu sofian be too quick for they mahomet 's scout have only reach bedr reconnoiter and retire when abu sofian approach the well within its precinct and demand of a man belong to a neighbouring tribe if there be stranger in the vicinity i have see none but two man o chief he reply they come to the well to water they camel but he have be bribe by mahomet and know well they be muslim abu sofian be silent and look around he carefully suddenly he start up as he catch sight of they camel ' litter wherein be visible the small date stone peculiar to medinan palm camel from yathreb he cry quickly these be the scout of mahomet then he gather he company together and depart hastily towards the sea he despatch a messenger to mecca to tell of the caravan 's safety and a little later hear with joy of he countryman 's progress to oppose mahomet doth mahomet indeed imagine that it will be this time as in the affair of the hadramate -lrb- slay at nakhlum -rrb- never he shall know that it be otherwise but the army that cause such joy to abu sofian create nothing but apprehension in mahomet 's camp he know the caravan have elude he and now there be a greater force more than three time he own advance on he hurriedly he convene a council of war whereat he whole follow urge a immediate advance the excitement have now fully capture they tumultuous soul and there be more danger for mahomet in a retreat than in a attack a immediate advance be therefore decide upon and mahomet send alus on the day before the battle to reconnoitre as they be near bedr the same journey which tell abu sofian of the presence of the muslim also result for they in the capture of three water-carrier by alus who drag they before mahomet where they be compel to give the information he want and from they he learn the disposition and strength of the enemy the valley of bedr be a plain with hill flank it to the north and east on the west be small sandy hillock which render progress difficult especially if the ground be at all damp from recent rain through this shallow valley run the little stream have at its south-western extremity the spring and well which give the place its importance as a halting stage command of the well be of the highest importance but as yet neither army have obtain it for the muslim have not take up they final position and the kureisch be hem in by the sandy ground in front of they the wretched water-carrier be bring before mahomet at first declare they know nothing but after some time confess they be abu jahl 's servant and where be the abide place of abu jahl beyond the sand-hill to the east and how many of he countryman abide with he they be numerous i can not tell they be as numerous as leaf on one day nine the next ten then they number 950 man exclaim the prophet to alus take the man away mahomet now call a council of general and it be decide to advance up the valley to the farther side of the well so as to secure the water-supply and destroy all except the one they themselves need this maneuver be carry out successfully and the muslim army encamped opposite the kureisch at the foot of the western hill and separate from they adversary by the low sandy hillock in front of they a rough hut of palm branch be build for mahomet whence he could direct the battle and where he could retire for counsel with abu bekr and for prayer both side have now make they disposition and there remain nothing but to wait till daybreak that night the rain descend upon the doomed kureisch like the spear of the lord whelm they sandy soil and churn up the rise ground in front of the troops into a quagmire of bottomless mud the cloud be temper towards the higher muslim position and the water drain off the hilly land see the lord be with we he have send he heavy rain upon we enemy declare mahomet look from he hut in the early dawn weary with anxiety for the issue of this fateful hour but strong in faith and confident in the favor of allah then he retire to the hut for prayer and contemplation o allah forget not thy promise o lord if this little band be vanquish idolatry will prevail and thy pure worship cease from off the earth he set himself to the encouragement and instruction of he troops he have no cavalry with which to cover a advance and he therefore order he troops to remain firm and await the oncoming rush until the word to charge be give but on no account be they to lose command of the well draw up in several line they champion in front and mahomet with abu bekr to direct they from the rear the little troop of muslim await the onslaught of they greater foe but dissent have break out among the kureisch general obi one of they best warrior perhaps feel the confident carelessness of the kureisch be misplace want to go back without attack he be overrule after much discussion and some bad feeling by abu jahl who declare that if they refrain from attack now all the land would ring with they cowardice so a general advance be order and the kureisch champion lead the way the battle begin as most battle of primitive time by a series of single combat one champion challenging another to fight the glory of be the first muslim to kill a meccan in this encounter fall to hamza aswad of the kureisch swear to drink of the water of those well guard by the muslim hamza oppose and he first sword stroke sever the leg of aswad but he undaunt crawl on until at the fountain he be slay by hamza before its water pass he lip now three champion of the kureisch come forward to challenge three muslim of equal birth hamza alus and obeida answer the charge and in front of the oppose rank three homeric conflict rage hamza the lion of god and ali the sword of the faith quickly overcome they opponent but obeida be wound before he could spear he man the sight give courage to the kureisch and now the main body of they press on seek to overwhelm the muslim by sheer weight the heavy ground impede they movement and they come on slowly with what anxious expectation on the part of mahomet 's soldier whom they prophet have command to await he signal when the kureisch be near enough mahomet lift he hand : ya mansur amit -lrb- ye conqueror strike -rrb- he cry point with outstretched finger at the close rank bear down upon they paradise await he who lay down he life for islam the muslim with a wild cry dash forward against they foe but the kureisch be brave and they be numerous and the muslim be few and almost untutor the battle rage surge like foam within the narrow valley its wave now roar almost up to the prophet 's vantage ground now retreat in eddy towards the rear of the kureisch under a lower sky whose wind-swept cloud seem to reflect the strife in the heaven behold gabriel with a thousand angel charge down upon the infidel cry mahomet as a blast of wind tear shriek down the valley see muhail and seraphil with they troops rush to the help of god 's choose then as the muslim seem to waver press back by the mass of they enemy he appear in they midst and take a handful of dust cast it in the face of the foe : let they face be confound the muslim catch by the magnetism of mahomet 's presence seize by the immortal energy which radiate from he rally they strength with a shout they bear down upon the kureisch who waver and break beneath this inspired onrush within whose vigor dwelt all mahomet 's surcharged ambition and indomitable aim he command the attack to be follow up at once and the kureisch hamper in they retreat by the marshy ground fall in confusion they rank shatter they champion crush in the welter of spear and horseman sword armor sand blood and the body of man the order go forth from mahomet to spare as much as possible he own house of hashim but otherwise the slaughter be as remorseless as the temper of the muslim ensured of the prophet 's army so tell the chronicle only fourteen be kill but of the kureisch the dead number forty-nine with a like haul of prisoner abu jahl be among those sorely wound but when abdallah see he lie helpless he recognize he and slew he without a word then have cut off he head he bring the prize to mahomet it be the head of god 's enemy cry the prophet as he gaze on it in exaltation it be more acceptable to I than the choicest camel in all arabia the broken remnant of the kureisch army journey slowly back to mecca through the same desert that have see all the bravery and splendor of they advance and the news of they terrible fate precede they all the city be drape in cloth of mourning for there be no distinguished house that do not bewail its dead one alone do not weep -- hind wife of abu sofian go forth to meet she husband what doest thou with unrent garment knowest thou not the affliction that have fall on this thy city i will not weep reply hind until this wrong have be avenge when thou hast go forth hast conquer this accursed then will i mourn for those who be slay this day nay my lord i will not deck myself nor perfume my hair nor come near thy couch until i see the avenging of this humiliation then abu sofian swear a great oath that he would immediately collect man and take the field once more against islam there remain now for the victor but the distribution of the spoil and the decision of the fate of the prisoner the less valuable of these be put to death they body cast into a pit but the muslim take the rest with they hope for ransom the spoil be take up in haste and the prophet repair joyfully to safra where he propose to divide it but there contention arise as be almost inevitable over the distribution of the wealth and so acute do the disaffection become that mahomet reveal the will of allah concern it : and know ye when ye have take any booty a fifth part belongeth to god and to the apostle and to the near of kin and to orphan and to the poor and to the wayfarer if ye believe in god and in that which we have send down to we servant on the day of the victory the day of the meeting of the host as part of he due mahomet take the famous sword dhul ficar which have gather around it as many legend as the weapon of classical hero and which hereafter never leave he whenever he take command of he follower in battle so the muslim flush with victory laden with spoil return to medina whose entire population assemble to accord they triumphal entry abu jahl the sinner be slay cry the little child catch the phrase from they parent ' lip abu jahl the sinner be slay and the foe of islam lay low be cry from the mosque and market-place from minaret and house-top allah akbar islam the great testing day have come and be past in open fight before a host of they foe the muslim with smaller number have prevail the effect upon medina and upon mahomet 's later career can not be overestimate it be indeed a turn point whence mahomet proceed irrevocably upon the road to success and fame reverse hereafter he certainly have and at time the outlook be almost insuperably dark but no misfortune or gloom could dull the splendor of that day at bedr when besides he own slender follow the host of the lord whose turban glow like crown lead by gabriel in golden armor have fight for he and vanquish he foe the glory of this battle be the lamp by which he plan he future win at medina the disaffected be triumphantly gather beneath he banner he position become for the time at least establish no longer do he need to conciliate flatter spy upon the various faction within he wall he prisoner be kindly treat and some convert by these means to the faith he have vainly seek to impose upon they affair within the city be organise and consolidated register be prepare the famous register of omar which be to contain the name of all those who have give distinguished service to the cause of allah and to confer upon they exalted rank the three hundred name inscribed therein be the embryo of a muslim aristocracy constitute in fact a peerage of islam mahomet 's religious ordinance be strengthen and confirm while he faith receive that homage pay to success which have raise its founder from the commander of a small hand of religionist to the chief of a prosperous city the leader of a efficient army the head of a community which hold within itself the future dominion of arabium of western asia southern europe in fact the greater part of the middle world more than ever mahomet perceive that he success lay in the sword bedr set the seal upon he acceptance of warfare as a means of propaganda henceforth the sword become to he the bright but awful instrument through which the will of allah be achieve in the measure that he trust its power and confide to it he own destiny and that of he follower so do war exact of he its ceaseless penalty urge he on continually through motive of policy and self-defence until he become its slave compel to continue along the path appoint he or perish by that very instrument by which he power have be work henceforward he activity consist chiefly of war aggressive and defensive while the religion actuate they receive slighter notice because the main thesis have be establish in he own state and require the force of arm to obtain its supremacy over alien race after bedr the poet and prophet become the administrator and prophet the quietude and meditation of the meccan hill-slope be exchange for the council-chamber and the battlefield and appear upon the background of he anxious life with the glamour and aloofness of a dream-country the inevitable turmoil and preoccupation which accompany the direction of affair take hold upon he life the fervor of he nature its remorseless activity compel he to legislate for he follower with that minute attention to detail almost inconceivable to the modern mind with its conception of the various department of state we see he mainly through tradition but also to a great extent in the kuran direct the humblest detail in the life of the muslim organise they ritual regulate they commerce they usury law they personal cleanliness they dietary they social and moral relation regard the multifarious duty and care of he grow state its almost complete helplessness in its hand for he alone be its guide force it be the clearest testimony to he vital energy he strength and sanity of brain that he be not overwhelm by they and that the creative side of he nature be not crush beyond recovery although confront by the clamorous demand of government and warfare these could not touch he spiritual enthusiasm nor he glowing and changeless devotion to allah and he cause at the end of he long year of rule he could still say with perfect truth my chief delight be in prayer chapter xii the jew at medina and if the people of the book have believe it have surely be better for they : believer there be among they but most of they be perverse -- _ the kuran _ the song of triumph over bedr have scarcely leave the lip of muslim poet when the voice of faction be hear again in medina the jew that stiff-necked nation unimpressed by mahomet 's triumph careful only of its probable effect on they own position which effect they could not but regard as disastrous see that it augur they own submission to a superior power murmur against he success and try they utmost to sow dissension by the publication of contemptuous song through the mouth of they poet and prophetess not only do the jew murmur in secret against he but they try hard to induce member of the original medinan tribe to join with they in a desperate effort to throw off the muslim yoke chief among these defamer of mahomet 's prestige be asma a prophetess of the tribe of benus aus she publish abroad several libellous song upon mahomet but be quickly silence by omeir a blind man devote to he leader who feel he way to she dwelling-place at dead of night and creep past she servant slew she in the midst of she child news of the outrage be bring to mahomet it be expect he would punish omeir but : thou shalt not call he blind but the see reply the prophet for indeed he have do I great service the result of this ruthlessness be the official conversion of the tribe for resistance be useless and they have not like the jew the flame of faith to keep they resistance alive the only alternative to a hopeless blood feud be the adoption of islam but the jew with stubborn consciousness of they own essential autonomy prefer the more terrible alternative and so the defamatory song continue when it be remember that these composition take the place of newspaper be as universal and wield as such influence it be not to be expect that mahomet could ignore the campaign against he abu afak a belated representative of the prophetic spirit of old fire by the ancient glory of israel and its present threaten degradation at the hand of this upstart continue in spite of all warning to publish abroad he contempt and hatred for the prophet it be no time for half-measure with such a ferment as this universal abuse be create the whole of he hard-won power might crumble victor though he be it want only the torch of some malcontent to set alight the flame of rebellion therefore mahomet with he inexorable determination and force of will take the only course possible in such a time the singer be slay by he express command who will rid I of this pestilence he cry and like all strong nature he have not long to wait before he will become the inspired act of another so fear enter into the soul of the people at medina and for a time there be no more disloyal song nor do the populace dare to oppose one who have give so efficient proof of he power but it be not enough for mahomet to have silence disaffection he aim at nothing less than the complete union of all medina under he leadership and in one religious belief to this end he go in shawwal of the second year of the hegira -lrb- jan 624 -rrb- unto the jewish tribe the benus kainukaa goldsmith of medina whose work lay outside the city 's confines there he summon they chief man in the bazaar and exhort they fervently to become convert to islam but the kainukaa be firm in they faith and refuse he with contemptuous coldness o mahomet thou thinkest we be man akin to thine own race hitherto thou hast meet only man unskilled in battle and therefore couldst thou slay they but when thou meetest we by the god of israel thou shalt know we be man therewith mahomet be force to acknowledge defeat and he journey back to the city vow that if allah be please to give he opportunity he would avenge this slight upon islam and he own divinely appoint mission friction between he and the kainukaa naturally increase and it be therefore not long before a pretext arise the story of a jew 's insult to a muslim girl and its avenging by one of she co-religionist be probably only a fiction to explain mahomet 's aggression against this tribe it be uncertain how the first definite breach arise but it be easy to see that whatever the actual _ casus bellus _ such a development be inevitable the anger of the prophet be arouse for be they not presume to oppose he will and that of allah whose instrument he be he marshal he army and put a great white banner at they head give the leadership to hamza and so march forth to attack the rebellious kainukaa for fifteen day the tribe be besiege in its stronghold until at last beaten and discourage face by scarcity of supplies and the certainty of disease it surrender at discretion then be show in all its fullness the implacable despotism conceive by mahomet as the only possible method of government which indeed for those time and with that nation it certainly be the order go forth for the slaying and despoiling of the kainukaa and the grim work begin by the seizure of they armor precious stone gold and goldsmith 's tool but abdallah chief of the khazraj and formerly leader of the disaffected become suppliant for they release he seek audience of mahomet and there petition with many tear for the life of he friend and kinsman but mahomet turn he back upon he abdallah in a ecstacy of importunity grasp the skirt of mahomet 's garment loose thou thy hand cry mahomet while he face grow dark with anger but abdallah in the boldness of desperation reply i will not let thee go until thou hast show favor to my kinsman then say mahomet as thou wilt not be silent i give thee the life of those i have take prisoner nevertheless the exile of the tribe be enforce and mahomet compel they immediate removal from the outskirts of medina the prophet 's later policy towards the jew be hereby inaugurate he set himself deliberately to break up they stronghold one by one and do not swerve from he purpose until the whole of the hate race have be remove either by slaughter or by enforced exile from the precinct of he adopted city he would suffer no one but himself to govern and uproot with he unwavering purpose all who refuse to accept he as lord for about a month affair take they normal and uninterrupted course in medina but in the follow month dzul higg -lrb- march -rrb- the last of that eventful second year a slight disturbance of he steady work of government threaten he follower abu sofian 's vow press sorely upon he conscience until unable to endure inaction further he gather together 200 horseman and take the highway towards medina he travel by the inland road and arrive at length at the settlement of the benus nadhir one of the jewish tribe in the vicinity of medina he harry they palm-gardens burnt they cornfield and kill two of they man mahomet have plunder the meccan wealth he ally should in turn be harass by he victim it be purely a private enterprise undertake out of bravado and in fulfilment of a vow as soon as the predatory attack have be make abu sofian deem himself absolved and prepared to return but mahomet be on he trace for five day he pursue the fly kureisch whose retreat turn into such a headlong rout that they throw away they sack of meal so as to travel more lightly therefore the incident have be know ever since accord to the vivid arab method of description as the battle of the meal-bag but the foe be not worthy of he pursuit and mahomet make no further attempt to come up with abu sofian but return at once to medina the attack have end more or less in fiasco and as a trial of strength upon either side it be negligible the sacred month dzul higg and the only one in which it be lawful to make the greater pilgrimage in far-off mecca be now fully upon he and mahomet feel draw irresistibly to the ceremony surround the ancient and now to he distorted faith he feel compel to acknowledge he kinship with the ancient ritual of arabium and to this end appoint a festival eed-al-zoha to be celebrate in this month which be not only to take the place of the jewish sacrificial ceremony but to strengthen he connection with the rite still perform at mecca of which the kaaba and the black stone form the emblem and the goal in commemoration of the ceremonial slaying of victim in the vale of mina at the end of the greater pilgrimage mahomet order two kid to be sacrifice at every festival so that he people be continually remind that at mecca beneath the infidel yoke the sacred ritual so peculiarly they own by virtue of the abrahamic descent and they inexorable monotheism be be unworthily perform the institution be important as indicate the development of mahomet 's religious and ritualistic conception in the first day of he enthusiasm he be content to enjoin worship of one god by prayer and praise take secondary account of form and ceremony then come the uprooting of he outward religious life and the demand of he embryo state for the manifestation essential to a communistic faith he find israelite belief uncontaminate by the worship of many god and turn to they ritual in the hope of establish with they aid a ceremonial which should incorporate they system with he own fervent faith now find no middle road between separatism and absorption possible with such a people as the jew and unconsciously divine that in no great length of time islam would be sufficient unto itself he turn again to the practice of he native religion and ancestral ceremony henceforth he put forward definitely he conception of islam as a purify and divinely regulated form of the worship follow by he arabian forbear purge of its idol-worship and free from numerous age-long corruption not only in ritual do he mind turn towards mecca it loom before he eye still as the choose city the city of he dream whose conquest and render back purify to the guidance of allah he set before he mind as the ultimate dim-descried goal of all he intermediary war the kiblum have long since be change to mecca thither at prayer every muslim turn he face and direct he thought and now every possible detail of ancient meccan ritual be perform in scrupulous deference to the one god so that when the time come and in fulfilment of he desire he set foot on its soil no part of the ceremony with the linger enthusiasm of he youth still sweet upon they might be omit or be allow to lose its savor through disuse the third year of the hegira begin favourably for mahomet during the first month muharram there be three small expedition against unruly desert tribe the benus ghatafan on the eastern babylonian route be friendly to the kureisch this be undesirable because they might allow the meccan caravan to pass through in safety and the prophet have resolve that it should be despoil by whichever route it journey coast road or arid tableland when therefore he receive news that they be assemble in force at carcarat-al-kadr a desert oasis on the confines of they territory he march thither in haste hope to catch and overcome they before they disperse but the benus ghatafan be too wise to suffer this and when mahomet come to the place he find it desert save for some camel leave behind in the flight which he capture and bring to medina deem it useless to attempt the pursuit of he quarry through the trackless desert the raid in jumad ii -lrb- September -rrb- by zeid be far more successful since the victory at bedr the coast route have be entirely bar for the kureischite caravan and they be force to try the central desert which road lay through the middle tableland lead on to babylonia and the syrian waste the meccan caravan have only reach carada when it be meet by a muslim force under zeid send by the prescience and predatory instinct of mahomet the guard be not strong possibly because the meccan think there be little fear of attack by this route and so zeid be easily able to overcome he foe and secure the spoil which amount to many bale of goods camel trappings and armor the conquerer return elate to medina where he cast the spoil at the foot of the prophet the usual division be make and the whole city rejoice over the wealth it have secure and the increase discomfiture of its enemy meanwhile matter be become urgent between the muslim and the jew neither the murder of they singer nor the expulsion of the kainukaa could silence the voice of jewish discontent which find its most effective mouthpiece in the poet ka ' b al ' ashraf son of a jewess of the tribe of the benus nadhir this man have be righteously indignant at the slaughter of the kureischite champion at bedr the story seem to he so monstrous that he could not believe it be this true he ask the messenger have mahomet verily slay these man by the lord if he have do this then be the innermost part of the earth better than the surface thereof he journey in haste to mecca and when he hear the dreadful news confirm he do he utmost to stir up the kureisch against the murderer as soon as he return he publish verse lament the disgraceful victory purchase at such a price moreover he also address insulting love poem to the muslim woman always with the intent of cause as much disaffection as possible at last mahomet wax impatient and cry : who will give I peace from this ka ' b al ' ashraf mahomet mosleima reply i even i will slay he the method of he accomplishment of this deed be instructive of the estimation in which individual life be then hold mosleima secure the assistance of ka ` b 's treacherous brother -- how we be not tell but most probably by bribe together the two go to the poet 's house by moonlight and beg he company on a discussion of much importance he young wife would have prevent ka ' b sense treachery from the manner and time of the request but he disregard she prayer in the gleam of moonbeam the three walk past the outskirts of the city in deepest converse the subject of which be rebellion against the prophet they come at length to the ravine adjuz a lonely place overhang with ghastly silence and pallid under the white light here they stop and soon he brother begin to stroke the hair of ka ' b until he have lull he into drowsiness then suddenly seize the forelock he shout : let the enemy of god perish ka ' b be pinion while four man of the benus aus slash at he with they sword but he be a brave man and strong determine to sell he life dearly the struggle become furious when i see that relate mosleima through the mouth of tradition i remember my dagger and thrust it into he body with such violence that it penetrate the entire bulk the enemy of god give one cry and fall to the ground then they leave he and hasten to tell they master of the good news mahomet rejoice and be at no pain to conceal he satisfaction ka ' b have make himself objectionable to the prophet and dangerous to islam ka ' b be remove it be well allah akbar islam eastern nation have never be so careful of human life as western and especially as the anglo-saxon people to mahomet the security of he state come before all and if a hundred poet have threaten to undermine he authority he would have have they all slay with equal steadfastness man be bind to die and those who disturb the progress of affair merely suffer more swiftly the universal lot it be obvious that no modern western standard can be set up for mahomet the deed must be interpret by that inflexible will and determination to achieve he aim which lie at the root of all he crime of state but the unfortunate jew go in fear and tremble and they panic be increase when mahomet issue a order to he follower with permission to kill they wherever they might be find he very soon however allow so drastic a command to lapse but not before some have take advantage of he savage policy and after a time he make a new treaty with the jew not at all on the old federal line but guarantee they some sort of security provide they show proper submission to he superior power this treaty smooth over matter somewhat but nevertheless the jew be now thoroughly intimidate and those who be leave live a restricted life wherein fear play the greater part but for the time be mahomet be satisfied and no further punitive act be attempt not many month later he be face with a far greater danger the appearance in force of he old enemy the kureisch burning for vengeance fierce in they hatred of such a despoiler and before they mahomet in the new-found arrogance of he dominion be force to pause chapter xiii the battle of ohod if a wound have befall you a wound like it have already befall other we alternate these day -lrb- of good and evil fortune -rrb- among man that god may know those who have believe and that he may take martyr from among you -- _ the kuran _ the jew have be alternately force and cajole into submission the disaffected have be sweep into temporary loyalty after the triumph at bedr he own follower be magnificently proud of he dominance the kureisch have make as yet no serious endeavor to avenge they humiliation at bedr moreover the religious and political affair of the city have be regulate so that it be possible to carry on the usual business of life in security -- a security which certainly possess no guarantee permanence and which might at any moment crack beneath the foot of those who walk thereon and plunge they back into a anarchy of war creed and chief -- still a security such as medina have seldom know build up by the one strong personality within its wall for a few month mahomet could live in peace among he follower and the interest shift not to he religious ordinance and work of government -- these have be successfully start and be now continue almost automatically -- but to he domestic life and he relation with he intimate circle of friend as he year increase he feel the continual need of companionship and consolation and while he seek for advice in government and counsel in war from such man as abu bekr alus and othman he find solace and refreshment in the minister hand of woman sawda he already possess and she slow softness and unimaginative mind have already begin to pall ayesha with she beauty and shrewdness she jewel-like nature bright and almost as hard could lessen the continual strain of he life and induce by a kind of reflex action that tireless energy of mind find body which be the secret of he power but these be not enough and now he seek fresh pleasure in haphsa and in other and lesser woman though he never cast away he earlier love still with the same unformulated desire to obtain some respite from the care which beset he some renewal of he vivid nature burning with self-destroying fire the emotional stimulus whose agent woman be become for he as necessary as prayer and we see he in later life add experience after experience in he search for solace nevertheless cleave most to ayesha whose vitality fulfil he intensest need secondary to the necessity of refreshment come the not inconsiderable duty of secure the permanence of he power by the foundation of a line of male successor he earlier marriage have be productive only of daughter while he later union and also he most recent with haphsa have be unfruitful but though so far no direct male issue have be vouchsafe he he be careful to unite with himself the most important man in he state by marriage with he child bind they thereby with the closest blood tie rockeya now dead have marry the warrior othman and fatima the prophet 's youngest daughter be bestow upon the bright and impetuous alus whose exploit in warfare have fill the muslim with pride and a wonder fear of this marriage be bear the famous hassan and hosein name write indelibly upon the muslim roll of fame as each inmate become add to he household rough house almost hut be build for they reception but the prophet himself have no abide place only a council-chamber where he conduct public business and dwelt by turn in the house of he wife but delighted most to visit ayesha who occupy the foremost position by virtue of she beauty and personality mahomet 's household grow up gradually near the mosque in this manner together with the house of he son-in-law not far away and the sacred place itself it constitute the center of activity for the muslim world witness the arrival and despatch of embassy the administration of justice and public business the performance of the muslim religious ceremonial the kuranic revelation of allah 's will it radiate mahomet 's personality and concentrate for he follower all the enthusiasm and persistence that have go to its creation as well as the endurance and foresight ensure its continuance but such security be not permanently possible for mahomet he spirit be doom to perpetual sojourn amid tumult and effort it be almost twelve month since the victory of bedr the broken kureisch have have time to recover themselves and they be now prepare for revenge the wealth of abu sofian 's caravan so dearly acquire have not be distribute after bedr it remain inviolate at mecca a weapon wherefrom be to be work they bitter vengeance all they fighting man be mass into a great host horse and armor weapon and trappings be buy with they hoard wealth and at length 3000 strong include 700 mail warrior and 200 well-mounted cavalry they prepare to set forth upon they work of punishment not only be they own citizen press into the service but the fight man from ally neighbouring tribe who be very ready to take part in a expedition that promise excitement and bloodsh with the hope of plunder the wife of they chief man implore permission to go with the army point out they usefulness and they great eagerness to share the come triumph but many warrior murmur against this for the undertaking be a difficult one and they know the discomfort of a long march at length fifteen specially privileged woman be allow to travel with the host among they hind the fierce wife of abu sofian who bring in she train a immense negro specially reserve for she crowning act of vengeance the murder of hamza in revenge for the slaying of she father the army take the easier seaward route travel as before in all the pomp and gorgeousness of eastern warfare and finally reach the valley of akik five mile west of medina thence they turn to the leave so as to command a more vulnerable place in the city 's defence and finally encamp at ohod at the base of the hill on a fertile plain separate from the city to the north by several rocky ridge impassable for such a army mahomet 's first news of the premeditated attack reach he through he uncle abba that weak doubter who never could make up he mind to become either the friend or the foe of islam he send a messenger to coba to say that the kureiseh be advance in force mahomet be inevitably the leader of the city in spite of the bad feeling between himself and certain section within it jews and disaffected alike look to he for leadership in such a crisis by virtue of he former prowess he counsel be seek mahomet know perfectly well that this attack force be unlike the last which have be gather together hurriedly and have underestimate its opposition he know that besides a better equipment they possess the strongest incentive to daring and determination the desire to avenge some wrong it be with no false estimate of they foe that he counsel he follower to remain in they city and allow the enemy to waste he strength on they defence abdallah agree with the prophet 's decision but the younger section and especially those who have not fight at bedr be clamorously dissentient they point out that if mahomet do not go forth to meet the kureisch he would lay himself open to the charge of cowardice and they openly declare that they loyalty to the prophet would not endure this outrage but would turn to contempt against he will mahomet be force into action he might succeed in defeat he foe and at all event he position would not endure the disloyalty and disaffection that he refusal would entail after Friday 's service he retire to he chamber and appear before the people in armor he call for three lance and fix he banner to they design one for the leader of the refugee and the other two for the tribe of the benus aus and khazraj he could muster in this year a army of 1000 man but he have no cavalry and fewer mail warrior than the kureisch abdallah try he best to dissuade mahomet but the prophet be firm it do not become I to lay aside my armor when once i have put it on without meet my foe in battle at dawn the army move to ohod and he draw up he line of battle at the base of the hill directly face the kureisch but before he could take up he final position abdallah with three hundred man turn they back upon he and hasten again to medina declare that the enterprise be too perilous and that it have be undertake against they judgment mahomet let they go with the same proud sufficiency that he have show before the advance host at bedr we do not need they the lord be on we side then he direct he attention to the disposition of he force he station fifty archer under a captain on the left of he line with strict order that they be to hold they ground whatever chance befall so as to guard he rear and foil a kureischite flank movement then have provide for the enemy 's probable tactic he draw out he main line face medina in rather shallow formation the attack begin as usual by single combat in which none of the champion seem to have take part and soon mahomet 's whole line be engage in a ruthless onward sweep before which the kureisch waver but the muslim press too hotly and unable to retain they ground at all point be drive back here and there again they long line recover and pursue its foe only to lose its coherence and discipline for a section of they count the day already win begin plunder the kureisch camp this be too much for the archer on the left forget everything in one wild desire to share the enemy 's wealth they leave they post and charge down into the struggle central mass here be khalid 's chance the chief warrior and counsellor of the kureisch gather he man together hastily and circle round the now oblivious muslim drive he force against they rear which break up and flee mahomet instantly see the fatal mistake and command the archer across the sea of man and weapon to remember they order and stand firm but it be too late and all he could do be to attempt to stay the muslim flight i be the apostle of god return he call across the tumult but even he magnetism fail to rally the stricken muslim and they rush in headlong flight towards the slope of ohod in the chaos that follow hind see she enemy standing against the press of he fellow-citizen strive to encourage they while with he sword he cut at the pursue kureisch she send she giant negro wahschus to cleave he way to the abhorred one through the struggle man and he crash they asunder with spear uplift to strike hamza be fell to the ground and with one despair upward thrust easily parry by he huge assailant he succumb to wahschus 's spear and lay lifeless the first martyr in the cause of islam which still remember with pride he glorious end seven refugee and citizen gather round they leader to defend he but the battle rage in he vicinity and he friend could not keep off the blow of he enemy he be wound and some of he tooth be knock out then the cry arise that he be slay and the evil tiding heighten the muslim disaster a wretched remnant manage to gain the security of the hill slope and not the good news of mahomet 's escape when they see he amongst they could make of they aught but a vanquish and ignominious band they lay hide among the hill while the kureisch work they triumphant vengeance upon the corpse of they victim which they mutilate before bury after the barbarous fashion of the time and the savage wrath of hind find appeasement in she destruction of hamza 's body at length the kureisch prepare to depart and they spokesman go to the base of the fatal hill demand the prophet 's agreement to a fresh encounter in the following year omar consent on behalf of the prophet and he follower and mahomet remain silent wish to confirm the impression that he be dead why the kureisch do not follow up they victory and attempt a raid upon medina it be difficult to imagine possibly they be apprehensive that mahomet might have fresh reserve and strong defence within the city but more probably they feel they have accomplish they purpose and the muslim would now be cure of seek to plunder they caravan so they retreat again towards mecca and the forlorn muslim creep silently from they hiding-place to discover the extent of they defeat they find seventy-four body of they own following and twenty of the enemy they ignominy be complete and to the bitterness of they reverse be add the terrible fear that the kureisch would proceed further and attack they defenceless city they return to medina at sunset a mournful and piteous band bearing with they they leader whose wound have be hastily dress on the field mahomet be indeed in sore strait himself maim the bulk of he army scatter he foe victorious and he headquarters full of seething discontent bring to the surface by he defeat he feel himself in peril even at medina and pass the night fearfully await what event might bring fresh disaster but he determination and foresight do not desert he and once the torment night be pass he recover he old resourcefulness and he wonderful energy he command bilal to announce that he would pursue the kureisch and put himself stricken and suffer at the head of the expedition they reach safra and remain there three day return then to medina with the announcement that the kureisch have elude they this sortie be nothing more than a manifestation of courage and by it mahomet hope to restore in a measure he shake confidence in the city and also to apprise the kureisch that he be not utterly crushed but he defeat have damage he prestige far more than a mere expedition could remedy and he follower be aghast at he humiliation they world be upturned it be as if the lord himself for whom they have suffer so much have suddenly demonstrate he frailty and human weakness and the malcontent in medina triumph especially the jew who see with joy some measure of the prophet 's brutality towards they be mete to he in turn the situation be grave and mahomet 's reputation must be at all cost re-establish he retire for some time to he own quarter and receive the revelation of part of sura iii wherein he explain the whole matter urge first that allah be please to make a selection between the brave and the cowardly the weak and the steadfast and then that the defeat be the punishment for disobey he divine command the passage be write in mahomet 's most forcible style and stand out clearly as a reliable account for neither the defeat of the muslim nor they own culpability be minimize the martyr at ohod receive at he hand they crown of praise and repute not those slay on god 's path to be dead nay alive with they lord be they and richly sustained rejoicing in what god of he bounty have vouchsafed fill with joy at the favor of god and at he mercy and that god suffereth not the reward of the faithful to perish he spend most time however in speak for the encouragement of he sorely try flock and for the confusion of those who doubt he the revelation come in answer to a direct need and be inseparable from the event which call it forth as far as be possible it achieve its purpose for the faithful receive it with humility but it could not fully restore the shake confidence in the prophet the immediate result of the battle of ohod be to render mahomet free from any more threatening from the kureisch who have fulfil the task of overawe he into quietude towards they but its ultimate result be far-reaching and endure for many year in fact it be by reason of the reverse at ohod that the next period of he life be crowd with defensive and punitive expedition and attack upon he follower by desert tribe he position at medina have be render thoroughly insecure and every tribe deem it possible to accomplish some kind of demonstration against he jew and arabian both pit themselves against the embryo state and the powerful desert ally of the kureisch constitute a perpetual menace to he own stronghold it be only when he have murder or exile every jew and carry out repeat campaign against the tribe of the interior that he position in medina be remove beyond possibility of assailment ruthlessness and trust in the sword be he only chance of success if he relax he vigilance or allow any humane feeling to prevent the execution of severe measure upon any of he enemy he very existence would be menace from now he may be say to pass under the tyranny of war and its remorseless urge be never slacken until he have he own native city within he power the god of battle exact he pitiless toll from he devotee compelling he to work out he destiny by the sword 's rough mean the thinker have become irrevocably the man of action prayer have be supplement by the command fight and yet again fight that god may conquer and retain reverse show the temper of hero and mahomet be never more fully reveal than in the first gloomy day after ohod when he steadfastly set himself to retrieve what be lose refuse to acknowledge that he position be impaired impervious to the whisper that speak of failure supreme in he mighty asset of a impregnable faith chapter xiv the tyranny of war and we have send down iron dire evil resideth in it as well as advantage to mankind -- _ the kuran _ after the battle of ohod two month pass quietly for mahomet he be unable to undertake any aggressive expedition and both the jew at medina and the exterior desert tribe be lull into tranquillity by the knowledge that he power be for the time considerably weaken but the prophet know that this security could not continue for long and for the character of he future war he be fully prepare -- sufficient proof if one be still necessary of he skill as soldier and leader he know the kureisch have institute a policy of alliance with the surround tribe and that now they plan would be to crush he by a ceaseless pressure from the east unite to the inevitable disaffection within the city as its inhabitant witness the decline of they leader 's power watchfulness and severity be the only means of hold he position and these two quality he use with a tenacity which alone secure he ultimate success the first threatening come from the benus asad a powerful tribe inhabit the country directly east of medina under they chief tuleiha they plan a raid against mahomet but he excellent system of espionage stand he now as always in good stead so that he hear of they scheme before it be ripe and despatched 150 man to frustrate it the benus asad be wise enough to give up the attempt after mahomet 's man have find and plunder they camp they disperse for the time be and the danger of a attack be avert but scarcely have the expedition return when news come of another gathering at orna between mecca and taif again mahomet lose no time but send a force large enough to disperse they in a skirmish in which the chief of the lahyan tribe be kill in the next month mahomet send six of he follower to mecca probably as spy but they be not allow to reach they goal in safety at raja they fall in with a party of the benus lahyan proceed the same way the man be arm and mahomet 's follower be glad to accompany they because of the additional security at the oasis the party encamp for the night and the muslim prepared unsuspectingly for sleep at dead of night they be surround by they profess friend who be resolve on revenge for the murder of they chief four be kill and two zeid and khubeib take bind to mecca whose citizen gloat over they prey legend in plenty group themselves around these two figure -- the first real martyr for islam and one of the most profound testimony to the love which mahomet inspire in he follower be give traditionally in a few significant sentence deal with the episode the prisoner be keep a month before be lead to the inevitable torture abu sofian the scoffer come to zeid as he be prepare to face he death wouldst thou not o zeid he ask that thou wert once more with thy family and that mahomet suffer in thy place by allah i would not that mahomet should suffer the smallest prick from a thorn no not even if by that mean i could be safe once more among my kindred then the enemy of islam marvel at he word and say : never have i see among man such love as mahomet 's follower bear towards he and after that zeid be put to death mahomet be powerless to retaliate and be oblige to suffer from afar the murder of he fellow-believer the fate of these six muslim give courage to mahomet 's enemy everywhere and prompt even he friend to treachery the benus aamir a branch of the great hawazin tribe dwelling between the benus asad and the benus lahyan be friendly towards medina and send mahomet gift as a guarantee these mahomet refuse to receive unless the tribe become convert to islam he know the danger of compromise -- he meccan experience have not fade from he mind moreover he recognize that in he present weakened position firmness be essential he could not open the gate of he fortress even a chink without let in a flood before which it must topple into ruin but they chief would not be so coerced neither would he give up he ancestral faith without due examination of that offer in its stead he demand that a party of muslim should accompany he back to he own people and strive by reasoning and eloquence to convert they to islam after much deliberation for he be chary of send any of he choose to what would be swift death in the event of treachery mahomet consent and give order for a party of man skilled in they faith to accompany abu bera back to he people the man be receive in all honor and be escort as befitted they position as far as bir mauna where they halt and a muslim messenger be send with a letter to the chief of another branch of the same tribe this leader aamir ibn sofail immediately put the messenger to death and call upon he ally to exterminate the follower of the blasphemous prophet but the tribe refuse to break abu bera 's pledge so aamir determine to root they out appeal to the benus suleim mahomet 's avowed enemy and with they aid proceed to bir mauna there they fall upon the band of muslim and slaughter they to a man then return to they desert fastness proudly confident in they ability to elude pursuit the news be carry to mahomet and at first he be convince that abu bera have betray he he follower who have bring the news have fall upon and kill some luckless member of the benus aamir in reprisal and mahomet acclaimed they action when however he hear from abu bera that he and he tribe have be faithful to they pledge he pay blood money for the murder man then call he people together he solemnly curse each tribe by name who have dare to attack the faithful by treachery but the incident do not end here mahomet could not compass the destruction of the benus aamir they be too powerful and dwelt too far off for he vengeance to assail they but the benus nadhir the second jewish tribe within the prophet 's territory be near and they be confederate with the treacherous people mahomet 's action be swift and effective force be he only temporal weapon compulsion he only policy the command go forth through the lip of mosleima : thus saith the prophet of the lord : ye shall go forth out of my land within a space of ten day whosoever that remaineth behind shall be put to death the benus nadhir be aghast and tremble they urge they former treaty with mahomet and the antiquity of they settlement it be impossible that they should break up they homestead thus suddenly and depart forlorn into a unknown land but mahomet be obdurate with that same fixity of purpose which be everywhere the keynote of he dominance heart be change now be the only reply to they prayer they entreaty and they throat abdallah leader of the benus aus and khazraj seek desperately for a reconciliation but to no purpose the die be cast then the jew bring to bay and careless with the despair of impotence refuse to obey the command and prepare to encounter the wrath of allah and the vengeance of he emissary behold the jew prepare to fight : great be the lord the prophet declare when the news be bring to he he be sure of he victim and ruthless in destruction all thing be make ready for the undertake the army be assemble and the march begin alus carry the great green banner of the prophet towards the stronghold of he enemy the benus nadhir be invest in they own quarter the date tree lie outside they fort be burn they field be lay waste for three week the siege endure each day bring the miserable garrison nearer to the inevitable privation and final surrender at last the jew recognize the hopelessness of they lot and come to reluctant term submit to exile and agree to depart immediately then follow the terrible break up of home and the wander forth of a whole tribe as of old to seek other dwelling-place some go to kheibar where they be to suffer later on still more severely at mahomet 's hand some go to jericho and the highland south of syrium but all vanish from they ancient abide place as suddenly as if a plague have reduce they land to silence it be a important conquest for mahomet and have find fitting notice in the kuran the number of he enemy within the city be considerably reduce he be gradually prove he power by break up the jewish federation and thereby advance far towards he goal he unassailable almost royal dominance of medina moreover he bind the refugee closer to he by divide the despoil country amongst they it be a event worthy of incorporation into the record of divine favor for by it the sacred cause of islam have be render more triumphant god be the mighty the wise he it be who cause the unbeliever among the people of the book to quit they home and be it not that god have decree they exile surely in this world would he have chastise they : but in the world to come the chastisement of the fire awaiteth they this because they set they against god and he apostle and whoso setteth he against god -- god truly be vehement in punish the sura end in a mood of fierce exultation unrivalled by any ecstatic utterance of he early vision it be the measure of he relief at he first great success since the humiliation of ohod he fervor beat through it like the clamor of water in whose triumphant gladness no pause be hear he be god beside whom there be no god : he be the king the holy the peaceful the faithful the guardian the mighty the strong the most high far be the glory of god from that which they unite with he he be god the producer the maker the fashioner to he be ascribe excellent title what ever be in the heaven and in the earth praiseth he he be the mighty the wise the expulsion of the benus nadhir be a brutal but necessary act the choice lay between they security and he future dominion and he uproot they dwelling as ruthlessly as any conqueror set aside the obstacle in he path half measure be impossible even dangerous and mahomet be not afraid to use terrible means to achieve he all-absorbing end he have avowedly accept the behest of the sword and do not repudiate he master the hate jew be enemy of he god whose vicegerent he now rank himself they ruin be in the divinely appoint order of the world the time be soon at hand when by arrangement the medinan army be to repair to bedr to meet the kureisch the meccan send a messenger in schaban -lrb- nov 625 -rrb- to mahomet say that they be prepare to advance against he with 2000 foot and 50 horse this large army do in reality set out but be soon force to return owe to lack of supplies and scarcity of food the message be send mainly in the hope of intimidate the muslim but mahomet be probably as well inform of the kureisch movement as they be themselves and know that no real attack be possible he therefore determine to show both friend and enemy that he be ready to meet he foe the muslim be not very agreeable know what fate have decree at they last encounter with the meccan but mahomet 's stern determination prevail he declare that he would go to bedr even if he go alone and so collect by sheer force of will 1500 man he march to bedr hold camp there for eight day during which of course no demonstration be make and the whole expedition be turn into a peaceable mercantile undertaking when all they goods have be profitably sell or exchange mahomet break up the camp and return in triumph to medina he prestige have certainly be much increase by this unmolested sortie it be therefore in a glad and confident mood that he return to he native city and prepare to enjoy he success he take thereupon two wife zeinab and omm salma of whom very little be know except that zeinab be the widow of mahomet 's cousin kill at bedr the incident of he marriage with zeinab find allusion in the kuran in the briefest of passage she be probably take as much out of a desire to protect as a desire to possess and she quickly become one of the many with whom mahomet be content to pass a few day and night there be also sign in the kuran at this time of disagreement between the different member of he household and of they extravagant demand upon mahomet it be evidently not so easy to rule he wife as to acquire they moreover he be begin to feel the sting of jealousy towards every other man of the muslim here really begin the insistence upon restrictive regulation for woman which have be ever since the bane of islam mahomet could not allow he wife to go abroad freely deck in the ornament he himself have bestow to become a mark for every envious gazer they be not as other woman and he imperious nature regard they as peculiarly inviolate so that he fence in they action and seclude they life as early as he marriage with zeinab he impose restriction upon woman 's dress abroad they be not to traverse the street in jewel or beautiful robe but be to cover themselves closely with a long sober garment whereas he former sura regard woman have be confine to codify and render fairer divorce and property law now the personal note sound strongly and continue throughout the whole of he later pronouncement regard muslim woman the next few month be to see danger and disturbance in he domestic life which be to fix the position of woman in islam throughout the come century but before he have long complete he latest marriage he be call away upon another necessary expedition thus casually almost from purely personal consideration be the law regard the status of woman establish in islam he ordinance have the savor of they impetuous creator who find in the subject sex no opposition against the write down in they most sacred book of those decree which render they inferior position permanent and authorise it be allah speaking through the lip of he prophet and they submit with willing heart with no shadow of the knowledge of all it be to mean to they descendant darken they mind in muharram of 626 the benus ghatafan always formidable on account of they size and they desert hinterland assemble in force at dzat-al-rica mahomet determinedly march against they and once more at the news of he approach they courage fail they and they flee to the mountain mahomet come unexpectedly upon they habitation carry off some of they woman as slave and return to medina after fifteen day have effectively crush the incipient rise against he the event be chiefly important as be the occasion which lead mahomet to institute the service of danger describe in the kuran whereby half the army pray or sleep while the other watch a body of man be therefore keep constantly under arm while the army be in the field and public prayer be repeat twice and when ye go forth to war in the land it shall be no crime in you to cut short you prayer and when thou o apostle shalt be among they and shalt pray with they then let a party of they rise up with thee but let they take they arm and when they shall have make they prostration let they retire to you rear : then let another party that have not pray come forward and let they pray with you but let they take they precaution and they arm the military organization be be gradually perfect so that the mahometan sword may finally be in the perpetual ascendant this be the chief significance of a campaign which at best be only a interlude in the daily life of prayer civil and domestic care and regulation which take up mahomet 's life in the breathing space before the great meccan attack mahomet be absent from medina but fifteen day and he return home resolve to take advantage of the respite from war not long after he return he happen to visit the house of zeid he adopted son and chance not on zeid but on he wife at she tiring mahomet be fill with she beauty for she loveliness be past praise and he covet she zeinab herself be proud of the honor vouchsafe she and be willing indeed anxious to become divorce for so mighty a ruler zeid she husband with that measureless devotion which the prophet inspire in he follower offer to divorce she for he mahomet at first refuse declare it be not meet that such a thing should be but after a time he desire prove too strong for he and he consent so zeinab be divorce and pass into the harem of the prophet and he justify the proceedings in sura 33 : and when zeid have settle concern she to divorce she we marry she to thee that it might not be a crime in the faithful to marry the wife of they adopt son when they have settle the affair concern they no blame attacheth to the prophet when god have give he a permission there follow the sum of mahomet 's restriction upon the dress and demeanor of woman they be to veil they face when abroad and suffer no man but they intimate kinsman to look upon they the faithful be forbid to go near the dwelling-place of the prophet 's wife without he permission nor be they even to desire to marry they after the prophet be dead by such casual means by decree bear out of the circumstance of he age and personal temperament do mahomet institute the custom which be more vital to the position and fate of muslim woman than all he utterance as to they just treatment and he injunction against they oppression power be already take its insidious hold upon he and he foot be set upon the path that lead to the despotism of the chalifate and the horror of muslim conquest allah be still omnipotent but he be make continual and indispensable use of temporal means to achieve he end and he servant do likewise after the interlude of peace mahomet be call upon in July 626 to undertake a punitive expedition to jumat-al-gandal a oasis midway between the red sea and the gulf of persium the expedition be successful and the marauder disperse he have now reach the confines of syrium and with the extension of he expeditionary activity he political horizon widen he begin to conceive himself as the predatory chief of arabia one who be regard with awe and fear by the surround tribe with the one exception of the stiff-necked city mecca whose inhabitant he long in vain to subdue the success foster he love of plunder and inclined he more than ever to hold out this reward of valor to he follower he stern and wary policy be justify by its success for by it he have recover from the severe blow at ohod but it threaten to become he master and set its perpetual seal upon he life in December 626 he hear of the defection of the benus mustalik a branch of the khozaa tribe they join the kureisch for mixed motive chiefly political for they hope to make themselves and they religion secure by alliance with mahomet 's enemy mahomet learn of they desertion through he efficient spy and determine to anticipate any disturbance with ayesha and omm salma to accompany he and a adequate army to support he he set out for the quarter of the benus mustalik and before long reach moraisus where he encamp the benus mustalik be desert by they ally and in the skirmish that follow mahomet be easily successful they camp be plunder they woman and some of they man take prisoner the expedition be however provocative of two consequence which take up considerable attention in contemporary record the quarrel between the citizen and the refugee and the scandal regard ayesha the punishment of the benus mustalik have be effect and nought remain but the division of the spoil the captive have mostly be ransom but one a girl juweira remain sorrowfully with the muslim for she ransom be fix so high that payment be impossible mahomet listen to she tale and the loveliness of she face and figure do not escape he wilt thou hearken to what may be better he ask she even that i should pay thy ransom and take thee myself juweira be thankful for she safety and rejoice at she good fortune mahomet marry she straightway and for she bridal gift give she the life of she fellow tribesman wherefore say ayesha juweira be the best benefactress to she people in that she restore the captive to they kinsfolk but the citizen and refugee be by no means so contented they quarrel arise nominally out of the distribution of spoil but really it be a long smouldering discontent that finally burst into flame mahomet be face with what threaten to be a serious revolt and only he order for a immediate march prevent the outbreak of desperate passion -- greed and envy abdallah they ubiquitous leader be chide in the kuran where the whole affair bring down the strength of mahomet 's scorn upon he offend people the camp break up immediately and through its hasty departure ayesha be face with what might have be the tragedy of she life she litter be carry away without she by a oversight on the part of the bearer and she be leave alone in the desert 's velvet dusk with no alternative but to await its return the dark deepen add its mysterious vastness and silence to trouble she already tremulous mind in the first hour of the night safwan one of mahomet 's rear come towards she as she sit forlorn and be amaze to find the prophet 's wife in such a position he bring he mule near she then turn he face away as she mount so as to keep she inviolate from he gaze closely veil and tremble as to she meeting with mahomet ayesha ride with safwan at she bridle until the next day they come up with the main column now murmur against she break out on all side mahomet refuse to believe she story and remain estrange from she until she ask permission to return to she father as she word be thus doubt alus be consult by the prophet and he with that antagonism towards ayesha which germinate later into open hatred be incline to believe she defamer at last the outcry become so great that mahomet call upon allah enter he chamber in medina he receive the sign of divine inspiration when the trance be over he declare that ayesha be innocent and reveal the passage deal with divorce in sura 24 : they who defame virtuous woman and bring not four witness scourge they with fourscore stripe and receive ye not they testimony forever for these be perverse person and they who shall accuse they wife and have no witness but themselves the testimony of each of they shall be a testimony by god four time repeat that he be indeed of they that speak the truth the revelation end with a repetition of the restriction impose upon woman and a injunction to the muslim not to enter each other 's house until they have ask leave this be a necessary ordinance in that primitive community where bolt be little used and there be virtually no privacy and be design in common with most of he present utterance to encourage the lead of decent well-regulated life by the follower of so magnificent a faith ayesha 's defamer be publicly scourge and the matter dismiss from the muslim mind save that regulation have once more be frame upon personal feeling and specific event and be to constitute the whole future law regard a important and difficult question mahomet be justly content with the position of affair after the dispersion of the benus mustalik he have show he strength to the surround desert tribe by systematically crush each rebellion as it arise he have demonstrate to they the impossibility of alliance against he he know they be each prone to self-seeking and distrustful of each other and he play unhesitatingly upon they jealousy and passion thus he keep they disunited and fearful afraid even to ally with he powerful enemy the kureisch for after all the meccan be he chief obstacle they opposition be spirited and urge on by the memory of past humiliation and triumph they alone be really worthy of he steel and he know that as far as the intermediary war be concern they be but the prelude to another encounter in the year-long warfare with he native city the drama close in now upon the protagonist save for the expulsion of the last jewish tribe in the neighborhood of medina there be little to compare with that central causal hatred the final hour be not yet but the struggle grow in intensity with the passage of time -- the struggle wherein one fight for revenge and future freedom from molestation but the other for the establishment of a faith in its rightful environment the manifestation before man of that faith 's determine achievement the symbol of its destine conquest and divinely appoint power chapter xv the war of the ditch and god drive back the infidel in they wrath they win no advantage god suffice the faithful in the fight for god be strong mighty -- _ the kuran _ the kureischite plan for the annihilation of mahomet be now complete they have achieve a alliance against he not only among the bedouin tribe of the interior but also among the exile and bitterly vengeful medinan jew now in schawwal 627 mahomet 's unresting foe summon all they confederate to warfare against this man the ally tribe chief among whom be the beni suleim and ghatafan always at feud with mahomet hasten to mass themselves at mecca where they be welcome confidently by the kureiseh the host be organise in three separate camp and abu sofian be place at the head of the entire army each leader however be to have alternate command of the campaign and this primitive arrangement -- the only one it seem by which early nation lack a indisputable leader can surmount the jealousy and self-will display by every petty chief -- be responsible in great measure for they ultimate failure in such fashion still with the bravery and splendor of eastern warfare wrap about they a army of 4000 man with 300 horse 1500 camel countless store spear arrow armor and accoutrements move forward upon the small and factious city of the prophet whose fight strength be hamper by the exhaustion of many campaign and the disloyalty of those within he very wall the prophet be outwardly undismayed whatever fear prey upon he inner mind they be dominate by he unshakable belief in the protection and favor of allah he do not allow the day of respite to pass he idly by as soon as he receive the news of this fateful expedition he call together a meeting of he wisest and bravest and explain to they the position he tell they of the horde mass against they and dwelt upon the impossibility of oppose they in the open field and the necessity of guard they own city this time there be no dissentient voice both the disaffected and the muslim have have a lesson at ohod that be not lightly forget then salman a persian and one skilled in war suggest that they stronghold should be further defend by a trench dig at the most vulnerable part of the city 's outpost medina be build upon a outcropping mass of rock which render attack impossible upon the north-west side detach from it and leave a considerable vacant space between a row of compactly build house stand make a very passable stone wall defense for that portion of the city the trench be dig in that level ground between the rock and the house and continue also upon the unsheltered south and east side there be many legend of the digging of the trench and the desperate haste with which it be accomplish mahomet himself be say to have help in the work and it be almost certain that here tradition have not err the deed coincide so well with he eager and resolute nature that never neglect any means however humble that would achieve he purpose the faithful work determinedly devote they whole day to the task and never rest from they labor until the whole trench be dig the hard ground be soften by water and legendary account of mahomet 's power in pulverise the rock be numerous the great work be complete in six day and on the evening of its achievement the muslim army encamp between the trench and the city in the open space thus form a tent of red leather be set up for mahomet where zeinab and omm salma as well as he favorite and companion ayesha visit he in turn around he rest he chief warrior ali othman zeid omar with he counseller abu bekr and he numerous entourage of hero and enthusiast they be infuse with the same exalted resolve as they leader and wait undismayed for the infidel attack but with the rest of the citizen and especially with the disaffected it be otherwise ever since the rumor of the onrush of they foe reach medina they have murmur openly against they leader 's rule they have refuse to help in the digging of the ditch and now wait in ill-concealed discontent mingle with a base panic fear for they own safety the meccan host advance as before by way of ohod and pursue they way to the city rejoice in the freedom from attack and convinced thereby that they conquest of medina would be rapid and complete they penetrate to the rampart wall of house and march past they to the level ground intend to rush the city and pen the muslim army within its narrow street there to be crush at will by the sheer mass of its foe then as the whole army in battle array move forward strong in its might of number the advance be check and throw into confusion by the oppose trench abu sofian hurry up learn with anger of this unexpected barrier finding he could not cross it he wax indignant and declare the device be cowardly and unlike a arab the traditionalist as usual be disconcert by the resourceful man of action and the muslim obstinately remain behind they defense the kureisch discharge a shower of arrow over the ditch among the entrenched muslim and then retire a little from they first position so as to encamp not far from the city and try to starve it into surrender mahomet be content that he have stave off immediate attack and set to work to complete he defence and strengthen he fight force when grave news reach he from the immediate environs of the city successful as he have be in extirpate two of the hate jewish tribe mahomet be nevertheless force to submit to the presence of the benus koreitza whose fortress be situate near the city on its undefended side it be uncertain whether there be ever a treaty between this tribe and the prophet or what its provision be suppose such a document to have exist but it be evident that there must have be some peaceable relation between the muslim and the koreitza and that the latter be of some account politically now the jewish tribe resentful at the treatment of they fellow-believer and see the t I ripe for secession to the probable win side cast away even they nominal allegiance to mahomet and openly join he enemy a muslim spy be send to they territory to discover they true feeling and he report be so disquieting that the prophet immediately set a guard over he tent fear assassination and order patrol to keep the medinan street free from any attempt to disturb the peace and threaten he army from within the city 's confines the muslim be now in parlous state the trench might avail to stop the enemy for a time but a opportunity be sure to occur when they would attempt a cross and once within the city mahomet know they would carry destruction before they and irretrievable ruin to he cause he jewish enemy make common enmity against he with the kureisch and the disaffected declare they intention of join the rest of he foe but he would not yield and continue unabashed to defend the trench and city with all the skill and energy he could command from he harass follower the kureisch remain several day inactive but at last abu jahl discover a weak spot in he enemy ' line where the trench be narrow and undefended he determine on immediate attack and send a troop of horseman to clear the ditch and give battle on the opposite side the move be notice from within the defense alus and a body of pick man be send to frustrate it alus reach the ground just as the foremost of the kureisch clear the ditch and prepare to advance upon the city swiftly he leap from he horse and challenge a aged chief of the kureisch to single combat the gage be accept but the chieftain could stand up to ali no better than a reed stand upright before the wind that shake it the chief be slay before the eye of he friend and thereupon the general onslaught begin the muslim fight like those possess until in a little space there remain not one of the defiant party that have recently cross the gulf between the army but the kureisch be undaunted the order for a general attack upon the trench be now order the assault begin in the early morning and continue throughout the day for long weary hour without respite and with very little sustenance the muslin army keep the kureisch host at bay the encounter be sharp and prolonged and none of the man could be spare from the strife to make they daily devotions to allah they have keep we from we prayer declare mahomet in wrath as he watch the unresting attack god fill they belly and they grave with fire he curse the infidel dog while exhort he man to stand firm and before all thing keep they line unbroken the attack be repulse but not without great loss and misery upon mahomet 's side he prestige be now entirely lose among the citizen only the faithful still rally round he out of they invincible trust in he personality the disaffected begin to foment agitation within the narrow street the bazaar and public place there be great distress among the people of medina scarcity of food mingle with they fear for the future to create a insecurity wherein crime find its dwelling-place and brutality its foster soil then be the faithful try and with strong quake do they quake nevertheless they stand firm and take no part in the murmuring of the disaffected and presently allah send they down succor for they steadfastness and high courage mahomet fail in direct warfare to drive back he enemy resort to strategy he plan to send a secret embassy to buy off the benus ghatafan and so strive to break up the kureisch alliance but the rest of the city be unwilling to adopt this measure prefer to trust more firmly in the strength of they defence finally mahomet determine to essay upon he own initiative some means of subtlety whereby he might force back this encompass foe that hourly threaten he whole dominion he send a embassy to the jew outside the city with intent to sow dissension between they and the kureisch see now he command he envoy whether thou canst not break up this confederacy for war after all be but a game of deception the muslim pursue he way unchecked to the camp of the koreitza just outside the city where he whisper he insidious message into the ear of the chief say the kureisch be already weary of fight and be even now plan a retreat and would forsake they ally as soon as be expedient leave they to the mercy of a muslim revenge he promise bribe of money slave girl and land from the prophet if they would betray they new-found ally self-interest prevail at last the plan be agree upon and the messenger return to mahomet with the good news of the breaking-up of the confederacy the treachery of the koreitza spread discouragement among the arab chief moreover they supplies be already run short they cease to press the siege so severely the attack become weaker and mahomet be easily able to prevent any further incursion beyond the trench and now the weather break up the sunny country be transform suddenly into a dreary storm-swept wilderness blast of wind come skurry down upon the kureisch camp driving rain and sleet before they to mahomet it be the wrath of the lord make manifest upon the presumptuous meccan they camp-fire be blow out they tent damp and draggle they man dispirit they forage scarce suddenly abu sofian weary of inaction thoroughly dishearten by the hardship of he position break up the camp and order a retreat the vast army fade away as magically as it have come the morning after they departure the muslim awake to see only a few scattered tent and the disorderly remains of human occupation as evidence of the presence of a foe that have account itself invincible the meccan evidently accept defeat for they return speedily to they own country realize bitterly the impossibility of keep together so heterogeneous a army in the face of a prolonged check medina be free of its immediate menace and great be the rejoice when the camp be abandon and islam return in security to its sanctuary within the city mahomet repair immediately to ayesha 's house and be cleanse the stain of conflict from he body when the mandate come from heaven through the lip of gabriel : hast thou lay aside thine arm lo the angel have not yet put down they weapon and i be come to bid thee go against the benus koreitza to destroy they citadel mahomet 's swift nature alive to the value of speed have realize in a flash that now be the time to strike at the koreitza the treacherous hebrew dog before they could grow strong and gather together any ally to help they ward off they certain chastisement the enterprise be proclaim at once to the weary muslim and the great banner still unfurl place in the hand of alus the faithful be eager for rest but at the command of they leader they forget they exhaustion and rally round he again with the same loving and invincible devotion that have sustain they during the terrible day of siege the expedition march to the koreitza fortress and lay siege to it in march 627 for twenty-five day it be besiege by islam say the chronicler until god put terror into the heart of the jew and they be reduce to sore strait then they offer to depart as the kainukaa have depart empty-handed with neither gold nor cattle into a strange land but mahomet have not forget they treachery to he under the suasion of the kureisch and he determine on sterner measure the jew be now thoroughly terrify and send in haste to crave permission for a visit from abu lubaba a ally of the benus aus they former confederate mahomet consent as one who grant the trivial wish of a doomed man in sorrow abu lubaba go into the camp of the koreitza and when they question he he tell they openly that they must abandon hope they doom be decree by the prophet sanction by allah it be irrevocable when the koreitza hear the sentence they bow they head some in wrath some in despair and charge abu lubaba with supplication for mahomet 's clemency the messenger return and tell the prophet what he have disclose to the jew concern they impending fate thou hast do ill declare mahomet for i would not that mine enemy know they doom before it be accomplished thereupon say tradition abu lubaba be fill with remorse at have displeased he master and enter the mosque bind himself to one of its pillar whence it be call the pillar of repentance to this day at last the jew wear out with the siege without resource ally or any hope of relief surrender at discretion to the benus aus immediately they citadel be seize and plunder while they man be handcuff and keep apart they woman and child give into the keep of a renegade jew they cattle be drive into medina before they eye and soon the whole tribe be withdraw from its ancestral habitation await what might come from the hand of they terrible foe then mahomet pronounced judgment he send for sa'ad ibn muadh the chief of the benus aus and into he hand he give the fate of all those soul who belong to the tribe of koreitza sa'ad be elderly fat irritable and vindictive he have a long-standing grudge against this people and know nothing of the mercy which greater man bestow upon the fall my judgment be that the man shall be put to death the woman and child sell into slavery and the spoil divide among the army mahomet be exultant at the sentence truly the judgment of sa'ad be the judgment of god pronounce on high from beyond the seventh heaven it accord with he mood of angry resentment against the earlier treachery of the koreitza but why he depute its pronouncement to sa'ad instead of take it upon himself be not easy to discover possibly he may have dread to acquire such a reputation for cruelty as this would bestow upon he possibly he wish to make clear to the world that the jew have be doom to death by a member of they ally tribe certainly he welcome the terrible sentence and ensure its accomplishment the koreitza be drag pitilessly to medina the man keep together under strict guard the woman and child make ready to be sell at the mart within the city that night the outskirts of medina become the scene of grim activity in the soft darkness of the arabian night mahomet 's follower labor with dreadful haste at the digging of many trench the day dawn upon they uncompleted work and not until the sun be high do they return to the heart of the city then the man of the koreitza be divide into company and lead out in turn to the trench the slaughter begin as they file to the edge of the pit they be strike down by the wait muslim so that they body fall into the common grave mingle with the blood and quiver flesh of those who follow as one company after another march out and do not return they chief man ask the muslim soldier concern he countryman 's fate : seest thou not that each company depart and be see no more will ye never understand the doom of the koreitza be work out to its terrible end which be not until set of sun the number of butcher man be variously estimate but it can not have be less than between 700 and 800 so the koreitza perish each move forward to meet the irremediable without fear without supplication and when the carnage be over mahomet turn to the distribution of the spoil he eye light upon rihana a beautiful jewess and he desire she as solace after this ruthless but necessary punishment he offer she marriage she refuse and become of necessity and forthwith he concubine then he take the possession slave and cattle of the vanquish tribe and divide they among the faithful keep a fifth part himself and the land he partition also a few woman who have find favor in the eye of muslim be retain the rest be send to be sell as slave among the bedouin tribe of nejd the koreitza no longer exist they treachery have be visit again upon themselves the massacre of the koreitza and the war of the ditch can not be view apart the ruthlessness of the former be the outcome of the success which make it possible mahomet have defeat a most formidable attempt to overthrow he a attempt which would have lose much of its potency if the koreitza have remain either friendly or neutral and in the triumph which follow he seek to make such treachery henceforth impossible he never lose a opportunity he see that the koreitza must be deal with instantly after the failure of the meccan attack and unhesitatingly he accomplish he work he act be a plain proof of he increase confidence in he mission and in himself as ruler and emissary from on high it speak not only of he barbarity and courage in the use of it when occasion arise but also of he tireless energy and swift perception of the right moment to strike he lack of compunction over the cruelty bear upon it the stamp of he age and environment the koreitza be the enemy of allah and he prophet they have dare to betray he they doom be just the result of the failure of the meccan attack be to restore in great measure mahomet 's reputation so that he have less trouble hereafter with the disaffected within medina and with the marauding of desert tribe for the moment he position within the city be comparatively secure moreover in exterminate the koreitza he have remove the last of the hate hebrew race from the precinct of he adopted city and could regard himself as master of all its neighbouring territory the disaffected it be true remain sufficiently at variance with he to resent though impotently he severity towards the koreitza and to declare that sa'ad ibn muadh 's death which occur soon after be the direct result of he bloody judgment but they resentment be confine to speech the meccan have retire discredited and be unlikely to attack again for some time at least for a little space mahomet seem secure in he city whence active opposition have be drive out the period after the war of the ditch show he definitely the ruler of a rival city to mecca the kureisch have make they last concerted attack and be now force to recognize he as a permanent factor in they political world though they would not name he equal until he have make further display of strength he take he place now among the city chieftain of western arabium and have next to reckon with the nomad bedouin tribe of the interior in which position he be akin to the ruler of mecca himself he be still never at rest from warfare one expedition succeed another until there be some chance of the realisation of he dream whose splendor even now beat with insistence upon he spirit the establishment of he mighty faith within the mother-city which give it birth whence purge of its idolatry and aflame with devotion it shall make of that city the goal of its follower ' prayer the crown of its earthly sovereignty chapter xvi the pilgrimage to hodeibium and he it be who hold they hand from you and you hand from they in the valley of mecca after that he have give you the victory over they for god see what ye do -- _ the kuran _ mahomet now secure from immediate attack count himself permanently rid of the meccan menace and devoted he care to the strengthening of he position among the surround desert tribe the year 627-628 be fill with minor expedition to chastise or conquer he numerous enemy in the interior he ceaseless vigilance make effectual through he elaborate spy system enable he to keep the bedouin horde in check though he be by no means uniformly successful in he attack upon they the period be characterise by the absence of pitched battle and by the employment of very small raiding party who go out simply to plunder and to disperse the hostile force he first expedition after the koreitza massacre in June 627 be direct against the benus lahyan in revenge for they slaughter of the faithful at radjus he take the north-west road to syrium as a feint then swiftly turn march along the sea-shore route to mecca and the benus lahyan flee before he mahomet be anxious to give battle but as he find he foe be move hastily towards the hostile city with intent to draw he on to he doom he give up the chase and contented himself with break up they encampment plunder they wealth and woman and so return to medina he have be there only a few night when he learn that oyeina chief of the fazara tribe in concert with the benus ghatafan have make a raid upon he milch camel at ghaba kill they keeper and torture he wife mahomet pursue but the raider be too quick for he and get away with the spoil mahomet do not follow they up as nothing be to be gain from such a fruitless quest in August of the same year another raid on he camel be attempt by the famished tribe of nejd and mahomet send a expedition under maslama to chastise they but the muslim be overpower by a superior force and most of they company slay the prophet vow vengeance upon the perpetrator of this defeat when he should have the power to carry it out and now the meccan caravan venture once more to take the seaward road so long bar to they be plunder by zeid at al be thereby confirm mahomet 's hostile intention towards the kureisch and ensure they continue enmity but reprisal on they part be impossible after the failure before medina and they suffer the outrage in silence mahomet be not content to rest upon he newly win security but now determine to send out messenger and embassy to the ruler of surround land exhort they to embrace islam this policy be to develop later into a regular system but for the moment only one envoy be send upon a hazardous mission to the roman emperor whose recent conquest in persium have make he famous among the arab the envoy be not permit a quiet journey at wadi-al-cora he be seize and plunder by the benus judzam but he property afterwards restore by the influence of a neighbouring tribe ally to mahomet who know something of the revenge mete out by the prophet as it be as soon as he hear of it he despatch zeid with 500 man who fall upon the benus judzam and slaughter many when the expedition return to medina with the news they find that the tribe in question have send in its submission before the slaying of its member the judzam envoy demand compensation what can be do reply mahomet i can not restore dead man to life but the booty that have be take i will return and give you safe escort hence mahomet 's next enterprise be to send one of he chief warrior and wise man to dumah to try and convert the tribe they listen to he word and promise and after a time judge it be not alone to they spiritual but also to they political welfare to follow this powerful leader they embrace islam and receive the protectorship of the prophet zeid return from the plunder of the kureisch caravan and straightway set out upon several mercantile journey upon one of which he be set upon and plunder by the benus fazara near wadi-al-cora swift retribution follow at the hand of mahomet who be not mind to see the expedition that be secure the wealth of he land the prey of maraud tribe many barbarity be practice at the overthrow of the benus fazara possibly as a salutary lesson to neighbouring tribe lest they should presume to attempt like attack but now a further menace threaten mahomet from the persecute but still actively hostile jew at kheibar they be suspect of stir up revolt and so the prophet know the activity centre in they leader slew he by treachery still he successor continue he father 's work only in the fullness of time to be remove from the prophet 's path by the same effectual but illicit means dark and tortuous indeed be some of the way by which mahomet hold he power he cruelty and treachery be in a measure demand of he as a necessity for he continued office they be the price he pay for earthly dominion and together with the avowed help of the sword they be the stern and pitiless means that secure the triumph of islam as time go on the scope of he state-craft widen its exigency become more varied and exact new and often barbarous deed that the position win with year of thought and energy might be maintain mahomet have now pay complete homage to the fickle goddess force and craft the sacred month dzul-cada of 628 come round bring with it disturbing dream and yearning for mahomet for long past indeed ever since he have find himself the leader of a religious organization and have take the broad tradition of meccan ceremony half unconsciously to himself as the basis of he faith he have long to perform the pilgrimage to the holy city he have uphold mecca before the eye of he follower as the crown and cradle of they faith he have preach of pilgrimage thereto as a sacred duty the inalienable right of every muslim six year have elapse since he have himself perform the sacred rite it be no wonder therefore that he whole be be seize with the fervent dream of accomplish once more the ceremony inseparable from he faith political consideration also sway he decision if he be allow to come peaceably to mecca and perform the pilgrimage it be conceivable that a permanent truce might be agree upon by the kureisch and the deed itself could not but enhance he prestige among the bedouin he be strong enough to resist the meccan in case of a attack and if such a thing should occur the blame would attach to the kureisch as violator of the sacred month with he thought attuned thus it be not surprising that in dzul-cada a vision be vouchsafe he wherein he see himself within the sacred precinct perform the rite of pilgrimage the dream be communicate to the faithful and instant preparation make for the expedition mahomet call upon the surround tribe to join in he march to mecca but they fear the kureisch host for the most part decline and earn thereby mahomet 's fierce anger in the page of the kuran at length the cavalcade be ready 1500 man in the garment of pilgrim but with sword and armor accompany they in the rear journey over the desert track that have see the migration to medina of a small hunt band six short year previously with they be seventy camel devote to sacrifice the pilgrim march as far as osfan when a messenger come to they say that the kureisch be oppose they advance they have withdraw they milch camel from the outskirts and now lie encamped have gird themselves with leopard skin a signal that they will fight like wild beast even now khalid with they cavalry have advance to oppose thee curse upon the kureisch reply mahomet who will show I a way where they will not meet we a guide be quickly find and mahomet turn he company aside journey by devious route until he come to the place of hodeibium a plain upon the verge of the sacred territory here al-cawsa mahomet 's prize camel halted and would in nowise be urge farther she be weary clamour the populace but mahomet know otherwise al-caswa be not weary he reply but that which restrain the army in the year of the elephant now restraineth she and he would go no farther into the sacred territory fear the doom that have afflict abraha in that fateful year so he pilgrim host encamp at hodeibium and mahomet send man to clear the well of sand and dust so that there might be ample supply of water thereupon negotiation begin between the prophet and mecca the kureisch send a ambassador to learn the reason of the appearance of mahomet when the peaceable intent of the army have be explain to he he remain in earnest converse with the prophet until at last he move to catch at the sacred beard after the manner of he race when speak instantly one of mahomet 's companion seize he hand : come not near the sacred countenance of god 's prophet the enemy be amaze and return tell the citizen that he have see many king in he lifetime but never a man so devotedly love as mahomet the negotiation however proceed very tardily and at last mahomet send othman he famous warrior and companion to mecca to conduct the final overture he have be choose because of he kinship with the most powerful man of mecca he be invite to perform the sacred ceremony of encircle the kaaba but this he refuse to do until the prophet should accompany he the kureisch then detain he at mecca to complete if it might be the negotiation while othman tarry the report spread among the muslim that he be treacherously slay mahomet feel that a blow have be strike at he very heart instantly he summon the faithful to he beneath a tall tree upon that undulate plain of hodeibium and enjoin upon they a oath that they would not forsake he but would stand by he till death the muslim with one accord give they solemn word in gladness and devotion and the pledge of the tree be bring into be mahomet feel the significance of they loyalty very deeply it be the first oath he have enjoin upon the believer since the day of the pledge of acaba long ago when he be but a persecute zealot flee before the menace of he foe he be glad because of this proof of loyalty and he joy find expression in the muslim book of book : well pleased have god be now with the believer when they plight fealty to thee under the tree and he know what be in they heart therefore do he send down upon they a spirit of secure repose and reward they with a speedy victory but rumor as ever prove untrustworthy and before long othman return with the news that the kureisch be undispose to battle and later they send suheil of they own clan to make term with mahomet namely that he be to return to medina that year but that the next year he might come again as a pilgrim during the sacred month and have enter mecca perform the pilgrimage alus be command to write down the condition of the treaty and he begin with the formulum : in the name of god the compassionate the merciful suheil protest i know not that title write ` in thy name o god ' mahomet acquiesce and alus continue the treaty of mahomet prophet of god with suheil ibn amr but suheil interrupted again : if i acknowledge thee as prophet of god i should not have make war on thee write simply thy name and the name of thy father and so the treaty be draw up the traditional text of it be simple and clear and the only point require comment be the clause provide for the treatment of those who go over to islam and those of the believer who rejoin the kureisch mahomet be sure enough of himself and he magnetism to allow the clause to stand which allow any backslider full permission to return to mecca he know there would not be many who have come under the spell of islam would return again to idolatry the text of the treaty stand substantially in these term : in thy name o god these be the condition of peace between mahomet son of abdallah and suheil son of amr war shall be suspend for ten year whosoever wisheth to join mahomet or enter into treaty with he shall have liberty to do so and likewise whoever wisheth to join the kureisch or enter into treaty with they if one goeth over to mahomet without permission of he guardian he shall be send back to he guardian but should any of the follower of mahomet return to the kureisch they shall not be send back mahomet shall retire this year without enter the city in the coming year mahomet may visit mecca he and he follower for three day during which the kureisch shall retire and leave the city to they but they may not enter it with any weapon save those of the traveller namely to each a sheathed sword after the solemn pledge of the treaty mahomet sacrifice he victim shave he head and change he raiment as a symbol of the complete ceremonial in spirit if not in fact and order the immediate withdrawal to medina he follower be crestfallen for they have be lead to expect he speedy entry into mecca and they be disappoint too because they warlike desire have be curb to stifle point but the prophet be firm and promise they fight in plenty as soon as they should have reach medina again so the host move back to its city of origin fortify by the treaty with its hitherto implacable foe and exult in the promise that next year the sacred ceremony would be accomplish by all true believer the depression that at first seize he follower at the conclusion of they enterprise find no reflex in the mind of mahomet he be well aware of the significance of the transaction in the kuran the episode have a sura inspire directly by it and entitle victory the burden of which be the goodness of god upon the occasion of the prophet 's pilgrimage to hodeibium in truth they who plight fealty to thee really plighted fealty to god the hand of god be over they hand whoever therefore shall break he oath shall only break it to he own hurt but whoever shall be true to he engagement with god he will give he a great reward it be in fact a great step forward towards he ultimate goal it involve he recognition by the kureisch as a power of equal importance with themselves no longer be he the outcast fanatic for whose overthrow the kureisch army be not require to put forth its full strength no longer even be he a rebel leader who have succeed in establish he precarious power by the sword alone the treaty of hodeibium recognize he as sovereign of medina and formally concede to he by implication he temporal governance it be not to be wonder at therefore that he mood on return to the city be one of rejoice and praise to allah who have make such a victory possible henceforward the dream of universal sovereignty take ever more distinctive lineament in he mind he picture first a great and united arabium mighty because of its homage to the true god and supreme because of its birthing of the world-subduing faith to say that these thought have be with he since he first hazardous entry into medina be to grant he a long-sightedness which he opportunist rule do not warrant the creator of they be he boundless energy he force of personality which keep steadily before he he unquenchable faith and lead he from strength to strength by diplomacy and the sword he have carve out he kingdom and now he purpose to extend it by suasion and cunning which nevertheless be to be support by he soldier 's skill and courage the next phase in he career be one in which reliance be place as much upon statecraft as warfare in which he try with vary success to array he state and he religion along with the great empire and principality of he eastern world chapter xvii the fulfil pilgrimage o ye to whom the scripture have be give believe in what we have send down confirmatory of the scripture which be in you hand ere we efface you feature and twist you head round backward or curse you as we curse the sabbath-breaker : and the command of god be carry into effect the end of dzul-cada saw mahomet safe in he own city but with he promise of booty and warfare for he follower unfulfilled he remain a month at medina and then seek means to carry out he pact he have now determine upon a pure war of aggression and for this the outcast jew of kheibar offer themselves as a acceptable sacrifice in he eye in muharram he prepare a expedition against they important as be the first of any size that he have undertake from the offensive it be a greater proof of he renewed security and rapidly grow power than all the eulogy of he follower and the curse of he enemy the white standard be place in the hand of alus and the whole host of 1000 strong go up against the fortress of kheibar the jews be take completely off they guard without ally and with no store of food and ammunition they could make no prolonged resistance one by one they fort fall before the muslim raider until only the stronghold of kamuss remain mahomet be exultant allah akbar truly when i light upon the coast of any people woe unto they in that day then he assemble all he man and put the sacred eagle standard at they head the white standard with the black eagle emboss work out of the cloak of he wife ayesha he bid they lead the assault upon kamuss and spare nothing until it should fall to they in the carnage that follow marhab chief of kheibar be slay and at length the jews be beat back with terrible loss there be now no hope leave : the fortress kamuss must fall and with it the last resistance of the jew they house goods and woman be seize they land confiscate kinana the chief who have dare to try and originate a coalition previously against mahomet be tortured by the burning brand and put to death while safium he seventeen year old bride pass tranquilly into the hand of the conqueror mahomet marry she and she be content indeed rejoice at this sudden change for accord to legend she have dream that such honor should befall she but all the woman of the jew be not so complacent and in zeinab sister of marhab burn all the fierceness and lust for revenge of which the proud hebrew spirit be capable she would smite this plunderer of she nation though it might be by treacherous means have he not betray she kindred far more terribly upon the bloody slaughter ground of the koreitza she prepare for he pleasure a young kid dress it with care and place it before he in the shoulder she put the most effective poison she know and the rest of the meat she polluted also when mahomet come to the partaking he take he favorite morsel the shoulder and set it to he lip instantly he realize the tainted flavor he cry to he companion : this meat telleth I it be poison eat ye not of it but it be too late to save two of the faithful who have swallow mouthful of it they die in torture a few hour afterwards mahomet himself be not immune from its poison he have himself bleed at once and immediate evil be avert but he feel the effect of it ever after and attribute not a little of he later exhaustion to the poison meat he have eat in kheibar the woman be put to death horribly and the muslim army hasten to depart from the ill-omened place they return to medina after several month absence and there the spoil be divide the land as usual be give out to muslim follower or the jew be allow to keep they holding provide they pay half the produce as tribute to mahomet half the conquer territory however be reserve exclusively for the prophet constitute a sort of crown domain whence he draw revenue and profit thus be temporal wealth continually employ to strengthen he spiritual kingdom and put he faith upon a unassailable foundation the expedition to kheibar see the promulgation of several ordinance deal with the personal and social life of he follower the dietary law be put into stricter practice the flesh of carnivorous animal be forbid and a severer embargo be lay upon the drinking of wine -- the result of mahomet 's knowledge of the havoc it make among man in that fierce country and among those wild and passionate soul henceforward also the most careful count be keep of all the booty take in warfare and those who be discover in the possession of spoil fraudulently obtain be subject to extreme penalty all spoil be inviolate until the formal division of it which usually take place upon the battlefield itself or less frequently within medina the prophet 's share be one-fifth and the rest be distribute equally among the warrior and companion since islam derive its temporal wealth chiefly by spoliation the destiny of its plunder be a important question and give rise to frequent dispute between the disaffected and the believer which be mention in the kuran by now however the malcontent be for the most part silence and we hear little disputation after this as to the apportionment of wealth with the return to medina come the inaugury of mahomet 's extension of diplomacy -- the dream which have fill he mind since the tide of he fortune have turn with the kureisch failure to capture he city the year 628 the first year of embassy see he courier journey to the prince and emperor of he immediate world to demand or cajole acknowledgment of he mission a great seal be engrave have for its sign mahomet the prophet of god and this be append to the strange and incoherent document which spread abroad he creed and pretension the first embassy to heraclius be send in this year summon he to follow the religion of god 's prophet and to acknowledge he supremacy at the same time the prophet send a like missive to the ghassanide prince harith ally of heraclius and a great soldier the envoy be treat with the contempt inevitable before so strange a request from a unknown fanatic and heraclius dismiss the whole matter as the idle word of a barbarian dreamer but harith with the quick resentment harbour by smaller man ask permission of the emperor to chastise the impostor heraclius refuse the embassy be not worthy of he notice and he be certainly determine not to lose good fight man in a useless journey through the desert so mahomet receive no message in return from the emperor but the omission make no difference to he determination to proceed upon he course of diplomacy he then send to siro of persium a similar letter but here he be treat more rudely the envoy be receive in audience by the king who read the extraordinary letter and in a flash of anger tear it up he do not ill-treat the messenger however and suffer he to return to he own land even so o lord rend thou he kingdom from he cry mahomet as he hear the story of he flout he next enterprise be more successful the governor of yemen badzan nominally under the sway of persium have separate himself almost entirely from he overlord during the unstable rule of siro son of the warrior chosro now badzan embrace islam and with he conversion the yemen population become officially follower of the prophet encourage by the success mahomet send a despatch to egypt where he be courteously receive and give two slave girl mary and shirin as present mary he keep for himself because of she exceed beauty but shirin be bestow upon one of the companion although the egyptian king do not embrace islam he be kindly disposed towards its prophet the next despatch to abyssinium be distinguish by the importance of its indirect result ever since the small body of islamic convert have flee thither for refuge before the persecution of the kureisch mahomet have desire to convert abyssinium to he creed now he send a envoy to its king enjoin he to embrace islam and ask for the hand of omm haliba in marriage daughter of abu sofian and widow of obeidallah one of the four inquirer of a earlier and almost forget time the despatch be well receive by the governor who allow omm haliba and all who wish of the original immigrant to return to they native country jafar mahomet 's cousin exile to abyssinia in the old troublous time be the most famous of these disciple he be a great warrior and find he glory fight at the head of the army of the prophet at muta where he be slay and enter forthwith upon the paradise of joy which await the martyr for islam not long after he return from kheibar the refugee arrive and mahomet take omm haliba to wife during the remainder of 628 the prophet hold he state in medina only send out some of he lesser leader at interval upon small defensive expedition he position be now secure but only just as long as he right arm never waver and he hand never rest from slaughter by the edge of the sword he conquest have be make by the edge of the sword alone they would be keep but it be now necessary only for he to show he power the frightened arab tribe creep away cow before he vigilance but if the whip be once put out of sight they would spring again to the attack he now receive the title of prince of hadaz how and by whom bestow upon he we have no record most probably he wrest it himself by force from the tribe inhabit that country and compel they to acknowledge he by that sign of overlordship the year before the stipulate time for mahomet to repair once more to mecca be spend in consolidate he position by every means in he power he be resolve that no weakness on he part should give the kureisch the chance to refuse he again the entry into they city he position be to be such that any question of ignore the treaty would be make impossible and by the time of dzul cada 629 he have carry out he design with that thoroughness of which only he in all arabia seem at that period capable two thousand man gather round he to participate in the important ceremony which be for they the visible sign of they kinship with the sacred city and its ultimate religious absorption in they own all-conquering creed they be clothe in the dress of pilgrim and carry with they only the sheathed sword of they compact for defense but a body of man bring up the rear themselves in armor drive before they pack-camels whereon rest arm and munitions of all kind sixty camel be take for sacrifice and mahomet son of maslama with one hundred horse form the vanguard so as to prove a defense should the passion of the kureisch overcome they discretion and nullify they plighted word abdallah the impetuous would fain have shout some defiant word as the cavalcade near the portal of the city but omar restrain he and mahomet give the command speak ye only these word ` there be no god but god it be he that have upholden he servant alone have he put to flight the host of the confederate ' so any tumult be prevent and the truce carry out then begin one of the most wonderful episode ever write upon the page of history -- nothing less than the peaceable emigration for three day of a whole city before the host of one who but a little time since have flee thence from the persecution of he fellow all the meccan armed population retire to the hill and leave they city free for the completion of mahomet 's religious rite with the sublimest faith in he integrity they leave they city defenceless at he foot truly the prophet 's magnetism have win he many a adherent and secured he great triumph in warfare but never have he power shone with such lustre as at the time of he fulfil pilgrimage the city be leave weaponless before he soldiery and the dweller within its wall be content to trust to the power of a write agreement which in the hand of a unscrupulous man would be as effective as a reed against a whirlwind mahomet enter the city and for three day pitch he tent of leather beneath the shadow of the kaaba he make the sevenfold circuit thereof and kiss the black stone thence he journey with all he follower to safa and marwa where he perform the necessary rite and at which latter place he sacrifice he victim draw they up in line between himself and the city then return there he ask for and obtain the hand of meimuna sister-in-law of he uncle abba a bold and characteristic stroke which do much to pave the way for the later conversion of he uncle and the final enrolment of the chief man of mecca upon he side this be the last marriage he contract and it show as so many other alliance he keen political foresight and the exercise of he favorite method of attempt to win over hostile state he be still the political leader and schemer though the ecstasy of religion symbolise for he just now in the rite of the lesser pilgrimage have catch he for the moment in its sweep public prayer be offer upon the third day from the kaaba itself and with that the pilgrimage come to a end mahomet try earnestly to win over and conciliate the meccan during this meager three day ' sojourn but he task be beyond the power even of he magnificent energy at the end of the third day the meccan return thy time be outrun : depart thou out of we city mahomet answer : what can it matter if ye allow I to celebrate my marriage here and make a feast as be the custom but they reply with anger we need not thy feast depart thou hence and mahomet be reluctantly force to comply he have be not without hope that the kureisch would be win over to he cause in such great number that he might be suffer to remain as head of a convert mecca and he be loth to see such a unrivalled opportunity slip by without try he utmost to gain some kind of permanent foothold in the city of he desire but he faith weigh not so well with the kureisch and have within himself the strength which know when to desist from importunity he quit the city and retire to sarif eight mile away where he rest together with he host of believer now content and reverent towards the master who have make they dream incarnate they ideal tangible at sarif mahomet receive what be perhaps the best fortune that have come to he outside he own powerful volition khalid the skilful leader at ohod and the greatest warrior the kureisch possess together with amru poet and scholar as well as future warrior and conqueror of egypt be win over to the faith they have so obstinately oppose they join mahomet at sarif and be forthwith appoint among the companion the equal of alus othman and omar follow they adherence to the win cause come the allegiance to

expeditionary force at fadak receive now at he hand they delay but inevitable punishment the prophet find himself strong enough and without any compunction he inflict the severest chastisement upon they more especially as a example to the neighbouring tribe of the retribution in store for all who dare to revolt against he newly-won but still precarious power soon after a expedition of fifteen man be send to dzat allah upon the border of syrium the man journey confidently to they far-off goal but instead of finding as they expect a few chief at the head of ill-organised army they find array against they a overwhelming force well lead and discipline they call upon they to embrace islam with the fine courage of certain failure the bedouin horde scoff at the exhortation and forthwith slew the whole company except one who manage to escape to medina with the tale the catastrophe be a signal for a mass attack upon mahomet 's power from the whole of the border district lead by the feudatory of heraclius who be bent upon exterminate the upstart hastily the muslim army be mobilise give into the leadership of zeid who with jafar and abdallah be commission to resist the infidel to the last and to continue they attack upon the foe until they be either slay or victorious the army march to muta in September 629 and while on the way hear with alarm of the massing of the foe whose number daunt even they savage bravery at muta a council of war be call at which zeid and abdallah be the principal speaker after the peril of they position have be discuss and the reason for retreat give abdallah rise from among he fellow determine to rally they spirit he press for a immediate advance urge the invincibility of allah the power of they prophet and the glory of they cause it be impossible for those warrior spirit not to respond to he enthusiasm and the order be give the muslim march to beleea by the dead sea but find themselves in no good strategic position and hearing still further news as to the immensity of they opposition they retire to muta where at the head of a narrow ravine they offer battle to the roman auxiliary who far outweigh they in number and efficiency the roman phalanx bear down upon they and zeid at the head of he troops urge they to resist with all they strength he be cut down in the van as he lead the oppose rush and instantly jafar leap from he horse maim it as a symbol that he would fight to the death and rush forward on foot the fight grow furious and as the muslim army see itself slowly press back by the enemy its leader fall cover with wound abdallah seize the standard and try to rally the faithful whose slow retreat be now break into a headlong flight at he cry there be a brief rally until in he turn he be cut down by the advance foe a citizen spring to the standard and keep it aloft while he strive to stem the tide but in vain the muslim rank be break and dispirit they fall back quickly and only the military genius of khalid in command of the rear be able to save they from annihilation he succeed in cover they retreat by he swift and skilful moving and enable the remnant to return to medina in safety mahomet 's grief at the loss of jafar and zeid be great jafar have only lately return from abyssinium and be just at the beginning of he military career he be the brother of alus and the martial spirit that have raise that warrior to eminence be only just now give opportunity to manifest itself he loss be rightly feel by mahomet to be a blow to the military as well as the intellectual prowess of islam the syrian feudatory however be not permit to enjoy they triumph in peace in October 629 amru mahomet 's recent convert be send to chastise the offender and exact tribute from they he find the task be greater than he have imagine and send hurriedly to medina for reinforcement abu obeida be in command of the new army and when he come up with amru there be a angry discussion as to who should be leader abu obeida have the precedent of experience and the asset of have be longer in mahomet 's service than amru but he be a mild man fearful and a laggard in dispute amru 's impetuous determination overrule he and he yield to the compulsion of he more energetic rival fear to provoke disaster by prolong the quarrel the hostile syrian tribe be rapidly disperse with the increase force at amru 's command and he return triumphant to medina as a recompense for he yielding of the leadership to amru abu obeida be entrust by mahomet with the task of reduce the tribe of joheina to submission the expedition be wholly successful the joheina accept the prophet 's yoke without opposition and they lead be follow later in the year by the benus ab murra and the benus dzobian and finally the benus suleim whose enmity in conjunction with the benus ghatafan have do much to prolong the siege of medina the prophet be exultant the year 's success have surpass he expectation and the mature of he deep-laid plan for the reduction of mecca by pressure without bloodsh satisfied he ambitious and dominate soul he be now master of hedaz overlord of yeman and the bedouin tribe of the interior as far as the dim syrian border but with all he newly-found sovereignty there be one stronghold which he could neither conquer nor even impress on the crowning achievement of subdue mecca all he hope be set and there be no means that he do not employ to increase he power so that its continued resistance might ultimately become impossible he strengthen he hold over the rest of arabium he win from mecca as many ally as he could he continually impressed upon both he follower and the surround tribe that the city be he natural home the true abiding-place of he faith now have prepare the way he venture to ensure the safety thereof by diplomacy and a skilful use of the demonstration of force he be strong enough to compel a encounter with the kureisch which should prove decisive in the attack upon the khozaa ally of the prophet the benus bekr who give they allegiance to the kureisch supply mahomet with the necessary _ casus bellus _ he declare upon the evidence of he friend that the kureisch have help the benus bekr in disguise and announce the swift enforcement of he vengeance in alarm the kureisch send abu sofian to medina to make they deposition as to the rights of the case and to beg for clemency but they emissary meet with no success mahomet feel himself powerful enough to flout he and accordingly abu sofian be send back to he native city discomfited there follow a tradition which have become obscure with the passing of time and whose import we can only dimly investigate abu sofian be return somewhat uneasily to mecca when he encounter the chief of the khozaa the outraged tribe a interview of some length be report and it be suppose that the chief represent to the meccan citizen the hopelessness of he resistance and the advantage in belong to the party that be rapidly bring all arabium under its sway abu sofian listen and it may be that the chief 's word induce he to consider seriously the possibility of range himself beneath the banner of the prophet meanwhile mahomet have summon all the matchless energy of which he be capable and set on foot preparation for the overwhelming of mecca every believer be call to arm equipment horse camel store be gather in vast concourse upon the outskirts of medina await only the command of the prophet to go up against the scornful city whose humiliation be at hand the order to march be give on January 1 630 and soon the whole army be bear down upon mecca with that rapidity which continually characterise the prophet 's action and which be more than ever necessary now in face of the difficult task to be perform in a week the prophet with zeinab and dram salma as he companion at the head of 10000 man the largest army ever see in medina arrive within a stage of he goal he encamp at mar azzahran and there rest he army from the long desert march the toilsome and difficult route connect the two long-sundered city that have give feature to the origin and growth of islam while he be there he receive what be perhaps the most important asset since the conversion of khalid abba he uncle still timorous and vacillate but now impel into a firmer courage by the powerful agency of mahomet 's recent triumph quit mecca with he follow and join he nephew profess the creed of islam and enjoin it also upon those who accompany he the conversion do not come as a surprise to mahomet he have be watch carefully by means of he spy the trend of event in mecca and he know that the allegiance of abba be he whenever he should collect sufficient force to demonstrate he superiority abba love the win cause when mahomet be obscure and persecute he have befriend he as far as personal protection but he be not the nature to venture upon a hazardous enterprise such as the prophet 's attempt to find a new religious community in another city now however that the undertaking have prove so completely victorious that it threaten to make of mecca the weaker side abba with the solemnity which fall upon such people when self-interest point the same way as previous inclination throw in he lot with islam the muslim rest that night at mar azzahran kindle they camp-fire upon the crest of a hill whose summit could be see from the holy city the glare flame red against the purple night sky and by its ominous glow abu sofian venture beyond the city 's boundary to reconnoitre before he could penetrate as far as the muslim encampment he be meet by abba who take he straightway to mahomet when the morning come the prophet send for he rival and greet he with contempt : woe unto thee abu sofian seest thou not that there be no god but god but he answer with profession of he regard for mahomet woe unto thee abu sofian believest thou not that i be the prophet of god thou art well appraise by we and i see thy great goodness among the companion as for what thou hast say i know not the wherefore of it then abba standing by mahomet besought he : woe unto thee abu sofian become one of the faithful and believe there be no god but god and that mahomet be he prophet before we sever thy head from the body under such strong compulsion say tradition abu sofian be convert and send back to mecca with promise of clemency it be almost impossible not to believe that collusion between abba and abu sofian exist before this interview abba have give the lead for he prescience have divine the uselessness of resistance and he foresee greater glory as the upholder of islam the triumph cause than as the vain opposer of what he firmly believe to be a all-conquering power abu sofian take somewhat longer to convince and never really give up he dream of resistance until he meet abba on the fateful night and be show the vastness of the medinan army they good organization and they boundless enthusiasm thereat he hope of victory become dust and he bow to the inevitable in the same manner as abba have do before he though from different motive one be actuate by the desire for favor and fame the other only anxious to save he city from the horror of a prolonged and ultimately unsuccessful siege thereafter the army march upon mecca and mahomet complete he plan for a peaceful entry zobeir one of he most trust commander be to enter from the north khalid and the bedouin from the southern or lower suburb where possible resistance might be meet as it be the most populous and turbulent quarter abu obeida follow by mahomet take the nearest road skirt jebel hind it be a anxious time as the force divide and make its appoint way so as to come upon the city from three side mahomet watch he army from the rear in a kind of paralysis of thought which overtake man of action who have provide for every contingency and now can do nothing but wait khalid alone encounter opposition but he skill and the force behind he soon drive the meccan back within they narrow street and there separate they into small company rob they of all concerted action and render they a easy prey to he oncoming soldiery mahomet draw breath once more and see all be well and that the other entry have be peacefully effect direct he tent to be pitch to the north of the city it be in fact a bloodless revolution mahomet the outcast the despise be now lord of the whole splendid city that stretch before he eye he have see what few man be vouchsafe the material fulfilment of he year-long dream and know it be by he own tireless energy and overmastering faith that they have be work upon the soil of he native land he first act be to worship at the kaaba but before complete the whole ancestral rite he destroy the idol that polluted the sanctuary then he command bilal to summon the faithful to prayer from the summit of the kaaba and when the concourse of believer crowd to the precinct of that sacred place he know that this occupation of mecca would be write among the triumphant deed of the world he victory be not stain by any relentless vengeance strength be always the harbinger of mercy only four people be put to death accord to tradition two women-singer who have continue they insulting poem even after he occupation of the city and two renegade from islam about ten or twelve be proscribe but of these several be afterwards pardon even hind the savage slayer of hamza submit and receive she pardon at mahomet 's hand a order be promulgate forbid bloodshed and the orderly settlement of believer among the meccan population embark upon only one commander violate the peace khalid send to convert the jadzima just outside the city find they recalcitrant and take ruthless vengeance he slew they most barbarously and return to mecca expect reward but mahomet know well the value of mercy and he be not by nature vindictive towards the weak and inoffensive he could punish without remorse those who oppose he and be he equal in strength but towards inferior tribe he have the compassion of the strong he could not censure khalid as he be too valuable a general but he be really grieve at the barbarity practice against the jadzima he effectually prevent any further cruelty and on that very account render he authority secure and he rulership free from attempt to throw off its yoke within the vicinity of he newly-won power the populace be far too weak to resist the muslim incursion its leader abu sofian and abba with they following have surrender to the hostile faith for the inhabitant there be nothing now between submission and death the believer be merciful and they have nought to fear from they violence they embrace the new faith in self-defence and receive the rulership of the prophet very much as they have receive the government of all the other chieftain before he one command however be to be rigidly obey the command inseparable from the dominion of islam idolatry be to be exterminate the accursed idol tear down and annihilate party of muslim be send out to the neighbouring district to break these desecrator of islam the famous al-ozza and manat whose power mahomet for a brief space have formerly acknowledge be sweep into forgetfulness at nakhlum every image be destroy that picture the abomination and the temple be cleanse of pollution out of he spirit-fervour mahomet 's triumph have be achieve in the dim beginning of he faith when nothing but its conception of the indivisible godhead have be accomplish he have bring to its altar only the quenchless fire of he inspiration he have not dream at first of political supremacy only the rapture of belief and the imperious desire to convert have make he foundation of a city and then a overlordship inevitable but circumstance have force a temporal dominance upon he he become concerned for the ultimate triumph of he earthly power thereupon he dream take upon themselves the coloring of external ambition conversion might only be achieve by conquest therefore he first thought turn to its attainment and as soon as he look upon arabium with the eye of a potential despot he see mecca the center of he ceremonial he parent city hostile and unsubdued certainly from the time of the kureisch failure to capture medina he have set he deliberate aim towards its humiliation with diplomacy with caution by cruelty cajolement threatening and slaughter he have make he position sufficiently stable to attack she now she lay at he foot acknowledge he she master -- mecca the headstone of arabium the inviolate city whose tradition speak of she kinship with the hero and prophet of a earlier world henceforward the command of arabium be but a question of time with mecca subdue he anxiety for the fate of he creed be at a end as far as the mastery of the surrounding country be concern all that be need be vigilance and promptitude these two quality he possess in fullest measure and he have efficient soldiery inform with a devoted enthusiasm to supplement he diplomacy he be still to encounter resistance even defeat but none that could endanger the final success of he cause within arabium full of exaltation he settle the affair of he now subject city alter its usage to conform to he own and conciliate its member by clemency and goodwill the conquest of mecca mark a new period in the history of islam a period which place it perpetually among the ruling factor of the east and remove it for ever from the condition of a diffident minor state struggle with equally powerful neighbor islam be now the master power in arabium mightier than the kureisch than the bedouin tribe or any idolater soon to fare beyond the confines of its peninsula to impose its rigid code and resistless enthusiasm upon the people dwelling both to the east and west of its narrow cradle chapter xix mahomet victor now have god help you in many battlefield and on the day of honein when ye pride yourselve on you number but it avail you nothing then ye turn you back in flight then do god lend down he spirit of repose upon he apostle and upon the faithful and he send down the host which ye saw not and punish the infidel -- _ the kuran _ mahomet 's triumph at mecca be not leave long undisturbed if the kureisch have yield in the face of he superior army the great tribe of the hawazin be by no means mind to suffer he lordship indeed they determine forthwith vigorously to oppose it they be devote to idol-worship and leaven of mahomet 's teaching have not effect even remotely they age-long faith they now see themselves face to face not only with a religious revolution but also with political absorption in the victorious sect if they do not make good they opposition to this overwhelming enemy in they midst they assemble at auta in the range of mountain north-east of taif and threaten to raid the sacred city itself mahomet be oblige to leave mecca hurriedly after have only occupy the city for about three week he leave muadh ibn jabal to instruct the meccan and secure they allegiance and call off the whole of he army together with 2000 of the more warlike spirit of he newly conquer territory the force draw near the valley of honein where mahomet fall in with the vanguard of the hawazin there the two army the rebel under malik the muslim under the combined leadership of khalid and mahomet join battle khalid lead the van and charge up the steep and narrow valley hope to overwhelm the hawazin by he speed but the enemy fall upon they from a ambuscade at the top of the hill and sweep unexpectedly into the narrow choke path the muslim unprepared for the sudden onslaught turn abruptly and make for flight instantly above the tumult rise the voice of they leader : whither go ye the prophet of the lord be here return abba lend he encouragement to the waver file : citizen of medina ye man of the pledge of the tree of fealty return to you post in the narrow defile the battle surge in confluent wave until mahomet seize the moment when a little advantage be in he favor press home the attack and casting dust in the face of the enemy cry : ruin seize they by the lord of the kaaba they yield god have cast fear into they heart the inspired word of they leader whose vehement power all know and reverence turn the day for the muslim host they charge up the valley and overwhelm the troops at the rear of the hawazin the enemy 's rout be complete they camp and family fall into the hand of the conqueror six thousand prisoner be remove to jeirana and the fugitive army pursue to nakhlum mahomet 's loss be more severe than any which he have encounter for some time but undeterred and exultant he march to taif whose idolatrous citadel have become a refuge for the fly auxiliary of the hawazin taif remain hostile and idolatrous ever since it have reject he message with contumely in the day when he be but a religious visionary inspire by a dream it have refuse negotiation and even recognition to the blasphemous prophet now mahomet conceive that he day of vengeance have come he invest the city bring he army close up to its wall and hope to reduce it speedily but the wall of taif be strong its citadel like tower its garrison well provision its inmate determine to resist to the end a shower of arrow from the wall work such destruction among he muslim force that mahomet be force to withdraw out of range where the camp be pitch two tent of red leather be erect for he favorite wife omm salma and zeineb from the camp frequent assault be make upon the town which be carry out with the help of testudo catapult and the primitive besiege engine of the time but taif remain inviolate and each attack upon she wall make with mass troops in the hope of scale she fortress be receive by heated ball fling from the battlements which set the scale ladder on fire and bring destruction upon the helpless body of mahomet 's soldiery but if he could not impress the city mahomet wreak he full vengeance upon its neighborhood the vineyard be cut down pitilessly and the whole land of taif lay desolate liberty be even offer to the slave of the city who would desert to the invader nothing ruthless or guileful be spare by the prophet to gain he end but with no avail taif hold out until mahomet grow weary and finally raise the siege which have considerably lessen in political importance owe to the overture of the hawazin who now wish to be reconcile with mahomet have perceive that they wisdom lay in peace with so powerful a adversary they promise alliance with he and they prisoner be restore but the booty take from they be retain after the old imperious custom which demand wealth from the conquer mahomet forthwith distribute largesse among the lesser arab of the neighborhood a act of policy which call down the resentment of he adherent and cause the detail of the law of almsgive to be promulgate in the kuran the muslim point of view be that have fight for the spoil they be entitle to receive a share of it but they leader hold that it must first be distribute in part to those needy bedouin tribe who have flock to he banner the bounty have its desire effect malik the hawazin chieftain move either by he love of spoil or genuinely convinced of the truth of islam possibly by the influence of both these consideration tender he submission to mahomet and become convert February and march 630 be occupy in distribute equitably the wealth that have fall into he hand it be now the time of the lesser pilgrimage and mahomet return to mecca to perform it then have fulfil every ceremony and surround by he follower he return to medina still the capital of he formless principality and the keystone of he power thereafter mahomet rest in he own city where he live in potential kingship receive and send out embassy administer justice instruct he adherent but still keep he army alert he leader well train to quell the least disturbance or threatening of revolt the conquest of mecca and the victory of honein have render he secure from all except those abortive attack that be instantly crush by the march of the force that be to subdue they the year 680-681 be spend in the receive and send out of embassy alternate with the organising of small expedition to chastise recusant but to mahomet himself there come besides the flower of a idyll the frost of a grief mary the coptic maid young lovely and forlorn the helpless barter of a egyptian king reach medina in the first year of embassy and be reserve for the prophet because of she beauty and she innocence she have become long since a humble inmate of he harem and would have end she day in the same obscurity if potential motherhood have not come to she as a honor and a crowning when mahomet perceive that she be with child he have she remove from the company of he other wife and build for she a garden-house in upper medina where she live until she child be bear mahomet return from he campaign seek she in she retreat and give she he companionship and he prayer in April of 630 she bear a son to she master who could hardly believe that such a gift have be grant he never before have he arm hold a man-child of he own begetting and the honor lavish upon the slave-mother show he boundless gratitude to allah a son mean much to he for by that be ensure he hope for a continuance of power when he earthly sojourn be over the child be name ibrahim and all the lawful ceremony be scrupulously observe by he father he sacrifice a kid upon the seventh day and seek for the best and most fitting nurse for he new-born son mary receive in full measure the smile and favor of she master and the prophet 's wife become jealous to fury so that they former anger be revive -- the anger that also have its root in jealousy when mahomet have first look upon mary with desire eye then they have gain they lord 's displeasure as far as to cause a rebuke against they to be inscribe in the kuran but now they rage though still smoulder be useless against the triumph of that long-looked-for birth but mahomet 's joy be short-lived scarcely have three month pass when ibrahim sicken even beneath the most devoted care he father be inconsolable and the little garden-house that have be the scene of so much rejoicing be now fill with sorrow ibrahim grow rapidly worse until mahomet perceive that there be no more hope then he become resigned and have close the child 's eye give direction for its burial with all fitting ceremonial thereafter he know that allah have not ordain he a heir and become reconcile to the vast decree of fate mary instrument of he hope and despair pass into the oblivion of the despise and now useless slave we never hear any more of she beyond that the prophet treat she kindly and would not suffer she to be ill-used she be the mere necessary means of the fulfilment of he intent have fail in she task she be no longer important no longer even desire meanwhile the task of administration have be increase steadily mahomet be now strong enough to insist that none but believer be to be admit to the kaaba and its ceremony and although all the idolatrous practice in mecca be not remove until after abu bekr 's pilgrimage yet the power of polytheism be completely subdue and before long be to be extirpate from the holy place the next matter to be take in hand owe its origin to the extent of mahomet 's domain in the year 630 it be imperative that some sort of financial system should be adopt so that the prophet and the believer might possess adequate means for keep up the efficiency of the army give present to embassy from foreign land rewarding worthy subject and all the numerous demand upon a chieftain 's wealth deputy be therefore send out to the various tribe now under he sway to gather from every subject tribe the price of they protection and championship by mahomet in most case the tax-gatherer be receive as the inevitable result of submission but there be occasional resistance organise by the bolder tribe chief of whom be the temim who drive out mahomet 's envoy with contempt and ill-usage reprisal be immediately set on foot the tribe be attack and route many of its member be take prisoner these be subsequently liberate upon the tribe 's guarantee of good faith the benus mustalik also drive out the tax-gatherer but afterwards repent and send a deputation to mahomet to explain the circumstance they be pardon and give guarantee that they would dwell henceforth at peace with the prophet the summer see a few minor expedition to chastise resister chief of which be all 's campaign against the benus tay he be wholly successful and bring back to medina prisoner and booty the second year of embassy prove more gratifying than the first mahomet 's power have increase sufficiently to awe the tribe of the interior into submission and to gain at least a hearing from land beyond he immediate vicinity slowly and surely he be build up the fabric of he dominion with a watchfulness and sense of organization irresistible in its efficiency he make he presence know the sword have gain he he dominion the sword should preserve it with the help of he unfailing vigilance and diplomatic skill as he power progress it draw to itself not only the fight material but the dream and poetic aspiration of the wild untutored race who find themselves beneath he yoke islam be before all a ideal a real and material tradition give scope to the manifold quality of courage devotion aspiration and endeavor every tribe come fully within its magnetism feel it to be the sum of he life a religion which have not only a indivisible mighty god at its head but a strong and resolute prophet as its earthly leader around the central figure each see the majesty of the lord and also the headship of army the crown of power and the sovereignty of wealth they invest mahomet with the royalty of romance and the potency of he magnetism be realize in the story of the conversion of ka ' b the poet he have for year voice the feeling of contempt and anger against the prophet and have be the chief vehicle for the launching of defamatory song he conversion to the cause of islam be momentous because it deprive the idolater of they chief means of vituperation and ensure the gradual die down of the fire of abuse mahomet receive ka ' b with the utmost honor and throw over he he own mantle as a sign of he rejoice at the acquisition of so potent a man ka ' b thereupon compose the poem of the mantle in praise of he leader and lord a poem which have render he famous and well-beloved throughout the whole muslim world now embassy come to mahomet from all part of arabium instead of be the suppliant he become the dictator for whose favor prince sue hadramaut and yeman send token of alliance and promise of conversion even the far-off tribe upon the border of syrium be not all equally hostile and be content to send deputation nevertheless it be from the north that he power be threaten secure as be he control over central and southern arabia the northern feudatory back by heraclius be still obdurate and even openly hostile they be the one hope that arabium possess of throw off the prophet 's yoke which even now be threaten to press hardly upon they unrestrained nature all the malcontent look towards the north for deliverance and make haste to rally if possible to the side of the syrian border state towards the end of the year sign be not want of a concerted effort to overthrow he power on the part of all the northern tribe who have as they ally a powerful emperor and therefore might with reason expect to triumph over a usurper who have put he yoke upon they brethren of the southern interior and be only deter from attempt they complete reduction to the status of tributary state by the distance between he capital and themselves add to the menace of the imperial legion chapter xx iconoclasm oh prophet contend against the infidel and the hypocrite and be rigorous with they hell shall be they dwelling-place wretched the journey thither -- _ the kuran _ the cloud upon the syrian border gather so rapidly that they threaten any moment to burst during the autumn of 680 when mahomet hear that the feudatory be mass under the bidding of heraclius at him he realize there be no time to be lose eagerly he summon he army and expect from it the same enthusiasm for the campaign as he himself display but there be no generous response to he call syrium be far away the believer could not be convince of the importance of the attack they be weary of the incessant warfare and it be moreover the season of the heat when no man willingly embark upon arduous task the companion rally at once to the side of they leader and many true believer also support they lord but the citizen and the bedouin murmur against he exaction and for the most part refuse to accompany he only mahomet 's indefatigable energy summon together a sufficient army but the believer be generous and give not only themselves but they gold and after some delay the expedition be organise mahomet himself lead the troop leave abu bekr in medina to conduct the daily prayer and have charge of the religious life of the city while to molleima be give the administrative duty the expedition reach the valley of heja where mahomet call a halt and there about half-way from he goal rest the greater part of two day the next day see he continually advance over the scanty desert way urge on he soldier with prayer and exhortation so that they might not grow weary with the long heat and the silence finally he sight tebuk where the rebel army be report to be but by this time the border tribe have disperse frightened into inactivity by the strength of mahomet 's army and incapacitate further by lack of definite leadership there seem no fight to be do but mahomet be determine to make sure of he peaceful triumph the main force stay at tebuk while khalid be despatch to dumah there to intimidate both jew and bedouin by the size of he force and they fighting prowess the maneuver be entirely successful and before long mahomet have receive the submission of the tribe dwelling along the shore of the elanitic gulf meanwhile he have recourse to diplomacy as well as the sword he send a letter to john christian prince of eylum and receive from he a most favourable hearing john accompany the messenger back to the prophet where he accord he meet reverence and regard as the leader of a mighty faith between the two prince a treaty be draw up the text of which be extant and very probably authentic it be characteristic of the whole series of treaty enter into at this time by mahomet with the desert tribe and as such be interesting enough to reproduce these treaty be give at full length in wakidus they differ from each other by only small detail and that draw up for john of eylum may be take as fairly representative it be little more than a guarantee of safe conduct upon either side and be noticeably free from any religious requirement or commission : in the name of god the gracious the merciful a compact of peace from god and from mahomet the prophet and apostle of god grant unto yuhanna son of rubah and unto the people of eylum for they who remain at home and for those that travel by sea or by land there be the guarantee of god and of mahomet the apostle of god and for all that be with they whether of syrium or of yeman or of the sea coast whoso contraveneth this treaty he wealth shall not save he -- it shall be the fair prize of he that taketh it now it shall not be lawful to hinder the man of eylum from any spring which they have be in the habit of frequent nor from any journey they desire to make whether by sea or by land the writing of juheim and sharrabil by command of the apostle of god when this scanty document have be complete john of eyla betook himself again to he own country leave mahomet free to enter into further compact with the jew of mauna adzuh and jaaba when these have be ratify and mahomet have receive tribute from the surrounding people he set out again for medina have first make sure of khalid 's success in dumah and receive the conversion of the chief of that tribe with much gladness now depart to medina confident in he success it be with no good will that he enter its wall many of he erstwhile follower especially the tribe of bedouin have refuse he they help upon this adventure and immediate danger be past he return to rend they in the fury of he eloquence he success have give he the right to chastise even the ansar be not exempt from he wrath three who remain behind be proscribe and compel to fulfil fifty day of penance have there be a near advantage and a short journey they would certainly have follow thee but the way seem long to they yet they will swear by god ` have we be able we have surely go forth with you they be self-destroyer and god knoweth that they be surely liar ' before he have enter the city he anger be further provoke by the benus ganim who have erect a mosque ostensibly out of piety really to spite the benus amru ibn auf and to make they jealous for they own mosque at kuba whose stone he have lay with he own hand he fall upon the ganim some who have build a mosque for mischief and demolish the building then he draw attention to they perfidy in the kuran and take care that there should be no more mosque build in the spirit of rivalry and envy very little time after he return to medina abdallah leader of the disaffected he opponent and critic for so many year die suddenly he death mean a great change in the position of he party there be no strong man to succeed abdallah and they find themselves without leader or policy they have for long be nominally ally of mahomet but have not scruple under abdallah 's leadership to question he authority by opposition and sometimes in open act of war abdallah 's death crush for ever any attempt at revolt in medina and fuse the disaffected into the common stock of believer abdallah occupy rather a peculiar position in mahomet 's entourage he be often the prophet 's opponent sometimes he open defier and yet mahomet 's dealings with he be uniformly gentle and forbearing he may have have some personal regard for he abdallah be a stern and upright man whose uncompromising nature would speedily win mahomet 's respect possibly the prophet feel he might be too powerful a enemy and determine to ignore he insurrection he pay he that respect which he generosity of mind allow he to offer towards any he know and like the mahomet whose ruthlessness towards he opponent fall like a awe upon all arabium could know and do homage to a enemy who have show himself worthy of he steel all thing seem to be work towards mahomet 's final prevail now at last after many year the city of medina be unfeignedly he the jew be extirpate the disaffected unite under he banner meanwhile the city of taif still hold out in spite of malik 's incessant warfare against it but its defence be steadily grow weaker and at last the inhabitant know they could no longer continue the hopeless struggle the chief citizen send a embassy to mahomet promising to destroy they idol within three year if the prophet would release they from they harassment but mahomet refuse unconditionally the uprooting of idolatry be ever the price of he mercy the message be send back that instant demolition of the accursed thing must be make or the siege would continue then the people of taif hope once more for clemency ask to be release from the obligation of daily prayer this request mahomet also refuse but in deference to they ancestral worship and no doubt in some pity for they plight he allow they idol to be destroy by other hand than they own abu sofian and molleima be despatch with a cover force to destroy the great image lat which have stand for time immemorial in the center of taif and be the shrine for all the prayer and devotions of that fair and ancient city taif be the last stronghold of the idolater when that have fall beneath the sway of the prophet and he remote austerely majestic god-head indivisible and personless the doom of the old god be at hand they be dethrone from they high place at the bidding of a man but they have not bow they head before he proclaimed message but before the strength of he army the onward sweep of he ceaseless and victorious warfare to mahomet indeed allah have never show himself more gracious than at the fall of idolatrous taif he resolve thereupon that the crowning act of homage should be fulfil he would make a solemn journey to the holy city and accomplish the greater pilgrimage with purify rite free from the curse of the worship of many god but when he come to the setting forth and the sacred month of dzul higg be upon he he find that many idolatrous practice still remain as part of the great ceremonial he could not contaminate himself by undertake the pilgrimage while these remain but he could send abu bekr to ensure that none should remain after this year 's cleanse he be now strong enough to insist that the root out of idolatry be he chief policy and to make the break up of the ancestral god incumbent upon the whole country abu bekr be commission to set forth upon he task with 300 man and to spare neither himself nor they until the mission be accomplish and every idolatrous practice blot out and now follow one of the most characteristic act mahomet ever perform wherein obligation be make to bow to expediency and the bond of treaty snap and break before the wind of the prophet 's will abu bekr have start but one day 's journey upon the meccan road when alus be send after he with a document bear the prophet 's seal this he be to read to the faithful and receive they pledge that they would act upon its contents mahomet also publish abroad a like proclamation in the city itself the document draw up and despatch with such haste be nothing less than a release for the prophet and he follower from all obligation to the infidel after a term of four month a release by god and the apostle in respect of the heathen with whom ye have enter into treaty go to and fro in the earth securely in the four month to come and know ye can not hinder god and that verily god will bring disgrace upon the unbeliever and a announcement from god and he apostle unto the people on the day of pilgrimage that god be discharge from -lrb- liability to -rrb- the heathen and he prophet likewise fulfil unto these they engagement until the expiration of they term for god loveth the pious and when the forbid month be over then fight gainst the heathen wheresoever ye find they but if they repent and establish prayer and give the tithe leave they in peace o ye that believe verily the unbeliever be unclean wherefore let they not approach the holy temple after this year no one reading this writing which bear upon it all the stamp of authenticity can fail to see the motive behind its word its unscrupulousness have receive in all good faith the sanction of the most high mahomet know that the time be ripe for a uncompromising insistence upon the acceptance of he faith he be strong enough to compel it be allah who have strengthen he army and give he dominion therefore in allah 's name he repudiate he agreement with heathen people and by virtue of he power he purpose to bestow upon he lord a greater glory a act work in such defiance of honor at the inspiration of god savor unquestionably of hypocrisy but none who estimate aright the age and environment in which mahomet dwelt can accuse he of anything more than a keenness of political cunning which lead he to value accurately he own power and the wane reputation of idolatry the evil example he have set in this first release extend with he conquest until it be account of universal application and no muslim consider himself dishonoured if he break he pledge with any unbeliever from this time a more dogmatic and terrible note enter into he message he openly assert that idolatry be to be extirpate from arabium by the sword and that judaism and christianity be to be reduce to subordinate position judaism he have never forgive for its rejection of he as prophet and head of a federal state christianity he hate and despise because to he in these later year monotheism have become a fanatic belief and the whole conception of christ 's divinity be abhorrent to he worship of allah he be not strong enough to proclaim a destructive war against either faith but he allow they to exist in he dominion upon a precarious footing always liable to abuse attack and profanation from the spring of 631 until the end of he life mahomet 's campaign consist in defensive and punitive expedition the realm of arabium be virtually he and the constant succession of embassy promise obedience and express homage continue until the end but he be not allow to enjoy he power in peace the continuous series of small insurrection speedily suppress which have accompany he rise to power in later year be by no means end with he comparative security but they never grow sufficiently in volume to threaten he dominion they be wipe out at once by the alertness and political genius of he rule until he death give all the smaller chieftain fresh hope and become the signal for a desperate and almost successful attempt to throw off the shackle the first important conversion after he return from taif be that of jeyfar king of oman follow closely by the district of mahra and yeman which locality have be hover for some time between islam and idolatry the tribe of najran be incline to christianity and mahomet be now anxious to gain they over to himself the severity he have practice against a certain christian church of hanifa however weigh with they against any allegiance until he promise that theirs should be more favourably treat a treaty be then make with these tribe by which each be to respect the religion of the other mahomet remain in medina throughout the year 631 and the beginning of 632 keep he state like unto that of a king surround by he companion and believer receive and send forth embassy receive also tribute from those land he have conquer the beginning of that wealth which be to create the magnificence of bagdad the treasure of cordova the tribe of the benus asad the benus kunda and many from the territory of hadramaut make they submission tax-gatherer be also send out to all the tributary people and return in safety with they toll almost it seem as if peace have settle for good upon the land the only threatening come from the benus harith of the country border najran and the benus nakhla with a few minor tribe near yemen khalid be send to call the benus harith to conversion at the point of the sword and alus subdue without effort the enfeebled resistance of the benus nakhla continual embassy pour into medina the country be quiet at last after year of tumult arabium have settle for the moment peaceably under the yoke of a religious enthusiast who nevertheless possess sufficient political and military genius to find he kingdom well and strongly mahomet have attain he aim and whether he could keep what he have now rest with himself alone after this period of calm there be a diminution in he energy and fiery zeal the effort of that continual warfare have keep he in perpetual fever of action when its strain be remove he feel the weight of he kingdom and the religion he have so fearlessly rear until the end of he life he keep he hold upon he subject and every branch of justice law administration and military policy feel he detailed guide but with the attainment of peace for arabium under he sway he aggressive striving vanish virtually he have accomplish he destiny and with the keen prescience of those who have live and work for one object he know that the outermost stronghold of those which islam be destine to subdue have yield to he passionate insistence he successor would carry he work to higher attainment but he personal part be do and it be with a sense of finality that almost bring peace to he perpetually strive nature that he prepare for he last witness to the glory and unity of allah the performance of the greater and farewell pilgrimage chapter xxi last rite this day have i perfect you religion for you and have fill up the measure of my favor upon you and it be my pleasure that islam be you religion -- _ the kuran _ a year have pass since abu bekr 's purgatory pilgrimage and now the sacred month draw

locust overwhelming the country and the tune of they march spread far around in ten day the pilgrim army in the gladness of self-confidence and power arrive at sarif a short day 's march from they goal there mahomet rest before he embark upon the final journey mecca lay before he await he come she animosity silence she populace acquiescent she temple free from the curse of idolatry he mind be uplift into a fervor of praise he seem in truth about to enter upon he triumph to celebrate in very flesh the ceremony he have reverence to celebrate they in he own peculiar manner free of what be to he they bane and degradation something of the foreknowledge of the approach cessation of activity flash across he as he mount al-caswa and prepared to make the entry of the city he come upon the upper suburb by the same route as he have enter mecca two year before and proceed to the kaaba there he perform the circuit of the sacred place and the preliminary rite of the greater pilgrimage then he return to the valley outside the city where he tent be pitch and tarry there the night and now ali the mighty in arm reach the city from a admonitory expedition and demand the privilege of perform the pilgrimage mahomet reply that like most other believer he might perform the rite of the lesser pilgrimage but that the greater be bar to he because he have no victim but alus refuse to forego he privilege and at last mahomet urge by he love for he and he fear of create any disturbance at such a time feel it wiser to yield he give ali the half of he own victim and they friendship and alus 's devotion to he master be idealise and make sweeter for the gift now the rite of the greater pilgrimage properly begin mahomet preach to the people from the kaaba on the morning of the next day and when he word have rouse the intense religious spirit of those listen mass he set out for mina accompany by bilal follow by every believer and prepare to spend the night in the sacred valley when morning dawn he make he way to arafat where he climb the hill in the midst of the low-lying desolate ground standing at the summit of the hill surround by the host of he follower reveal to they eye in all the splendor and dignity of he familiarity and personally wrest authority he recite some of the verse of the kuran deal with the fit and proper celebration of the pilgrimage he expound then the manner in which that rite be to be perform for all time so long as there remain one muslim upon earth he pilgrimage will be carry out along the tradition lay down for he at this beneficent moment now have order all matter mahomet raise he hand to heaven and call allah to witness that he have complete he task : this day have i perfect you religion for you the supreme moment come and flee and the prophet descend once more into the plain and journey again to the valley of mecca where accord to immemorial tradition he cast stone or rather small pebble at the rock of the devil 's corner symbolic of the defeat of the power of darkness by puny and assail mankind thereafter he slew he victim in thankful and devout spirit and the greater pilgrimage be complete in token he shave he head pare he nail and remove the pilgrim 's robe then come before the people he exhort they further enjoin upon they the strict observance of daily prayer the fast of ramadan the rite of pilgrimage and all the essential ceremonial of the muslim faith he abolish also with one short verse of the kuran the intercalary year which have be in use among the faithful during the whole of he medinan rule the believer be now subject to the fluctuation of they month so that they year follow a perpetually change cycle bearing no relation to the solar season when the exhortation be end mahomet depart to mecca and there he encircle the kaaba and enter its portal for prayer but of this last act he repent later inasmuch as it would not be possible hereafter for every muslim to do so and he have desire to perform in all particulars the exact ceremony incumbent upon the faithful for all the future year he now make a ending of all he observance and with every rite fulfil at the head of he vast concourse summon by he tireless will and hold together by he overmastering zeal the prophet return to he governmental city ready to take up anew the rein of he temporal ruling with the sense of fine thing fittingly achieve a great purpose accomplish which render he as much at peace as he fiery temperament and the flame of he activity could compass fulfilment have come with the performance of the greater pilgrimage but still he state demand he personal government death alone could still he ardent pulse and bring about he relinquishment of command over the kingdom that be he -- death that be even now wing he silent way nearer and whose shadow have almost touch the fount of the prophet 's earthly life in such manner the greater pilgrimage be fulfil and the burden of its accomplishing be the muslim reverence for ceremony the ritual in all its forget superstition and immemorial tradition appeal most potently to the emotion of every believer all the more so because it have not be impose upon he as a new and untried ceremony by a religious reformer but come to he with all its hallowed sanctity fresh upon it to be bind up inseparably with he religious life by its purification under the prophet 's guidance its use by the founder of islam bear witness at once to he knowledge of the earlier faith and tradition and he reverence for they as well as he keen insight which place the rite of pilgrimage in the forefront of he religious system he know the value of ritual and the force of age-long association the farewell pilgrimage be the last great public act he perform he feel that it strengthen islam 's connection with the belief and ceremony of he ancestor legendarily free from idolatry under the governance of abraham and ishmael he realize too that it round off the ceremonial side of he faith give he follower a example and a material union with himself and he god it be the knowledge that this union would always be a living fact to he descendant so long as the sacred ceremony be perform that cause he to assert its necessity and to place it among the few unalterable injunction to all the faithful meanwhile a phenomenon have arise inseparable from the activity of great man wherever there be strong soul from whose spirit flow any inspiring energy there will always be find they imitator when the battle have be win whether hypocrite or genuinely lead by a sheep-like instinct into the same path as they model they follow the step of they forerunner and usually achieve some slight fame before the dark close around they early in the year badzan governor of marab nazran and hamadan die he territory be seize by mahomet in defiance of the claim of he son shehr and divide among different governor he success in the temporal world and especially this peaceful annexation of land work so vividly upon the imagination of he countryman that three false prophet arise and three separate band of devoted fanatic appear to uphold they of these three man the most effective be tuleiha of the beri asad who gather together a army and be only repel and crush by khalid himself but tuleiha still persist in spite of defeat and be content to bide he time until under abu bekr he faction rise again to importance and constitute a serious disturbance to the rule of the first caliph moseilama of whom not so much be know also attempt to usurp the prophet 's power at the close of he life mahomet demand he submission moseilama refuse but before adequate punishment could be mete out the prophet be stricken down with illness so that the task of chastisement devolve upon abu bekr aswad the veil prophet of yeman might have prove the most formidable of the three have not rashness of conduct and lack of governance cause he undoing he cast off the muslim yoke while the prophet be still alive and proclaimed himself the magician prince who would liberate he follower from the tyrant 's yoke najran rise in he favor and he march confidently upon sana the great capital city of yemen slew the puppet king shehr and take command of the surrounding country mahomet purpose to send a force against he but even while he army be mass for the march he hear that the veil prophet be assassinate the sudden success have prove he ruin aswad only need the touch of power to call out he latent tyranny cruelty and stupidity he treat the people harshly and they could not retaliate effectually but he forget be of unreflect mould the imperative necessity of conciliate the chief of he armed force he offend he leader of army and the end come swiftly the leader desert to mahomet and treacherously murder he when he have count they submission be beyond question the three impostor be not powerful enough to disturb seriously the steady flow of mahomet 's organising and administrative activity but they be indicative of the thin crust that divide he rule from anarchy a crust even now crack under the weight of the burden impose upon it need the constant cement of armed expedition to keep it from crumble beyond mahomet 's own remedy April pass quietly enough at medina but with may come the news of fresh disturbance upon the syrian border they be not serious but the pretext be sufficient muta be as yet unavenged and mahomet be glad to be able to send a force again to the troublesome frontier osama son of zeid slay in that disastrous battle be choose for leader of this expedition in spite of he youth which arouse the quick anger of some of the muslim warrior but mahomet maintain he choice he be give the battle banner by the prophet himself and the expedition sally forth to jorf where it be delay and finally hastily recall by news of a grave and most disturbing nature even as he bless the syrian expedition and send it on its road mahomet be in no fit state of health for public duty after a little while however he will triumph over he flesh and he thrust back the weakness but he physical nature have already be strain to break point under the stress of he life he have perforce to bow to the dictate of he body he give up attempt to throw off the fever and retire to ayesha 's house attribute the seizure to the effect of the poison at kheibar and convinced that he end be at hand in the house of he favorite wife he remain during the few remain day of he life he linger for about a week before he indomitable soul give way before the assault of death and all the time he continue to attend to public affair and to take he accustomed part in they as long as possible about the third day of he illness he hear the people still murmur over the appointment of osama upon the syrian expedition rise from he couch he go out to speak to they and command they to cease from such empty discontent remind they that he be they prophet and master and that they might safely rely upon he the exertion of move prove too much for he strength he be now indeed a broken man and this activity be but the last conquest of mind over he ever-growing weakness of body he return exhaust to ayesha 's room and know that he mission be over command abu bekr to lead the public prayer by this act he virtually nominate abu bekr he successor for the privilege of lead the prayer belong exclusively to himself and he designation of the office be as plain a proof as there could be that he consider the mantle of authority to have descend upon he friend and counsellor who have be to he so unfail a resource in defeat and triumph through all the tumultuous year from this time the prophet grow steadily worse he physical break-up be complete he have use every particle of he enormous energy in the fulfilment of he work now that activity have cease there be no reserve leave he become delirious and finally weak to the point of utter exhaustion many be the tradition concern he die word chiefly exhortation for the preservation of the faith he have so laboriously bring to life he be say to have curse both jew and christian in he paroxysm of fever but in he lucid moment he seem to have be fill with love for he disciple and fear for the future of he religion and temporal state he linger thus for two more day -- day which gather round he the deep spiritual fervor the human love and affection of every believer so that the record be interpenetrate with the grief and tenderness of a people 's sorrow on the third day he rally sufficiently to come to morning prayer where he take a seat by abu bekr in token of he dedication of the headship of islam to he alone the believer ' joy at the sight of they prophet show itself in they throng thanksgiving and in they escort of they chief back to he place of rest it seem that he illness be but slight and that before long he would appear among they once more in all the fullness of he strength but the exertion sap he little remain vitality and he could scarcely reach ayesha 's room again there a few hour afterwards after a period of semi-consciousness he die in she arm while it be yet only a little after mid-day the forlorn ayesha be almost too terrify to impart the dreadful news abu bekr be summon instantly and come with awe and horror into the mosque omar mahomet 's beloved warrior-friend refuse to believe that he leader be really dead and even rush to announce he belief to the people but abu bekr visit the place of death and assure himself by the still cold form of the prophet that he be indeed dead he go out with despair in he countenance and convince the faithful that the soul of they leader have pass there fall upon islam the hush of a intolerable knowledge and in the first blankness of realisation they be dumb and passive when the army at jorf be apprise of the news it break up at once and return to medina with the withdrawal of the guide hand they battle enthusiasm become as nought and they could only join the wait rank of the citizen -- a crowd that would now be drive whither its master see fit the faithful assemble round the mosque to question the future of themselves and they ruler abu bekr address they at once and it be soon evident that he have they well in hand he be support by omar and the chief leader except alus who maintain a jealous attitude chiefly due to the feeling of envy arouse in the mind of fatima he wife at the sight of ayesha 's privilege at last when abu bekr have tell the circumstance of the prophet 's death tenderly and with that loving reverence which characterise he the faithful be attuned to the acceptance of this man as they prophet 's successor the chief man follow by the rank and file swear fealty to he and covenant to maintain intact and precious the faith bequeath they by they leader who have be also they guide and fellow-worshipper of allah there remain only the last dignity of burial the prophet 's body be wash and prepare for the grave around it be wrap white linen and a outer covering of striped yemen stuff abu bekr and omar perform these simple service for they prophet and then a grave be dig for he in ayesha 's house and a partition make between the grave and the antechamber it be dig vaulted fashion and the body deposit there upon the evening of the day of death the people be permit to visit it and after the long procession have look they last upon they prophet abu bekr and omar deliver speech to the assemble multitude urge they to remain faithful to they religion and to hold before they continually the example of the prophet who even now be receive into the paradise he have describe so ardently and love with such enshrine desire thus the prophet of islam religious and political leader director of army lover of woman austere devout passionate cunning lay as he would have wish in the simplicity of that communal life in the midst of he follower near the sacred temple of he own devise he have live close to he disciple have appear to they a man among man indue only with the divine authority of he religious enthusiasm now he rest among they as one of themselves and none but feel the inspiration of he energy inform they activity after he though the manifestation thereof confine itself to the violence necessary to maintain the prophet 's domain secure from its earthly enemy mahomet indeed in he mortal likeness rest in the quiet of ayesha 's chamber but he spirit still lead he follower to prayer and conquest still stand at the head of he army urge to victory and plunder so that they might find in the flaunt banner of islam the fulfilment of they lust and aspiration they worldly triumph and the glory of they heavenly vision chapter xxii the genesis of islam the jew say ` ezra be a son of god ' and the christian say ` the messiah be a son of god ' they resemble the say of the infidel of old they take they teacher and they monk and the messiah son of mary for lord beside god though bidden to worship one god only there be no god but he far what from he glory be what they associate with he -- _ the kuran _ the prophet of arabium have scarcely be commit to the keep of earth when on all side rebellion against he rule arise the unity that he have labor so long to create be still in embryo but the seed of it be live and develop rapidly to its full fruition in the political sphere he achievement be not limit to the immediate security of he dominion he have inculcate mainly by the forcible logic of the sword the idea of union and discipline and have restore in mightier degree the fall greatness of he land tradition of arabian prosperity during the time when it be the trade route from persium and the east to petraea palestine and even asia minor linger in the native mind the caravan route from southern arabium famous in biblical story have make the importance of such city as mecca and sana but with the maritime enterprise of rome they well-being decline and the consequent distress in yeman induce its tribe to emigrate northwards to mecca to syrium and the central desert southern arabium never recover from the blow to its trade and in the sixth century yeman become merely a dependency of persium central arabium be a unknown country inhabit by maraud tribe in a constant state of political flux while hira the kingdom to the east of the desert on the bank of the euphrate have become a satrapy of persium early in the century in which mahomet live and heraclius by frequent inroad have reduce the kingdom of palmyra to impotence arabium be ripe for the rise of a strong political leader for it be flank by no powerful kingdom and within itself there be no organization and no reliable political influence the material be there but it need the shaping of a master-hand at the instigation of unflagging zeal if it be to be work into order and strength tireless energy and unceasing belief in he own power could alone accomplish the task and these mahomet possess in abundance before he death he have secure the subjection of yeman and hadramaut have penetrate far into the syrian borderland and have make he rule feel among the nomad tribe of the interior as far as the confines of persium with he rise to power the national feeling of arabium be bear and under he successor develop by the enticement of plunder and glory until it soar beyond mere nationality and dream of world-conquest by which presumption its ruin be work mahomet be the instigator of all this absorbing activity although he never calculate the extent of he political impulse in supersede the already effete tribal ideal he be to himself only spread the faith of he inspiration all governmental conception die slowly and the tribal life of arabium be far from extinguish at the end of he mission but its vitality be go and the focus of arabium 's obedience have shift from the clan to the prophet as military overlord it be pre-eminently in the domain of political action that mahomet 's personality be reveal the living fiber of he unique character pulse through all he dealings with he fellow-leader and opponent before all thing he possess the capacity of inspiring both love and fear alus abu bekr hamza omar zeid every one of he follower feel the force of he affection continually upon they and be bind to he by tie that neither misfortune nor any unworthy act of he could break and they devotion be call upon to suffer many test mahomet be self-willed and ruthless subordinate the means to the end without any misgiving in he remorseless dealings with the jew in he calm repudiation of obligation with the heathen as soon as he feel himself strong enough he show affinity to the most conscienceless statesman that ever grace european diplomacy he method of conquest and government combine watchfulness and strength no help be scorn by this builder of power what he could not achieve by force he attempt to gain by cunning he have a large faith in the power of argument back by force and he win over of abba and abu sofian chiefly by the aid of these two factor combine with they personal ambition be only the supreme instance of he master-stroke of policy he know how to play upon the baser passion of man and especially be he mindful of the lure of gold he first foray against the kureisch be set before the eye of he disciple as much in the light of plunder expedition as religious war against a infidel and oppressive nation he be at once the outcome of circumstance and independent of they he give coherence to all the unformulated desire for a fuller scope of military and mercantile power stir at the fount of arabium 's life and at the same time he found he dominion in a unique and absolutely personal manner within he sphere of governance he will be supreme and unassailable if these mutable tribal entity be to be unite at all despotism be the only possible form of command as he polity demand authority vest in one person only so he conception of god be that of a absolute monarch resistance to whom be annihilation out of this idea the doctrine of fatalism be evolve it be necessary during the first terrible year of uncertainty in islam in order to produce among mahomet 's follower a recklessness in battle and in the vary fortune of they life at medina bear of the knowledge that they fate be irrevocably decide they fight for the true god against the idolater this true god hold they destiny in he hand nothing could be alter the result be that the muslim fight with superhuman daring and face overwhelming force undaunted but the time come when islam have no longer any need to fight and the doctrine of fatalism still live it sink into mental and physical inactivity and of that inactivity induce by the knowledge that they energy be unavailing pessimism be breed despotism and fatality be perhaps the purely personal idea that mahomet give to he political state the latter encroach however as most of he secular principle upon the realm of philosophy indeed he political rule be inseparable from he religion and as a religious leader he be more justly appraise in the sphere of religion the raw material be to he hand at the inception of he mission mecca and central arabium though confirm in idolatry still mingle with they rite some distorted jewish tradition and ceremony while yeman have embrace the christian faith for a short time as a dependency of abyssinium but have relapse into idolatry with the interference of persium both the border kingdom to the north palmyra and hira be christian and in the time of they prosperity have influence arabium in the direction of christianity the christian scripture be know and respect but these impulse be feeble and spasmodic so that the bulk of arabium remain fix in its ancient idolatry by far the more enduring influence be that of judaism many jewish tribe be settle in arabium and the ancient tradition of the jewish race the great figure of abraham lot and noah be set vividly before the eye of the arab there be every indication that a religious teacher might use the exist element of judaism and christianity to produce a monotheistic faith partaking of they nature and for a time mahomet endeavor to bring both form within the scope of he mission but compromise whether with idolater or jew be find to be impossible and here religious and political ideal be inextricably blended if mahomet have acquiesce in the jewish religion have submit to the sovereignty of jerusalem as the holy place he would have find it impossible to have establish he supremacy in medina and the religion of islam as he conceive it would have be overriden by the older and more hallowed faith of the jew he see the danger and he dominant spirit could not allow the existence of a equal or superior power to he own with that fiery daring and supreme belief in he destiny which characterise he in later life he cast away all pretension to friendliness either with the jew or the christian and steer he follower triumphantly through the peril that beset every adherent to a idea but in compelling acceptance of he central thesis of the unity of the godhead he show signal wisdom and knowledge of man he be himself by no means impervious to the value of tradition and never conceive he faith as have no historical basis in the religious legend of he birthplace that the muslim belief possess institution such as the reverence for the kaaba the rite of pilgrimage the acceptance of mecca as its sacred city be due to its founder 's love of he native place and the ceremonial of which he own creed be really the inseparable outcome besides he recognition of the need of ritual he be fully aware of the repugnance of most man to the wholly new whenever possible he emphasize he connection with the ancient ceremony of mecca in they purer form and as soon as he power be sufficient he enforce the recognition of he claim upon the city itself he achievement as religious reformer rest largely upon the state of preparation in which he find he medium but it owe its efficiency to one force alone mahomet be possess of one central idea the indivisibility of god and it be sufficient to uphold he against all calamity the kuran sound the note of insistence which ring the clarion call of he message with eloquence of mind and soul with a repetition that be wearisome to the outsider he force that dominant truth into the heart of he hearer it can not escape they for he will not cease to remind they of they doom if they do not obey what he set out to do for the religious life of arabium he accomplish chiefly because he concentrate the whole of he demand into one formulum there be no god but god then when success have show he the measure of he ascendancy there be no god but god and mahomet be he prophet at the end of he life idolatry be uproot from he native country the tribe might rebel against the heaviness of he political yoke and be often hold to he by the slenderest of diplomatic thread but they monotheistic belief remain intact once islam have gain the ascendancy over they at the end of the farewell pilgrimage he realize with one grand uplifting of he soul in thanksgive that he have indeed catch up the errant attempt of arabium to remodel its unsatisfying faith and have make of they a triumphant reality in which the conception of allah 's unity be the essential belief besides he religious and political attainment he give to arabia as a whole its first write social and moral code here the estimate of he accomplishment be difficult to render bemuse comparison with the exist state be almost impossible extensively in the kuran but to a greater degree in the mass of he traditional saying crystallise into a standard edition by al-bokharus when due allowance have be make for the addition and exaggeration of he follower the chief characteristic be the casual nature of he law all he dictate as to the control of marriage the sale and tenure of land commerce plunder as well as health and dietary be the result of definite case come within he adjudication such a idea as the deliberate compilation of a code never occur to he and there be no evidence that he ever refer to he former decision in similar case so that possibility of contradiction and evasion be limitless out of this jumble of inconsistency muslim law and practice have grow he be enable to impose he command upon the conquer people by means of he military organization so that it be not long before arabium be rule in rough fashion by he social and moral precept enforce by the sword he wife offend he and he forthwith set down the duty and position of woman in he temporal state he desire the wife of he friend and the result be a kuranic decree sanction the taking of a woman under those condition he be jealous of he younger and more comely associate and thereupon ordain the perpetual seclusion of woman he be annoy at the untimely visit to he house of assembly and so he command that no believer shall enter another 's apartment uninvited it be inconvenient to relinquish the watch night or day during the period of siege in medina therefore he institute a system whereby half the army be to pray while the other half remain at its post instance may be multiply without cease of this building up of a whole social code upon the most casual foundation but unheed as be its genesis it be in the main effective for those time and in any case it substitute definite law for the measureless waste of tradition and custom it be probable that mahomet rely a great deal upon exist usage he be too wise to disturb they unnecessarily he be a nature of extreme combine with a wisdom that come as a revelation to he follower where he hate it be with a hurricane of wrath and destruction where he love it be with the same impetuous tenacity he denunciation of the infidel of he enemy among the kureisch of the laggard within he own city of the defamer of holy thing of drunkard of the unclean of those who even copy the feature of they kindred or picture they idea of god be write in the most violent word whose fury seem to smite upon the ear with the rush of flame and so the prevail stamp upon muslim institution be fanaticism and intolerance as the prophet draw up hard-and-fast rule so he follower insist upon they remorseless continuance mahomet find himself compel to issue ordinance often hurry and unreflect to meet immediate need to settle dispute whose prolongation would have mean he ruin he possess the quality of poet seer and religious mystic but these in he later life be overshadow by the characteristic of lawgiver soldier and statesman demand by he position as head of a body of man but neither he mysticism nor he poetic feeling entirely desert he they flash out at rare moment in the later sura of the kuran and be apparent in he action and the traditional account of he saying while he creed remain steadfast and unassailable with a strength that neither defeat nor disaffection could shake with all the incompleteness and often contradiction of he administration he nevertheless be able to satisfy he follower as to its efficacy mainly by he exhaustless belief in himself and he work in military development he contribution be unique he gather together all the war-loving propensity of the faithful and weave they into a solidarity of aim he personal courage be not great but he strategy and above all he invincible confidence which refuse to admit defeat be beyond question every leader he send upon plunder or admonitory expedition bear witness to he efficiency and he zeal he subject the muslim to a discipline that bring out they best quality of tenacity and daring he would not allow he soldiery to become individual plunderer but insist that the booty should be equally divide in the beginning he possess few horseman but he rapidly produce a squadron of cavalry as soon as he become convinced of they usefulness he readiness to accept advice as to the defense of medina prove the salvation of the city under he the military prowess of islam have ample scope for he give he leader complete freedom of action the result be visible in the supreme fight quality of alus omar and hamza while the chance of achieve glory under he banner be the move motive of the conversion of khalid and abba he subdue internecine warfare and by a bold stroke unite the warrior instinct of arabium against external foe lay upon they the sanction of religion and the promise of eternal happiness though unskilled in the mechanism of knowledge -- he could neither read nor write -- he have leave he mark upon the literature of he age and the year succeed he the kuran be the sum of he inspiration the expression in poetic and visionary language of he belief and ideal he find the medium prepare the arab have long previously evolve a poetry of they own which live not in write word but in they traditional song mahomet 's first flush of inspiration which wane before the heaviness of he later task be the cumulation of that wild and fervid art with the breath of the desert urgent within it the kuran be never write down during he lifetime but be collect into a jumble of fragment gather together from date-leaf and tablet of white stone and from the breast of man by zeid in the first troublous year of the caliphate we have inevitably lose much of its original fire and its effect be weaken by any translation into the unsuitable medium of modern speech but that it be a valuable contribution to the literature of its country can not be doubt especially in the earlier portion before mahomet 's love of harangue and the necessity of some vehicle by which to make he political dictate know have transform its style into the bald reiterative medley of its later page through it all run the fire of he genius in the later sura it be the reflection of he energy that look out from the page the flame itself have now light he action and inspire he dream of conquest the kuran be the best revelation of mahomet himself that posterity possess imperfect as be the manner of its hand down to the modern world it show we both the beauty and strength of he personality and he cruelty evasion magnanimity and lust more than all the passionate zeal beat through it make clear the secret of he sustained endeavor through discouragement and defeat until he triumph dawn to those outside the sphere of he magnetism mahomet seem urge on by a power beyond himself and scarcely within he control he gift bear intimate relation to the particular phase in the task of create a religion and a political entity that be uppermost at the moment in mecca he be poet and visionary the man who speak with angel and have see gabriel and israfil whose heart-string be a lute and who have the sweetest voice of all god 's creature he penetrate in fancy to the innermost holy place and behold the god of battle even feel he touch icy-cold upon he shoulder and return with the glow of that immortal intercourse upon he it sustain he in defeat and danger and by the power of it he convert a few in medina and flee thither to complete he task in medina he become a watchful leader and still inspire by heavenly visitant he produce order out of chaos and guard he power from numberless assault in attempt to explain he achievement when allowance be make for all those factor which give he help we be compel to do homage to the strength of he personality neither in he revelation through the kuran nor in the tradition of he be he secret to be find he live outside himself and he action be the standard of he accomplishment he find arabia the prey of war tribe without leader without law without religion save a idolatry obstinate but creatively dead and he take the exist element work into they he own conviction quicken they with the fire of he zeal and create a embryo with effective law fitting social and religious institution but greater than all these with the enthusiasm for a idea that lead he follower to prayer and conquest the kuran tradition the later history all minister to that personality which inform the muslim so that they sweep through the land like flame impel not only by religious zeal but also by the memory of they leader 's struggle and victory and of he journey before they on the perilous path of warfare to the paradise promise to the faithful end of the project gutenberg ebook of mahomet by glady m draycott
