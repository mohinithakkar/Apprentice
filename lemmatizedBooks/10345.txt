produce by david g johnson domestic manners of the american by fanny trollope france milton trollope -lrb- know as fanny trollope -rrb- 1780 -- 1863 -lrb- mother of the author anthony trollope -rrb- first publish in 1832 chapter 1 entrance of the mississippus -- balize on the 4th of November 1827 i sail from london accompany by my son and two daughter and after a favourable though somewhat tedious voyage arrive on christmas-day at the mouth of the mississippus the first indication of we approach to land be the appearance of this mighty river pour forth its muddy mass of water and mingle with the deep blue of the mexican gulf the shore of this river be so utterly flat that no object upon they be perceptible at sea and we gaze with pleasure on the muddy ocean that meet we for it tell we we be arrive and seven week of sailing have weary we yet it be not without a feeling like regret that we pass from the bright blue wave whose vary aspect have so long furnished we chief amusement into the murky stream which now receive we large flight of pelican be see standing upon the long mass of mud which rise above the surface of the water and a pilot come to guide we over the bar long before any other indication of land be visible i never behold a scene so utterly desolate as this entrance of the mississippus have dante see it he might have draw image of another bolgium from its horror one only object rear itself above the eddy water this be the mast of a vessel long since wreck in attempt to cross the bar and it still stand a dismal witness of the destruction that have be and a bode prophet of that which be to come by degree bulrush of enormous growth become visible and a few more mile of mud bring we within sight of a cluster of hut call the balize by far the most miserable station that i ever see make the dwelling of man but i be tell that many family of pilot and fisherman live there for several mile above its mouth the mississippus present no object more interesting than mud bank monstrous bulrush and now and then a huge crocodile luxuriate in the slime another circumstance that give to this dreary scene a aspect of desolation be the incessant appearance of vast quantity of drift wood which be ever find its way to the different mouth of the mississippus tree of enormous length sometimes still bear they branch and still oftener they uptorn root entire the victim of the frequent hurricane come float down the stream sometimes several of these entangled together collect among they bough a quantity of float rubbish that give the mass the appearance of a move island bear a forest with its root mock the heaven while the dishonoured branch lash the tide in idle vengeance : this as it approach the vessel and glide swiftly past look like the fragment of a world in ruin as we advance however we be cheer notwithstanding the season by the bright tint of southern vegetation the bank continue invariably flat but a succession of planless villa sometimes merely a residence and sometimes surround by they sugar grounds and negro hut vary the scene at no one point be there a inch of what painter call a second distance and for the length of one hundred and twenty mile from the balize to new orlean and one hundred mile above the town the land be defend from the encroachment of the river by a high embankment which be call the levee without which the dwelling would speedily disappear as the river be evidently higher than the bank would be without it when we arrive there have be constant rain and of long continuance and this appearance be therefore unusually striking give to this great natural feature the most unnatural appearance imaginable and make evident not only that man have be busy there but that even the mightiest work of nature might be make to bear he impress it recall literally swift 's mock heroic nature must give way to art yet she be look so mighty and so unsubdued all the time that i could not help fancy she would some day take the matter into she own hand again and if so farewell to new orlean it be easy to imagine the total want of beauty in such a landscape but yet the form and hue of the tree and plant so new to we add to the long privation we have endure of all sight and sound of land make even these swampy shore seem beautiful we be however impatient to touch as well as see the land but the navigation from the balize to new orlean be difficult and tedious and the two day that it occupy appear longer than any we have pass on board in truth to those who have pleasure in contemplate the phenomenon of nature a sea voyage may endure many week without weary perhaps some may think that the first glance of ocean and of sky shew all they have to offer nay even that that first glance may suggest more of dreariness than sublimity but to I they variety appear endless and they beauty unfail the attempt to describe scenery even where the object be prominent and tangible be very rarely successful but where the effect be so subtile and so vary it must be vain the impression nevertheless be perhaps deeper than any other i think it possible i may forget the sensation with which i watch the long course of the gigantic mississippus the ohio and the potomac may mingle and be confound with other stream in my memory i may even recall with difficulty the blue outline of the alleghany mountain but never while i remember any thing can i forget the first and last hour of light on the atlantic the ocean however and all its indescribable charm no longer surround we we begin to feel that we walk on the quarter-deck be very like the exercise of a ass in a mill that we book have lose half they page and that the other half be know by rote that we beef be very salt and we biscuit very hard in short that have study the good ship edward from stem to stern till we know the name of every sail and the use of every pulley we have have enough of she and as we lay down head to head in we tiny bed for the last time i exclaimed with no small pleasure tomorrow to fresh field and pasture new chapter 2 new orlean -- society -- creole and quadroon voyage up the mississippus on first touch the soil of a new land of a new continent of a new world it be impossible not to feel considerable excitement and deep interest in almost every object that meet we new orlean present very little that can gratify the eye of taste but nevertheless there be much of novelty and interest for a newly arrive european the large proportion of black see in the street all labor be perform by they the grace and beauty of the elegant quadroon the occasional group of wild and savage look indian the unwonted aspect of the vegetation the huge and turbid river with its low and slimy shore all help to afford that species of amusement which proceed from look at what we never see before the town have much the appearance of a french ville de province and be in fact a old french colony take from spain by france the name of the street be french and the language about equally french and english the market be handsome and well supply all produce be convey by the river we be much please by the chant with which the negro boatman regulate and beguile they labor on the river it consist but of very few note but they be sweetly harmonious and the negro voice be almost always rich and powerful by far the most agreeable hour i pass at new orlean be those in which i explore with my child the forest near the town it be we first walk in the eternal forest of the western world and we feel rather sublime and poetical the tree generally speak be much too close to be either large or well grow and moreover they growth be often stunt by a parasitical plant for which i could learn no other name than spanish moss it hang gracefully from the bough convert the outline of all the tree it hang upon into that of weep willow the chief beauty of the forest in this region be from the luxuriant undergrowth of palmeto which be decidedly the loveliest color and most graceful plant i know the pawpaw too be a splendid shrub and in great abundance we here for the first time see the wild vine which we afterwards find grow so profusely in every part of america as naturally to suggest the idea that the native ought to add wine to the numerous production of they plenty-teeming soil the strong pendant festoon make safe and commodious swing which some of we party enjoy despite the sublime temperament above-mentioned notwithstanding it be mid-winter when we be at new orlean the heat be much more than agreeable and the attack of the mosquito incessant and most torment yet i suspect that for a short time we would rather have endure it than not have see orange green pea and red pepper grow in the open air at christmas in one of we ramble we venture to enter a garden whose bright orange hedge attract we attention here we see green pea fit for the table and a fine crop of red pepper ripen in the sun a young negress be employ on the step of the house that she be a slave make she a object of interest to we she be the first slave we have ever speak to and i believe we all feel that we could hardly address she with sufficient gentleness she little dream poor girl what deep sympathy she excite she answer we civilly and gaily and seem amuse at we fancy there be something unusual in red pepper pod she give we several of they and i feel fearful lest a hard mistress might blame she for it how very childish do ignorance make we and how very ignorant we be upon almost every subject where hearsay evidence be all we can get i leave england with feeling so strongly oppose to slavery that it be not without pain i witness its effect around I at the sight of every negro man woman and child that pass my fancy weave some little romance of misery as belong to each of they since i have know more on the subject and become better acquaint with they real situation in america i have often smile at recall what i then feel the first symptom of american equality that i perceive be my be introduce in form to a milliner it be not at a boarding-house under the indistinct outline of miss c -- nor in the street through the veil of a fashionable toilette but in the very penetralium of she temple stand behind she counter give law to ribbon and to wire and usher cap and bonnet into existence she be a english woman and i be tell that she possess great intellectual endowment and much information i really believe this be true she manner be easy and graceful with a good deal of french tournure and the gentleness with which she fine eye and sweet voice direct the movement of a young female slave be really touching : the way too in which she blended she french talk of mode with she customer and she english talk of metaphysics with she friend have a pretty air of indifference in it that give she a superiority with both i find with she the daughter of a judge eminent it be say both for legal and literary ability and i hear from many quarter after i have leave new orlean that the society of this lady be highly value by all person of talent yet be i traveller-like to stop here and set it down as a national peculiarity or republican custom that milliner take the lead in the best society i should greatly falsify fact i do not remember the same thing happen to I again and this be one instance among a thousand of the impression every circumstance make on enter a new country and of the propensity so irresistible to class all thing however accidental as national and peculiar on the other hand however it be certain that if similar anomaly be unfrequent in america they be nearly impossible elsewhere in the shop of miss c -- i be introduce to mr m ` clure a venerable personage of gentlemanlike appearance who in the course of five minute propound as many axiom as ignorance be the only devil man make he own existence and the like he be of the new harmony school or rather the new harmony school be of he he be a man of good fortune -lrb- a scotchman i believe -rrb- who after live a tolerably gay life have conceive high thought such as lycurgus loved who bid flog the little spartan and determine to benefit the species and immortalize himself by found a philosophical school at new harmony there be something in the hollow square legislation of mr owen that strike he as admirable and he seem as far as i can understand to have intend aid he view by a sort of incipient hollow square drilling teach the young idea of all he could catch to shoot into parallelogramic form and order this venerable philosopher like all of he school that i ever hear of loved better to originate lofty imagining of faultless system than to watch they application to practice with much liberality he purchase and convey to the wilderness a very noble collection of book and scientific instrument but not finding among man one whose view be liberal and enlarged as he own he select a woman to put into action the machine he have organize as he acquaintance with this lady have be of long standing and as it be say very intimate he feel sure that no violation of he rule would have place under she sway they would act together as one being : he be to perform the function of the soul and will everything she those of the body and perform everything the principal feature of the scheme be that -lrb- the first liberal outfit of the institution have be furnish by mr m ` clure -rrb- the expense of keep it up should be defray by the profit arise from the labor of the pupil male and female which be to be perform at state interval of each day in regular rotation with learn study and scientific research but unfortunately the soul of the system find the climate of indiana uncongenial to its peculiar formation and therefore take its flight to mexico leave the body to perform the operation of both in whatever manner it like best and the body be a french body find no difficulty in set actively to work without trouble the soul about it and soon become conscious that the more simple be a machine the more perfect be its operation she throw out all that related to the intellectual part of the business -lrb- which to do poor soul justice it have lay great stress upon -rrb- and stir herself as effectually as ever body do to draw wealth from the thew and sinew of the youth they have collect when last i hear of this philosophical establishment she and a nephew-son be say to be reap a golden harvest as many of the lad have be send from a distance by indigent parent for gratuitous education and possess no means of leave it we stay in new orlean be not long enough to permit we enter into society but i be tell that it contain two distinct set of people both celebrate in they way for they social meeting and elegant entertainment the first of these be compose of creole family who be chiefly planter and merchant with they wife and daughter these meet together eat together and be very grand and aristocratic each of they ball be a little almack 's and every portly dame of the set be as exclusive in she principle as the exclude but amiable quandroon and such of the gentleman of the former class as can by any means escape from the high place where pure creole blood swell the vein at the bare mention of any be taint in the remotest degree with the negro stain of all the prejudice i have ever witness this appear to I the most violent and the most inveterate quadroon girl the acknowledged daughter of wealthy american or creole father educate with all of style and accomplishment which money can procure at new orlean and with all the decorum that care and affection can give exquisitely beautiful graceful gentle and amiable these be not admit nay be not on any term admissable into the society of the creole family of louisiana they can not marry that be to say no ceremony can render a union with they legal or binding yet such be the powerful effect of they very peculiar grace beauty and sweetness of manner that unfortunately they perpetually become the object of choice and affection if the creole lady have privilege to exercise the awful power of repulsion the gentle quadroon have the sweet but dangerous vengeance of possess that of attraction the union form with this unfortunate race be say to be often lasting and happy as far as any union can be so to which a certain degree of disgrace be attach there be a french and a english theater in the town but we be too fresh from europe to care much for either or indeed for any other of the town delight of this city and we soon become eager to commence we voyage up the mississippus miss wright then less known -lrb- though the author of more than one clever volume -rrb- than she have since become be the companion of we voyage from europe and it be my purpose to have pass some month with she and she sister at the estate she have purchase in tennessee this lady since become so celebrated as the advocate of opinion that make million shudder and some half-score admire be at the time of my leave england with she dedicate to a pursuit widely different from she subsequent occupation instead of become a public orator in every town throughout america she be about as she say to seclude herself for life in the deepest forest of the western world that she fortune she time and she talent might be exclusively devote to aid the cause of the suffer african she first object be to shew that nature have make no difference between black and whites except in complexion and this she expect to prove by give a education perfectly equal to a class of black and white child could this fact be once fully establish she conceive that the negro cause would stand on firmer ground than it have yet do and the degraded rank which they have ever hold amongst civilized nation would be prove to be a gross injustice this question of the mental equality or inequality between we and the negro race be one of great interest and have certainly never yet be fairly try and i expect for my child and myself both pleasure and information from visit she establishment and watch the success of she experiment the innumerable steam boat which be the stage coach and fly waggon of this land of lake and river be totally unlike any i have see in europe and greatly superior to they the fabric which i think they most resemble in appearance be the float bath -lrb- les bains vigier -rrb- at paris the annexed drawing will give a correct idea of they form the room to which the double line of window belong be a very handsome apartment before each window a neat little cot be arrange in such a manner as to give its drapery the air of a window curtain this room be call the gentleman 's cabin and they exclusive right to it be somewhat uncourteously insist upon the breakfast dinner and supper be lay in this apartment and the lady passenger be permit to take they meal there on the first of January 1828 we embark on board the belvidere a large and handsome boat though not the largest or handsomest of the many which display themselves along the wharf but she be go to stop at memphis the point of the river nearest to miss wright 's residence and she be the first that depart after we have get through the customhouse and finish we sight-seeing we find the room destine for the use of the lady dismal enough as its only window be below the stem gallery but both this and the gentleman 's cabin be handsomely fit up and the former well carpeted but oh that carpet i will not i may not describe its condition indeed it require the pen of a swift to do it justice let no one who wish to receive agreeable impression of american manners commence they travels in a mississippus steam boat for myself it be with all sincerity i declare that i would infinitely prefer share the apartment of a party of well condition pig to the be confine to its cabin i hardly know any annoyance so deeply repugnant to english feeling as the incessant remorseless spitting of american i feel that i owe my reader a apology for the repeat use of this and several other odious word but i can not avoid they without suffer the fidelity of description to escape I it be possible that in this phrase american i may be too general the united state form a continent of almost distinct nation and i must now and always be understand to speak only of that portion of they which i have see in converse with american i have constantly find that if i allude to anything which they think i consider as uncouth they would assure I it be local and not national the accidental peculiarity of a very small part and by no mean a specimen of the whole that be because you know so little of america be a phrase i have listen to a thousand time and in nearly as many different place _ it may be so _ -- and have make this concession i protest against the charge of injustice in relate what i have see chapter 3 company on board the steam boat -- scenery of the mississippus -- crocodile -- arrival at memphi -- nashoba the weather be warm and bright and we find the guard of the boat as they call the gallery that run round the cabin a very agreeable station here we all sit as long as light last and sometimes wrap in we shawl we enjoy the clear bright beauty of american moonlight long after every passenger but ourselves have retire we have a full complement of passenger on board the deck as be usual be occupy by the kentucky flat-boat man return from new orlean after have dispose of the boat and cargo which they have convey thither with no other labor than that of steer she the current bring she down at the rate of four mile a hour we have about two hundred of these man on board but the part of the vessel occupy by they be so distinct from the cabin that we never see they except when we stop to take in wood and then they run or rather spring and vault over each other 's head to the shore whence they all assist in carry wood to supply the steam engine the performance of this duty be a stipulate part of the payment of they passage from the account give by a man servant we have on board who share they quarter they be a most disorderly set of person constantly gamble and wrangle very seldom sober and never suffer a night to pass without give practical proof of the respect in which they hold the doctrine of equality and community of property the clerk of the vessel be kind enough to take we man under he protection and assign he a berth in he own little nook but as this be not inaccessible he tell he by no means to detach he watch or money from he person during the night whatever they moral characteristic may be these kentuckian be a very noble-looking race of man they average height considerably exceed that of european and they countenance except when disfigure by red hair which be not unfrequent extremely handsome the gentleman in the cabin -lrb- we have no lady -rrb- would certainly neither from they language manners nor appearance have receive that designation in europe but we soon find they claim to it rest on more substantial ground for we hear they nearly all address by the title of general colonel and major on mention these military dignity to a english friend some time afterwards he tell I that he too have make the voyage with the same description of company but remark that there be not a single captain among they he make the observation to a fellow-passenger and ask how he account for it oh sir the captain be all on deck be the reply we honor however be not all military for we have a judge among we i know it be equally easy and invidious to ridicule the peculiarity of appearance and manner in people of a different nation from ourselves we may too at the same moment be undergo the same ordeal in they estimation and moreover i be by no means dispose to consider whatever be new to I as therefore objectionable but nevertheless it be impossible not to feel repugnance to many of the novelty that now surround I the total want of all the usual courtesy of the table the voracious rapidity with which the viand be seize and devour the strange uncouth phrase and pronunciation the loathsome spit from the contamination of which it be absolutely impossible to protect we dress the frightful manner of feed with they knife till the whole blade seem to enter into the mouth and the still more frightful manner of clean the tooth afterwards with a pocket knife soon force we to feel that we be not surround by the general colonel and major of the old world and that the dinner hour be to be any thing rather than a hour of enjoyment the little conversation that go forward while we remain in the room be entirely political and the respective claim of adam and jackson to the presidency be argue with more oath and more vehemence than it have ever be my lot to hear once a colonel appear on the verge of assault a major when a huge seven-foot kentuckian gentleman horse-dealer ask of the heaven to confound they both and bid they sit still and be d -- d we too think we should share this sentence at least sit still in the cabin seem very nearly to include the rest of it and we never tarry there a moment longer than be absolutely necessary to eat the unbroken flatness of the bank of the mississippus continue unvaried for many mile above new orlean but the graceful and luxuriant palmetto the dark and noble ilex and the bright orange be every where to be see and it be many day before we be weary of look at they we occasionally use the opportunity of the boat 's stop to take in wood for a ten minute ' visit to the shore we in this manner explore a field of sugar cane and loaded ourselves with as much of the sweet spoil as we could carry many of the passenger seem fond of the luscious juice that be easily express from the cane but it be too sweet for my palate we also visit in the same rapid manner a cotton plantation a handsome spacious building be point out to we as a convent where a considerable number of young lady be educate by the nun at one or two point the wearisome level line of forest be relieve by _ bluff _ as they call the short interval of high ground the town of natch be beautifully situate on one of these high spot the climate here in the warm season be as fatal as that of new orlean be it not for this natch would have great attraction to new settler the beautiful contrast that its bright green hill form with the dismal line of black forest that stretch on every side the abundant growth of pawpaw palmetto and orange the copious variety of sweet-scented flower that flourish there all make it appear like a oasis in the desert natch be the furthest point to the north at which orange ripen in the open air or endure the winter without shelter with the exception of this sweet spot i think all the little town and village we pass wretched look in the extreme as the distance from new orlean increase the air of wealth and comfort exhibit in its immediate neighborhood disappear and but for one or two cluster of wooden house call themselves town and borrow some pompous name generally from greece or rome we might have think ourselves the first of the human race who have ever penetrate into this territory of bear and alligator but still from time to time appear the hut of the wood-cutter who supply the steam-boat with fuel at the risk or rather with the assurance of early death in exchange for dollar and whiskey these sad dwelling be nearly all of they inundate during the winter and the best of they be construct on pile which permit the water to reach its highest level without drown the wretched inhabitant these unhappy being be invariably the victim of ague which they meet recklessly sustain by the incessant use of ardent spirit the squalid look of the miserable wife and child of these man be dreadful and often as the spectacle be renew i could never look at it with indifference they complexion be of a blueish white that suggest the idea of dropsy this be invariable and the poor little one wear exactly the same ghastly hue a miserable cow and a few pig stand knee-deep in water distinguish the more prosperous of these dwelling and on the whole i should say that i never witness human nature reduce so low as it appear in the wood-cutter ' hut on the unwholesome bank of the mississippus it be say that at some point of this dismal river crocodile be so abundant as to add the terror of they attack to the other suffering of a dwelling there we be tell a story of a squatter who have located himself close to the river 's edge proceed to build he cabin this operation be soon perform for social feeling and the love of whiskey bring all the scanty neighborhood round a new corner to aid he in cut down tree and in roll up the log till the mansion be complete this be do the wife and five young child be put in possession of they new home and sleep soundly after a long march towards daybreak the husband and father be awaken by a faint cry and look up beheld relic of three of he child scatter over the floor and a enormous crocodile with several young one around she occupy in devour the remnant of they horrid meal he look round for a weapon but find none and aware that unarmed he could do nothing he raise himself gently on he bed and contrived to crawl from thence through a window hope that he wife whom he leave sleep might with the remain child rest undiscovered till he return he fly to he nearest neighbor and besought he aid in less than half a hour two man return with he all three well armed but alas they be too late the wife and she two babe lay mangled on they bloody bed the gorge reptile fall a easy prey to they assailant who upon examine the place find the hut have be construct close to the mouth of a large hole almost a cavern where the monster have hatch she hateful brood among other sight of desolation which mark this region condemn of nature the lurid glare of a burning forest be almost constantly visible after sunset and when the wind so will the smoke arise from it float in heavy vapor over we head not all the novelty of the scene not all its vastness could prevent its heavy horror weary the spirit perhaps the dinner and supper i have describe may help to account for this but certain it be that when we have wonder for a week at the ceaseless continuity of forest have first admire and then weary of the festoon drapery of spanish moss when we have learn to distinguish the different mass of timber that pass we or that we pass as a snag a log or a sawyer when we have finally make up we mind that the gentleman of the kentucky and ohio military establishment be not of the same genus as those of the tuillery and st jame 's we begin to wish that we could sleep more hour away as we advance to the northward we be no longer cheer by the beautiful border of palmetto and even the amusement of occasionally spy out a sleep crocodile be over just in this state when we would have fain believe that every mile we go carry we two towards memphi a sudden and violent shock startle we frightfully it be a sawyer say one it be a snag cry another we be aground exclaim the captain aground good heaven and how long shall we stay here the lord in he providence can only tell but long enough to tire my patience i expect and the poor english lady how fare they the while two breakfast two dinner and a supper do they eat with the ohio and kentucky gentleman before they move a inch several steam-boat pass while we be thus enthral but some be not strong enough to attempt draw we off and some attempt it but be not strong enough to succeed at length a vast and mighty thing of life approach throw out grapple iron and in three minute the business be do again we see the tree and mud slide swiftly past we and a hearty shout from every passenger on deck declare they joy at length we have the pleasure of be tell that we have arrive at memphi but this pleasure be considerably abate by the hour of we arrival which be midnight and by the rain which be fall in torrent memphi stand on a high bluff and at the time of we arrival be nearly inaccessible the heavy rain which have be fall for many hour would have make any steep ascent difficult but unfortunately a new road have be recently mark out which beguile we into its almost bottomless mud from the firmer footing of the unbroken cliff shoe and glove be lose in the mire for we be glad to avail ourselves of all we limb and we reach the grand hotel in a most deplorable state miss wright be well know there and as soon as she arrival be announce every one seem on the alert to receive she and we soon find ourselves in possession of the best room in the hotel the house be new and in what appear to I a very comfortless condition but i be then new to western america and unaccustomed to they mode of get along as they term it this phrase be eternally in use among they and seem to mean exist with as few of the comfort of life as possible we sleep soundly however and rise in the hope of soon change we mortar-smelling-quarter for miss wright 's nashoba but we presently find that the rain which have fall during the night would make it hazardous to venture through the forest of tennessee in any sort of carriage we therefore have to pass the day at we queer comfortless hotel the steam-boat have weary I of social meal and i should have be thankful to have eat we dinner of hard venison and peach-sauce in a private room but this miss wright say be impossible the lady of the house would consider the proposal as a personal affront and moreover it would be assuredly refuse this latter argument carry weight with it and when the great bell be sound from a upper window of the house we proceed to the dining-room the table be lay for fifty person and be already nearly full we party have the honor of sit near the lady but to check the proud feeling to which such distinction might give birth my servant william sit very nearly opposite to I the company consist of all the shop-keeper -lrb- store-keeper as they be call throughout the united state -rrb- of the little town the mayor also who be a friend of miss wright 's be of the party he be a please gentlemanlike man and seem strangely misplace in a little town on the mississippus we be tell that since the erection of this hotel it have be the custom for all the male inhabitant of the town to dine and breakfast there they eat in perfect silence and with such astonishing rapidity that they dinner be over literally before we 's be begin the instant they cease to eat they dart from the table in the same moody silence which they have preserve since they enter the room and a second set take they place who perform they silent part in the same manner the only sound hear be those produce by the knife and fork with the unceasing chorus of cough & c no woman be present except ourselves and the hostess the good woman of memphi be well content to let they lord partake of mr anderson 's turkey and venison -lrb- without they have the trouble of cooking for they -rrb- whilst they regale themselves on mash and milk at home the remainder of the day pass pleasantly enough in rambling round the little town which be situate at the most beautiful point of the mississippus the river be here so wide as to give it the appearance of a noble lake a island cover with lofty forest tree divide it and relieve by its broad mass of shadow the uniformity of its water the town stretch in a rambling irregular manner along the cliff from the wolf river one of the innumerable tributary to the mississippus to about a mile below it half a mile more of the cliff beyond the town be clear of tree and produce good pasture for horse cow and pig sheep they have none at either end of this space the forest again rear its dark wall and seem to say to man so far shalt thou come and no farther courage and industry however have brave the warning behind this long street the town straggle back into the forest and the rude path that lead to the more distant log dwelling become wilder at every step the ground be break by frequent water-course and the bridge that lead across they be form by trunk of tree throw over the stream which support other of smaller growth that be lay across they these bridge be not very pleasant to pass for they totter under the tread of a man and tremble most frightfully beneath a horse or a waggon they be however very picturesque the great height of the tree the quantity of pendant vine branch that hang amongst they and the variety of gay plumaged bird particularly the small green parrot make we feel we be in a new world and a repetition of we walk the next morning would have pleased we well but miss wright be anxious to get home and we be scarcely less so to see she nashoba a clumsy sort of caravan draw by two horse be prepare for we and we set off in high spirit for a expedition of fifteen mile through the forest to avoid pass one of the bridge above describe which be think insecure we negro driver take we through a piece of water which he assure we be not deep to matter however we soon lose sight of we pole and as we be evidently descend we gently remonstrate with he on the danger of proceeding but he only grin and flog in reply we soon see the front wheel disappear and horse begin to plunge and kick most alarmingly but still without he look at all disturb at length the splinter-bar give way upon which the black philosopher say very composedly i expect you 'll best be ride out upon the horse as we have get into a unhandsome fix here miss wright who sit composedly smile at the scene say yes jacob that be what we must do and with some difficulty we in this manner reach the shore and soon find ourselves again assemble round mr anderson 's fire it be soon settle that we must delay we departure till the water have subside but miss wright be too anxious to reach home to endure this delay and she set off again on horseback accompany by we man servant who tell I afterwards that they ride through place that might have daunt the boldest hunter but that miss wright take it quite easy the next day we start again and the clear air the bright sun the novel wildness of the dark forest and we keenly awaken curiosity make the excursion delightful and enable we to bear without shrink the bump and bruise we encounter we soon lose all trace of a road at least so it appear to we for the stump of the tree which have be cut away to open a passage be leave stand three foot high over these the high-hung deerborn as we carriage be call pass safely but it require some mile of experience to convince we that every stump would not be we last it be amusing to watch the cool and easy skill with which the driver wind he horse and wheel among these stump i think he might have be import to bond street with great advantage the forest become thicker and more dreary-looking every mile we advance but we ever-grinning negro declare it be a right good road and that we should be sure to get to nashoba and so we didand one glance suffice to convince I that every idea i have form of the place be as far as possible from the truth desolation be the only feeling -- the only word that present itself but it be not speak i think however that miss wright be aware of the painful impression the sight of she forest home produce on I and i doubt not that the conviction reach we both at the same moment that we have err in think that a few month pass together at this spot could be productive of pleasure to either but to do she justice i believe she mind be so exclusively occupy by the object she have then in view that all thing else be worthless or indifferent to she i never hear or read of any enthusiasm approach she 's except in some few instance in age past of religious fanaticism it must have be some feeling equally powerful which enable miss wright accustom to all the comfort and refinement of europe to imagine not only that she herself could exist in this wilderness but that she european friend could enter there and not feel dismayed at the savage aspect of the scene the annexed plate give a faithful view of the clear space and building which form the settlement each building consist of two large room furnish in the most simple manner nor have they as yet collect round they any of those minor comfort which ordinary mind class among the necessaries of life but in this we philosophical friend seem to see no evil nor be there any mixture of affectation in this indifference it be a circumstance really and truly beneath she notice she whole heart and soul be occupy by the hope of raise the african to the level of european intellect and even now that i have see this favorite fabric of she imagination fall to piece beneath she foot i can not recall the self-devotion with which she give herself to it without admiration the only white person we find at nashoba be my amiable friend mr w -- the sister of miss wright and she husband i think they have between thirty and forty slave include child but when i be there no school have be establish book and other material for the great experiment have be collect and one or two professor engage but nothing be yet organize i find my friend mr w -- in very bad health which she confess she attribute to the climate this naturally so much alarmed I for my child that i decide upon leave the place with as little delay as possible and do so at the end of ten day i do not exactly know what be the immediate cause which induce miss wright to abandon a scheme which have take such possession of she imagination and on which she have expend so much money but many month have not elapse before i learn with much pleasure that she and she sister have also leave it i think it probable that she become aware upon return to nashoba that the climate be too hostile to they health all i know farther of nashoba be that miss wright have find -lrb- from some cause or other -rrb- that it be impossible to pursue she object herself accompany she slave to haytus and leave they there free and under the protection of the president i find no beauty in the scenery round nashoba nor can i conceive that it would possess any even in summer the tree be so close to each other as not to permit the growth of underwood the great ornament of the forest at new orlean and still less of we see any opening where the vary effect of light and shade might atone for the absence of other object the clearing round the settlement appear to I inconsiderable and imperfect but i be tell that they have grow good crop of cotton and indian corn the weather be dry and agreeable and the aspect of the heaven by night surprisingly beautiful i never see moonlight so clear so pure so powerful we return to memphi on the 26th January 1828 and find ourselves oblige to pass five day there await a steam-boat for cincinnatus to which metropolis of the west i be now determine to proceed with my family to await the arrival of mr trollope we be tell by everyone we speak to at memphi that it be in all respects the finest situation west of the alleghany we find many lovely walk among the broken forest glade around memphi which together with a morning and evening enjoyment of the effect of a glowing horizon on the river enable we to wait patiently for the boat that be to bear we away chapter 4 departure from memphi -- ohio river louisville -- cincinnatus on the 1st of February 1828 we embark on board the criterion and once more begin to float on the father of water as the poor banish indian be wont to call the mississippus the company on board be wonderfully like what we have meet in come from new orlean i think they must have all be first cousin and what be singular they too have all arrive at high rank in the army for many a wearisome mile above the wolf river the only scenery be still forest -- forest -- forest the only variety be produce by the receding of the river at some point and its encroach on the opposite shore these change be continually go on but from what cause none could satisfactorily explain to I where the river be encroach the tree be see grow in the water many foot deep after some time the water undermine they root and they become the easy victim of the first hurricane that blow this be one source of the immense quantity of drift wood that float into the gulf of mexico where the river have recede a young growth of cane-brake be soon see start up with the rapid vegetation of the climate these two circumstance in some degree relieve the sameness of the thousand mile of vegetable wall but we be now approach the river which be emphatically call the beautiful la belle riveriere of the new orlean french and a few day take we i trust for ever out of that murky stream which be as emphatically call the deadly and well do it seem to merit the title the air of its shore be mephitic and it be say that nothing that ever sink beneath its muddy surface be know to rise again as truly do la belle riviere deserve its name the ohio be bright and clear its bank be continually vary as it flow through what be call a rolling country which seem to mean a district that can not shew a dozen pace of level ground at a time the primaeval forest still occupy a considerable portion of the ground and hang in solemn grandeur from the cliff but it be break by frequent settlement where we be cheer by the sight of herd and flock i imagine that this river present almost every variety of river scenery sometimes its clear wave water a meadow of level turf sometimes it be bound by perpendicular rock pretty dwelling with they gay portico be see alternately with wild interval of forest where the tangled bear-brake plainly enough indicate what inhabitant be native there often a mountain torrent come pour its silver tribute to the stream and be there occasionally a ruin abbey or feudal castle to mix the romance of real life with that of nature the ohio would be perfect so powerful be the effect of this sweet scenery that we cease to grumble at we dinner and supper nay we almost learn to rival we neighbor at table in they voracious rapidity of swallow so eager be we to place ourselves again on the guard lest we might lose sight of the beauty that be pass away from we yet these fair shore be still unhealthy more than once we land and converse with the family of the wood-cutter and scarcely be there one in which we do not hear of some member who have lately die of the fever -- they be all subject to ague and though they dwelling be infinitely better than those on the mississippus the inhabitant still look like a race that be sell they life for gold louisville be a considerable town prettily situate on the kentucky or south side of the ohio we spend some hour in see all it have to shew and have i not be tell that a bad fever often rage there during the warm season i should have like to pass some month there for the purpose of explore the beautiful country in its vicinity frankfort and lexington be both town worth visit though from they be out of the way place i never get to either the first be the seat of the state government of kentucky and the last be i be tell the residence of several independent family who with more leisure than be usually enjoy in america have its natural accompaniment more refinement the fall of the ohio be about a mile below louisville and produce a rapid too sudden for the boat to pass except in the rainy season the passenger be oblige to get out below they and travel by land to louisville where they find other vessel ready to receive they for the remainder of the voyage we be spare this inconvenience by the water be too high for the rapid to be much feel and it will soon be altogether remove by the louisville canal come into operation which will permit the steam-boat to continue they progress from below the fall to the town the scenery on the kentucky side be much finer than on that of indiana or ohio the state of kentucky be the darling spot of many tribe of indian and be reserve among they as a common hunting ground it be say that they can not yet name it without emotion and that they have a sad and wild lament that they still chaunt to its memory but they exclusion thence be of no recent date kentucky have be longer settle than the illinoi indiana or ohio and it appear not only more highly cultivate but more fertile and more picturesque than either i have rarely see richer pasture than those of kentucky the forest tree where not too crowd be of magnificent growth and the crop be gloriously abundant where the thriftless husbandry have not wear out the soil by a unvarying succession of exhausting crop we be shewn ground which have bear abundant crop of wheat for twenty successive year but a much shorter period suffice to exhaust the ground if it be make to produce tobacco without the intermission of some other crop we reach cincinnatus on the 10th of February it be finely situate on the south side of a hill that rise gently from the water 's edge yet it be by no mean a city of striking appearance it want dome tower and steeple but its landing-place be noble extend for more than a quarter of a mile it be well paved and surround by neat though not handsome building i have see fifteen steam-boat lie there at once and still half the wharf be unoccupied on arrive we repair to the washington hotel and think ourselves fortunate when we be tell that we be just in time for dinner at the table d'hote but when the dining-room door be open we retreat with a feeling of dismay at see between sixty and seventy man already at table we take we dinner with the female of the family and then go forth to seek a house for we permanent accommodation we go to the office of a advertising agent who profess to keep a register of all such information and describe the dwelling we want he make no difficulty but tell we he boy should be we guide through the city and shew we what we seek we accordingly set out with he and he lead we up one street and down another but evidently without any determinate object i therefore stop and ask he whereabout the house be which we be go to see i be look for bill be he reply i think we could have look for bill as well without he and i tell he so upon which he assume a air of great activity and begin knock regularly at every door we pass enquire if the house be to be let it be impossible to endure this long and we guide be dismiss though i be afterwards oblige to pay he a dollar for he service we have the good fortune however to find a dwelling before long and we return to we hotel have determine upon take possession of it as soon at it could be get ready not wish to take we evening meal either with the three score and ten gentleman of the dining-room nor yet with the half dozen lady of the bar-room i order tea in my own chamber a good-humoured irish woman come forward with a sort of patronising manner take my hand and say och my honey ye 'll be from the old country i 'll see you will have you tay all to yourselve honey with this assurance we retire to my room which be a handsome one as to its size and bed furniture but it have no carpet and be darken by blind of paper such as room be hang with which require to be roll up and then fasten with string very awkwardly attach to the window-frame whenever light or air be wish for i afterwards meet with these same uncomfortable blind in every part of america we irish friend soon reappear and bring we tea together with the never fail accompaniment of american tea drinking hang beef chip up raw and sundry sweetmeat of brown sugar hue and flavor we take we tea and be enjoy we family talk relative to we future arrangement when a loud sharp knock be hear at we door my come in be answer by the appearance of a portly personage who proclaim himself we landlord be any of you ill he begin no thank you sir we be all quite well be my reply then madam i must tell you that i can not accommodate you on these term we have no family tea-drinking here and you must live either with I or my wife or not at all in my house this be say with a air of authority that almost preclude reply but i venture a sort of apologistic hint that we be stranger and unaccustomed to the manners of the country we manners be very good manners and we do not wish any change from england i thought of mine host of the washington afterwards when read scott 's anne of geierstein he in truth strongly resemble the inn keeper therein immortalize who make he guest eat drink and sleep just where when and how he please i make no farther remonstrance but determine to hasten my removal this we achieve the next day to we great satisfaction we be soon settle in we new dwelling which look neat and comfortable enough but we speedily find that it be devoid of nearly all the accommodation that european conceive necessary to decency and comfort no pump no cistern no drain of any kind no dustman 's cart or any other visible means of get rid of the rubbish which vanish with such celerity in london that one have no time to think of its existence but which accumulate so rapidly at cincinnatus that i send for my landlord to know in what manner refuse of all kind be to be dispose of you help will just have to fix they all into the middle of the street but you must mind old woman that it be the middle i expect you do not know as we have get a law what forbid throw such thing at the side of the street they must just all be cast right into the middle and the pig soon take they off in truth the pig be constantly see do herculean service in this way through every quarter of the city and though it be not very agreeable to live surround by herd of these unsavoury animal it be well they be so numerous and so active in they capacity of scavenger for without they the street would soon be choke up with all sort of substance in every stage of decomposition we have hear so much of cincinnatus its beauty wealth and unequalled prosperity that when we leave memphi to go thither we almost feel the delight of rousseau 's novice un voyage  faire et paris au bout -- as soon therefore as we little domestic arrangement be complete we set forth to view this wonder of the west this prophet 's gourd of magic growth -- this infant hercule and surely no traveller ever parade a city under circumstance more favourable to they find it fair to the sight three dreary month have elapse since we have leave the glory of london behind we for nearly the whole of that time we behold no other architecture than what we ship and steam-boat have furnish and except at new orlean have see hardly a trace of human habitation the sight of brick and mortar be really refreshing and a house of three story look splendid of this splendor we see repeat specimen and moreover a brick church which from its two little peaked spire be call the two-horned church but alas the flatness of reality after the imagination have be busy i hardly know what i expect to find in this city fresh rise from the bosom of the wilderness but certainly it be not a little town about the size of salisbury without even a attempt at beauty in any of its edifice and with only just enough of the air of a city to make it noisy and bustling the population be greater than the appearance of the town would lead one to expect this be partly owe to the number of free negro who herd together in a obscure part of the city call little africa and partly to the density of the population round the paper-mill and other manufactory i believe the number of inhabitant exceed twenty thousand we arrive in cincinnatus in February 1828 and i speak of the town as it be then several small church have be build since whose tower agreeably relieve its uninteresting mass of building at that time i think main street which be the principal avenue -lrb- and run through the whole town answering to the high street of we old city -rrb- be the only one entirely pave the _ troittoir _ be of brick tolerably well lay but it be inundate by every shower as cincinnatus have no drain whatever what make this omission the more remarkable be that the situation of the place be calculate both to facilitate they construction and render they necessary cincinnatus be build on the side of a hill that begin to rise at the river 's edge and be it furnish with drain of the simplest arrangement the heavy shower of the climate would keep they constantly clean as it be these shower wash the higher street only to deposit they filth in the first level spot and this happen to be in the street second in importance to main street run at right angle to it and contain most of the large warehouse of the town this deposit be a dreadful nuisance and must be productive of miasma during the hot weather the town be build as i believe most american town be in square as they call they but these square be the reverse of we 's be solid instead of hollow each consist or be intend to consist when the plan of the city be complete of a block of building front north east west and south each house communicate with a alley furnish a back entrance this plan would not be a bad one be the town properly drain but as it be these alley be horrible abomination and must i conceive become worse with every passing year to the north cincinnatus be bound by a range of forest-covered hill sufficiently steep and rugged to prevent they be build upon or easily cultivate but not sufficiently high to command from they summit a view of any considerable extent deep and narrow water-course dry in summer but bring down heavy stream in winter divide these hill into many separate height and this furnish the only variety the landscape offer for many mile round the town the lovely ohio be a beautiful feature wherever it be visible but the only part of the city that have the advantage of its beauty be the street nearest to its bank the hill of kentucky which rise at about the same distance from the river on the opposite side form the southern boundary to the basin in which cincinnatus be build on first arrive i think the many tree cover hill around very beautiful but long before my departure i feel so weary of the confine view that salisbury plain would have be a agreeable variety i doubt if any inhabitant of cincinnatus ever mount these hill so often as myself and my child but it be rather for the enjoyment of a freer air than for any beauty of prospect that we take we daily climb these hill afford neither shrub nor flower but furnish the finest specimen of millepore in the world and the water course be full of fossil production the forest tree be neither large nor well grow and so close as to be nearly knot together at top even the wild vine here lose its beauty for its graceful festoon bear leave only when they reach the higher branch of the tree that support they both air and light be too scantily find below to admit of they do more than climb with a bare stem till they reach a better atmosphere the herb we call pennyroyal be the only one i find in abundance and that only on the brow where the ground have be partially clear vegetation be impossible elsewhere and it be this circumstance which make the eternal forest of america so detestable near new orlean the undergrowth of palmetto and pawpaw be highly beautiful but in tennessee indiana and ohio i never find the slightest beauty in the forest scenery fall tree in every possible stage of decay and congery of leaf that have be rot since the flood cover the ground and infect the air the beautiful variety of foliage afford by evergreen never occur and in tennessee and that part of ohio that surround cincinnatus even the sterile beauty of rock be want on cross the water to kentucky the scene be greatly improve beech and chestnut of magnificent growth border the beautiful river the ground have be well clear and the herbage be excellent the pawpaw grow abundantly and be a splendid shrub though it bear neither fruit nor flower so far north the noble tulip tree flourish here and bloom profusely the river lick flow into the ohio nearly opposite cincinnatus it be a pretty wind stream and two or three mile from its mouth have a brisk rapid dancing among white stone which in the absence of better rock we find very picturesque chapter 5 cincinnatus -- forest farm -- mr bullock though i do not quite sympathise with those who consider cincinnatus as one of the wonder of the earth i certainly think it a city of extraordinary size and importance when it be remember that thirty year ago the aboriginal forest occupy the ground where it stand and every month appear to extend its limit and its wealth some of the native political economist assert that this rapid conversion of a bear-brake into a prosperous city be the result of free political institution not be very deep in such matter a more obvious cause suggest itself to I in the unceasing goad which necessity apply to industry in this country and in the absence of all resource for the idle during nearly two year that i reside in cincinnatus or its neighborhood i neither see a beggar nor a man of sufficient fortune to permit he cease he effort to increase it thus every bee in the hive be actively employ in search of that honey of hyblum vulgarly call money neither art science learn nor pleasure can seduce they from its pursuit this unity of purpose back by the spirit of enterprise and join with a acuteness and total absence of probity where interest be concern which might set canny yorkshire at defiance may well go far towards obtain its purpose the low rate of taxation too unquestionably permit a more rapid accumulation of individual wealth than with we but till i have travel through america i have no idea how much of the money collect in tax return among the people not only in the purchase of what they industry furnish but in the actual enjoyment of what be furnish be i a english legislator instead of send sedition to the tower i would send she to make a tour of the united state i have a little lean towards sedition myself when i set out but before i have half complete my tour i be quite cure i have read much of the few and simple want of rational man and i use to give a sort of dreamy acquiescence to the reasoning that go to prove each add want a add woe those who reason in a comfortable london drawing-room know little about the matter be the aliment which sustain life all that we want the faculty of the hog might suffice we but if we analyze a hour of enjoyment we shall find that it be make up of agreeable sensation occasion by a thousand delicate impression on almost as many nerve where these nerve be sluggish from never have be awaken external object be less important for they be less perceive but where the whole machine of the human frame be in full activity where every sense bring home to consciousness its touch of pleasure or of pain then every object that meet the sens be important as a vehicle of happiness or misery but let no frame so temper visit the united state or if they do let it be with no longer pause than will store the memory with image which by the force of contrast shall sweeten the future guarda e passa -lrb- e pous -rrb- ragiam di lor the simple manner of living in western america be more distasteful to I from its levelling effect on the manners of the people than from the personal privation that it render necessary and yet till i be without they i be in no degree aware of the many pleasurable sensation derive from the little elegancy and refinement enjoy by the middle class in europe there be many circumstance too trifling even for my gossip page which press themselves daily and hourly upon we and which force we to remember painfully that we be not at home it require a abler pen than mine to trace the connection which i be persuade exist between these deficiency and the mind and manners of the people all animal want be supply profusely at cincinnatus and at a very easy rate but alas these go but a little way in the history of a day 's enjoyment the total and universal want of manners both in male and female be so remarkable that i be constantly endeavor to account for it it certainly do not proceed from want of intellect i have listen to much dull and heavy conversation in america but rarely to any that i could strictly call silly -lrb- if i except the every where privileged class of very young lady -rrb- they appear to I to have clear head and active intellect be more ignorant on subject that be only of conventional value than on such as be of intrinsic importance but there be no charm no grace in they conversation i very seldom during my whole stay in the country hear a sentence elegantly turn and correctly pronounce from the lip of a american there be always something either in the expression or the accent that jar the feeling and shock the taste i will not pretend to decide whether man be better or worse off for require refinement in the manners and custom of the society that surround he and for be incapable of enjoyment without they but in america that polish which remove the coarser and rougher part of we nature be unknown and undreamed of there be much substantial comfort and some display in the larger city in many of the more obvious feature they be as pari or as london be all large assembly of active and intelligent human being -- but yet they be wonderfully unlike in nearly all they moral feature now god forbid that any reasonable american -lrb- of whom there be so many million -rrb- should ever come to ask I what i mean i should find it very difficult nay perhaps utterly impossible to explain myself but on the other hand no european who have visit the union will find the least difficulty in understand I i be in no way competent to judge of the political institution of america and if i should occasionally make a observation on they effect as they meet my superficial glance they will be make in the spirit and with the feeling of a woman who be apt to tell what she first impression may be but unapt to reason back from effect to they cause such observation if they be unworthy of much attention be also obnoxious to little reproof : but there be point of national peculiarity of which woman may judge as ably as man -- all that constitute the external of society may be fairly trust to we captain hall when ask what appear to he to constitute the greatest difference between england and america reply like a gallant sailor the want of loyalty be the same question put to I i should answer the want of refinement be american indeed dispose to assume the plain unpretend deportment of the switzer in the day of he picturesque simplicity -lrb- when however he never chew tobacco -rrb- it would be in bad taste to censure he but this be not the case jonathan will be a fine gentleman but it must be in he own way be he not a free-born american jonathan however must remember that if he will challenge competition with the old world the old world will now and then look out to see how he support he pretension with they hour of business whether judicial or mercantile civil or military i have nothing to do i doubt not they be all spend wisely and profitably but what be they hour of recreation those hour that with we be pass in the enjoyment of all that art can win from nature when if the elaborate repast be more deeply relish than sage might approve it be redeem from sensuality by the presence of elegance and beauty what be the american pendant to this i will not draw any comparison between a good dinner party in the two country i have hear american gentleman say that they could perceive no difference between they but in speaking of general manners i may observe that it be rarely they dine in society except in tavern and board house then they eat with the greatest possible rapidity and in total silence i have hear it say by american lady that the hour of greatest enjoyment to the gentleman be those in which a glass of gin cocktail or egg receive its highest relish from the absence of all restraint whatever and when there be no lady to trouble they notwithstanding all this the country be a very fine country well worth visit for a thousand reason nine hundred and ninety-nine of these be reason found on admiration and respect the thousandth be that we shall feel the more contented with we own the more unlike a country through which we travel be to all we have leave the more we be likely to be amuse every thing in cincinnatus have this newness and i should have think it a place delightful to visit but to tarry there be not to feel at home my home however for a time it be to be we hear on every side that of all the known place on the globe call earth cincinnatus be the most favourable for a young man to settle in and i only await the arrival of mr t to fix we son there intend to continue with he till he should feel himself sufficiently establish we accordingly determine upon make ourselves as comfortable as possible i take a larger house which however i do not obtain without considerable difficulty as notwithstanding fourteen hundred new dwelling have be erect the preceding year the demand for house greatly exceed the supply we become acquaint with several amiable people and we beguile the anxious interval that precede mr t 's join we by frequent excursion in the neighborhood which not only afford we amusement but give we a opportunity of observe the mode of life of the country people we visit one farm which interested we particularly from its wild and lonely situation and from the entire dependence of the inhabitant upon they own resource it be a partial clearing in the very heart of the forest the house be build on the side of a hill so steep that a high ladder be necessary to enter the front door while the back one open against the hill side at the foot of this sudden eminence run a clear stream whose bed have be deepen into a little reservoir just opposite the house a noble field of indian-corn stretch away into the forest on one side and a few half-cleared acre with a shed or two upon they occupy the other give accommodation to cow horse pig and chicken innumerable immediately before the house be a small potatoe garden with a few peach and apple tree the house be build of log and consist of two room besides a little shanty or lean-to that be use as a kitchen both room be comfortably furnish with good bed drawer & c the farmer 's wife and a young woman who look like she sister be spin and three little child be play about the woman tell I that they spin and weave all the cotton and woolen garment of the family and knit all the stocking she husband though not a shoe-maker by trade make all the shoe she manufacture all the soap and candle they use and prepare she sugar from the sugar-tree on they farm all she want with money she say be to buy coffee tea and whiskey and she could get enough any day by send a batch of butter and chicken to market they use no wheat nor sell any of they corn which though it appear a very large quantity be not more than they require to make they bread and cake of various kind and to feed all they live stock during the winter she do not look in health and say they have all have ague in the fall but she seem contented and proud of she independence though it be in somewhat a mournful accent that she say ti strange to we to see company : i expect the sun may rise and set a hundred time before i shall see another _ human _ that do not belong to the family i have be minute in the description of this forest farm as i think it the best specimen i saw of the back-wood 's independence of which so much be say in america these people be indeed independent robinson crusoe be hardly more so and they eat and drink abundantly but yet it seem to I that there be something awful and almost unnatural in they loneliness no village bell ever summon they to prayer where they might meet the friendly greet of they fellow-man when they die no spot sacred by ancient reverence will receive they bone -- religion will not breathe she sweet and solemn farewell upon they grave the husband or the father will dig the pit that be to hold they beneath the nearest tree he will himself deposit they within it and the wind that whisper through the bough will be they only requiem but then they pay neither tax nor tythe be never expect to pull off a hat or to make a curtsy and will live and die without hearing or utter the dreadful word god save the king about two mile below cincinnatus on the kentucky side of the river mr bullock the well know proprietor of the egyptian hall have buy a large estate with a noble house upon it he and he amiable wife be devote themselves to the embellishment of the house and grounds and certainly there be more taste and art lavish on one of they beautiful saloon than all western america can show elsewhere it be impossible to help feeling that mr bullock be rather out of he element in this remote spot and the gem of art he have bring with he shew as strangely there as would a bower of rose in siberium or a cincinnatus fashionable at almack 's the exquisite beauty of the spot command one of the finest reach of the ohio the extensive garden and the large and handsome mansion have tempt mr bullock to spend a large sum in the purchase of this place and if any one who have pass he life in london could endure such a change the active mind and sanguine spirit of mr bullock might enable he to do it but he frank and truly english hospitality and he enlighten and enquire mind seem sadly waste there i have since hear with pleasure that mr bullock have part with this beautiful but secluded mansion chapter 6 servant -- society -- evening party the greatest difficulty in organise a family establishment in ohio be get servant or as it be there call get help for it be more than petty treason to the republic to call a free citizen a _ servant _ the whole class of young woman whose bread depend upon they labor be teach to believe that the most abject poverty be preferable to domestic service hundred of half-naked girl work in the paper-mill or in any other manufactory for less than half the wages they would receive in service but they think they equality be compromise by the latter and nothing but the wish to obtain some particular article of finery will ever induce they to submit to it a kind friend however exert herself so effectually for I that a tall stately lass soon present herself say i be come to help you the intelligence be very agreeable and i welcome she in the most gracious manner possible and ask what i should give she by the year oh giminus exclaim the damsel with a loud laugh you be a downright englisher sure enough i should like to see a young lady engage by the year in america i hope i shall get a husband before many month or i expect i shall be a outright old maid for i be most seventeen already besides mayhap i may want to go to school you must just give I a dollar and half a week and mother 's slave philli must come over once a week i expect from t ` other side the water to help I clean i agree to the bargain of course with all dutiful submission and see she be prepare to set to work in a yellow dress parseme with red rose i gently hint that i think it be a pity to spoil so fine a gown and that she have better change it ` tis just my best and my worst she answer for i have get no other and in truth i find that this young lady have leave the paternal mansion with no more clothes of any kind than what she have on i immediately give she money to purchase what be necessary for cleanliness and decency and set to work with my daughter to make she a gown she grin applause when we labor be complete but never utter the slightest expression of gratitude for that or for any thing else we could do for she she be constantly ask we to lend she different article of dress and when we decline it she say well i never seed such grumpy folk as you be there be several young lady of my acquaintance what go to live out now and then with the old woman about the town and they and they gurl always lend they what they ask for i guess you inglish think we should poison you thing just as bad as if we be negurs and here i beg to assure the reader that whenever i give conversation they be not make  loisir but be write down immediately after they occur with all the verbal fidelity my memory permit this young lady leave I at the end of two month because i refuse to lend she money enough to buy a silk dress to go to a ball say then ` tis not worth my while to stay any longer i can not imagine it possible that such a state of thing can be desirable or beneficial to any of the party concerned i might occupy a hundred page on the subject and yet fail to give a adequate idea of the sore angry ever wakeful pride that seem to torment these poor wretch in many of they it be so excessive that all feeling of displeasure or even of ridicule be lose in pity one of these be a pretty girl whose natural disposition must have be gentle and kind but she good feeling be sour and she gentleness turn to morbid sensitiveness by have hear a thousand and a thousand time that she be as good as any other lady that all man be equal and woman too and that it be a sin and a shame for a

and strong mind have enable she to win she way through a host of cruel step-mother faithless lover and cheating brother among other thing she tell I with the appearance of much emotion that she have

the house very late i get up go to the top of the stair and by the help of a bright moon recognize nancy 's best bonnet i call to she : you be very late say i what be the reason of it oh mr trollope she reply i be late indeed we have this night have seventeen soul add to we flock may they live to bless this night but it have be a long sit and very warm i 'll just take a drink of water and get to

and i seldom see she occupy about any thing without observe that she have place it near she at last she fall sick with the cholera and she life be despair of i nurse she with great care and sit up the greatest part of two night with she she be often delirious and all she wander thought seem to ramble to heaven i have be a sinner she say but i be safe in the lord jesus when she recover she ask I to let she go into the country for a few day to change the air and beg I to lend she three dollar while she be absent a lady call on I and enquire with some agitation if my servant nancy fletcher be at home i reply that she be go into the country thank god she exclaim never let she enter you door again she be the most abandon woman in the town : a gentleman who know you have be tell that she live with you and that she boast of have the power of enter you house at any hour of night she tell I many other circumstance unnecessary to repeat but all tend to prove that she be a very dangerous inmate i expect she home the next evening and i believe i pass the interval in meditate how to get rid of she without a _ eclaircissement _ at length she arrive and all my study have fail to supply I with any other reason than the real one for dismiss she i state it at once not the slightest change pass over she countenance but she look steadily at I and say in a very civil tone i should like to know

must do without they nancy good morning to you i must just put up my thing she say and leave the room about half a hour afterwards when we be all assemble at dinner she enter with she usual civil compose air well i be come to wish you all goodbye and with a friendly good-humoured smile she leave we this adventure frighten I so heartily that notwithstanding i have the dread of cooking my own dinner before my eye i would not take any more young lady into my family without receive some slight sketch of they former history at length i meet with a very worthy french woman and soon after with a tidy english girl to assist she and i have the good fortune to keep they till a short time before my departure : so happily i have no more misfortune of this nature to relate such be the difficulty respect domestic arrangement it be obvious that the lady who be bring up amongst they can not have leisure for any great development of the mind : it be in fact out of the question and remember this it be more surprising that some among they should be very please than that none should be highly instruct have i pass as many evening in company in any other town that i ever visit as i do in cincinnatus i should have be able to give some little account of the conversation i have listen to but upon reading over my note and then tax my memory to the utmost to supply the deficiency i can scarcely find a trace of any thing that deserve the name such as i have shall be give in they place but whatever may be the talent of the person who meet together in society the very shape form and arrangement of the meeting be sufficient to paralyze conversation the woman invariably herd together at one part of the room and the man at the other but in justice to cincinnatus i must acknowledge that this arrangement be by no means peculiar to that city or to the western side of the alleghany sometimes a small attempt at music produce a partial reunion a few of the most daring youth animated by the consciousness of curl hair and smart waistcoat approach the piano forte and begin to mutter a little to the half-grown pretty thing who be compare with one another how many quarter ' music they have have where the mansion be of sufficient dignity to have two drawing-room the piano the little lady and the slender gentleman be leave to themselves and on such occasion the sound of laughter be often hear to issue from among they but the fate of the more dignified personage who be leave in the other room be extremely dismal the gentleman spit talk of election and the price of produce and spit again the lady look at each other 's dress till they know every pin by heart talk of parson somebody 's last sermon on the day of judgment on dr t ` otherbody 's new pill for dyspepsia till the tea be announce when they all console themselves together for whatever they may have suffer in keep awake by take more tea coffee hot cake and custard hoe cake johny cake waffle cake and dodger cake pickle peach and preserved cucumber ham turkey hang beef apple sauce and pickle oyster than ever be prepare in any other country of the known world after this massive meal be over they return to the drawing-room and it always appear to I that they remain together as long as they could bear it and then they rise en masse cloak bonnet shawl and exit chapter 7 market -- museum -- picture gallery -- academy of fine art draw school -- phrenological society -- miss wright 's lecture perhaps the most advantageous feature in cincinnatus be its market which for excellence abundance and cheapness can hardly i should think be surpass in any part of the world if i except the luxury of fruit which be very inferior to any i have see in europe there be no butcher fishmonger or indeed any shop for eatables except bakery as they be call in the town every thing must be purchase at market and to accomplish this the busy housewife must be stir betime or ` spite of the abundant supply she will find she hope of breakfast dinner and supper for the day defeat the market be pretty well over by eight o'clock the beef be excellent and the highest price when we be there four cent -lrb- about two-penny -rrb- the pound the mutton be inferior and so be veal to the eye but it eat well though not very fat the price be about the same the poultry be excellent fowl or full-sized chicken ready for table twelve cent but much less if buy alive and not quite fat turkey about fifty cent and goose the same the ohio furnish several sort of fish some of they very good and always to be find cheap and abundant in the market egg butter nearly all kind of vegetable excellent and at moderate price from June till December tomato -lrb- the great luxury of the american table in the opinion of most european -rrb- may be find in the highest perfection in the market for about sixpence the peck they have a great variety of bean unknown in england particularly the lima-bean the seed of which be dress like the french harico it furnish a very abundant crop and be a most delicious vegetable : could it be naturalise with we it would be a valuable acquisition the windsor or broad-bean will not do well there mr bullock have they in he garden where they be cultivate with much care they grow about a foot high and blossom but the pod never ripen all the fruit i see expose for sale in cincinnatus be most miserable i pass two summer there but never taste a peach worth eating of apricot and nectarine i see none strawberry very small raspberry much worse gooseberry very few and quite uneatable currant about half the size of ours and about double the price grape too sour for tart apple abundant but very indifferent none that would be think good enough for a english table pear cherry and plum most miserably bad the flower of these region be at least equally inferior : whether this proceeds from want of cultivation or from peculiarity of soil i know not but after leave cincinnatus i be tell by a gentleman who appear to understand the subject that the state of ohio have no indigenous flower or fruit the water-melon which in that warm climate furnish a delightful refreshment be abundant and cheap but all other melon very inferior to those of france or even of england when ripen in a common hot-bed from the almost total want of pasturage near the city it be difficult for a stranger to divine how milk be furnish for its supply but we soon learn that there be more way than one of keep a cow a large proportion of the family in the town particularly of the poorer class have one though apparently without any accommodation whatever for it these animal be feed morning and evening at the door of the house with a good mess of indian corn boil with water while they eat they be milk and when the operation be complete the milk-pail and the meal-tub retreat into the dwelling leave the republican cow to walk away to take she pleasure on the hill or in the gutter as may suit she fancy best they generally return very regularly to give and take the morning and evening meal though it more than once happen to we before we be supply by a regular milk cart to have we jug send home empty with the sad news that the cow be not come home and it be too late to look for she to breakfast now once i remember the good woman tell we that she have oversleep herself and that the cow have come and go again not liking i expect to hanker about by herself for nothing poor thing cincinnatus have not many lion to boast but among they be two museum of natural history both of these contain many respectable specimen particularly that of mr dorfeuille who have moreover some highly interesting indian antiquity he be a man of taste and science but a collection form strictly accord to they dictate would by no means satisfy the western metropolis the people have a most extravagant passion for wax figure and the two museum vie with each other in display specimen of this barbarous branch of art as mr dorfeuille can not trust to he science for attract the citizen he have put he ingenuity into requisition and this have prove to he the surer aid of the two he have construct a pandaemonium in a upper story of he museum in which he have congregate all the image of horror that he fertile fancy could devise dwarf that by machinery grow into giant before the eye of the spectator imp of ebony with eye of flame monstrous reptile devour youth and beauty lake of fire and mountain of ice in short wax paint and spring have do wonder to give the scheme some more effect he make it visible only through a grate of massive iron bar among which be arrange wire connect with a electrical machine in a neighbouring chamber should any daring hand or foot obtrude itself with the bar it receive a smart shock that often pass through many of the crowd and the cause be unknown the effect be exceedingly comic terror astonishment curiosity be all set in action and all contribute to make dorfeuille 's hell one of the most amusing exhibition imaginable there be also a picture gallery at cincinnatus and this be a circumstance of much interest to we as we friend mr h who have accompany miss wright to america in the expectation of find a good opening in the line of historical painting intend commence he experiment at cincinnatus it would be invidious to describe the picture gallery i have no doubt that some year hence it will present a very different appearance mr h be very kindly receive by many of the gentleman of the city and though the state of the fine art there give he but little hope that he should meet with much success he immediately occupy himself in paint a noble historical picture of the landing of general lafayette at cincinnatus perhaps the clearest proof of the little feeling for art that exist at that time in cincinnatus may be draw from the result of a experiment originate by a german who teach draw there he conceive the project of form a chartered academy of fine art and he succeed in the begin to he utmost wish or rather they fool he to the top of he bent three thousand dollar be subscribe that be to say name be write against different sum to that amount a house be choose and finally application be make to the government and the charter obtain rehearse formally the name of the subscribe member the professor and the officer so far do the steam of they zeal impel they but at this point it be let off the affair stand still and i never hear the academy of fine art mention afterwards this same german gentleman on see mr h 's sketch be so well pleased with they that he immediately propose he join he in he draw school with a agreement i believe that he payment from it should be five hundred dollar a year mr h accept the proposal but the union do not last long and the cause of its dissolution be too american to be omit mr h prepare he model and attend the class which be numerous consist both of boy and girl he soon find that the sage call decipline be not one of the assistant and he remonstrate against the constant talking and run from one part of the room to another but in vain finding however that he could do nothing till this be discontinue he write some rule enforce order for the purpose of place they at the door of the academy when he shew they to he colleague he shake he head and say very goot very goot in europe but america boy and gal vill not bear it dey will do just vat dey please suur dey vould all go avay next day and you will not enforce these regulation _ si necessaires _ monsieur olar not for de vorld _ eh bien _ monsieur i must leave the young republican to you management i hear another anecdote that will help to show the state of art at this time in the west mr bullock be shew to some gentleman of the first stand the very _ elite _ of cincinnatus he beautiful collection of engraving when one among they exclaim have you really do all these since you come here how hard you must have work i be also tell of a gentleman of high cincinnatus ton and critical of he taste for the fine art who have a draw put into he hand represent hebe and the bird umquhile sacred to jupiter demand in a satirical tone what be this hebe reply the alarmed collector hebe sneer the man of taste what the devil have hebe to do with the american eagle we have not be long at cincinnatus when dr caldwell the spurzheim of america arrive there for the purpose of deliver lecture on phrenology i attend he lecture and be introduce to he he have study spurzheim and combe diligently and seem to understand the science to which he have devote himself but neither he lecture nor he conversation have that delightful truth of genuine enthusiasm which make listen to dr spurzheim so great a treat he lecture however produce considerable effect between twenty and thirty of the most erudite citizen decide upon form a phrenological society a meeting be call and fully attend a respectable number of subscriber ' name be register the payment of subscription be arrange for a future day president vice - president treasurer and secretary be choose and the first meeting dissolve with every appearance of energetic perseverance in scientific research the second meeting bring together one-half of this learn body and they enact rule and law and pass resolution sufficient it be say to have fill three folio a third day of meeting arrive which be a important one as on this occasion the subscription be to be pay the treasurer come punctually but find himself alone with patient hope he wait two hour for the wise man of the west but he wait in vain : and so expire the phrenological society of cincinnatus i have often occasion to remark that the spirit of enterprise or improvement seldom glow with sufficient ardor to resist the smother effect of a demand for dollar the american love talk all great work however that promise a profitable result be sure to meet support from man who have enterprise and capital sufficient to await the return but where there be nothing but glory or the gratification of taste to be expect it be i believe very rarely that they give any thing beyond they most sweet voice perhaps they be right in europe we see fortune cripple by a passion for statue or for picture or for book or for gem for all and every of the artificial want that give grace to life and tend to make man forget that he be a thing of clay they be wiser in they generation on the other side the atlantic i rarely see any thing that lead to such oblivion there soon after dr caldwell 's departure another lecturer appear upon the scene whose purpose of publicly address the people be no sooner make known than the most violent sensation be excite that a lady of fortune family and education whose youth have be pass in the most refined circle of private life should present herself to the people as a public lecturer would naturally excite surprise any where and the nil admirarus of the old world itself would hardly be sustain before such a spectacle but in america where woman be guard by a seven - fold shield of habitual insignificance it cause a effect that can hardly be describe miss wright of nashoba be go to lecture at the court-house sound from street to street and from house to house i share the surprise but not the wonder i know she extraordinary gift of eloquence she almost unequalled command of word and the wonderful power of she rich and thrilling voice and i doubt not that if it be she will to do it she have the power of command the attention and enchant the ear of any audience before whom it be she pleasure to appear i be most anxious to hear she but be almost deter from attempt it by the report that reach I of the immense crowd that be expect after many consultation and hearing that many other lady intend go my friend mr p -- and myself decide upon make the attempt accompany by a party of gentleman and find the difficulty less than we anticipate though the building be crowd in every part we congratulate ourselves that we have have the courage to be among the number for all my expectation fall far short of the splendor the brilliance the overwhelming eloquence of this extraordinary orator she lecture be upon the nature of true knowledge and it contain little that could be object to by any sect or party it be intend as a introduction to the strange and startling theory contain in she subsequent lecture and could alarm only by the hint it contain that the fabric of human wisdom could rest securely on no other base than that of human knowledge there be however one passage from which common-sense revolt it be one wherein she quote that phrase of mischievous sophistry all man be bear free and equal this false and futile axiom which have do be do and will do so much harm to this fine country come from jefferson and truly he life be a glorious commentary upon it i pretend not to criticise he written work but commonsense enable I to pronounce this he favorite maxim false few name be hold in higher estimation in america than that of jefferson it be the touchstone of the democratic party and all seem to agree that he be one of the greatest of man yet i have hear he name couple with deed which would make the son of europe shudder the fact i allude to be speak openly by all not whisper privately by a few and in a country where religion be the tea-table talk and its strict observance a fashionable distinction these fact be record and listen to without horror nay without emotion mr jefferson be say to have be the father of child by almost all he numerous gang of female slave these wretched offspring be also the lawful slave of they father and work in he house and plantation as such in particular it be record that it be he especial pleasure to be wait upon by they at table and the hospitable orgy for which he montecielo be so celebrated be incomplete unless the goblet he quaff be tender by the tremble hand of he own slavish offspring i once hear it state by a democratical adorer of this great man that when as it sometimes happen he child by quadroon slave be white enough to escape suspicion of they origin he do not pursue they if they attempt to escape say laughingly let the rogue get off if they can i will not hinder they this be state in a large party as a proof of he kind and noble nature and be receive by all with approve smile if i know anything of right or wrong if virtue and vice be indeed something more than word then be this great american a unprincipled tyrant and most heartless libertine but to return to miss wright -- it be impossible to imaging any thing more striking than she appearance she tall and majestic figure the deep and almost solemn expression of she eye the simple contour of she finely form head unadorned excepting by its own natural ringlet she garment of plain white muslin which hang around she in fold that recall the drapery of a grecian statue all contribute to produce a effect unlike anything i have ever see before or ever expect to see again chapter 8 absence of public and private amusement -- church and chapel -- influence of the clergy -- a revival i never see any people who appear to live so much without amusement as the cincinnatian billiards be forbid by law so be card to sell a pack of card in ohio subject the seller to a penalty of fifty dollar they have no public ball except i think six during the christmas holiday they have no concert they have no dinner party they have a theater which be in fact the only public amusement of this triste little town but they seem to care little about it and either from economy or distaste it be very poorly attend lady be rarely see there and by far the larger proportion of female deem it a offence against religion to witness the representation of a play it be in the church and chapel of the town that the lady be to be see in full costume and i be tempt to believe that a stranger from the continent of europe would be incline on first reconnoiter the city to suppose that the place of worship be the theater and cafe of the place no evening in the week but bring throng of the young and beautiful to the chapel and meeting - house all dress with care and sometimes with great pretension it be there that all display be make and all fashionable distinction seek the proportion of gentleman attend these evening meeting be very small but often as might be expect a sprinkling of smart young clerk make this sedulous display of ribbon and ringlet intelligible and natural be it not for the church indeed i think there might be a general bonfire of best bonnet for i never could discover any other use for they the lady be too actively employ in the interior of they house to permit much parading in full dress for morning visit there be no public garden or lounge shop of fashionable resort and be it not for public worship and private tea - drinking all the lady in cincinnatus would be in danger of become perfect recluse the influence which the minister of all the innumerable religious sect throughout america have on the female of they respective congregation approach very nearly to what we read of in spain or in other strictly roman catholic country there be many cause for this peculiar influence where equality of rank be affectedly acknowledge by the rich and clamourously claim by the poor distinction and preeminence be allow to the clergy only this give they high importance in the eye of the lady i think also that it be from the clergy only that the woman of america receive that sort of attention which be so dearly value by every female heart throughout the world with the priest of america the woman hold that degree of influential importance which in the country of europe be allow they throughout all order and rank of society except perhaps the very lowest and in return for this they seem to give they heart and soul into they keep i never see or read of any country where religion have so strong a hold upon the woman or a slighter hold upon the man i mean not to assert that i meet with no man of sincerely religious feeling or with no woman of no religious feeling at all but i feel perfectly secure of be correct as to the great majority in the statement i have make we have not be many month in cincinnatus when we curiosity be excite by hear the revival talk of by every one we meet throughout the town the revival will be very full -- we shall be constantly engage during the revival -- be the phrase we constantly hear repeat and for a long time without in the least comprehend what be mean but at length i learn that the un-national church of america require to be rouse at regular interval to greater energy and exertion at these season the most enthusiastic of the clergy travel the country and enter the city and town by score or by hundred as the accommodation of the place may admit and for a week or fortnight or if the population be large for a month they preach and pray all day and often for a considerable portion of the night in the various church and chapel of the place this be call a revival i take considerable pain to obtain information on this subject but in detail what i learn i fear that it be probable i shall be accuse of exaggeration all i can do be cautiously to avoid deserving it the subject be highly interesting and it would be a fault of no trifling nature to treat it with levity these itinerant clergyman be of all persuasion i believe except the episcopalian catholic unitarian and quaker i hear of presbyterian of all variety of baptist of i know not how many division and of methodist of more denomination than i can remember whose innumerable shades of vary belief it would require much time to explain and more to comprehend they enter all the city town and village of the union in succession i could not learn with sufficient certainty to repeat what the interval generally be between they visit these itinerant be for the most part lodge in the house of they respective follower and every evening that be not spend in the church and meeting-house be devote to what would be call party by other but which they designate as prayer meeting here they eat drink pray sing hear confession and make convert to these meeting i never get invite and therefore i have nothing but hearsay evidence to offer but my information come from a eye-witness and one on whom i believe i may depend if one half of what i hear may be believe these social prayer meeting be by no mean the most curious or the least important part of the business it be impossible not to smile at the close resemblance to be trace between the feeling of a first-rate presbyterian or methodist lady fortunate enough to have secure a favorite itinerant for she meeting and those of a first-rate london blue equally bless in the presence of a fashionable poet there be a strong family likeness among we all the world over the best room the best dress the choicest refreshment solemnize the meeting while the party be assemble the load-star of the hour be occupy in whisper conversation with the guest as they arrive they be call brother and sister and the greeting be very affectionate when the room be full the company of whom a vast majority be always woman be invite intreated and coax to confess before they brother and sister all they thought fault and folly these confession be strange scene the more they confess the more invariably be they encourage and caress when this be over they all kneel and the itinerant pray extempore they then eat and drink and then they sing hymn pray exhort sing and pray again till the excitement reach a very high pitch indeed these scene be go on at some house or other every evening during the revival nay at many at the same time for the church and meeting-house can not give occupation to half the itinerant though they be all open throughout the day and till a late hour in the night and the officiate minister succeed each other in the occupation of they it be at the principal of the presbyterian church that i be twice witness to scene that make I shudder in describe one i describe both and every one the same thing be constantly repeat it be in the middle of summer but the service we be recommend to attend do not begin till it be dark the church be well light and crowd almost to suffocation on enter we find three priest stand side by side in a sort of tribune place where the altar usually be handsomely fit up with crimson curtain and elevated about as high as we pulpit we take we place in a pew close to the rail which surround it the priest who stand in the middle be pray the prayer be extravagantly vehement and offensively familiar in expression when this end a hymn be sing and then another priest take the center place and preach the sermon have considerable eloquence but of a frightful kind the preacher describe with ghastly minuteness the last feeble fainting moment of human life and then the gradual progress of decay after death which he follow through every process up to the last loathsome stage of decomposition suddenly change he tone which have be that of sober accurate description into the shrill voice of horror he bent forward he head as if to gaze on some object beneath the pulpit and as rebecca make know to ivanhoe what she see through the window so the preacher make know to we what he see in the pit that seem to open before he the device be certainly a happy one for give effect to he description of hell no image that fire flame brimestone molten lead or red-hot pincers could supply with flesh nerve and sinew quiver under they be omit the perspiration run in stream from the face of the preacher he eye roll he lip be cover with foam and every feature have the deep expression of horror it would have bear have he in truth be gaze at the scene he describe the acting be excellent at length he give a languish look to he supporter on each side as if to express he feeble state and then sit down and wipe the drop of agony from he brow the other two priest arise and begin to sing a hymn it be some seconds before the congregation could join as usual every upturned face look pale and horror strike when the singing end another take the center place and begin in a sort of coax affectionate tone to ask the congregation if what they dear brother have speak have reach they heart whether they would avoid the hell he have make they see come then he continue stretch out he arm towards they come to we and tell we so and we will make you see jesus the dear gentle jesus who shall save you from it but you must come to he you must not be ashamed to come to he this night you shall tell he that you be not ashamed of he we will make way for you we will clear the bench for anxious sinner to sit upon come then come to the anxious bench and we will shew you jesus come come come again a hymn be sing and while it continue one of the three be employ in clear one or two long bench that go across the rail send the people back to the lower part of the church the singing cease and again the people be invite and exhort not to be ashamed of jesus but to put themselves upon the anxious bench and lay they head on he bosom once more we will sing he conclude that we may give you time and again they sing a hymn and now in every part of the church a movement be perceptible slight at first but by degree become more decide young girl arise and sit down and rise again and then the pew open and several come totter out they hand clasp they head hang on they bosom and every limb tremble and still the hymn go on but as the poor creature approach the rail they sob and groan become audible they seat themselves on the anxious bench the hymn cease and two of the three priest walk down from the tribune and go one to the right and the other to the left begin whisper to the poor trembler seat there these whisper be inaudible to we but the sob and groan increase to a frightful excess young creature with feature pale and distorted fall on they knee on the pavement and soon sink forward on they face the most violent cry and shriek follow while from time to time a voice be hear in convulsive accent exclaim oh lord oh lord jesus help I jesus and the like meanwhile the two priest continue to walk among they they repeatedly mount on the bench and trumpet-mouthed proclaimed to the whole congregation the tiding of salvation and then from every corner of the building arise in reply short sharp cry of amen glory aman while the prostrate penitent continue to receive whisper comforting and from time to time a mystic caress more than once i see a young neck encircle by a reverend arm violent hysteric and convulsion seize many of they and when the tumult be at the highest the priest who remain above again give out a hymn as if to drown it it be a frightful sight to behold innocent young creature in the gay morning of existence thus seize upon horror strike and render feeble and enervate for ever one young girl apparently not more than fourteen be support in the arm of another some year older she face be pale as death she eye wide open and perfectly devoid of mean she chin and bosom wet with slaver she have every appearance of idiotism i see a priest approach she he take she delicate hand jesus be with she bless the lord he say and pass on do the man of america value they woman as man ought to value they wife and daughter would such scene be permit among they it be hardly necessary to say that all who obey the call to place themselves on the anxious bench be woman and by far the greater number very young woman the congregation be in general extremely well dress and the smartest and most fashionable lady of the town be there during the whole revival the church and meeting-house be every day crowd with well dress people it be thus the lady of cincinnatus amuse themselves to attend the theater be forbid to play card be unlawful but they work hard in they family and must have some relaxation for myself i confess that i think the coarsest comedy ever write would be a less detestable exhibition for the eye of youth and innocence than such a scene chapter 9 school -- climate -- water melon -- fourth of July -- storm -- pig -- move house -- mr flint -- literature cincinnatus contain many school but of they rank or merit i have very little opportunity of judge the only one which i visit be keep by dr lock a gentleman who appear to have liberal and enlarged opinion on the subject of female education should he system produce practical result proportionably excellent the lady of cincinnatus will probably some year hence be much improve in they power of companionship i attend the annual public exhibition at this school and perceive with some surprise that the higher branch of science be among the study of the pretty creature i see assemble there one lovely girl of sixteen take she degree in mathematics and another be examine in moral philosophy they blush so sweetly and look so beautifully puzzle and confound that it might have be difficult for a abler judge than i be to decide how far they merit the diploma they receive this method of let young lady graduate and grant they diploma on quit the establishment be quite new to I at least i do not remember to have hear of any thing similar elsewhere i should fear that the time allow to the fair graduate of cincinnatus for the acquirement of these various branch of education would seldom be sufficient to permit they reach the eminence in each which they enlighten instructor anticipate a quarter 's mathematics or two quarter political economy moral philosophy algebra and quadratic equation would seldom i should think enable the teacher and the scholar by they joint effort to lay in such a stock of these science as would stand the wear and tear of half a score of child and one help towards the end of may we begin to feel that we be in a climate warmer than any we have be accustom to and my son suffer severely from the effect of it a bilious complaint attend by a frightful degree of fever seize he and for some day we fear for he life the treatment he receive be i have no doubt judicious but the quantity of calomel prescribe be enormous i ask one day how many grain i should prepare and be tell to give half a teaspoonful the difference of climate must i imagine make a difference in the effect of this drug or the practice of the old and new world could hardly differ so widely as it do in the use of it anstey speaking of the bath physician say no one e'er view any one of the medical gentleman stew but i can vouch upon my own experience that no similar imputation lie against the gentleman who prescribe large quantity of calomel in america to give one instance in proof of this when i be afterwards in montgomery county near washington a physician attend one of we neighbor and complain that he be himself unwell you must take care of yourself doctor say the patient i do so he reply i take forty grain of calomel yesterday and i feel better than i do repeat and violent bleeding be also have recourse to in the case of my son and in a few day he be able to leave he room but he be dreadfully emaciated and it be many week before he recover he strength as the heat of the weather increase we hear of much sickness around we the city be full of physician and they be all to be see drive about in they cab at a very alarming rate one of these gentleman tell we that when a medical man intend settle in a new situation he always if he know he business walk through the street at night before he decide if he see the dismal twinkle of the watch-light from many window he might be sure that disease be busy and the the location might suit he well judge by this criterion cincinnatus be far from healthy i begin to fear for we health and determine to leave the city but for a considerable time i find it impossible to procure a dwelling out of it there be many boarding-house in the vicinity but they be all overflow with guest we be advise to avoid as much as possible walk out in the heat of the day but the morning and evening be delightful particularly the former if take sufficiently early for several week i be never in bed after four o'clock and at this hour i almost daily accompany my help to market where the busy novelty of the scene afford I much amusement many waggon-load of enormous water-melon be bring to market every day and i be sure to see group of man woman and child seat on the pavement round the spot where they be sell suck in prodigious quantity of this water-fruit they manner of devour they be extremely unpleasant the huge fruit be cut into half a dozen section of about a foot long and then drip as it be with water apply to the mouth from either side of which pour copious stream of the fluid while ever and anon a mouthful of the hard black seed be shoot out in all direction to the great annoyance of all within reach when i first taste this fruit i think it very vile stuff indeed but before the end of the season we all learn to like it when take with claret and sugar it make delicious wine and water it be the custom for the gentleman to go to market at cincinnatus the smartest man in the place and those of the highest standing do not scruple to leave they bed with the sun six day in the week and prepare with a mighty basket to sally forth in search of meat butter egg and vegetable i have continually see they return with they weighty basket on one arm and a enormous ham depend from the other and now arrive the 4th of July that greatest of all american festival on the 4th of July 1776 the declaration of they independence be sign at the state-house in philadelphium to I the dreary coldness and want of enthusiasm in american manners be one of they greatest defect and i therefore hail the demonstration of general feeling which this day elicit with real pleasure on the 4th of July the heart of the people seem to awaken from a three hundred and sixty-four day ' sleep they appear high-spirited gay animated social generous or at least liberal in expense and would they but refrain from spit on that hallowed day i should say that on the 4th of July at least they appear to be a amiable people it be true that the woman have but little to do with the pageantry the splendor or the gaiety of the day but set this defect aside it be indeed a glorious sight to behold a jubilee so heartfelt as this and have they not the bad taste and bad feeling to utter a annual oration with unvarying abuse of the mother country to say nothing of the warlike manifesto call declaration of independence we gracious king himself might look upon the scene and say that it be good nay even rejoice that twelve million of bustling body at four thousand mile distance from he throne and he altar should make they own law and drink they own tea after the fashion that please they best one source of deep interest to we in this new clime be the frequent recurrence of thunderstorm those who have only listen to thunder in england have but a faint idea of the language which the god speak when they be angry thomson 's description however will do : it be hardly possible that word can better paint the spectacle or more truly echo to the sound than he do the only point he do not reach be the vast blaze of rose-coloured light that ever and anon set the landscape on fire in read this celebrated description in america and observe how admirably true it be to nature there i seem to get a glimpse at a poet 's machinery and to perceive that in order to produce effect he must give he image more vast than he find they in nature but the proportion must be just and the color true every thing seem colossal on this great continent if it rain if it blow if it thunder it be all do _ fortissimo _ but i often feel terror yield to wonder and delight so grand so glorious be the scene a storm exhibit accident be certainly more frequent than with we but not so much so as reasonably to bring terror home to one 's bosom every time a mass of lurid cloud be see roll up against the wind it seem hardly fair to quarrel with a place because its staple commodity be not pretty but i be sure i should have like cincinnatus much better if the people have not deal so very largely in hog the immense quantity of business do in this line would hardly be believe by those who have not witness it i never see a newspaper without remark such advertisement as the following : want immediately 4000 fat hog for sale 2000 barrel of prime pork but the annoyance come nearer than this if i determine upon a walk up main-street the chance be five hundred to one against my reach the shady side without brushing by a snout fresh drip from the kennel when we have screw we courage to the enterprise of mount a certain noble look sugar-loaf hill that promise pure air and a fine view we find the brook we have to cross at its foot red with the stream from a pig slaughter house while we nose instead of meet the thyme that love the green hill 's breast be greet by odour that i will not describe and which i heartily hope my reader can not imagine we foot that on leave the city have expect to press the flowery sod literally get entangled in pig ' tail and jaw-bone : and thus the prettiest walk in the neighborhood be interdict for ever one of the sight to stare at in america be that of house move from place to place we be often amuse by watch this exhibition of mechanical skill in the street they make no difficulty of move dwelling from one part of the town to another those i see travel be all of they frame-house that be build wholly of wood except the chimney but it be say that brick building be sometimes treat in the same manner the largest dwelling that i saw in motion be one contain two story of four room each forty ox be yoke to it the first few yard bring down the two stack of chimney but it afterwards go on well the great difficulty be the first get it in motion and the stop exactly in the right place this locomotive power be extremely convenient at cincinnatus as the constant improvement go on there make it often desirable to change a wooden dwelling for one of brick and whenever this happen we be sure to see the ex no100 of main-street or the ex no55 of second street creep quietly out of town to take possession of a humble suburban station on the common above it the most agreeable acquaintance i make in cincinnatus and indeed one of the most talented man i ever meet be mr flint the author of several extremely clever volume and the editor of the western monthly review he conversational power be of the highest order : he be the only person i remember to have know with first rate power of satire and even of sarcasm whose kindness of nature and of manner remain perfectly uninjured in some of he critical notice there be a strength and keenness second to nothing of the kind i have ever read he be a warm patriot and so true-hearted a american that we could not always be of the same opinion on all the subject we discuss but whether it be the force and brilliancy of he language he genuine and manly sincerity of feeling or he bland and gentleman-like manner that beguile I i know not but certainly he be the only american i ever listen to whose unqualified praise of he country do not appear to I somewhat overstrain and ridiculous on one occasion but not at the house of mr flint i pass a evening in company with a gentleman say to be a scholar and a man of read he be also what be call a _ serious _ gentleman and he appear to have pleasure in feeling that he claim to distinction be acknowledge in both capacity there be a very amiable _ serious _ lady in the company to whom he seem to trust for the development of he celestial pretension and to I he do the honor of address most of he terrestrial superiority the difference between we be that when he speak to she he speak as to a be who if not he equal be at least deserving high distinction and he give she smile such as michael might have vouchsafe to eve to I he speak as paul to the offend jew he do not indeed shake he raiment at I but he use he pocket-handkerchief so as to answer the purpose and if every sentence do not end with i be clean pronounced by he lip he tone he look he action fully supply the deficiency we poor lord byron as may be suppose be the bull 's - eye against which every dart in he black little quiver be aim i have never hear any serious gentleman talk of lord byron at full length before and i listen attentively it be evident that the noble passage which be grave on the heart of the genuine lover of poetry have altogether escape the serious gentleman 's attention and it be equally evident that he know by rote all those that they wish the mighty master have never write i tell he so and i shall not soon forget the look he give I of other author he knowledge be very imperfect but he criticism very amusing of pope he say he be so entirely go by that in _ we _ country it be consider quite fustian to speak of he but i persevere and name the rape of the lock as evince some little talent and be in a tone that might still hope for admittance in the drawing-room but on the mention of this poem the serious gentleman become almost as strongly agitate as when he talk of don juan and i be unfeignedly at a loss to comprehend the nature of he feeling till he mutter with a indignant shake of the handkerchief the very title at the name of dryden he smile and the smile speak as plainly as a smile could speak how the old woman twaddle we only know dryden by quotation madam and these indeed be find only in book that have long since have they day and shakspeare sir shakspeare madam be obscene and thank god we be sufficiently advance to have find it out if we must have the abomination of stage play let they at least be mark by the refinement of the age in which we live this be certainly be _ au courant du jour _ of massenger he know nothing of ford he have never hear gray have have he day prior he have never read but understand he be a very childish writer chaucer and spenser he tie in a couple and dismiss by say that he think it be neither more nor less than affectation to talk of author who write in a tongue no longer intelligible this be the most literary conversation i be ever present at in cincinnatus \* \* -lrb- the pleasant easy unpretending talk on all subject -lrb- which i enjoy in mr flint 's family be a exception -lrb- to every thing else i meet at cincinnatus in truth there be many reason which render a very general diffusion of literature impossible in america i can scarcely class the universal reading of newspaper as a exception to this remark if i could my statement would be exactly the reverse and i should say that america beat the world in letter the fact be that throughout all rank of society from the successful merchant which be the highest to the domestic serve man which be the lowest they be all too actively employ to read except at such broken moment as may suffice for a peep at a newspaper it be for this reason i presume that every _ american newspaper _ be more or less a magazine wherein the merchant may scan while he hold out he hand for a invoice stanza by mr heman or a garbled extract from moore 's life of byron the lawyer may study he brief faithfully and yet contrive to pick up the valuable dictum of some american critic that bulwer 's novel be decidedly superior to sir walter scott 's nay even the auctioneer may find time as he bustle to he tub or he tribune to support he pretension to polite learning by glance he quick eye over the column and reading that miss mitford 's description be indescribable if you buy a yard of ribbon the shopkeeper lay down he newspaper perhaps two or three to measure it i have see a brewer 's drayman perch on the shaft of he dray and read one newspaper while another be tuck under he arm and i once go into the cottage of a country shoemaker of the name of harri where i see a newspaper half full of original poetry direct to madison f harris to be sure of the fact i ask the man if he name be madison yes madam madison franklin harri be my name the last and the lyre divide he time i fear too equally for he look pale and poor this i presume be what be mean by the general diffusion of knowledge so boast of in the united state such as it be the diffusion of it be general enough certainly but i greatly doubt its be advantageous to the population the only reading man i meet with be those who make letter they profession and of these there be some who would hold a higher rank in the great republic -lrb- not of america but of letter -rrb- do they write for person less give to the study of magazine and newspaper and they might hold a higher rank still do they write for the few and not for the many i be always draw a parallel perhaps a childish one between the external and internal deficiency of polish and of elegance in the native volume of the country they composition have not that condensation of thought or that elaborate finish which the consciousness of write for the scholar and the man of taste be calculate to give nor have they dirty blue paper and slovenly type \* the polished elegance that fit a volume for the hand or the eye of the fastidious epicure in literary enjoyment the first book i buy in america be the chronicle of the cannongate in ask the price i be agreeably surprise to hear a dollar and a half name be about one sixth of what i use to pay for its fellow in england but on open the grim page it be long before i could again call they cheap to be sure the pleasure of a bright well-printed page ought to be quite lose sight of in the glowing gallop bewitching course that the imagination set out upon with a new waverley novel and so it be with I till i feel the want of it and then i be almost ashamed to confess how often in turn the thin dusky page my poor earth-born spirit pause in its pleasure to sigh for hot-pressed wire-wove \* -lrb- i must make a exception in favor of the american -lrb- quarterly review to the eye of the body it be in -lrb- all respects exactly the same thing as the english -lrb- quarterly review chapter 10 removal to the country -- walk in the forest -- equality at length my wish of obtain a house in the country be gratify a very pretty cottage the residence of a gentleman who be remove into town for the convenience of he business as a lawyer be to let and i immediately secure it it be situate in a little village about a mile and a half from the town close to the foot of the hill formerly mention as the northern boundary of it we find ourselves much more comfortable here than in the city the house be pretty and commodious we sitting-room be cool and airy we have get rid of the detestable mosquito and we have a ice-house that never fail beside all this we have the pleasure of gather we tomato from we own garden and receive we milk from we own cow we manner of life be infinitely more to my taste than before it give we all the privilege of rusticity which be fully as incompatible with a residence in a little town of western america as with a residence in london we live on term of primaeval intimacy with we cow for if we lay down on we lawn she do not scruple to take a sniff at the book we be read but then she give we she own sweet breath in return the verge of the cool-looking forest that rise opposite we window be so near that we often use it as a extra drawing - room and there be no one to wonder if we go out with no other preparation than we parasol carry book and work enough to while away a long summer day in the shade the meadow that divide we from it be cover with a fine short grass that continue for a little way under the tree make a beautiful carpet while sundry log and stump furnish we sofa and table but even this be not enough to satisfy we when we first escape from the city and we determine upon have a day 's enjoyment of the wildest forest scenery we could find so we pack up book album pencil and sandwich and despite a burning sun drag up a hill so steep that we sometimes fancy we could rest ourselves against it by only lean forward a little in panting and in groan we reach the top hope to be refresh by the purest breath of heaven but to have taste the breath of heaven we must have climb yet farther even to the top of the tree themselves for we soon find that the air beneath they stir not nor ever have stir as it seem to we since first it settle there so heavily do it weigh upon we lung still we be determine to enjoy ourselves and forward we go crunch knee deep through aboriginal leaf hope to reach some spot less perfectly airtight than we landing-place wearied with the fruitless search we decide on repose awhile on the trunk of a fall tree be all considerably exhaust the idea of sit down on this tempting log be conceive and execute simultaneously by the whole party and the whole party sink together through its treacherous surface into a mass of rotten rubbish that have form part of the pith and marrow of the eternal forest a hundred year before we be by no mean the only sufferer by the accident frog lizard locust katiedid beetle and hornet have the whole of they various tenement disturbed and testify they displeasure very naturally by annoy we as much as possible in return we be bit we be sting we be scratch and when at last we succeed in raise ourselves from the venerable ruin we present as woeful a spectacle as can well be imagine we shake we -lrb- not ambrosial -rrb- garment and pant with heat sting and vexation move a few pace from the scene of we misfortune and again sit down but this time it be upon the solid earth we have no sooner begin to chew the cud of the bitter fancy that have beguile we to these mountain solitude than a new annoyance assail we a cloud of mosquito gather round and while each sharp proboscis suck we blood they tease we with they humming chorus till we lose all patience and start again on we foot pretty firmly resolve never to try the _ al fresco _ joy of a american forest again the sun be now in its meridian splendor but we homeward path be short and down hill so again pack up we preparation for felicity we start homeward or more properly speak we start for in look for a agreeable spot in this dungeon forest we have advance so far from the verge of the hill that we have lose all trace of the precise spot where we have enter it nothing be to be see but multitude of tall slender melancholy stem as like as pea and stand within a foot of each other the ground as far as the eye could reach -lrb- which certainly be not far -rrb- be cover with a unvaried bed of dry leave no trace no track no trail as mr cooper would call it give we a hint which way to turn and have pause for a moment to meditate we remember that chance must decide for we at last so we set forward in no very good mood to encounter new misfortune we walk about a quarter of a mile and come to a steep descent we think ourselves extremely fortunate and begin to scramble down nothing doubt that it be the same we have scramble up in truth nothing could be more like but alas thing that be like be not the same when we have slip and stumble down to the edge of the wood and be able to look beyond it we see no pretty cottage with the shadow of its beautiful acacia come forward to meet we : all be different and what be worse all be distant from the spot where we have hope to be we have come down the opposite side of the ridge and have now to win we weary way a distance of three mile round its base i believe we shall none of we ever forget that walk the bright glowing furnace - like heat of the atmosphere seem to scorch as i recall it it be painful to tread it be painful to breathe it be painful to look round every object glow with the reflection of the fierce tyrant that glare upon we from above we get home alive which agreeably surprise we and when we parched tongue again find power of utterance we promise each other faithfully never to propose any more party of pleasure in the grim store-like forest of ohio we be now in daily expectation of the arrival of mr t but day after day and week after week pass by till we begin to fear some untoward circumstance might delay he come till the spring at last when we have almost cease to look out for he on the road which lead from the town he arrive late at night by that which lead across the country from pitzburgh the pleasure we feel at see he be greatly increase by he bring with he we eldest son which be a happiness we have not hope for we walk and we drive now become doubly interesting the young man fresh from a public school find america so totally unlike all the nation with which they reading have make they acquaint that it be indeed a new world to they have they visit greece or rome they would have encounter object with whose image they mind have be long acquaint or have they travel to france or italy they would have see only what daily conversation have already render familiar but at we public school america -lrb- except perhaps as to she geographical position -rrb- be hardly better know than fairy land and the american character have not be much more deeply study than that of the anthropophagus : all therefore be new and every thing amusing the extraordinary familiarity of we poor neighbor startle we at first and we hardly know how to receive they uncouth advance or what be expect of we in return however it sometimes produce very laughable scene upon one occasion two of my child set off upon a explore walk up the hill they be absent rather longer than we expect and the rest of we party determine upon go out to meet they we know the direction they have take but think it would be as well to enquire at a little public-house at the bottom of the hill if such a pair have be see to pass a woman whose appearance more resemble a covent garden market-woman than any thing else i can remember come out and answer my question with the most jovial good humor in the affirmative and prepared to join we in we search she look she voice she manner be so exceedingly coarse and vehement that she almost frighten I she pass she arm within mine and to the inexpressible amusement of my young people she drag I on talk and question I without cease she live but a short distance from we and i be sure intend to be a very good neighbor but she violent intimacy make I dread to pass she door my child include my son she always address by they christian name except when she substitute the word honey this familiarity of address however i afterwards find be universal throughout all rank in the united state my general appellation amongst my neighbor be the english old woman but in mention each other they constantly employ the term lady and they evidently have a pleasure in use it for i repeatedly observe that in speaking of a neighbor instead of say mr such-a-one they describe she as the lady over the way what take in wash or as that there lady out by the gulley what be make dip-candle mr trollope be as constantly call the old man while drayman butcher ' boy and the labourer on the canal be invariably denominate they gentleman nay we once see one of the most gentlemanlike man in cincinnatus introduce a fellow in dirty shirt sleeve and all sort of detestable et cetera to one of he friend with this formulum d -- let I introduce this gentleman to you we respective title certainly be not very important but the eternal shake hand with these lady and gentleman be really a annoyance and the more so as the near approach of the gentleman be always redolent of whiskey and tobacco but the point where this republican equality be the most distressing be in the long and frequent visitation that it produce no one dream of fasten a door in western america i be tell that it would be consider as a affront by the whole neighborhood i be thus expose to perpetual and most vexatious interruption from people whom i have often never see and whose name still oftener be unknown to I those who be native there and to the manner bear seem to pass over these annoyance with more skill than i could ever acquire more than once i have see some of my acquaintance beset in the same way without appear at all distressed by it they continue they employment or conversation with I much as if no such interruption have take place when the visitor enter they would say how do you do and shake hand tolerable i thank ye how be you be the reply if it be a female she take off she hat if a male he keep it on and then take possession of the first chair in they way they would retain it for a hour together without utter another word at length rise abruptly they would again shake hand with well now i must be go i guess and so take themselves off apparently well contented with they reception i could never attain this philosophical composure i could neither write nor read and i always fancy i must talk to they i will give the minute of a conversation which i once set down after one of they visit as a specimen of they tone and manner of speaking and think my visitor be a milkman well now so you be from the old country ay -- you 'll see sight here i guess i hope i shall see many that be a fact i expect you little place of a island do not grow such dreadful fine corn as you see here -lrb- corn always mean indian corn or maize -rrb- it grow no corn at all sir ' possible no wonder then that we read such awful story in the papers of you poor people be starve to death we have wheat however ay for you rich folk but i calculate the poor seldom get a belly full you have certainly much greater abundance here i expect so why they do say that if a poor body contrive to be smart enough to scrape together a few dollar that you king george always come down upon 'em and take it all away do not he i do not remember hearing of such a transaction i guess they be pretty close about it you papers be not like ourn i reckon now we say and print just what we like you spend a good deal of time in read the newspaper and i would like you to tell I how we can spend it better how should freemen spend they time but look after they government and watch that they feller as we give office to doo they duty and give themselves no air but i sometimes think sir that you fence might be in more thorough repair and you road in better order if less time be spend in politics the lord to see how little you know of a free country why what be the smoothness of a road put against the freedom of a free-born american and what do a broken zig-zag signify comparable to know that the man what we have be please to send up to congress speak handsome and straight as we choose they should it be from a sense of duty then that you all go to the liquor store to read the papers to be sure it be and he would be no true bear american as do not i do not say that the father of a family should always be after liquor but i do say that i would rather have my son drunk three time in a week than not look after the affair of he country we autumn walk be delightful the sun cease to scorch the want of flower be no longer peculiar to ohio and the tree take a coloring which in richness brilliance and variety exceed all description i think it be the maple or sugar - tree that first sprinkle the forest with rich crimson the beech follow with all its harmony of golden tint from pale yellow up to brightest orange the dog-wood give almost the purple color of the mulberry the chesnut soften all with its frequent mass of delicate brown and the sturdy oak carry its deep green into the very lap of winter these tint be too bright for the landscape painter the attempt to follow nature in a american autumn scene must be abortive the color be in reality extremely brilliant but the medium through which they be see increase the effect surprisingly of all the point in which america have the advantage of england the one i feel most sensibly be the clearness and brightness of the atmosphere by day and by night this exquisite purity of air give tenfold beauty to every object i could hardly believe the star be the same the great bear look like a constellation of sun and jupiter justified all the fine thing say of he in those beautiful line from i know not what spirit pen beginning i look on thee jove till my gaze shrink smote by the pow ' r of thy blaze i always remark that the first silver line of the moon 's crescent attract the eye on the first day in america as strongly as it do here on the third i observe another phenomenon in the crescent moon of that region the cause of which i less understand that appearance which shakespear describe as the new moon with the old moon in she lap and which i have hear ingeniously explain as the effect of _ earth light _ be less visible there than here cuyp 's clearest landscape have a atmosphere that approach nearer to that of america than any i remember on canvas but even cuyp 's _ air _ can not reach the lung and therefore can only give a idea of half the enjoyment for it make itself feel as well as see and be indeed a constant source of pleasure we walk be however curtail in several direction by my old cincinnatus enemy the pig immense drove of they be continually arrive from the country by the road that lead to most of we favorite walk they be often feed and lodge in the prettiest valleysand worse still be slaughter beside the prettiest stream another evil threaten we from the same quarter that be yet heavier we cottage have a ample piazza -lrb- a luxury almost universal in the country house of america -rrb- which shaded by a group of acacia make a delightful sit - room from this favorite spot we one day perceive symptom of building in a field close to it with much anxiety we hasten to the spot and ask what building be to be erect there ` tis to be a slaughter house for hog be the dreadful reply as there be several gentleman 's house in the neighborhood i ask if such a erection might not be indict as a nuisance a what a nuisance i repeat and explain what i mean no no be the reply that may do very well for you tyrannical country where a rich man 's nose be more think of than a poor man 's mouth but hog be profitable produce here and we be too free for such a law as that i guess during my residence in america little circumstance like the foregoing often recall to my mind a conversation i once hold in france with a old gentleman on the subject of they active police and its omnipresent gen d'armerie croyez moi madame il n ' y a que ceux  qui ils ont  faire qui les trouvent de trop and the old gentleman be right not only in speaking of france but of the whole human family as philosopher call we the well disposed those whose own feeling of justice would prevent they annoying other will never complain of the restraint of the law all the freedom enjoy in america beyond what be enjoy in england be enjoy solely by the disorderly at the expense of the orderly and be i a stout knight either of the sword or of the pen i would fearlessly throw down my gauntlet and challenge the whole republic to prove the contrary but be as i be a feeble looker on with a needle for my spear and i talk for my device i must be contented with the power of state the fact perfectly certain that i shall be contradict by one loud shout from maine to georgia chapter 11 religion i have often hear it observe before i visit america that one of the great blessing of its constitution be the absence of a national religion the country be thus exonerate from all obligation of support the clergy those only contribute to do so whose principle lead they to it my residence in the country have shew I that a religious tyranny may be exert very effectually without the aid of the government in a way much more oppressive than the pay of tithe and without obtain any of the salutary decorum which i presume no one will deny be the result of a established mode of worship as it be impossible to remain many week in the country without be strike with the strange anomaly produce by its religious system my early note contain many observation on the subject but as nearly the same scene recur in every part of the country i state they here not as belong to the west alone but to the whole union the same cause produce the same effect every where the whole people appear to be divide into a almost endless variety of religious faction and i be tell that to be well receive in society it be necessary to declare yourself as belong to some one of these let you acknowledged belief be what it may you be say to be _ not a christian _ unless you attach yourself to a particular congregation besides the broad and well-known distinction of episcopalian catholic presbyterian calvinist baptist quaker sweden-borgian universalist dunker & c & c & c there be innumerable other spring out of these each of which assume a church government of its own of this the most intriguing and factious individual be invariably the head and in order as it should seem to shew a reason for this separation each congregation invest itself with some queer variety of external observance that have the melancholy effect of expose _ all _ religious ceremony to contempt it be impossible in witness all these unseemly vagary not to recognize the advantage of a established church as a sort of headquarters for quiet unpresuming christian who be contented to serve faithfully without insist upon have each a little separate banner embroider with a device of they own imagine the catholic alone appear exempt from the fury of division and sub-division that have seize every other persuasion have the pope for they common head regulate i presume they movement and prevent the outrageous display of individual whim which every other sect be permit i have the pleasure of be introduce to the catholic bishop of cincinnatus and have never know in any country a priest of a character and bear more truly apostolic he be a american but i should never have discover it from he pronunciation or manner he receive he education partly in england and partly in france he manners be highly polish he piety active and sincere and infinitely more mild and tolerant than that of the factious sectarian who form the great majority of the american priesthood i believe i be sufficiently tolerant but this do not prevent my see that the object of all religious observance be better obtain when the government of the church be confide to the wisdom and experience of the most venerated among the people than when it be place in the hand of every tinker and tailor who choose to claim a share in it nor be this the only evil attend the want of a national religion support by the state as there be no legal and fixed provision for the clergy it be hardly surprising that they service be confine to those who can pay they the vehement expression of insane or hypocritical zeal such as be exhibit during the revival can but ill atone for the want of village worship any more than the eternal talk of the admirable and unequalled government can atone for the continual contempt of social order church and state hobble along side by side notwithstanding they boast independence almost every man you meet will tell you that he be occupy in labor most abundant for the good of he country and almost every woman will tell you that besides those thing that be within -lrb- she house -rrb- she have come upon she daily the care of all the church yet spite of this universal attention to the government its law be half asleep and spite of the old woman and they dorca society atheism be awake and thrive in the smaller city and town prayer-meeting take the place of almost all other amusement but as the thinly scatter population of most village can give no party and pay no priest they contrive to marry christen and bury without they a stranger take up he residence in any city in america must think the native the most religious people upon earth but if chance lead he among she western village he will rarely find either church or chapel prayer or preacher except indeed at that most terrific saturnalia a camp-meeting i be much strike with the answer of a poor woman whom i see iron on a Sunday do you make no difference in you occupation on a Sunday i say i beant a christian ma'am we have get no opportunity be the reply it occur to I that in a country where all man be equal the government would be guilty of no great crime do it so far interfere as to give they all _ a opportunity _ of become christian if they wish it but should the federal government dare to propose build a church and endow it in some village that have never hear the bring home of bell and burial it be perfectly certain that not only the sovereign state where such a abomination be propose would rush into the congress to resent the odious interference but that all the other state would join the clamor and such a intermeddle administration would run great risk of impeachment and degradation where there be a church-government so constitute as to deserve human respect i believe it will always be find to receive it even from those who may not assent to the dogma of its creed and where such respect exist it produce a decorum in manners and language often find want where it do not sectarian will not venture to rhapsodise nor infidel to scoff in the common intercourse of society both be injurious to the cause of rational religion and to check both must be advantageous it be certainly possible that some of the fanciful variation upon the ancient creed of the christian church with which transatlantic religionist amuse themselves might inspire morbid imagination in europe as well as in america but before they can disturb the solemn harmony here they must prelude by a defiance not only to common sense but what be infinitely more appalling to common usage they must at once rank themselves with the low and the illiterate for only such prefer the eloquence of the tub to that of the pulpit the aristocracy must ever as a body belong to the established church and it be but a small proportion of the influential class who would be willing to allow that they do not belong to the aristocracy that such feeling influence the profession of man it be ignorance or hypocrisy to deny and that nation be wise who know how to turn even such feeling into a wholesome stream of popular influence as a specimen of the tone in which religion be mix in the ordinary intercourse of society i will transcribe the note i take of a conversation at which i be present at cincinnatus i write they immediately after the conversation take place dr a i wish mr m that you would explain to I what a revival be i hear it talk of all over the city and i know it mean something about jesus christ and religion but that be all i know will you instruct I farther mrs m i expect dr a that you want to laugh at I but that make no difference i be firm in my principle and i fear no one 's laughter dr a well but what be a revival mr m it be difficult very difficult to make those see who have no light to make those understand whose soul be darken a revival mean just a elegant kindling of the spirit it be bring about to the lord 's people by the hand of he saint and it mean salvation in the highest dr a but what be it the people mean by talk of feel the revival and wait in spirit for the revival and the extacy of the revival mr m oh doctor i be afraid that you be too far go astray to understand all that it be a glorious assurance a whispering of the everlasting covenant it be the bleating of the lamb it be the welcome of the shepherd it be the essence of love it be the fullness of glory it be be in jesus it be jesus be in we it be take the holy ghost into we bosom it be sit ourselves down by god it be be call to the high place it be eat and drink and sleep in the lord it be become a lion in the faith it be be lowly and meek and kiss the hand that smite it be be mighty and powerful and scorn reproof it be -- dr a thank you mr m i feel quite satisfied and i think i understand a revival now almost as well as you do yourself mr a my where can you have learn all that stuff mr m mr m how benighted you be from the holy book from the word of the lord from the holy ghost and jesus christ themselves mr a it do seem so droll to I to hear you talk of the word of the lord why i have be bring up to look upon the bible as nothing better than a old newspaper mr o surely you only say this for the sake of hear what mr m will say in return -- you do not mean it mr a la yes to be sure i do dr a i profess that i by no means wish my wife to read all she might find there -- what say the colonel mr m mr m as to that i never stop to ask he i tell he every day that i believe in father son and holy ghost and that it be he duty to believe in they too and then my conscience be clear and i do not care what he believe really i have no notion of one 's husband interfere in such matter dr a you be quite right i be sure i give my wife leave to believe just what she like but she be a good woman and do not abuse the liberty for she believe nothing it be not once nor twice nor thrice but many many time during my residence in america that i be present when subject which custom as well as principle have teach I to consider as fitter for the closet than the tea-table be thus lightly discuss i hardly know whether i be more startle at first hearing in little dainty namby pamby tone a profession of atheism over a teacup or at have my attention call from a johnny cake to a rhapsody on election and the second birth but notwithstanding this revolting license persecution exist to a degree unknown i believe in we well-ordered land since the day of cromwell i have the follow anecdote from a gentleman perfectly well acquaint with the circumstance a tailor sell a suit of clothes to a sailor a few moment before he sail which be on a Sunday morning the corporation of new york prosecute the tailor and he be convict and sentence to a fine greatly beyond he means to pay mr f a lawyer of new york defend he with much eloquence but in vain he powerful speech however be not without effect for it raise he such a host of presbyterian enemy as suffice to destroy he practice nor be this all : he nephew be at the time prepare for the bar and soon after the above circumstance occur he certificate be present and refuse with this declaration that no man of the name and family of f should be admit i have meet this young man in society he be a person of very considerable talent and be thus cruelly rob of he profession have become the editor of a newspaper chapter 12 peasantry compare to that of england -- early marriage -- charity -- independence and equality -- cottage prayer-meeting mohawk as we little village be call give we a excellent opportunity of compare the peasant of the united state with those of england and of judge the average degree of comfort enjoy by each i believe ohio give as fair a specimen as any part of the union if they have the roughness and inconvenience of a new state to contend with they have higher wages and cheaper provision if i err in suppose it a mean state in point of comfort it certainly be not in take too low a standard mechanic if good workman be certain of employment and good wages rather higher than with we the average wages of a labourer throughout the union be ten dollar a month with lodge board wash and mend if he live at he own expense he have a dollar a day it appear to I that the necessaries of life that be to say meat bread butter tea and coffee -lrb- not to mention whiskey -rrb- be within the reach of every sober industrious and healthy man who choose to have they and yet i think that a english peasant with the same qualification would in come to the united state change for the worse he would find wages somewhat higher and provision in western america considerably lower : but this statement true as it be can lead to nothing but delusion if take apart from other fact fully as certain and not less important but which require more detail in describe and which perhaps can not be fully comprehend except by a eye-witness the american poor be accustom to eat meat three time a day i never enquire into the habit of any cottager in western america where this be not the case i find afterwards in maryland pennsylvanium and other part of the country where the price of meat be higher that it be use with more economy yet still a much larger portion of the weekly income be thus expend than with we ardent spirit though lamentably cheap \* still cost something and the use of they among the man with more or less of discretion accord to the character be universal tobacco also grow at they door and be not tax yet this too cost something and the air of heaven be not in more general use among the man of america than chew tobacco i be not now point out the evil of dram-drinking but it be evident that where this practice prevail universally and often to the most frightful excess the consequence must be that the money spend to obtain the dram be less than the money lose by the time consume in drink it long disable and expensive fit of sickness be incontestably more frequent in every part of america than in england and the sufferer have no aid to look to but what they have save or what they may be enable to sell i have never see misery exceed what i have witness in a american cottage where disease have enter \* -lrb- about a shill a gallon be the retail price of good -lrb- whiskey if buy wholesale or of inferior quality it -lrb- be much cheaper but if the condition of the labourer be not superior to that of the english peasant that of he wife and daughter be incomparably worse it be they who be indeed the slave of the soil one have but to look at the wife of a american cottager and ask she age to be convince that the life she lead be one of hardship privation and labor it be rare to see a woman in this station who have reach the age of thirty without lose every trace of youth and beauty you continually see woman with infant on they knee that you feel sure be they grand - child till some convincing proof of the contrary be display even the young girl though often with lovely feature look pale thin and haggard i do not remember to have see in any single instance among the poor a specimen of the plump rosy laughing physiognomy so common among we cottage girl the horror of domestic service which the reality of slavery and the fable of equality have generate exclude the young woman from that sure and most comfortable resource of decent english girl and the consequence be that with a most irreverend freedom of manner to the parent the daughter be to the full extent of the word domestic slave this condition which no periodical merry-making no village fte ever occur to cheer be only change for the still sadder burden of a teem wife they marry very young in fact in no rank of life do you meet with young woman in that delightful period of existence between childhood and marriage wherein if only tolerably well spend so much useful information be gain and the character take a sufficient degree of firmness to support with dignity the more important part of wife and mother the slender childish thing without vigor of mind or body be make to stem a sea of trouble that dim she young eye and make she cheek grow pale even before nature have give it the last beautiful finish of the full-grown woman we shall get along be the answer in full for all that can be say in way of advice to a boy and girl who take it into they head to go before a magistrate and get marry and they do get along till sickness overtake they by means perhaps of borrow a kettle from one and a tea-pot from another but intemperance idleness or sickness will in one week plunge those who be even get along well into utter destitution and where this happen they be completely without resource the absence of poor-law be without doubt a blessing to the country but they have not that natural and reasonable dependence on the richer class which in country differently constitute may so well supply they place i suppose there be less alms-giving in america than in any other christian country on the face of the globe it be not in the temper of the people either to give or to receive i extract the follow pompous passage from a washington paper of feb 1829 -lrb- a season of uncommon severity and distress -rrb- which i think justify my observation among the liberal evidence of sympathy for the suffering poor of this city two have come to we knowledge which deserve to be especially notice : the one a donation by the president of the united state to the committee of the ward in which he reside of fifty dollar the other the donation by a few of the officer of the war department to the howard and dorca society of seventy-two dollar when such mention be make of a gift of about nine pound sterling from the sovereign magistrate of the united state and of thirteen pound sterling as a contribution from one of the state department the inference be pretty obvious that the suffering of the destitute in america be not liberally relieve by individual charity i have not be three day at mohawk-cottage before a pair of ragged child come to ask for medicine for a sick mother and when it be give to they the eldest produce a handful of cent and desire to know what he be to pay the superfluous milk of we cow be seek after eagerly but every new comer always propose to pay for it when they find out that the english old woman do not sell anything i be persuade they by no means like she the better for it but they seem to think that if she be a fool it be no reason they should be so too and accordingly the borrowing as they call it become very constant but always in a form that shew they dignity and freedom one woman send to borrow a pound of cheese another half a pound of coffee and more than once a intimation accompany the milk-jug that the milk must be fresh and unskimmed : on one occasion the messenger refuse milk and say mother only want a little cream for she coffee i could never teach they to believe during above a year that i live at this house that i would not sell the old clothes of the family and so pertinacious be they in bargain-making that often when i have give they the article which they want to purchase they would say well i expect i shall have to do a turn of work for this you may send for I when you want I but as i never do ask for the turn of work and as this formulum be constantly repeat i begin to suspect that it be speak solely to avoid utter the most un-american phrase i thank you there be one man whose progress in wealth i watch with much interest and pleasure when i first become he neighbor himself he wife and four child be live in one room with plenty of beef-steak and onion for breakfast dinner and supper but with very few other comfort he be one of the finest man i ever see full of natural intelligence and activity of mind and body but he could neither read nor write he drink but little whiskey and but rarely chew tobacco and be therefore more free from that plague spot of spit which render male colloquy so difficult to endure he work for we frequently and often use to walk into the drawing-room and seat himself on the sofa and tell I all he plan he make a engagement with the proprietor of the wooded hill before mention by which half the wood he could fall be to be he own he unwearied industry make this a profitable bargain and from the proceeds he purchase the material for build a comfortable frame -lrb- or wooden -rrb- house he do the work almost entirely himself he then get a job for cut rail and as he could cut twice as many in a day as any other man in the neighborhood he make a good thing of it he then let half he pretty house which be admirably construct with a ample portico that keep it always cool he next step be contract for the build a wooden bridge and when i leave mohawk he have fit up he half of the building as a hotel and grocery store and i have no doubt that every sun that set see he a richer man than when it rise he hope to make he son a lawyer and i have little doubt that he will live to see he sit in congress when this time arrive the wood-cutter 's son will rank with any other member of congress not of courtesy but of right and the idea that he origin be a disadvantage will never occur to the imagination of the most exalted of he fellow-citizen this be the only feature in american society that i recognize as indicative of the equality they profess any man 's son may become the equal of any other man 's son and the consciousness of this be certainly a spur to exertion on the other hand it be also a spur to that coarse familiarity untempered by any shadow of respect which be assume by the grossest and the lowest in they intercourse with the highest and most refine this be a positive evil and i think more than balance its advantage and here again it may be observe that the theory of equality may be very daintily discuss by english gentleman in a london dining-room when the servant have place a fresh bottle of cool wine on the table respectfully shut the door and leave they to they walnut and they wisdom but it will be find less palatable when it present itself in the shape of a hard greasy paw and be claim in accent that breathe less of freedom than of onion and whiskey strong indeed must be the love of equality in a english breast if it can survive a tour through the union there be one house in the village which be remarkable from its wretchedness it have a air of indecent poverty about it which long prevent my attempt a entrance but at length upon be tell that i could get chicken and egg there whenever i want they i determine upon venture the door be open to my knock i very nearly abandon my almost blunt purpose i never behold such a den of filth and misery : a woman the very image of dirt and disease hold a squalid imp of a baby on she hip bone while she knead she dough with she right fist only a great lanky girl of twelve year old be sit on a barrel gnawing a corn cob when i make known my business the woman answer no not i i get no chicken to sell nor egg neither but my son will plenty i expect here nick -lrb- bawl at the bottom of a ladder -rrb- here be a old woman what want chicken half a moment bring nick to the bottom of the ladder and i find my merchant be one of a ragged crew whom i have be use to observe in my daily walk play marble in the dust and swearing lustily he look about ten year old have you chicken to sell my boy yes and egg too more nor what you 'll buy have enquire price condition and so on i recollected that i have be use to give the same price at market the feather pluck and the chicken prepare for the table and i tell he that he ought not to charge the same oh for that i expect i can fix 'em as well as ever they be what you get in market you fix they yes to be sure why not i think you be too fond of marble he give I a keen glance and say you do not know i -- when will you be want the chicken he bring they at the time direct extremely well fix and i often deal with he afterwards when i pay he he always thrust he hand into he breach pocket which i presume as be _ the keep _ be fortify more strongly than the dilapidated outwork and draw from thence rather more dollar half-dollar levy and fip than he dirty little hand could well hold my curiosity be excite and though i feel a involuntary disgust towards the young jew i repeatedly converse with he you be very rich nick i say to he one day on he make a ostentatious display of change as he call it he sneer with a most unchildish expression of countenance and reply i guess ` twould be a bad job for i if that be all i would get to shew i ask he how he manage he business he tell I that he buy egg by the hundred and lean chicken by the score from the waggon that pass they door on the way to market that he fat the latter in coop he have make himself and could easily double they price and that he egg answer well too when he sell they out by the dozen and do you give the money to you mother i expect not be the answer with another sharp glance of he ugly blue eye what do you do with it nick he look say plainly what be that to you but he only answer quaintly enough i take care of it how nick get he first dollar be very doubtful i be tell that when he enter the village store the person serve always call in another pair of eye but have obtain it the spirit activity and industry with which he cause it to increase and multiply would have be delightful in one of miss edgeworth 's dear little clean bright-looking boy who would have carry all he get to he mother but in nick it be detestable no human feeling seem to warm he young heart not even the love of self-indulgence for he be not only ragged and dirty but look considerably more than half starve and i doubt not he dinner and supper half feed he fat chicken i by no means give this history of nick the chicken merchant as a anecdote characteristic in all respects of america the only part of the story which be so be the independence of the little man and be one instance out of a thousand of the hard dry calculate character that be the result of it probably nick will be very rich perhaps he will be president i once get so heartily scold for say that i do not think all american citizen be equally eligible to that office that i shall never again venture to doubt it another of we cottage acquaintance be a market-gardener from whom we frequently buy vegetable from the wife of this man we one day receive a very civil invitation to please to come and pass the evening with they in prayer the novelty of the circumstance and its great dissimilarity to the way and manners of we own country induce I to accept the invitation and also to record the visit here we be receive with great attention and a place be assign we on one of the bench that surround the little parlor several person look like mechanic and they wife be present every one sit in profound silence and with that quiet subdue air that serious people assume on enter a church at length a long black grim-looking man enter he dress the cut of he hair and he whole appearance strongly recall the idea of one of cromwell 's fanatic he step solemnly into the middle of the room and take a chair that stand there but not to sit upon it he turn the back towards he on which he place he hand and stoutly utter a sound between a hem and a cough he deposit freely on either side of he a considerable portion of masticated tobacco he then begin to preach he text be live in hope and he continue to expound it for two hour in a drawling nasal tone with no other respite than what he allow himself for expectoration if i say that he repeat the word of this text a hundred time i think i shall not exceed the truth for that allow more than a minute for each repetition and in fact the whole discourse be make up of it the various tone in which he utter it might have serve as a lesson on emphasis as a question -- in accent of triumph -- in accent of despair -- of pity -- of threaten -- of authority -- of doubt -- of hope -- of faith have exhaust every imaginable variety of tone he abruptly say let we pray and twist he chair round knelt before it every one knelt before the seat they have occupy and listen for another half hour to a rant of miserable low familiar jargon that he presume to improvise to he maker as a prayer in this however the cottage apostle only follow the example set by every preacher throughout the union except those of the episcopalian and catholic congregation they only do not deem themselves privileged to address the deity in strain of crude and unweighed importunity these ranter may sometimes be very much in earnest but surely the least we can say of it be that they praise they god amiss i enquired afterwards of a friend well acquaint with such matter how the grim preacher of hope get pay for he labor and he tell I that the trade be a excellent one for that many a gude wife bestow more than a tithe of what she gude man trust to she keep in reward the zeal of these self - choose apostle these sable minister walk from house to house or if the distance be considerable ride on a comfortable amble nag they be not only as empty as wind but resemble it in other particulars for they blow where they list and no man knoweth whence they come nor whither they go when they see a house that promise comfortable lodging and entertainment they enter there and say to the good woman of the house sister shall i pray with you if the answer be favourable and it be seldom otherwise he instal himself and he horse till after breakfast the next morning the best meat drink and lodging be he while he stay and he seldom depart without some little contribution in money for the support of the crucify and suffer church be it not strange that the most intelligent people in the world should prefer such a religion as this to a form establish by the wisdom and piety of the ablest and best among the err son of man solemnly sanction by the nation 's law and render sacred by the use of they father it would be well for all reasoner on the social system to observe steadily and with a eye obscure by no beam of prejudice the result of the experiment that be make on the other side of the atlantic if i mistake not they might learn there better than by any abstract speculation what be the point on which the magistrate of a great people should dictate to they and on what point they should be leave freely to they own guidance i sincerely believe that if a fire-worshipper or a indian brahmin be to come to the united state prepare to preach and pray in english he would not be long without a very respectable congregation the influence of a religion sanction by the government could in no country in the nineteenth century interfere with the speculation of a philosopher in he closet but it might and must steady the weak and waver opinion of the multitude there be something really pitiable in the effect produce by the want of this rudder oar i know a family where one be a methodist one a presbyterian and a third a baptist and another where one be a quaker one a declare atheist and another a universalist these be all female and all move in the best society that america afford but one and all of they as incapable of reasoning on thing past present and to come as the infant they nourish yet one and all of they perfectly fit to move steadily and usefully in a path mark out for they but i shall be call a itinerant preacher myself if i pursue this theme as i have not the magic power of my admirable friend miss mitford to give grace and interest to the humblest rustic detail i must not venture to linger among the cottage that surround we but before i quit they i must record the please recollection of one or two neighbor of more companionable rank from whom i receive so much friendly attention and such unfailing kindness in all my little domestic embarrassment that i shall never recall the memory of mohawk without pay a affectionate tribute to these far distant friend i wish it be within the range of hope that i might see they again in my own country and repay in part the obligation i owe they chapter 13 theater -- fine art -- delicacy -- shake quaker -- big-bone lick -- visit of the president the theater at cincinnatus be small and not very brilliant in decoration but in the absence of every other amusement we young man frequently attend it and in the bright clear night of autumn and winter the mile and a half of distance be not enough to prevent the less enterprising member of the family from sometimes accompany they the great inducement to this be the excellent acting of mr and mr alexander drake the manager -lrb- mr drake be a englishman -rrb- nothing could be more distinct than they line of act but the great versatility of they power enable they often to appear together she cast be the highest walk of tragedy and he the broadest comedy but yet as goldsmith say of he sister heroine i have know they change character for a whole evening together and have weep with he and laugh with she as it be they will and pleasure to ordain i think in he comedy he be superior to any actor i ever see in the same part except emery alexander drake 's comedy be like that of the french who never appear to be act at all he be himself the comic be the author aim at depict let he speak whose word he would from shakspeare to colman it be impossible not to feel that half the fun be he own he have too in a very high degree the power that fawcett possess of draw tear by a sudden touch of natural feeling he comic song might have set the gravity of the judge and bishop together at defiance liston be great but alexander drake be greater mr drake formerly miss denny greatly resemble miss o'neil a proof of this be that mr kean who have hear of the resemblance arrive at new york late in the evening and have repair to the theater see she for the first time across the stage and immediately exclaim that be miss denny she voice too have the same rich and touching tone and be superior in power she talent be decidedly first-rate deep and genuine feeling correct judgment and the most perfect good taste distinguish she play in every character she last act of belvidera be superior in tragic effect to any thing i ever see on the stage the one great exception to all comparison mr siddon be set aside it be painful to see these excellent performer play to a miserable house not a third full and the audience probably not include half a dozen person who would prefer they play to that of the vilest stroller in proof of this i see they as manager give place to paltry third-rate actor from london who would immediately draw crowded house and be overwhelm with applause poor drake die just before we leave ohio and he wife who besides she merit as a actress be a most estimable and amiable woman be leave with a large family i have little or rather no doubt of she be able to obtain a excellent engagement in london but she have property in several of the western theater will i fear detain she in a neighborhood where she be neither understand nor appreciate she tell I many very excellent professional anecdote collect during she residence in the west one of these particularly amuse I as a specimen of western idiom a lady who profess a great admiration for mr drake have obtain she permission to be present upon one occasion at she theatrical toilet she be dress for some character in which she be to stab herself and she dagger be lie on the table the visitor take it up and examine it with much emotion exclaim what do you really jab this into yourself sevagarous we also see the great american star mr forrest what he may become i will not pretend to prophesy but when i see he play hamlet at cincinnatus not even mrs drake 's sweet ophelium could keep I beyond the third act it be true that i have see kemble macready kean young c kemble cook and talma play hamlet and i might not perhaps be a very fair judge of this young actor 's merit but i be greatly amuse when a gentleman who ask my opinion of he tell I upon hear it that he would not advise I to state it freely in america for they would not bear it the theater be really not a bad one though the very poor receipt render it impossible to keep it in high order but a annoyance infinitely greater than decoration indifferently clean be the style and manner of the audience man come into the lower tier of box without they coat and i have see shirt sleeve tuck up to the shoulder the spit be incessant and the mixed smell of onion and whiskey be enough to make one feel even the drake ' act dearly buy by the obligation of endure its accompaniment the bearing and attitude of the man be perfectly indescribable the heel throw higher than the head the entire rear of the person present to the audience the whole length support on the bench be among the variety that these exquisite posture-master exhibit the noise too be perpetual and of the most unpleasant kind the applause be express by cry and thump with the foot instead of clap and when a patriotic fit seize they and yankee doodle be call for every man seem to think he reputation as a citizen depend on the noise he make two very indifferent figurante probably from the ambigu comique or la gaiete make they appearance at cincinnatus while we be there and have mercury step down and dance a _ pas seul _ upon earth he godship could not have produce a more violent sensation but wonder and admiration be by no mean the only feeling excite horror and dismay be produce in at least a equal degree no one i believe doubt they be admirable dancer but every one agree that the moral of the western world would never recover the shock when i be ask if i have ever see any thing so dreadful before i be embarrassed how to answer for the young woman have be exceedingly careful both in they dress and in they dancing to meet the taste of the people but have it be virginie in she most transparent attire or taglionus in she most remarkable pirouette they could not have be more reprobated the lady altogether forsake the theater the gentleman mutter under they breath and turn they head aside when the subject be mention the clergy denounce they from the pulpit and if they be name at the meeting of the saint it be to show how deep the horror such a theme could produce i could not but ask myself if virtue be a plant thrive under one form in one country and flourish under a different one in another if these western american be right then how dreadfully wrong be we it be really a very puzzling subject but this be not the only point on which i find my notion of right and wrong utterly confound hardly a day pass in which i do not discover that something or other that i have be teach to consider lawful as eating be hold in abhorrence by those around I many word to which i have never hear a objectionable meaning attach be totally interdicted and the strangest paraphrastic sentence substitute i confess it strike I that notwithstanding a general stiffness of manner which i think must exceed that of the scribe and pharisee the american have imagination that kindle with alarming facility i could give many anecdote to prove this but will content myself with a few a young german gentleman of perfectly good manners once come to I greatly chagrin at have offend one of the principal family in the neighborhood by have pronounce the word _ corset _ before the lady of it a old female friend have kindly overcome she own feeling so far as to mention to he the cause of the coolness he have remark and strongly advise he make a apology he tell I that he be perfectly well disposed to do so but feel himself greatly at a loss how to word it a english lady who have long keep a fashionable boarding-school in one of the atlantic city tell I that one of she earliest care with every new comer be the endeavor to substitute real delicacy for this affect precision of manner among many anecdote she tell I one of a young lady about fourteen who on enter the receive room where she only expect to see a lady who have enquire for she and find a young man with she put she hand before she eye and run out of the room again scream a man a man a man on another occasion one of the young lady in go up stair to the drawing-room unfortunately meet a boy of fourteen come down and she feeling be so violently agitate that she stop pant and sob nor would pass on till the boy have swing himself up on the upper banister to leave the passage free at cincinnatus there be a garden where the people go to eat ice and to look at rose for the preservation of the flower there be place at the end of one of the walk a sign-post sort of daub represent a swiss peasant girl hold in she hand a scroll request that the rose might not be gather unhappily for the artist or for the proprietor or for both the petticoat of this figure be so short as to shew she ancle the lady see and shudder and it be formally intimate to the proprietor that if he wish for the patronage of the lady of cincinnatus he must have the petticoat of this figure lengthen the affrighted purveyor of ice send off a express for the artist and he paint pot he come but unluckily not provide with any color that would match the petticoat the necessity however be too urgent for delay and a flounce of blue be add to the petticoat of red give bright and shine evidence before all man of the immaculate delicacy of the cincinnatus lady i confess i be sometimes tempt to suspect that this ultra refinement be not very deep seat it often appear to I like the consciousness of grossness that want a veil but the veil be never gracefully adjust occasionally indeed the very same person who appear ready to faint at the idea of a statue would utter some unaccountable sally that be quite startling and which make I feel that the indelicacy of which we be accuse have its limit the following anecdote be hardly fit to tell but it explain what i mean too well to be omit a young married lady of _ high standing _ and most fastidious delicacy who have be bring up at one of the atlantic seminary of highest reputation tell I that she house at the distance of half a mile from a populous city be unfortunately opposite a mansion of worse than doubtful reputation it be abominable she say to see the people that go there they ought to be expose i and another lady a intimate friend of mine do make one of they look foolish enough last summer : she be pass the day with I and while we be sit at the window we see a young man we both know ride up there we go into the garden and watch at the gate for he to come back and when he do we both step out and i say to he be you not ashamed mr william d to ride by my house and back again in that manner i never see a man look so foolish in converse with lady on the custom and manners of europe i remark a strong propensity to consider every thing as wrong to which they be not accustomed i once mention to a young lady that i think a picnic party would be very agreeable and that i would propose it to some of we friend she agree that it would be delightful but she add i fear you will not succeed we be not use to such sort of thing here and i know it be consider very indelicate for lady and gentleman to sit down together on the grass i could multiply anecdote of this nature but i think these sufficient to give a accurate idea of the tone of manners in this particular and i trust to justify the observation i have make one of the spectacles which produce the greatest astonishment on we all be the republican simplicity of the court of justice we have hear that the judge indulge themselves on the bench in those extraordinary attitude which doubtless some peculiarity of the american formation lead they to find the most comfortable of this we be determine to judge for ourselves and accordingly enter the court when it be in full business with three judge on the bench the annexed sketch will better describe what we see than any thing i can write we winter pass rapidly away and pleasantly enough by the help of frosty walk a little skait a visit to big-bone lick and a visit to the shake quaker a good deal of chess and a good deal of reading notwithstanding we be almost in the back wood of western america the excursion to big-bone lick in kentucky and that to the quaker village be too fatiguing for female at such a season but we gentleman bring we home mammoth bone and shake quaker story in abundance these singular people the shake quaker of america give undeniable proof that community may exist and prosper for they have continue for many year to adhere strictly to this manner of life and have be constantly increase in wealth they have form two or three different society in distant part of the union all govern by the same general law and all uniformly prosperous and flourishing there must be some sound and wholesome principle at work in these establishment to cause they success in every undertaking and this principle must be a powerful one for it have to combat much that be absurd and much that be mischievous the society be generally compose of about a equal proportion of male and female many of they be man and they wife but they be all bind by they law not to cohabit together they religious observance be wholly confine to singing and dancing of the most grotesque kind and this repeat so constantly as to occupy much time yet these people become rich and powerful wherever they settle themselves whatever they manufacture whatever they farm produce be always in the highest repute and bring the highest price in the market they receive all stranger with great courtesy and if they bring a introduction they be lodge and feed for any length of time they choose to stay they be not ask to join in they labor but be permit to do so if they wish it the big-bone lick be not visit and even partially examine without considerable fatigue it appear from the account of we traveller that the spot which give the region its elegant name be a deep bed of blue clay tenacious and unsound so much so as to render it both difficult and dangerous to traverse the digging it have be find so laborious that no one have yet hazard the expense of a complete search into its depths for the gigantic relic so certainly hide there the clay have never be move without find some of they and i think it can hardly be doubt that money and perseverance would procure a more perfect specimen of a entire mammoth than we have yet see -lrb- since the above be write a immense skeleton nearly perfect have be extract -rrb- and now the time arrive that we domestic circle be again to be break up we eldest son be to be enter at oxford and it be necessary that he father should accompany he and after considerable indecision it be at length determine that i and my daughter should remain another year with we second son it be early in February and we traveller prepare themselves to encounter some sharp gale upon the mountain though the great severity of the cold appear to be past we get buffalo robe and double shoe prepare for they and they be on the eve of departure when we hear that general jackson the newly-elected president be expect to arrive immediately at cincinnatus from he residence in the west and to proceed by steamboat to pittsburgh on he way to washington this determine they not to fix the day of they departure till they hear of he arrival and then if possible to start in the same boat with he the decent dignity of a private conveyance not be deem necessary for the president of the united state the day of he arrival be however quite uncertain and we could only determine to have every thing very perfectly in readiness let it come when it would this resolution be hardly act upon when the news reach we that the general have arrive at louisville and be expect at cincinnatus in a few hour all be bustle and hurry at mohawk-cottage we quickly dispatch we packing business and this be the first opportunity we have have of witness such a demonstration of popular feeling we all determine to be present at the debarkation of the great man we accordingly walk to cincinnatus and secure a favourable station at the landing-place both for the purpose of see the first magistrate and of observe he reception by the people we have wait but a few moment when the heavy panting of the steam engine and then a discharge of cannon tell that we be just in time another moment bring he vessel in sight nothing could be better of its kind than he approach to the shore : the noble steam-boat which convey he be flank on each side by one of nearly equal size and splendor the roof of all three be cover by a crowd of man cannon salute they from the shore as they pass by to the distance of a quarter of a mile above the town there they turn about and come down the river with a rapid but stately motion the three vessel so close together as to appear one mighty mass upon the water when they arrive opposite the principal landing they sweep gracefully round and the side vessel separate themselves from the center fall a few foot back permit she to approach before they with she honor freight all this manoeuvring be extremely well execute and really beautiful the crowd on the shore await she arrival in perfect stillness when she touch the bank the people on board give a faint huzza but it be answer by no note of welcome from the land : this cold silence be certainly not produce by any want of friendly feeling towards the new president during the whole of the canvassing he have be decidedly the popular candidate at cincinnatus and for month past we have be accustom to the cry of jackson for ever from a overwhelming majority but enthusiasm be not either the virtue or the vice of america more than one private carriage be station at the water 's edge to await the general 's order but they be dismiss with the information that he would walk to the hotel upon receive this intimation the silent crowd divide itself in a very orderly manner leave a space for he to walk through they he do so uncovered though the distance be considerable and the weather very cold but he alone -lrb- with the exception of a few european gentleman who be present -rrb- be without a hat he wear he gray hair carelessly but not ungracefully arrange and spite of he harsh gaunt feature he look like a gentleman and a soldier he be in deep mourning have very recently lose he wife they be say to have be very happy together and i be pained by hear a voice near I exclaim as he approach the spot where i stand there go jackson where be he wife another sharp voice at a little distance cry adam for ever and these sound be all i hear to break the silence they manage these matter better in the east i have no doubt but as yet i be still in the west and still incline to think that however meritorious the american character may be it be not amiable mr t and he son join the group of citizen who wait upon he to the hotel and be present to the president in form that be they shake hand with he learn that he intend to remain a few hour there or more properly that it would be a few hour before the steam-boat would be ready to proceed mr t secure berth on board and return to take a hasty dinner with we at the hour appoint by the captain mr t and he son accompany the general on board and by subsequent letter i learn that they have converse a good deal with he and be please by he conversation and manners but deeply disgusted by the brutal familiarity to which they see he expose at every place on they progress at which they stop i be tempt to quote one passage as sufficiently descriptive of the manner which so painfully grate against they european feeling ` there be not a hulk boy from a keel-boat who be not introduce to the president unless indeed as be the case with some they introduce themselves : for instance i be at he elbow when a greasy fellow accost he thus : - general jackson i guess ` the general bow assent why they tell I you be dead no providence have hitherto preserved my life and be you wife alive too ` the general apparently much hurt signify the contrary upon which the courtier conclude he harangue by say aye i think it be the one or the t ` other of ye ' chapter 14 american spring -- controversy between messr owen and cambell -- public ball -- separation of the sex -- american freedom -- execution the american spring be by no means so agreeable as the american autumn both move with faultering step and slow but this linger pace which be delicious in autumn be most torment in the spring in the one case you be about to part with a friend who be become more gentle and agreeable at every step and such step can hardly be make too slowly but in the other you be make you escape from a dreary cavern where you have be shut up with black frost and bite blast and where you best consolation be be smoke-dried but upon second thought i believe it would be more correct instead of complain of the slow pace of the american spring to declare that they have no spring at all the beautiful autumn often linger on till christmas after which winter can be trifle with no longer and generally keep a stubborn hold through the month which we call spring when he suddenly turn he back and summer take he place the inconceivable uncertainty of the climate be however such that i will not venture to state about what time this change take place for it be certain that let I name what time i would it would be easy for any weather journaliser to prove I wrong by quote that the thermometer be at 100 at a period which my statement include in the winter or 50 long after i make the summer commence the climate of england be call uncertain but it can never i think be so describe by any who have experience that of the united state a gentleman on whose accuracy i could depend tell I he have repeatedly know the thermometer vary above 40 degree in the space of twelve hour this most unpleasant caprice of the temperature be i conceive one cause of the unhealthiness of the climate at length however after shiver and shake till we be tire of it and have be half ruin in fire-wood -lrb- which by the way be nearly as dear as at paris and dearer in many part of the union -rrb- the summer burst upon we full blow and the ice-house the piazza and the jalousy be again in full requisition it be in the early summer of this year -lrb- 1829 -rrb- that cincinnatus offer a spectacle unprecedented i believe in any age or country mr owen of lanark of new harmony of texa well know to the world by all or either of these addition have challenge the whole religious public of the united state to discuss with he publicly the truth or falsehood of all the religion that have ever be propagate on the face of the earth state further that he undertake to prove that they be all equally false and nearly equally mischievous this most appalling challenge be convey to the world through the medium of new orlean newspaper and for some time it remain unanswered at length the reverend alexander campbell from bethany -lrb- not of judaea but of kentucky -rrb- proclaim through the same medium that he be ready to take up the gauntlet the place fix for this extraordinary discussion be cincinnati the time the second Monday in may 1829 be about a year from the time the challenge be accept thus give the disputant time to prepare themselves mr owen 's preparation however could only have be such as those who run may read for during the interval he traverse great part of north america cross the atlantic twice visit england scotland mexico texa and i know not how many place besides mr campbell i be tell pass this period very differently be engage in read with great research and perseverance all the theological work within he reach but whatever confidence the learning and piety of mr campbell might have inspire in he friend or in the cincinnatus christian in general it be not as it appear sufficient to induce mr wilson the presbyterian minister of the largest church in the town to permit the display of they within its wall this refusal be greatly reprobate and much regret as the curiosity to hear the discussion be very general and no other edifice offer so much accommodation a methodist meeting-house large enough to contain a thousand person be at last choose a small stage be arrange round the pulpit large enough to accommodate the disputant and they stenographer the pulpit itself be throughout the whole time occupy by the aged father of mr campbell whose flow white hair and venerable countenance constantly expressive of the deepest attention and the most profound interest make he a very striking figure in the group another platform be raise in a conspicuous part of the building on which be seat seven gentleman of the city select as moderator the chapel be equally divide one half be appropriate to lady the other to gentleman and the door of entrance reserve for the lady be carefully guard by person appoint to prevent any crowding or difficulty from impede they approach i suspect that the lady be indebted to mr owen for this attention the arrangement respect they on this occasion be by no means american when mr owen rise the building be throng in every part the audience or congregation -lrb- i hardly know which to call they -rrb- be of the highest rank of citizen and as large a proportion of best bonnet flutter there as the two horn church itself could boast it be in the profoundest silence and apparently with the deepest attention that mr owen 's opening address be receive and surely it be the most singular one that ever christian man and woman sit to listen to when i recollect its object and the uncompromising manner in which the orator state he mature conviction that the whole history of the christian mission be a fraud and its sacred origin a fable i can not but wonder that it be so listen to yet at the time i feel no such wonder never do any one practice the _ suaviter in modo _ with more powerful effect than mr owen the gentle tone of he voice he mild sometimes playful but never ironical manner the absence of every vehement or harsh expression the affectionate interest express for the whole human family the air of candor with which he express he wish to be convince he be wrong if he indeed be so -- he kind smile -- the mild expression of he eye -- in short he whole manner disarm zeal and produce a degree of tolerance that those who do not hear he would hardly believe possible half a hour be the time allot for each haranguer when this be expire the moderator be see to look at they watch mr owen too look at he -lrb- without pause -rrb- smile shake he head and say in a parenthesis a moment 's patience and continue for nearly another half hour mr campbell then arise he person voice and manner all greatly in he favor in he first attack he use the arm which in general have be consider as belong to the other side of the question he quiz mr owen most unmercifully pinch he here for he parallelogram hit he there for he human perfectibility and keep the whole audience in a roar of laughter mr owen join in it most heartily himself and listen to he throughout with the air of a man who be delighted at the good thing he be hear and exactly in the cue to enjoy all the other good thing that he be sure will follow mr campbell 's watch be the only one which remind we that we have listen to he for half a hour and have continue speak for a few minute after he have look at it he sit down with i should think the universal admiration of he auditory mr owen again address we and he first five minute be occupy in compliment mr campbell with all the strength he exceed hearty laughter have leave he but then he change he tone and say the business be too serious to permit the next half hour to pass so lightly and so pleasantly as the last and then he read we what he call he twelve fundamental law of human nature these twelve law he have take so much trouble to circulate to all the nation of the earth that it must be quite unnecessary to repeat they here to I they appear twelve truism that no man in he sens would ever think of contradict but how any one can have conceive that the explanation and defense of these law could furnish forth occupation for he pen and he voice through whole year of unwearying declamation or how he can have dream that they could be twist into a refutation of the christian religion be a mystery which i never expect to understand from this time mr owen entrenched himself behind he twelve law and mr campbell with equal gravity confine himself to bring forward the most elaborate theological authority in evidence of the truth of reveal religion neither appear to I to answer the other but to confine themselves to the utterance of what they have uppermost in they own mind when the discussion begin i lament this on the side of mr campbell as i be persuade he would have be much more powerful have he trust more to himself and less to he book mr owen be a extraordinary man and certainly possess of talent but he appear to I so utterly benighted in the mist of he own theory that he have quite lose the power of look through they so as to get a peep at the world as it really exist around he at the conclusion of the debate -lrb- which last for fifteen sitting -rrb- mr campbell desire the whole assembly to sit down they obey he then request all who wish well to christianity to rise and a very large majority be in a instant on they leg he again request they to be seat and then desire those who believe not in its doctrine to rise and a few gentleman and one lady obey mr owen protest against this maneuver as he call it and refuse to believe that it afford any proof of the state of man 's mind or of woman 's either declare that not only be such a result to be expect in the present state of thing but that it be the duty of every man who have child to feed not to hazard the sale of he hog or he iron by a declaration of opinion which might offend the majority of he customer it be say that at the end of the fifteen meeting the numerical amount of the christian and the infidel of cincinnatus remain exactly what it be when they begin this be a result that might have be perhaps anticipate but what be much less to have be expect neither of the disputant ever appear to lose they temper i be tell they be much in each other 's company constantly dine together and on all occasion express most cordially they mutual esteem all this i think could only have happen in america i be not quite sure that it be very desirable it should have happen any where in note the various brilliant event which diversify we residence in the western metropolis i have omit to mention the birthday ball as it be call a festivity which i believe have place on the 22nd of February in every town and city throughout the union it be the anniversary of the birth of general washington and well deserve to be mark by the american as a day of jubilee i be really astonish at the _ coup d'oeil _ on enter for i see a large room fill with extremely well-dressed company among whom be many very beautiful girl the gentleman also be exceedingly smart but i have not yet be long enough in western america not to feel startle at recognize in almost every full-dressed _ beau _ that pass I the master or shopman that i have be use to see behind the counter or lolling at the door of every shop in the city the fairest and finest belle smile and smirk on they with as much zeal and satisfaction as i ever see bestow on a eldest son and i therefore could feel no doubt of they be consider as of the highest rank yet it must not be suppose that there be no distinction of class : at this same ball i be look among the many very beautiful girl i see there for one more beautiful still with whose lovely face i have be particularly strike at the school examination i have mention i could not find she and ask a gentleman why the beautiful miss c be not there you do not yet understand we aristocracy he reply the family of miss c be mechanic but the young lady have be educate at the same school as these whom i see here and i know she brother have a shop in the town quite as large and apparently as prosperous as those belong to any of these young man what be the difference he be a mechanic he assist in make the article he sell the other call themselves merchant the dancing be not quite like yet not very unlike what we see at a assize or race-ball in a country town they call they dance cotillion instead of quadrille and the figure be call from the orchestra in english which have very ludicrous effect on european ear the arrangement for the supper be very singular but eminently characteristic of the country the gentleman have a splendid entertainment spread for they in another large room of the hotel while the poor lady have each a plate put into they hand as they pensively promenade the ballroom during they absence and shortly afterwards servant appear bear tray of sweetmeat cake and cream the fair creature then sit down on a row of chair place round the wall and each make a table of she knee begin eat she sweet but sad and sulky repast the effect be extremely comic they gala dress and the decorate room form a contrast the most unaccountable with they uncomfortable and forlorn condition this arrangement be owe neither to economy nor want of a room large enough to accommodate the whole party but purely because the gentleman like it better this be the answer give I when my curiosity tempt I to ask why the lady and gentleman do not sup together and this be the answer repeat to I afterwards by a variety of people to whom i put the same question i be lead to mention this feature of american manners very frequently not only because it constantly recur but because i consider it as be in a great degree the cause of that universal deficiency in good manners and graceful demeanor both in man and woman which be so remarkable where there be no court which every where else be the glass wherein the higher order dress themselves and which again reflect from they to the class below go far towards polish in some degree a great majority of the population it be not to be expect that manner should be make so much a study or should attain a equal degree of elegance but the deficiency and the total difference be greater than this cause alone could account for the hour of enjoyment be important to human being every where and we every where find they prepare to make the most of they those who enjoy themselves only in society whether intellectual or convivial prepare themselves for it and such make but a poor figure when force to be content with the sweet of solitude : while on the other hand those to whom retirement afford the greatest pleasure seldom give or receive much in society wherever the highest enjoyment be find by both sex in scene where they meet each other both will prepare themselves to appear with advantage there the man will not indulge in the luxury of chew tobacco or even of spit and the woman will contrive to be capable of hold a higher post than that of unwearied tea-maker in america with the exception of dancing which be almost wholly confine to the unmarried of both sex all the enjoyment of the man be find in the absence of the woman they dine they play card they have musical meeting they have supper all in large party but all without woman be it not that such be the custom it be impossible but that they would have ingenuity enough to find some expedient for spare the wife and daughter of the opulent the sordid office of household drudgery which they almost all perform in they family even in the slave state though they may not clear-starch and iron mix pudding and cake one half of the day and watch they bake the other half still the very highest occupy themselves in they household concern in a manner that preclude the possibility of they become elegant and enlighten companion in baltimore philadelphium and new york i meet with some exception to this but speaking of the country generally it be unquestionably true have i not become heartily tire of my prolonged residence in a place i cordially dislike and which moreover i begin to fear would not be attend with the favourable result we have anticipate i should have find a almost inexhaustible source of amusement in the notion and opinion of the people i converse with and as it be i often do enjoy this in a considerable degree we receive as i have mention much personal kindness but this by no means interfere with the national feeling of i believe unconquerable dislike which evidently live at the bottom of every truly american heart against the english this show itself in a thousand little way even in the midst of the most kind and friendly intercourse but often in a manner more comic than offensive sometimes it be thus -- well now i think you government must just be fit to hang themselves for that last war they cook up it have be the ruin of you i expect for it have just be the making of we then -- well i do begin to understand you broken english better than i do but no wonder i could not make it out very well at first as you come from london for every body know that london slang be the most dreadful in the world how queer it be now that all the people that live in london should put the _ h _ where it be not and never will put it where it be i be egotistical enough to ask the lady who say this if she find that i do so no you do not be the reply but she add with a complacent smile it be easy enough to see the pain you take about it : i expect you have hear how we american laugh at you all for it and so you be try to learn we way of pronounce one lady ask I very gravely if we have leave home in order to get rid of the vermin with which the english of all rank be afflict i have hear from unquestionable authority she add that it be quite impossible to walk through the street of london without have the head fill i laugh a little but speak not a word she color highly and say there be nothing so easy as to laugh but truth be truth laugh at or not i must preface the follow anecdote by observe that in america nearly the whole of the insect tribe be class under the general name of bug the unfortunate cosmopolite know by that name amongst we be almost the only one not include in this term a lady abruptly address I with do not you hate chintz mr trollope no indeed i reply i think they very pretty there now if that be not be english i reckon you call that loving you country well thank god we american have something better to love we country for than that come to we be not oblige to say that we like nasty filthy chintz to shew that we be good patriot chintz what be chintz possible do you pretend you do not know what chintz be why the nasty little stinking blood-sucker that all the bed in london be full of i have since be inform that _ chinche _ be spanish for bug but at the time the word suggest only the material of a curtain among other instance of that species of modesty so often see in america and so unknown to we i frequently witness one which while it evince the delicacy of the lady give opportunity for many lively sally from the gentleman i see the same sort of thing repeat on different occasion at least a dozen time eg a young lady be employ in make a shirt -lrb- which it would be a symptom of absolute depravity to name -rrb- a gentleman enter and presently begin the sprightly dialogue with what be you make miss clarissa only a frock for my sister 's doll sir a frock not possible do not i see that it be not a frock come miss clarissa what be it ti just a apron for one of we negro mr smith how can you miss clarissa why be not the two side join together i expect you be better tell I what it be my why then mr smith it be just a pillow-case now that pass miss clarissa ` tis a pillow-case for a giant then shall i guess miss quit mr smith behave yourself or i 'll certainly be affront before the conversation arrive at this point both gentleman and lady be in convulsion of laughter i once see a young lady so hard drive by a wit that to prove she be make a bag and nothing but a bag she sew up the end before he eye shew it triumphantly and exclaim there now what can you say to that one of my friend startle I one day by say in a affectionate but rather compassionate tone how will you bear to go back to england to live and to bring up you child in a country where you know you be consider as no better than the dirt in the street i begged she would explain why you know i would not affront you for any thing but the fact be we american know rather more than you think for and certainly if i be in england i should not think of associate with anything but lord i have always be among the first here and if i travel i should like to do the same i do not mean i be sure that i would not come to see you but you know you be not lord and therefore i know very well how you be treat in you own country i very rarely contradict statement of this kind as i find it less trouble and infinitely more amusing to let they pass indeed have i do otherwise it would have be of little avail as among the many conversation i hold in america respect my own country i do not recollect a single instance in which it be not clear that i know much less about it than those i converse with on the subject of national glory i presume i get more than my share of buffet for be a woman there be no objection to they speak out one lady indeed who be a great patriot evince much delicacy towards I for upon some one speaking of new orlean she interrupt they say i wish you would not talk of new orlean and turn to I add with great gentleness it must be so painful to you feeling to hear that place mention the immense superiority of the american to the british navy be a constant theme and to this i always listen as nearly as possible in silence i repeatedly hear it state -lrb- so often indeed and from such various quarter that i think there must be some truth in it -rrb- that the american sailor fire with a certainty of slaughter whereas we shot be send very nearly at random this say a naval officer of high reputation be the bless effect of you game law you sailor never fire at a mark whilst we free tar from they practice in pursuit of game can any of they split a hair but the favorite the constant the universal sneer that meet I every where be on we old-fashioned attachment to thing obsolete have they a little wit among they i be certain they would have give we the cognomen of my grandmother the british for that be the tone they take and it be thus they reconcile themselves to the crude newness of every thing around they i wonder you be not sick of king chancellor and archbishop and all you fustian of wig and gown say a very clever gentleman to I once with a affected yawn i protest the very sound almost set I to sleep it be amusing to observe how soothing the idea seem that they be more modern more advanced than england we classic literature we princely dignity we noble institution be all gone-by relic of the dark age this and the vastness of they naked territory make up the flattering unction which be lay upon the soul as a antidote to the little misgiving which from time to time arise lest they large country be not of quite so much importance among the nation as a certain paltry old-fashioned little place that they wot of i be once sit with a party of lady among whom be one or two young girl whose curiosity be greater than they patriotism and they ask I many question respect the splendor and extent of london i be endeavor to satisfy they by the best description i could give when we be interrupt by another lady who exclaim do hold you tongue girl about london if you want to know what a beautiful city be look at philadelphium when mr trollope have be there i think she will allow that it be better worth talk about than that great overgrown collection of nasty filthy dirty street that they call london once in ohio and once in the district of columbium i have a atla display before I that i might be convince by the evidence of my own eye what a very contemptible little country i come from i shall never forget the gravity with which on the latter occasion a gentleman draw out he graduate pencil-case and shew I past contradiction that the whole of the british dominion do not equal in size one of they least important state nor the air with which after the demonstration he place he foot upon the chimney-piece considerably higher than he head and whistle yankee doodle they glorious institution they unequalled freedom be of course not leave unsung i take some pain to ascertain what they mean by they glorious institution and it be with no affectation of ignorance that i profess i never could comprehend the meaning of the phrase which be however on the lip of every american when he talk of he country i ask if by they institution they mean they hospital and penitentiary oh no we mean the glorious institution which be coeval with the revolution be it i ask you institution of marriage which you have make purely a civil and not a religious rite to be perform by a justice of peace instead of a clergyman oh no we speak of we divine political institution yet still i be in the dark nor can i guess what they mean unless they call incessant electioneering without pause or interval for a single day for a single hour of they whole existence a glorious institution they unequalled freedom i think i understand better they code of common law be build upon ours and the difference between we be this in england the law be act upon in america they be not i do not speak of the police of the atlantic city i believe it be well arrange : in new york it be celebrate for be so but out of the range of they influence the contempt of law be greater than i can venture to state with any hope of be believe trespass assault robbery nay even murder be often commit without the slightest attempt at legal interference during the summer that we pass most delightfully in maryland we ramble be often restrain in various direction by the advice of we kind friend who know the manners and moral of the country when we ask the cause we be tell there be a public-house on that road and it will not be safe to pass it the line of the chesapeak and ohio canal pass within a few mile of mr s -- 's residence it twice happen during we stay with she that dead body be find partially conceal near it the circumstance be relate as a sort of half hour 's wonder and when i ask particulars of those who on one occasion bring the tale the reply be oh he be murder i expect or maybe he die of the canal fever but they say he have mark of be throttle no inquest be summon and certainly no more sensation be produce by the occurrence than if a sheep have be find in the same predicament the abundance of food and the scarcity of hanging be also favorite topic as prove they superiority to england they be both excellent thing but i do not admit the inference a wide and most fertile territory as yet but thinly inhabit may easily be make to yield abundant food for its population : and where a desperate villain know that when he have make he town or he village too hot to hold he he have nothing to do but to travel a few mile west and be sure of find plenty of beef and whiskey with no danger that the law shall follow he it be not extraordinary that execution should be rare once during we residence at cincinnatus a murderer of uncommon atrocity be take try convict and condemn to death it have be shew on he trial that some year before he have murder a wife and child at new orlean but little notice have be take of it at the time the crime which have now throw he into the hand of justice be the recent murder of a second wife and the chief evidence against he be he own son the day of he execution be fix and the sensation produce be so great from the strangeness of the occurrence -lrb- no white man have ever be execute at cincinnatus -rrb- that person from sixty mile ' distance come to be present at it meanwhile some unco ' good people begin to start doubt as to the righteousness of hang a man and make application to the governor of the state \* of ohio to commute the sentence into imprisonment the governor for some time refuse to interfere with the sentence of the tribunal before which he have be try but at length frighten at the unusual situation in which he find himself he yield to the importunity of the presbyterian party who have assail he and send off a order to the sheriff accordingly but this order be not to reprieve he but to ask he if he please to be reprieve and send to the penitentiary instead of be hang \* -lrb- the governor of state have the same power over life and -lrb- death as be vest with we in the crown the sheriff wait upon the criminal and make he proposal and be answer if any thing could make I agree to it it would be the hope of live long enough to kill you and my dog of a son : however i will not agree you shall have the hanging of I the worthy sheriff to whom the ghastly office of executioner be assign say all in he power to persuade he to sign the offer document but in vain he obtain nothing but abuse for he effort the day of execution arrive the place appoint be the side of a hill the only one clear of tree near the town and many hour before the time fix we see it entirely cover by a immense multitude of man woman and child at length the hour arrive the dismal cart be see slowly mount the hill the noisy throng be hush into solemn silence the wretched criminal mount the scaffold when again the sheriff ask he to sign he acceptance of the commutation propose but he spurn the paper from he and cry aloud hang I midday be the moment appoint for cut the rope the sheriff stand he watch in one hand and a knife in the other the hand be lift to strike when the criminal stoutly exclaim i sign and he be convey back to prison amidst the shout laughter and ribaldry of the mob i be not fond of hang but there be something in all this that do not look like the decent dignity of wholesome justice chapter 15 camp-meeting it be in the course of this summer that i find the opportunity i have long wish for of attend a camp-meeting and i gladly accept the invitation of a english lady and gentleman to accompany they in they carriage to the spot where it be hold this be in a wild district on the confines of indiana the prospect of pass a night in the back wood of indiana be by no means agreeable but i screw my courage to the proper pitch and set forth determine to see with my own eye and hear with my own ear what a camp-meeting really be i have hear it say that be at a camp-meeting be like stand at the gate of heaven and see it open before you i have hear it say that be at a camp-meeting be like find yourself within the gate of hell in either case there must be something to gratify curiosity and compensate one for the fatigue of a long rumble ride and a sleepless night we reach the ground about a hour before midnight and the approach to it be highly picturesque the spot choose be the verge of a unbroken forest where a space of about twenty acre appear to have be partially clear for the purpose tent of different size be pitch very near together in a circle round the clear space behind they be range a exterior circle of carriage of every description and at the back of each be fasten the horse which have draw they thither through this triple circle of defense we distinguish numerous fire burn brightly within it and still more numerous light flicker from the tree that be leave in the enclosure the moon be in meridian splendor above we head we leave the carriage to the care of a servant who be to prepare a bed in it for mr b and I and enter the inner circle the first glance remind I of vauxhall from the effect of the light among the tree and the move crowd below they but the second shew a scene totally unlike any thing i have ever witness four high frame construct in the form of altar be place at the four corner of the enclosure on these be support layer of earth and sod on which burn immense fire of blaze pinewood on one side a rude platform be erect to accommodate the preacher fifteen of whom attend this meeting and with very short interval for necessary refreshment and private devotion preach in rotation day and night from Tuesday to Saturday when we arrive the preacher be silent but we hear issue from nearly every tent mingle sound of pray preach singing and lamentation the curtain in front of each tent be drop and the faint light that gleam through the white drapery back as it be by the dark forest have a beautiful and mysterious effect that set the imagination at work and have the sound which vibrate around we be less discordant harsh and unnatural i should have enjoy it but listen at the corner of a tent which pour forth more than its proportion of clamor in a few moment chase every feeling derive from imagination and furnished reality that could neither be mistaken or forget great number of person be walk about the ground who appear like ourselves to be present only as spectator some of these very unceremoniously contrived to raise the drapery of this tent at one comer so as to afford we a perfect view of the interior the floor be cover with straw which round the side be heap in mass that might serve as seat but which at that moment be use to support the head and the arm of the close-packed circle of man and woman who kneel on the floor out of about thirty person thus place perhaps half a dozen be man one of these a handsome look youth of eighteen or twenty kneel just below the opening through which i look he arm be encircle the neck of a young girl who kneel beside he with she hair hang dishevelled upon she shoulder and she feature work with the most violent agitation soon after they both fall forward on the straw as if unable to endure in any other attitude the burning eloquence of a tall grim figure in black who stand erect in the center be utter with incredible vehemence a oration that seem to hover between pray and preach he arm hang stiff and immoveable by he side and he look like a ill-constructed machine set in action by a movement so violent as to threaten its own destruction so jerkingly painfully yet rapidly do he word tumble out the kneel circle cease not to call in every variety of tone on the name of jesus accompany with sob groan and a sort of low howling inexpressibly painful to listen to but my attention be speedily withdraw from the preacher and the circle round he by a figure which kneel alone at some distance it be a living image of scott 's macbriar as young as wild and as terrible he thin arm toss above he head have force themselves so far out of the sleeve that they be bare to the elbow he large eye glare frightfully and he continue to scream without a instant 's intermission the word glory with a violence that seem to swell every vein to burst it be too dreadful to look upon long and we turn away shudder we make the circuit of the tent pause where attention be particularly excite by sound more vehement than ordinary we contrived to look into many all be strew with straw and the distorted figure that we see kneel sit and lie amongst it join to the woeful and convulsive cry give to each the air of a cell in bedlam one tent be occupy exclusively by negro they be all full-dressed and look exactly as if they be perform a scene on the stage one woman wear a dress of pink gauze trim with silver lace another be dress in pale yellow silk one or two have splendid turban and all wear a profusion of ornament the man be in snow white pantaloons with gay color linen jacket one of these a youth of coal-black comeliness be preach with the most violent gesticulation frequently spring high from the ground and clap he hand over he head could we missionary society have hear the trash he utter by way of a address to the deity they might perhaps have doubt whether he conversion have much enlighten he mind at midnight a horn sound through the camp which we be tell be to call the people from private to public worship and we presently see they flock from all side to the front of the preacher ' stand mr b and i contrived to place ourselves with we back support against the lower part of this structure and we be thus enable to witness the scene which follow without personal danger there be about two thousand person assemble one of the preacher begin in a low nasal tone and like all other methodist preacher assure we of the enormous depravity of man as he come from the hand of he maker and of he perfect sanctification after he have wrestle sufficiently with the lord to get hold of he _ et cetera _ the admiration of the crowd be evince by almost constant cry of aman aman jesus jesus glory glory and the like but this comparative tranquility do not last long : the preacher tell they that this night be the time fix upon for anxious sinner to wrestle with the lord that he and he brethren be at hand to help they and that such as need they help be to come forward into the pen the phrase forcibly recall milton 's line -- blind mouth that scarce themselves know how to hold a sheep-hook or have learn aught else the least that to the faithful herdsman 's art belong -- but when they list they lean and flashy song grate on they scrannel pipe of wretched straw -- the hungry sheep look up and be not feed but swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw rot inwardly -- and foul contagion spread the pen be the space immediately below the preacher ' stand we be therefore place on the edge of it and be enable to see and hear all that take place in the very center of this extraordinary exhibition the crowd fall back at the mention of the _ pen _ and for some minute there be a vacant space before we the preacher come down from they stand and place themselves in the midst of it begin to sing a hymn call upon the penitent to come forth as they sing they keep turn themselves round to every part of the crowd and by degree the voice of the whole multitude join in chorus this be the only moment at which i perceive any thing like the solemn and beautiful effect which i have hear ascribe to this woodland worship it be certain that the combined voice of such a multitude hear at dead of night from the depths of they eternal forest the many fair young face turn upward and look paler and lovelier as they meet the moon-beam the dark figure of the official in the middle of the circle the lurid glare throw by the altar-fire on the wood beyond do altogether produce a fine and solemn effect that i shall not easily forget but ere i have well enjoy it the scene change and sublimity give place to horror and disgust the exhortation nearly resemble that which i have hear at the revival but the result be very different for instead of the few hysterical woman who have distinguish themselves on that occasion above a hundred person nearly all female come forward utter howling and groan so terrible that i shall never cease to shudder when i recall they they appear to drag each other forward and on the word be give let we pray they all fall on they knee but this posture be soon change for other that permit greater scope for the convulsive movement of they limb and they be soon all lie on the ground in a indescribable confusion of head and leg they throw about they limb with such incessant and violent motion that i be every instant expect some serious accident to occur but how be i to describe the sound that proceed from this strange mass of human being i know no word which can convey a idea of it hysterical sobbing convulsive groan shriek and scream the most appalling burst forth on all side i feel sick with horror as if they hoarse and over strained voice fail to make noise enough they soon begin to clap they hand violently the scene describe by dante be before I : - quivi sospiri pianti ed alti guai risonavon per l'aere -- -- orribili favelle parole di dolore accenti d'ira voci alti e floche e suon di man con elle many of these wretched creature be beautiful young female the preacher move about among they at once exciting and soothing they agony i hear the muttered sister dear sister i see the insidious lip approach the cheek of the unhappy girl i hear the murmured confession of the poor victim and i watch they tormentor breathe into they ear consolation that tinge the pale cheek with red have i be a man i be sure i should have be guilty of some rash act of interference nor do i believe that such a scene could have be act in the presence of englishman without instant punishment be inflict not to mention the salutary discipline of the treadmill which beyond all question would in england have be apply to check so turbulent and so vicious a scene after the first wild burst that follow they prostration the meaning in many instance become loudly articulate and i then experience a strange vibration between tragic and comic feeling a very pretty girl who be kneel in the attitude of canova 's magdalene immediately before we amongst a immense quantity of jargon break out thus : woe woe to the backslider hear it hear it jesus when i be fifteen my mother die and i backslided oh jesus i backslided take I home to my mother jesus take I home to she for i be weary oh john mitchel john mitchel and after sob piteously behind she raise hand she lift she sweet face again which be as pale as death and say shall i sit on the sunny bank of salvation with my mother my own dear mother oh jesus take I home take I home who could refuse a tear to this earnest wish for death in one so young and so lovely but i see she ere i leave the ground with she hand fast lock and she head support by a man who look very much as don juan might when send back to earth as too bad for the region below one woman near we continue to call on the lord as it be term in the loudest possible tone and without a moment 's interval for the two hour that we keep we dreadful station she become frightfully hoarse and she face so red as to make I expect she would burst a blood-vessel among the rest of she rant she say i will hold fast to jesus i never will let he go if they take I to hell i will still hold he fast fast fast the stunning noise be sometimes vary by the preacher begin to sing but the convulsive movement of the poor maniac only become more violent at length the atrocious wickedness of this horrible scene increase to a degree of grossness that drive we from we station we return to the carriage at about three o'clock in the morning and pass the remainder of the night in listen to the ever increase tumult at the pen to sleep be impossible at daybreak the horn again sound to send they to private devotion and in about a hour afterwards i see the whole camp as joyously and eagerly employ in prepare and devour they most substantial breakfast as if the night have be pass in dancing and i mark many a fair but pale face that i recognize as a demoniac of the night simper beside a swain to whom she carefully administer hot coffee and egg the preach saint and the howling sinner seem alike to relish this mode of recruit they strength after enjoy abundance of strong tea which prove a delightful restorative after a night so strangely spend i wander alone into the forest and i never remember to have find perfect quiet more delightful we soon after leave the ground but before we departure we learn that a very _ satisfactory _ collection have be make by the preacher for bible tract and _ all other religious purpose _ chapter 16 danger of rural excursion -- sickness it be by no means easy to enjoy the beauty of american scenery in the west even when you be in a neighborhood that afford much to admire at least in do so you run considerable risk of injure you health nothing be consider more dangerous than exposure to midday heat except exposure to evening damp and the twilight be so short that if you set out on a expedition when the fervid heat subside you can hardly get half a mile before sun down as they call it warn you that you must run or drive home again as fast as possible for fear you should get a chill i believe we brave all this more than any one else in the whole country and if we have not we should have leave cincinnatus without see any thing of the country around it though we keep steadily to we resolution of pass no more sylvan hour in the forest of ohio we often spend entire day in kentucky trace the course of a creek or climb the highest point within we reach in the hope of catch a glimpse of some distant object a beautiful reach of the ohio or the dark winding of the pretty lick be indeed always the most remarkable feature in the landscape there be one spot however so beautiful that we visit it again and again it be by no means free from mosquito and be on the bank of a stream with many enormous tree lie on the half-cleared ground around it be just such a place as we have be tell a hundred time be particularly dangerous nevertheless we dare every thing for the sake of dining beside we beautiful ripple stream and watch the bright sunbeam dance on the grassy bank at such a distance from we retreat that they could not heat we a little below the basin that cool we wine be a cascade of sufficient dimension to give we all the music of a waterfall and all the sparkling brightness of clear water when it be break again and again by jut crag to sit beside this miniature cascade and read or dream away a day be one of we greatest pleasure it be indeed a mortifying fact that whenever we find out a picturesque nook where turf and moss and deep shade and a crystal stream and fall tree majestic in they ruin tempt we to sit down and be very cool and very happy we invariably find that that spot lay under the imputation of malaria a row upon the ohio be another of we favorite amusement but in this i believe we be also very singular for often when enjoy it we be shout at by the young free-born on the bank as if we have be so many monster the only rural amusement in which we ever see any of the native engage be eat strawberry and cream in a pretty garden about three mile from the town here we actually meet three or four carriage a degree of dissipation that i never witness on any other occasion the strawberry be tolerable strawberry but the cream be the vilest sky-blue and the charge half a dollar to each person which be about the price of half a fat sheep i think pretty considerable much if i may be permit to use a expressive phrase of the country we have repeatedly be tell by those who know the land that the _ second summer _ be the great trial to the health of european settle in america but we have now reach the middle of we second August and with the exception of the fever one of my son have suffer from the summer after we arrival we have all enjoy perfect health but i be now doom to feel the truth of the above prediction for before the end of August i fall low before the monster that be for ever stalk through that land of lake and river breathe fever and death around it be nine week before i leave my room and when i do i look more fit to walk into the potter 's field -lrb- as they call the english bury ground -rrb- than any where else long after my general health be pretty well restore i suffer from the effect of the fever in my limb and lay in bed reading several week after i have be pronounced convalescent several american novel be bring I mr flint 's franci berrian be excellent a little wild and romantic but contain scene of first-rate interest and pathos hope leslie and redwood by miss sedgewick a american lady have both great merit and i now first read the whole of mr cooper 's novel by the time these american study be complete i never close my eye without see myriad of bloody scalp float round I long slender figure of red indian creep through my dream with noiseless tread panther flare forest blaze and which ever way i flee a light foot a keen eye and a long rifle be sure to be on my trail a additional ounce of calomel hardly suffice to neutralize the effect of these raw-head and bloody-bones adventure i be advise to plunge immediately into a course of fashionable novel it be a great relief to I but as my head be by no means very clear i sometimes jumbled strangely together the civilized rogue and assassin of mr bulwer and the wild man woman and child slayer of mr cooper and truly between they i pass my dream in very bad company still i could not stand nor even sit upright what be i to read next a happy thought strike I i determine upon begin with waverley and reading through -lrb- not for the first time certainly -rrb- the whole series and what a world do i enter upon the wholesome vigor of every page seem to communicate itself to my nerve i cease to be languid and fretful and though still a cripple i certainly enjoy myself most completely as long as my treat last but this be a shorter time than any one would believe who have not find how such volume melt before the constant reading of a long idle day when it be over however i have the pleasure of finding that i could walk half a dozen yard at a time and take short airing in a open carriage and better still could sleep quietly it be no very agreeable conviction which greet my recovery that we cincinnatus speculation for my son would in no way answer we expectation and very soon after he be again seize with the bilious fever of the country which terminate in that most distressing of all malady a ague i never witness be effect before and therefore make my self extremely miserable at what those around I consider of no consequence i believe this frightful complaint be not immediately dangerous but i never can believe that the violent and sudden prostration of strength the dreadfully convulsive movement which distort the limb the livid hue that spread itself over the complexion can take place without shake the seat of health and life repeatedly we think the malady cure and for a few day the poor sufferer believe himself restore to health and strength but again and again it return upon he and he begin to give himself up as the victim of ill health my own health be still very infirm and it take but little time to decide that we must leave cincinnati the only impediment to this be the fear that mr trollope who be to join we in the spring might have set out and thus arrive at cincinnatus after we have leave it however as the time he have talk of leave england be later in the season i decide upon run the risk but the winter have set in with great severity and the river be freeze the steam-boat could not run the frost continue unbroken through the whole of February and we be almost weary of wait for its departure which be to be the signal of ours the break up of the ice on the lick and ohio form a most striking spectacle at night the river present a solid surface of ice but in the morning it shew a collection of float iceberg of every imaginable size and form whirling against each other with frightful violence and with a noise unlike any sound i remember this sight be a very welcome one as it give we hope of immediate departure but my courage fail when i hear that one or two steam-boat weary of wait mean to start on the morrow the idea of run against these float island be really alarming and i be tell by many that my fear be not without foundation for that repeat accident have happen from this cause and then they talk of the little miamus river whose mouth we be to pass send down mass of ice that might stop we progress in short we wait patiently and prudently till the learn in such matter tell we that we might start with safety chapter 17 departure from cincinnatus -- society on board the steam-boat -- arrival at wheeling -- bel esprit we quit cincinnatus the beginning of march 1830 and i believe there be not one of we party who do not experience a sensation of pleasure in leave it we have see again and again all the queer variety of it be little world have amuse ourselves with it be consequence it be taste and it be ton till they have cease to be amusing not a hill be leave unclimbed nor a forest path unexplored and with the exception of two or three individual who bear head and heart peculiar to no clime but which be find scatter through the world as if to keep we every where in good humor with it we leave nought to regret at cincinnatus the only regret be that we have ever enter it for we have waste health time and money there we get on board the steam-boat which be to convey we to wheeling at three o'clock she be a noble boat by far the finest we have see the cabin be above and the deck passenger as they be call be accommodate below in front of the lady ' cabin be a ample balcony sheltered by a awning chair and sofa be place there and even at that early season nearly all the female passenger pass the whole day there the name of this splendid vessel be the lady franklin by the way i be often amuse by the evident fondness which the american shew for title the wife of they eminent man constantly receive that of lady we hear of lady washington lady jackson and many other lady the eternal recurrence of they militia title be particularly ludicrous meet with as they be among the tavern-keeper market-gardener & c but i think the most remarkable instance which we notice of this sort of aristocratical longing occur at cincinnatus mr t -- in speaking of a gentleman of the neighborhood call he mr m -- general m -- sir observe he companion i beg he pardon rejoin mr t -- but i be not aware of he be in the army no sir not in the army be the reply but he be surveyor - general of the district the weather be delightful all trace of winter have disappear and we again find ourselves move rapidly up the stream and enjoy all the beauty of the ohio of the male part of the passenger we see nothing excepting at the short silent period allot for breakfast dinner and supper at which we be permit to enter they cabin and place ourselves at they table in the lady franklin we have decidedly the best of it for we have we beautiful balcony to sit in in all respects indeed we accommodation be very superior to what we have find in the boat which bring we from new orlean to memphi where we be stow away in a miserable little chamber close aft under the cabin and give to understand by the steward that it be we duty there to remain till such time as the bell should ring for meal the separation of the sex so often mention be no where more remarkable than on board the steam-boat among the passenger on this occasion we have a gentleman and he wife who really appear to suffer from the arrangement she be a invalid and he be extremely attentive to she as far at least as the regulation permit when the steward open the door of communication between the cabin to permit we approach the table she husband be always station close to it to hand she to she place and when he accompany she again to the door he always linger for a moment or two on the forbid threshold nor leave he station till the last female have pass through once or twice he venture when all but he wife be on the balcony to sit down beside she for a moment in we cabin but the instant either of we enter he start like a guilty thing and vanish while mention the peculiar arrangement which be think necessary to the delicacy of the american lady or the comfort of the american gentleman i be tempt to allude to a story which i saw in the papers respect the visit which it be state captain basil hall persist in make to he wife and child on board a mississippus steam-boat after bring inform that do so be contrary to law now i happen to know that neither himself or mr hall ever enter the lady ' cabin during the whole voyage as they occupy a state-room which captain hall have secure for he party the veracity of newspaper statement be perhaps nowhere quite unimpeachable but if i be not greatly mistaken there be more direct falsehood circulate by the american newspaper than by all the other in the world and the one great and never-failing source of these voluminous work of imagination be england and the english how differently would such a voyage be manage on the other side of the atlantic be such a mode of travel possible there such long calm river excursion would be perfectly delightful and party would be perpetually form to enjoy they even be all the party stranger to each other the knowledge that they be to eat drink and steam away together for a week or fortnight would induce something like a social feeling in any other country it be true that the man become sufficiently acquaint to game together and we be tell that the opportunity be consider as so favourable that no boat leave new orlean without have as cabin passenger one or two gentleman from that city whose profession it be to drill the fifty-two element of a pack of card to profitable duty this doubtless be a additional reason for the strict exclusion of the lady from they society the constant drinking of spirit be another for though they do not scruple to chew tobacco and to spit incessantly in the presence of woman they generally prefer drinking and gaming in they absence i often use to amuse myself with fancy the different scene which such a vessel would display in europe the noble length of the gentleman 's cabin would be put into requisition for a dance while that of the lady with they delicious balcony would be employ for refreshment instead of sit down in two long silent melancholy row to swallow as much coffee and beef-steak as could be achieve in ten minute then song and music would be hear bear along by the midnight breeze but on the ohio when light fail to shew we the bluff and the tree with they image invert in the stream we creep into we little cot listen to the ceaseless churning of the engine in hope it would prove a lullaby till morning we be three day in reach wheeling where we arrive at last at two o'clock in the morning a uncomfortable hour to disembark with a good deal of luggage as the steam-boat be oblige to go on immediately but we be instantly supply with a dray and in a few moment find ourselves comfortably seat before a good fire at a hotel near the landing-place we room with fire in they be immediately ready for we and refreshment bring with all that sedulous attention which in this country distinguish a slave state in make this observation i be very far from intend to advocate the system of slavery i conceive it to be essentially wrong but so far as my observation have extend i think its influence be far less injurious to the manners and moral of the people than the fallacious idea of equality which be so fondly cherish by the work class of the white population in america that these idea be fallacious be obvious for in point of fact the man possess of dollar do command the service of the man possess of no dollar but these service be give grudgingly and of necessity with no appearance of cheerful goodwill on the one side or of kindly interest on the other i never fail to mark the difference on enter a slave state i be immediately comfortable and at my ease and feel that the intercourse between I and those who serve I be profitable to both party and painful to neither it be not till i have leisure for more minute observation that i feel aware of the influence of slavery upon the owner of slave when i do i confess i could not but think that the citizen of the united state have contrived by they political alchymy to extract all that be most noxious both in democracy and in slavery and have pour the strange mixture through every vein of the moral organization of they country wheeling be the state of virginium and appear to be a flourishing town it be the point at which most traveller from the west leave the ohio to take the stage which travel the mountain road to the atlantic city it have many manufactory among other one for blow and cut glass which we visit we be tell by the workman that the article finish there be equal to any in the world but my eye refuse they assent the cutting be very good though by no means equal to what we see in daily use in london but the chief inferiority be in the material which be never altogether free from color i have observe this also in the glass of the pittsburgh manufactory the labor bestow on it always appear greater than the glass deserve they tell we also that they be rapidly improve in the art and i have no doubt that this be true wheeling have little of beauty to distinguish it except the ever lovely ohio to which we here bid adieu and a fine bold hill which rise immediately behind the town this hill as well as every other in the neighborhood be bore for coal they mine be all horizontal the coal burn well but with a very black and dirty cinder we find the coach by which we mean to proceed to little washington full and learn that we must wait two day before it would again leave the town post be never hear of in the country and the mail travel all night which i do not approve of we therefore find ourselves compel to pass two day at the wheeling hotel i know not how this weary interval would have worn away have it not be for the fortunate circumstance of we meeting with a _ bel esprit _ among the boarder there we descend to the common sit room -lrb- for private parlor there be none -rrb- before breakfast the morning after we arrival several ordinary individual enter till the party amount to eight or nine again the door open and in swam a female who have once certainly be handsome and who it be equally evident still think herself so she be tall and well form dress in black with many gaudy trinket about she : a scarlet _ fichu _ relieve the sombre color of she dress and a very smart little cap at the back of she head set off a immense quantity of sable hair which naturally or artificially adorn she forehead a become quantity of rouge give the finish touch to she figure which have a degree of pretension about it that immediately attract we notice she talk fluently and without any american restraint and i begin to be greatly puzzle as to who or what she could be a lady in the english sense of the word i be sure she be not and she be a little like a american female of what they call good stand a beautiful girl of seventeen enter soon after and call she ma and both mother and daughter chatter away about themselves and they concern in a manner that greatly increase my puzzle after breakfast be much in want of amusement i seat myself by she and enter into conversation i find she nothing loth and in about a minute and a half she put a card into my hand set forth that she teach the art of painting upon velvet in all its branch she state to I with great volubility that no one but herself and she daughter know any thing of this invaluable branch of art but that for twenty-five dollar they be willing to communicate all they know in five minute more she inform I that she be the author of some of the most cut satire in the language and then she present I a paper contain a prospectus as she call it of a novel upon a entirely new construction i be strangely tempt to ask she if it go by steam but she leave I no time to ask any thing for continue the autobiography she have so obligingly begin she say i use to write against all the adam faction i will go up stair in a moment and fetch you down my sat-here against that side but oh my dear madam it be really frightful to think how talent be neglect in this country ah i know what you be go to say my dear madam you will tell I that it be not so in yours i know it but alas the atlantic however i really must tell you how i have be treat : not only do i publish the most biting sat-here against the adam faction but i write song and ode in honor of jackson and my daughter cordelium sing a splendid song of my write before eight hundred people entirely and altogether write in he praise and would you believe it my dear madam he have never take the slightest notice of I or make I the least remuneration but you can not suppose i mean to bear it quietly no i promise he that be not my way the novel i have just mention to you be begin as a sentimental romance -lrb- that perhaps after all be my real forte -rrb- but after the provocation i receive at washington i turn it into a sat-herical novel and i now call it _ yankee doodle court _ by the way my dear madam i think if i could make up my mind to cross that terrible atlantic i should be pretty well receive after write yankee doodle court i take the opportunity of a slight pause to ask she to what party she now belong since she have forswear both adam and jackson oh clay clay for ever he be a real true-hearted republican the other be neither more nor less than tyrant when next i enter the sitting-room she again address I to deplore the degenerate taste of the age would you believe it i have at this moment a comedy ready for representation i call it ` the mad philosopher ' it be really admirable and its success certain if i could get it play i assure you the neglect i meet with amount perfectly to persecution but i have find out how to pay they and to make my own fortune sat-here -lrb- as she constantly pronounce satire -rrb- sat-here be the only weapon that can revenge neglect and i flatter myself i know how to use it do I the favor to look at this she then present I with a tiny pamphlet whose price she inform I be twenty-five cent which i readily pay to become the possessor of this _ chef d'oeuvre _ the composition be pretty nearly such as i anticipate except that the english language be do to death by she pen still more than by she tongue the epigraph which be subscribe original be as follow : you popularity 's on the decline : you have you triumph now i 'll have mine these be rather a favourable specimen of the verse that follow in a subsequent conversation she make I acquaint with another talent inform I that she have play the part of charlotte in _ love a la mode _ when general lafayette honor the theater at cincinnatus with he presence she now appear to have run out the catalogue of she accomplishment and i come to the conclusion that my new acquaintance be a stroll player : but she seem to guess my thought for she presently add it be a thespian corps that play before the general chapter 18 departure for the mountain in the stage -- scenery of the alleghany -- haggerstown the weather be bleak and disagreeable during the two day we be oblige to remain at wheeling i have get heartily tire of my gifted friend we have walk up every side of the rugged hill and i set off on my journey towards the mountain with more pleasure than be generally feel in quit a pillow before daylight for a cold corner in a rumble stage-coach this be the first time we have get into a american stage though we have traverse above two thousand mile of the country and we have all the satisfaction in it which could be derive from the conviction that we be travel in a foreign land this vehicle have no step and we climb into it by a ladder when that be remove i remember with some dismay that the female at least be much in the predicament of sailor who in danger have no door to creep out but when a misfortune be absolutely inevitable we be apt to bear it remarkably well who would utter that constant petition of lady on rough road let I get out when compliance would oblige the pleader to make a step of five foot before she could touch the ground the coach have three row of seat each calculate to hold three person and as we be only six we have in the phrase of milton to inhabit lax this exalted abode and accordingly we be for some mile toss about like a few potato in a wheelbarrow we knee elbow and head require too much care for they protection to allow we leisure to look out of the window but at length the road become smoother and we become more skilful in the art of balance ourselves so as to meet the concussion with less danger of dislocation we then find that we be travel through a very beautiful country essentially different in its feature from what we have be accustom to round cincinnatus : it be true we have leave _ la belle riviere _ behind we but the many limpid and rapid little stream that dance through the landscape to join it more than atone for its loss the country already wear a air of more careful husbandry and the very circumstance of a wide and costly road -lrb- though not a very smooth one -rrb- which in theory might be suppose to injure picturesque effect be beautiful to we who since we have enter the muddy mouth of the mississippus have never see any thing except a steam-boat and the _ levee _ profess to have so noble a object as public accommodation through the whole of the vast region we have pass except at new orlean itself every trace of the art of man appear to be confine to the individual effort of get along which in western phrase mean contrive to live with as small a portion of the incumbrance of civilized society as possible this road be make at the expense of the government as far as cumberland a town situate among the alleghany mountain and from the nature of the ground must have be a work of great cost i regret not have count the number of bridge between wheeling and little washington a distance of thirty-four mile over one stream only there be twenty-five all pass by the road they frequently occur within a hundred yard of each other so serpentine be its course they be build of stone and sometimes very neatly finish little washington be in pennsylvanium across a corner of which the road run this be a free state but we be still wait upon by negro hire from the neighbouring state of virginium we arrive at night and set off again at four in the morning all therefore that we see of little washington be its hotel which be clean and comfortable the first part of the next day 's journey be through a country much less interesting : its character be unvaried for nearly thirty mile consist of a uninterrupted succession of forest-covered hill as soon as we have wearily drag to the top of one of these we begin to rumble down the other side as rapidly as we four horse could trot and no sooner arrive at the bottom than we begin to crawl up again the tree constantly so thick and so high as to preclude the possibility of see fifty yard in any direction the latter part of the day however amply repay we at four o'clock we begin to ascend the alleghany mountain : the first ridge on the western side be call laurel hill and take its name from the profuse quantity of evergreen with which it be cover not any among they however be the shrub to which we give the name of laurel the whole of this mountain region through ninety mile of which the road pass be a garden the almost incredible variety of plant and the lavish profusion of they growth produce a effect perfectly enchanting i really can hardly conceive a higher enjoyment than a botanical tour among the alleghany mountain to any one who have science enough to profit by it the magnificent rhododendron first catch we eye it fringe every cliff nestle beneath every rock and bloom around every tree the azalium the shumac and every variety of that beautiful mischief the kalmium be in equal profusion cedar of every size and form be above around and underneath we fir more beautiful and more various than i have ever see be in equal abundance but i know not whether they be really such as i have never see in europe or only in infinitely greater splendor and perfection of growth the species call the hemlock be i think second to the cedar only in magnificence oak and beech with innumerable rose and wild vine hang in beautiful confusion among they branch be in many place scatter among the evergreen the earth be carpet with various moss and creep plant and though still in the month of march not a trace of the nakedness of winter could be see such be the scenery that shew we we be indeed among the far-famed alleghany mountain as we noble terrace-road the semplon of america rise higher and higher all that be noblest in nature be join to all that be sweetest the blue top of the higher ridge form the outline huge mass of rock rise above we on the left half hide at interval by the bright green shrub while to the right we look down upon the top of the pine and cedar which clothe the bottom i have no idea of the endless variety of mountain scenery my notion have be of rock and precipice of torrent and of forest tree but i little expect that the first spot which should recall the garden scenery of we beautiful england would be find among the moutain : yet so it be from the time i enter america i have never see the slightest approach to what we call pleasure-grounds a few very worthless and scentless flower be all the specimen of gardening i have see in ohio no attempt at garden scenery be ever dream of and it be with the sort of delight with which one meet a old friend that we look on the lovely mixture of tree shrub and flower that now continually meet we eye often on descend into the narrow vally we find a little spot of cultivation a garden or a field hedge round with shumac rhododendron and azalia and a cottage cover with rose these vally be spot of great beauty a clear stream be always find run through they which be generally convert to the use of the miller at some point not far from the road and here as on the height great beauty of coloring be give to the landscape by the bright hue of the vegetation and the sober gray of the rock the first night we pass among the mountain recall we painfully from the enjoyment of nature to all the petty misery of personal discomfort arrive at we inn a forlorn parlor fill with the blended fume of tobacco and whiskey receive we and chill as we begin to feel ourselves with the mountain air we prefer go to we cold bedroom rather than sup in such a atmosphere we find linen on the bed which they assure we have only be use _ a few night _ every kind of refreshment we ask for we be answer we do not happen to have that article we be still in pennsylvanium and no longer wait upon by slave it be therefore with great difficulty that we procure a fire in we bedroom from the surly-looking _ young lady _ who condescend to officiate as chambermaid and with much more that we extort clean linen for we bed that do we patiently creep into they supperless while she make she exit mutter about the difficulty of fix english folk the next morning cheer we spirit again we now enjoy a new kind of alpine witchery the cloud be float around and below we and the distant peak be indistinctly visible as through a white gauze veil which be gradually lift up till the sun arise and again let in upon we the full glory of these interminable height we be tell before we begin the ascent that we should find snow four inch deep on the road but as yet we have see none and indeed it be with difficulty we persuade ourselves that we be not travel in the midst of summer as we proceed however we find the northern declivity still cover with it and at length towards the summit the road itself have the promise four inch the extreme mildness of the air and the brilliant hue of the evergreen contrast strangely with this appearance of winter it be difficult to understand how the snow could help melting in such a atmosphere again and again we enjoy all the exhilarating sensation that such scene must necessarily inspire but in attempt a continued description of we progress over these beautiful mountain i could only tell again of rock cedar laurel and run stream of blue height and green vally yet the continually vary combination of these object afford we unceasing pleasure from one point pre-eminently above any neighbouring ridge we look back upon the enormous valley of the west it be a stupendous view but have gaze upon it for some moment we turn to pursue we course and the certainty that we should see it no more raise no sigh of regret we dine on the second day at a beautiful spot which we be tell be the highest point on the road be 2846 foot above the level of the sea we be regale luxuriously on wild turkey and mountain venison which latter be infinitely superior to any furnish by the forest of the mississippus or the ohio the vegetable also be extremely fine and we be tell by a pretty girl who superintend the slave that wait on we -lrb- for we be again in virginium -rrb- that the vegetable of the alleghany be reckon the finest in america she tell we also that wild strawberry be profusely abundant and very fine that they cow find for themselves during the summer plenty of flowery food which produce a copious supply of milk that they spring give they the purest water of icy coldness in the warmest season and that the climate be the most delicious in the world for though the thermometer sometimes stand at ninety they cool breeze never fail they what a spot to turn hermit in for a summer my eloquent mountaineer give I some specimen of ground plant far unlike any thing i have ever see one particularly which she call the ground pine be peculiar as she tell I to the alleghany and in some place run over whole acre of ground it be extremely beautiful the room be very prettily decorate with this elegant plant hang round it in festoon in many place the clearing have be considerable the road pass through several fine farm situate in the sheltered hollow we be tell that the wolf continue to annoy they severely but that panther the terror of the west be never see and bear very rarely of snake they confess they have abundance but very few that be consider dangerous in the afternoon we come in sight of the monongehalum river and its bank give we for several mile a beautiful succession of wild and domestic scenery in some point the black rock rise perpendicularly from its margin like those at chepstow at other a mill with its owner 's cottage its corn-plat and its poultry present a delightful image of industry and comfort brownsville be a busy look little town build upon the bank of this river it would be pretty be it not stain by the hue of coal i do not remember in england to have see any spot however near a coal mine so dye in black as wheeling and brownsville at this place we cross the monongehalum in a flat ferry-boat which very commodiously receive we huge coach and four horse on leave the black little town we be again cheer by abundance of evergreen reflect in the stream with fantastic pile of rock half visible through the pine and cedar above give often the idea of a vast gothic castle it be a folly i confess but i often lament they be not such the travel for thousand of mile without meet any nobler trace of the age that be pass than a mass of rotten leaf or a fragment of fall rock produce a heavy earthly matter-of-fact effect upon the imagination which can hardly be describe and for which the greatest beauty of scenery can furnish only a occasional and transitory remedy we second night in the mountain be past at a solitary house of rather forlorn appearance but we fare much better than the night before for they give we clean sheet a good fire and no scolding we again start at four o'clock in the morning and eagerly watch for the first gleam of light that should show the same lovely spectacle we have see the day before nor be we disappoint though the show be somewhat different the vapor catch the morning ray as it first dart over the mountain top and pass it to the scene below we seem envelop in a rainbow we have now but one ridge leave to pass over and as we reach the top and look down on the new world before we i hardly know whether most to rejoice that all the toil of the long-pass 'd way be over or to regret that we mountain journey be draw to a close the novelty of my enjoyment have doubtless add much to its keenness i have never be familiar with mountain scenery wale have shew I all i ever see and the region of the alleghany alp in no way resemble it it be a world of mountain rise around you in every direction and in every form savage vast and wild yet almost at every step some lovely spot meet you eye green bright and bloom as the most cherish nook belong to some noble flora in we own beautiful land it be a ride of ninety mile through kalmy rhododendron azalia vine and rose sheltered from every blast that blow by vast mass of various color rock on which tall pine and cedar wave they dark green crest while in every direction you have a background of blue mountain top that play at bo-peep with you in the cloud after descend the last ridge we reach haggerstown a small neat place between a town and a village and here by the piety of the presbyterian coach-master we be doom to pass a entire day and two night as the accommodation line must not run on the sabbath i must however mention that this day of enforced rest be _ not _ Sunday Saturday evening we have take in at cumberland a portly passenger whom we soon discover to be one of the proprietor of the coach he ask we with great politeness if we should wish to travel on the sabbath or to delay we journey we answer that we would rather proceed the coach then shall go on tomorrow reply the liberal coach-master with the greatest courtesy and accordingly we travel all Sunday and arrive at haggerstown on Sunday night at the door of the inn we civil proprietor leave we but when we enquire of the waiter at what hour we be to start on the morrow he tell we that we should be oblige to pass the whole of Monday there as the coach which be to convey we forward would not arrive from the east till Tuesday morning thus we discover that the waive the sabbath-keeping by the proprietor be for he own convenience and not for ours and that we be to be tie by the leg for four-and-twenty hour notwithstanding this be quite a yankee trick luckily for we the inn at haggerstown be one of the most comfortable i ever enter it be there that we become fully aware that we have leave western america behind we instead of be scold as we literally be at cincinnatus for ask for a private sitting-room we here have two without ask at all a waiter quite _ comme il faut _ summon we to breakfast dinner and tea which we find prepare with abundance and even elegance the master of the house meet we at the door of the eating-room and after ask if we wish for any thing not on the table retire the charge be in no respect higher than at cincinnatus a considerable creek call conococheque creek run near the town and the valley through which it pass be say to be the most fertile in america on leave haggerstown we find to we mortification that we be not to be the sole occupant of the bulky accommodation two lady and two gentleman appear at the door ready to share it with we we again start at four o'clock by the light of a bright moon and rumble and nod through the road considerably worse than those over the mountain as the light begin to dawn we discover we lady to be a old woman and she pretty daughter soon after daylight we find that we pace become much slower than usual and that from time to time we driver address to he companion on the box many and vehement exclamation the gentleman put they head out to ask what be the matter but could get no intelligence till the mail overtake we when both vehicle stop and a animated colloquy of imprecation take place between the coachman at length we learn that one of we wheel be break in such a manner as to render it impossible for we to proceed upon this the old lady immediately become a principal actor in the scene she spring to the window and address the set of gentleman who completely fill the mail exclaim gentleman can not you make room for two only I and my daughter the naive simplicity of this request set both the coach into a uproar of laughter it be impossible to doubt that she act upon the same principle as the pious catholic who address heaven with a prayer for himself alone add _ pour ne pa fatiguer ta misericorde _ we laugh however never daunt the old woman or cause she for a moment to cease the reiteration of she request only for two of we gentleman can not you find room for two we situation be really very embarrassing but not to laugh be impossible after it be ascertain that we own vehicle could not convey we and that the mail have not even room for two we decide upon walk to the next village a distance fortunately of only two mile and await there the repair of the wheel we immediately set off at the brisk pace that six o'clock and a frosty morning in march be likely to inspire leave we old lady and she pretty daughter considerably in the rear we heart have be rather harden by the exclusive nature of she prayer for aid when we have again start upon we new wheel the driver to recover the time he have lose drive rapidly over a very rough road in consequence of which we self-seeking old lady fall into a perfect agony of terror and she cry of we shall be over oh lord we shall be over we must over we shall be over last to the end of the stage which with laughing walking and shake be a most fatiguing one chapter 19 baltimore -- catholic cathedral -- st mary 's -- college sermon -- infant school as we advance towards baltimore the look of cultivation increase the fence wear a air of greater neatness the house begin to look like the abode of competence and comfort and we be console for the loss of the beautiful mountain by know that we be approach the atlantic from the time of quit the ohio river though unquestionably it merit its title of the beautiful especially when compare with the dreary mississippus i strongly feel the truth of a observation i remember to have hear in england that little river be more beautiful than great one as feature in a landscape this be assuredly the case where the stream be so wide that the object on the opposite shore be indistinct all the beauty must be derive from the water itself whereas when the stream be narrow it become only a part of the composition the monongahelum which be in size between the wye and the thame be infinitely more picturesque than the ohio to enjoy the beauty of the vast river of this vast country you must be upon the water and then the power of change the scenery by now approach one shore and now the other be very please but travel as we now do by land the wild rocky narrow rapid little river we encounter be a thousand time more beautiful the potapsco near which the road run as you approach baltimore be at many point very picturesque the large block of gray rock now close upon its edge and now retire to give room for a few acre of bright green herbage give great interest and variety to its course baltimore be i think one of the handsomest city to approach in the union the noble column erect to the memory of washington and the catholic cathedral with its beautiful dome be build on a commanding eminence be see at a great distance as you draw nearer many other dome and tower become visible and as you enter baltimore-street you feel that you be arrive in a handsome and populous city we take up we quarter at a excellent hotel where the coach stop and the next day be fortunate enough to find accommodation in the house of a lady well know to many of my european friend with she and she amiable daughter we spend a fortnight very agreeably and feel quite aware that if we have not arrive in london or pari we have at least left far behind the half-horse half-alligator tribe of the west as the kentuckian call themselves baltimore be in many respects a beautiful city it have several handsome building and even the private dwelling-house have a look of magnificence from the abundance of white marble with which many of they be adorn the ample flight of step and the lofty door frame be in most of the best house form of this beautiful material this have be call the city of monument from its have the stately column erect to the memory of general washington and which bear a colossal statue of he at the top and another pillar of less dimension record some victory i forget which both these be of brilliant white marble there be also several pretty marble fountain in different part of the city which greatly add to its beauty these be not it be true quite so splendid as that of the innocent or many other at pari but they be fountain of clear water and they be build of white marble there be one which be sheltered from the sun by a roof support by light column it look like a temple dedicate to the genius of the spring the water flow into a marble cistern to which you descend by a flight of step of delicate whiteness and return by another these step be never without group of negro girl some carry the water on they head with that graceful steadiness of step which require no aid from the hand some trip gaily with they yet unfilled pitcher many of they singing in the soft rich voice peculiar to they race and all dress with that strict attention to taste and smartness which seem the distinguish characteristic of the baltimore female of all rank the catholic cathedral be consider by all american as a magnificent church but it can hardly be so class by any one who have see the church of europe its interior however have a air of neatness that amount to elegance the form be a greek cross have a dome in the center but the proportion be ill - preserve the dome be too low and the arch which support it be flatten and too wide for they height on each side of the high altar be chapel to the savior and the virgin the altar in these as well as the high altar be of native marble of different color and some of the specimen be very beautiful the decoration of the altar be elegant and costly the prelate be a cardinal and bear moreover the title of archbishop of baltimore there be several painting in different part of the church which we hear be consider as very fine there be two present by loui xviii one of these be the descent from the cross by paulin guirin the other a copy from ruben -lrb- as they tell we -rrb- of a legend of st loui in the holy land but the composition of the picture be so abominably bad that i conceive the legend of its be after ruben must be as fabulous as its subject the admiration in which these picture be hold be a incontestable indication of the state of art in the country we attend mass in this church the Sunday after we arrival and i be perfectly astonished at the beauty and splendid appearance of the lady who fill it except on a very brilliant Sunday at the tuillery i never see so shewy a display of morning costume and i think i never see any where so many beautiful woman at one glance they all appear to be in full dress and be really all beautiful the sermon -lrb- i be very attentive to sermon -rrb- be a most extraordinary one the priest begin by tell we that he be about to preach upon a vice that he would not mention or name from the beginning of he sermon to the end have thus excite the curiosity of he hearer by propose a riddle to they he begin adam he say be most assuredly the first who have commit this sin and cain the next then follow the advice give by the listener in the plaideur passon au deluge je vous prie he go on to mention the particular propriety of noah 's family on this point and then continue now observe what do god shew the greatest dislike to what be it that jesus be never even accuse of what be it joseph hate the most who be the disciple that jesus choose for he friend and thus he go on for nearly a hour in a strain that be often perfectly unintelligible to I but which as far as i could comprehend it appear to be a sort of expose and commentary upon private anecdote which he have find or fancy he have find in the bible i never see the attention of a congregation more strongly excited and i really wish in christian charity that something better have reward it there be a vast number of church and chapel in the city in proportion to its extent and several that be large and well - build the unitarian church be the handsomest i have ever see dedicate to that mode of worship but the prettiest among they be a little _ bijou _ of a thing belong to the catholic college the institution be dedicate to st mary but this little chapel look though in the midst of a city as if it should have be sacred to st john of the wilderness there be a sequestered little garden behind it hardly large enough to plant cabbage in which yet contain a mount calvary bear a lofty cross the tiny path which lead up to this sacred spot be not much wider than a sheep-track and its cedar be but shrub but all be in proportion and notwithstanding its fairy dimension there be something of holiness and quiet beauty about it that excite the imagination strangely the little chapel itself have the same touching and impressive character a solitary lamp whose glare be temper by delicately paint glass hang before the altar the light of day enter dimly yet richly through crimson curtain and the silence with which the well-lined door open from time to time admit a youth of the establishment who with noiseless tread approach the altar and kneel offer a whisper prayer and retire have something in it more calculated perhaps to generate holy thought than even the swell anthem hear beneath the resounding dome of st peter 's baltimore have a handsome museum superintend by one of the peale family well know for they devotion to natural science and to work of art it be not they fault if the specimen which they be enable to display in the latter department be very inferior to they splendid exhibition in the former the theater be close when we be in baltimore but we be tell that it be very far from be a popular or fashionable amusement we be indeed tell this every where throughout the country and the information be generally accompany by the observation that the opposition of the clergy be the cause of it but i suspect that this be not the principal cause especially among the man who if they be so implicit in they obedience to the clergy would certainly be more constant in they attendance at the church nor would they moreover deem the theater more righteous because a english actor or a french dancer perform there yet on such occasion the theater overflow the cause i think be in the character of the people i never see a population so totally divest of gaiety there be no trace of this feeling from one end of the union to the other they have no fete no fair no merry makings no music in the street no punch no puppet-show if they see a comedy or a farce they may laugh at it but they can do very well without it and the consciousness of the number of cent that must be pay to enter a theater i be very sure turn more step from its door than any religious feeling a distinguished publisher of philadelphium tell I that no comic publication have ever yet be find to answer in america we arrive at baltimore at the season of the conference i must be excuse from give any very distinct explanation of this term as i do not receive any from what i could learn it much resemble a revival we enter many church and hear much preaching and not one of the reverend orator could utter the reproach peut-on si bien precher qu'elle ne dorme au sermon for i never even dose at any there be one preacher whose manner and matter be so peculiar that i take the liberty of immediately write down a part of he discourse as a specimen i confess i begin write in the middle of a sentence for i wait in vain for a begin it be as follow : - nevertheless we must not lose sight of the one important great and only object for the lord be mighty he work be great likewise wonderful likewise wise likewise merciful and moreover we must ever keep in mind and close to we heart all he precious blessing and unspeakable mercy and overflowing and moreover we must never lose sight of no never lose sight of nor ever cease to remember nor ever let we soul forget nor ever cease to dwell upon and to reverence and to welcome and to bless and to give thanks and to sing hosanna and give praise -- and here my fragment of paper fail but this strain continue without a shadow of mean that i could trace and in a voice inconceivably loud for more than a hour after he have finish he sermon a scene exactly resemble that at the cincinnatus revival take place two other priest assist in call forward the people and in whisper comfort to they one of these man roar out in the coarsest accent do you want to go to hell tonight the church be almost entirely fill with woman who vie with each other in howling and contortion of the body many of they tear they clothes nearly off i be much amuse spite of the indignation and disgust the scene inspire by the vehemence of the negro part of the congregation they seem determine to bellow louder than all the rest to shew at once they piety and they equality at this same chapel a few night before a woman have fall in a fit of ecstasy from the gallery into the arm of the people below a height of twelve foot a young slave who wait upon we at table when this be mention say that similar accident have frequently happen and that once she have see it herself another slave in the house tell we that she like religion right well but that she never take fit in it 'cause she be always fix in she best when she go to chapel and she do not like to have all she best clothes break up we visit the infant school institute in this city by mr ibbertson a amiable and intelligent englishman it be the first infant school properly so call which i have ever see and i be greatly please with all the arrangement and the apparent success of they the child of whom we see about a hundred boy and girl be between eighteen month and six year the apartment be fill with all sort of instructive and amusing object a set of dutch toy arrange as a cabinet of natural history be excellent a numerous collection of large wooden brick fill one corner of the room the wall be hang with gay papers of different pattern each represent some pretty group of figure large and excellent color engraving of bird and beast be exhibit in succession as the theme of a little lesson and the sweet flute of mr ibbertson give tune and time to the prettiest little concert of chirp bird that i ever listen to a geographical model large enough to give clear idea of continent island cape isthmus et cetera all set in water be place before the child and the pretty creature point they little rosy finger with a look of intense interest as they be call upon to shew where each of they be to be find the dress both of boy and girl be elegantly neat and they manner when call upon to speak individually be well-bred intelligent and totally free from the rude indifference which be so remarkably prevalent in the manners of american child mr ibbertson will be benefactor to the union if he become the means of spread the admirable method by which he have polish the manner and awaken the intellect of these beautiful little republican i have converse with many american lady on the total want of discipline and subjection which i observe universally among child of all age and i never find any who do not both acknowledge and deplore the truth of the remark in the state of ohio they have a law -lrb- i know not if it exist elsewhere -rrb- that if a father strike he son he shall pay a fine of ten dollar for every such offence i be tell by a gentleman of cincinnatus that he have see this fine inflict there at the requisition of a boy of twelve year of age whose father he prove have strike he for lie such a law they say generate a spirit of freedom what else may it generate mr ibbertson who seem perfectly devoted heart and head to the subject tell I that he be employ in organize successive school that should receive the pupil as they advance in age if he prove himself as capable of complete education as he appear to be of begin it he institution will be a very valuable one it would indeed be valuable any where but in america where discipline be not where from the shell they be being that can not rule nor ever will be rule it be invaluable about two mile from baltimore be a fort nobly situate on the patapsco and command the approach from the chesapeak bay as we visit be on a Sunday we be not permit to enter it the walk to this fort be along a fine terrace of beautiful verdure which command a magnificent view of the city with its column tower dome and shipping and also of the patapsco river which be here so wide as to present almost a sea view this terrace be ornament with abundance of evergreen and wild rose innumerable but the whole region have the reputation of be unhealthy and the fort itself most lamentably so before leave the city of monument i must not omit name one rear to the grow wealth of the country mr barham 's hotel be say to be the most splendid in the union and it be certainly splendid enough for a people more luxurious than the citizen of the republic appear yet to be i hear different and indeed perfectly contradictory account of the success of the experiment but at least every one seem to agree that the liberal projector be fully entitle to exclaim ` tis not in mortal to command success i have do more jonathan i have deserve it after enjoy a very pleasant fortnight the greater part of which be pass in rambling about this pretty city and its environs we leave it not without regret and all indulge the hope that we should be able to pay it another visit chapter 20 voyage to washington -- capitol -- city of washington -- congress -- indian -- funeral of a member of congress by far the shortest route to washington both as to distance and time be by land but i much wish to see the celebrated chesapeak bay and it be therefore decide that we should take we passage in the steam-boat it be indeed a beautiful little voyage and well worth the time it cost but as to the beauty of the bay it must i think be feel only by sailor it be i doubt not a fine shelter for ship from the storm of the atlantic but its very vastness prevent its striking the eye as beautiful : it be in fact only a fine sea view but the entrance from it into the potomac river be very noble and be one of the point at which one feel conscious of the gigantic proportion of the country without have recourse to a graduate pencil-case the passage up this river to washington be interesting from many object that it pass but beyond all else by the view it afford of mount vernon the seat of general washington it be there that this truly great man pass the last year of he virtuous life and it be there that he lie bury : it be easy to distinguish as we pass the cypress that wave over he grave the latter part of the voyage shew some fine river scenery but i do not discover this till some month afterwards for we now arrive late at night we first object the next morning be to get a sight of the capitol and we impatience send we forth before breakfast the mist of morning still hang around this magnificent building when first it break upon we view and i be not sure that the effect produce be not the greater for this circumstance at all event we be strike with admiration and surprise none of we i believe expect to see so impose a structure on that side of the atlantic i be ill at describe building but the beauty and majesty of the american capitol might defy a abler pen than mine to do it justice it stand so finely too high and alone the magnificent western facade be approach from the city by terrace and step of bolder proportion than i ever before see the elegant eastern front to which many person give the preference be on a level with a newly-planted but exceedingly handsome inclosure which in a few year will offer the shade of all the most splendid tree which flourish in the union to cool the brow and refresh the spirit of the member the view from the capitol command the city and many mile around and it be itself a object of impose beauty to the whole country adjoining we be again fortunate enough to find a very agreeable family to board with and soon after breakfast leave we comfortless hotel near the water for very pleasant apartment in f street -lrb- the street that intersect the great avenue in washington be distinguish by the letter of the alphabet -rrb- i be delighted with the whole aspect of washington light cheerful and airy it remind I of we fashionable water place it have be laugh at by foreigner and even by native because the original plan of the city be upon a enormous scale and but a very small part of it have be as yet execute but i confess i see nothing in the least degree ridiculous about it the original design which be as beautiful as it be extensive have be in no way depart from and all that have be do have be do well from the base of the hill on which the capitol stand extend a street of most magnificent width plant on each side with tree and ornament by many splendid shop this street which be call pennsylvanium avenue be above a mile in length and at the end of it be the handsome mansion of the president conveniently near to he residence be the various public office all handsome simple and commodious ample area be leave round each where grass and shrub refresh the eye in another of the principal street be the general post-office and not far from it a very noble town - hall towards the quarter of the president 's house be several handsome dwelling which be chiefly occupy by the foreign minister the house in the other part of the city be scatter but without ever lose sight of the regularity of the original plan and to a person who have be travel much through the country and mark the immense quantity of new manufactory new canal new railroad new town and new city which be spring as it be from the earth in every part of it the appearance of the metropolis rise gradually into life and splendor be a spectacle of high historic interest commerce have already produce large and handsome city in america before she have attain to a individual political existence and washington may be scorn as a metropolis where such city as philadelphium and new york exist but i consider it as the grow metropolis of the grow population of the union and it already possess feature noble enough to sustain its dignity as such the residence of the foreign legation and they family give a tone to the society of this city which distinguish it greatly from all other it be also for a great part of the year the residence of the senator and representative who must be presume to be the _ elite _ of the entire body of citizen both in respect to talent and education this can not fail to make washington a more agreeable abode than any other city in the union the total absence of all sight sound or smell of commerce add greatly to the charm instead of dray you see handsome carriage and instead of the busy bustling hustle of man shuffling on to a sale of dry goods or prime broad stuff you see very well-dressed personage lounge leisurely up and down pennsylvanium avenue mr pishey thompson the english bookseller with he pretty collection of all sort of pretty literature fresh from london and mr somebody the jeweller with he brilliant shop full of trinket be the principal point of attraction and business what a contrast to all other american city the member who pass several month every year in this lounge easy way with no labor but a little talking and with the _ douceur _ of eight dollar a day to pay they for it must feel the change sadly when they term of public service be over there be another circumstance which render the evening party at washington extremely unlike those of other place in the union this be the great majority of gentleman the expense the trouble or the necessity of a ruling eye at home one or all of these reason prevent the member ' lady from accompany they to washington at least i hear of very few who have they wife with they the female society be chiefly to be find among the family of the foreign minister those of the officer of state and of the few member the wealthiest and most aristocratic of the land who bring they family with they some few independent person reside in or near the city but this be a class so thinly scatter that they can hardly be account a part of the population but strange to say even here a theater can not be support for more than a few week at a time i be tell that gambling be the favorite recreation of the gentleman and that it be carry to a very considerable extent but here as elsewhere within the country it be keep extremely well out of sight i do not think i be present with a pack of card a dozen time during more than three year that i remain in the country billiards be much play though in most place the amusement be illegal it often appear to I that the old woman of a state make the law and the young man break they notwithstanding the diminutive size of the city we find much to see and to amuse we the patent office be a curious record of the fertility of the mind of man when leave to its own resource but it give ample proof also that it be not under such circumstance it be most usefully employ this patent office contain model of all the mechanical invention that have be produce in the union and the number be enormous i ask the man who shew these what proportion of they have be bring into use he say about one in a thousand he tell I also that they chiefly proceed from mechanic and agriculturist settle in remote part of the country who have begin by endeavor to hit upon some contrivance to enable they to _ get along _ without send some thousand and odd mile for the thing they want if the contrivance succeed they generally become so fond of this offspring of they ingenuity that they bring it to washington for a patent at the secretary of state 's office we be shewn autograph of all the potentate with whom the union be in alliance which i believe pretty well include all to the parchment bear these royal sign manual be append of course the official seal of each enclose in gold or silver box of handsome workmanship : i be amuse by the manner in which one of they own just prepare for the court of russium be display to we and the superiority of they decoration point out they be superior and in much better taste than the rest and i only wish that the feeling that induce this display would spread to every corner of the union and mix itself with every act and with every sentiment let america give a fair portion other attention to the art and the grace that embellish life and i will make she another visit and write another book as unlike this as possible among the royal signature the only one which much interested I be two from the hand of napoleon the earliest of these when he be first consul be a most illegible scrawl and as the tradition go be write on horseback but he write improve greatly after he become a emperor the subsequent signature be firmly and clearly write -- i long to steal both the purity of the american character form and found on the purity of the american government be make evident to we sens by the display of all the offering of esteem and regard which have be present by various sovereign to the different american minister who have be send to they court the object of the law which exact this deposit from every individual so honor be they tell we to prevent the possibility of bribery be use to corrupt any envoy of the republic i should think it would be a better way to select for the office such man as they feel could not be seduce by a sword or a snuff-box but they doubtless know they own business best the bureau for indian affair contain a room of great interest : the wall be entirely cover with original portrait of all the chief who from time to time have come to negotiate with they great father as they call the president these portrait be by mr king and it can not be doubt be excellent likeness as be all the portrait i have ever see from the hand of that gentleman the countenance be full of expression but the expression in most of they be extremely similar or rather i should say that they have but two sort of expression the one be that of very noble and warlike daring the other of a gentle and naive simplicity that have no mixture of folly in it but which be inexpressibly engaging and the more touching perhaps because at the moment we be look at they those very heart which lend the eye such meek and friendly softness be wring by a base cruel and most oppressive act of they _ great father _ we be at washington at the time that the measure for chase the last of several tribe of indian from they forest home be canvass in congress and finally decide upon by the fiat of the president if the american character may be judge by they conduct in this matter they be most lamentably deficient in every feeling of honor and integrity it be among themselves and from themselves that i have hear the statement which represent they as treacherous and false almost beyond belief in they intercourse with the unhappy indian have i during my residence in the united state observe any single feature in they national character that could justify they eternal boast of liberality and the love of freedom i might have respect they however much my taste might have be offend by what be peculiar in they manners and custom but it be impossible for any mind of common honesty not to be revolt by the contradiction in they principle and practice they inveigh against the government of europe because as they say they favor the powerful and oppress the weak you may hear this declaim upon in congress roar out in tavern discuss in every drawing-room satirize upon the stage nay even anathematize from the pulpit : listen to it and then look at they at home you will see they with one hand hoist the cap of liberty and with the other flog they slave you will see they one hour lecture they mob on the indefeasible rights of man and the next driving from they home the child of the soil whom they have bind themselves to protect by the most solemn treaty in justice to those who approve not this treacherous policy i will quote a paragraph from a new york paper which shew that there be some among they who look with detestation on the bold bad measure decide upon at washington in the year 1830 we know of no subject at the present moment of more importance to the character of we country for justice and integrity than that which relate to the indian tribe in georgium and alabama and particularly the cherokee in the former state the act pass by congress just at the end of the session co-operate with the tyrannical and iniquitous statute of georgium strike a formidable blow at the reputation of the united state in respect to they faith pledge in almost innumerable instance in the most solemn treaty and compact there be many object of much interest shewn we at this indian bureau but from the peculiar circumstance of this most unhappy and ill-used people it be a very painful interest the dress worn by the chief when they portrait be take be many of they splendid from the embroidery of bead and other ornament : and the room contain many specimen of they ingenuity and even of they taste there be a glass case in the room wherein be arrange specimen of work muslin and other needlework some very excellent handwriting and many other little production of male and female indian all prove clearly that they be perfectly capable of civilization indeed the circumstance which render they expulsion from they own they native land so peculiarly lamentable be that they be yield rapidly to the force of example they life be no longer those of wander hunter but they be become agriculturist and the tyrannical arm of brutal power have not now drive they as formerly only from they hunting grounds they favorite spring and the sacred bone of they father but it have chase they from the dwelling they advance knowledge have teach they to make comfortable from the newly-ploughed field of they pride and from the crop they sweat have water and for what to add some thousand acre of territory to the half-peopled wilderness which border they the potomac on arrive at washington make a beautiful sweep which form a sort of bay round which the city be build just where it make the turn a wooden bridge be throw across connect the shore of maryland and virginium this bridge be a mile and a quarter in length and be ugly enough -lrb- it have since be wash away by the break up of the frost of February 1831 -rrb- the navy-yard and arsenal be just above it on the maryland side and make a handsome appearance on the edge of the river follow the sweep above mention near the arsenal -lrb- much too near -rrb- be the penitentiary which as it be just finish and not inhabit we examine in every part it be build for the purpose of solitary confinement for life a gallows be a much less nerve-shaking spectacle than one of these awful cell and assuredly when imprisonment therein for life be substitute for death it be no mercy to the criminal but if it be a greater terror to the citizen it may answer the purpose better i do not conceive that out of a hundred human being who have be thus confine for a year one would be find at the end of it who would continue to linger on there _ certain it be for ever _ if the alternative of be hang be offer to they i have write a description of these horrible cell but captain hall 's picture of a similar building be so accurate and so clear that it be needless to insert it still follow the sweep of the river at the distance of two mile from washington be george town formerly a place of considerable commercial importance and likely i think to become so again when the ohio and chesapeake canal which there mouth into the potomac shall be in full action it be a very pretty town command a lovely view of which the noble potomac and the almost nobler capitol be the great feature the country rise into a beautiful line of hill behind washington which form a sort of undulating terrace on to george town this terrace be almost entirely occupy by a succession of gentleman 's seat at george town the potomac suddenly contract itself and begin to assume that rapid rocky and irregular character which mark it afterwards and render its course till it meet the shenandoah at harper 's ferry a series of the most wild and romantic view that be to be find in america attend the debate in congress be of course one of we great object and as a english woman i be perhaps the more eager to avail myself of the privilege allow it be repeatedly observe to I that at least in this instance i must acknowledge the superior gallantry of the american and that they herein give a decide proof of surpass the english in a wish to honor the lady as they have a gallery in the house of representative erect expressly for they while in england they be rigorously exclude from every part of the house of common but the inference i draw from this be precisely the reverse of the suggest it be well know that the reason why the house of common be close against lady be that they presence be find too attractive and that so many member be tempt to neglect the business before the house that they might enjoy the pleasure of converse with the fair critic in the gallery that it become a matter of national importance to banish they -- and they be banish it will be long ere the american legislature will find it necessary to pass the same law for the same reason a lady of washington however tell I a anecdote which go far to shew that a more intellectual turn in the woman would produce a change in the manners of the man she tell I that when the miss wright be in washington with general lafayette they very frequently attend the debate and that the most distinguished member be always crowd round they for this unwonted gallantry they apologize to they beautiful countrywoman by say that if they take equal interest in the debate the gallery would be always throng by the member the privilege of attend these debate would be more valuable could the speaker be better hear from the gallery but with the most earnest attention i could only follow one or two of the orator whose voice be peculiarly loud and clear this make it really a labor to listen but the extreme beauty of the chamber be of itself a reason for go again and again it be however really mortifying to see this splendid hall fit up in so stately and sumptuous a manner fill with man sit in the most unseemly attitude a large majority with they hat on and nearly all spit to a excess that decency forbid I to describe among the crowd who must be include in this description a few be distinguish by not wear they hat and by sit on they chair like other human being without throw they leg above they head whenever i enquire the name of one of these exception i be tell that it be mr this or mr that _ of virginia _ one day we be fortunate enough to get place on the sofa between the pillar on the floor of the house the gallery be shut up for the purpose of make some alteration which it be hope might improve the hearing in that part of the house occupy by the member and which be universally complain of as be very defective \* but in we place on the sofa we find we hear very much better than up stair and well enough to be extremely amuse by the rude eloquence of a thorough horse and alligator orator from kentucky who entreat the house repeatedly to go the whole hog \* -lrb- as a proof of this defective hearing in the hall of -lrb- congress i may quote a passage from a newspaper report of -lrb- a debate on improvement it be propose to suspend a -lrb- ceiling of glass fifteen foot above the head of the -lrb- member a member speaking in favor of this proposal -lrb- say member would then at least be able to understand -lrb- what be the question before the house a advantage which -lrb- most of they do not now possess respect more than -lrb- half the proposition upon which they vote if i mistake not every debate i listen to in the american congress be upon one and the same subject namely the entire independence of each individual state with regard to the federal government the jealousy on this point appear to I to be the very strangest political feeling that ever get possession of the mind of man i do not pretend to judge the merit of this question i speak solely of the very singular effect of see man after man start eagerly to he foot to declare that the greatest injury the basest injustice the most obnoxious tyranny that could be practice against the state of which he be a member would be a vote of a few million dollar for the purpose of make they road or canal or for drainage or in short for any purpose of improvement whatsoever during the month we be at washington i hear a great deal of conversation respect a recent exclusion from congress of a gentleman who by every account be one of the most esteemed man in the house and i think the father of it the crime for which this gentleman be out-vote by he own particular friend and admirer be that he have give he vote for a grant of public money for the purpose of drain a most lamentable and unhealthy district call _ the dismal swamp _ one great boast of the country be that they have no national debt or that they shall have none in two year this seem not very wonderful consider they productive tariff and that the income pay to they president be 6000_l per annum _ other government salary be in proportion and all internal improvement at the expense of the government treasury be vote unconstitutional the senate-chamber be like the hall of congress a semicircle but of very much smaller dimension it be most elegantly fit up and what be better still the senator generally speak look like gentleman they do not wear they hat and the activity of youth be happily past they do not toss they heel above they head i would i could add they do not spit but alas i have a oath in heaven and may not write a untruth a very handsome room opening on a noble stone balcony be fit up as a library for the member the collection as far as a very cursory view could enable I to judge be very like that of a private english gentleman but with less latin greek and italian this room also be elegantly furnish rich brussels carpet library table with portfolio of engraving abundance of sofa and so on the view from it be glorious and it look like the abode of luxury and taste i can by no means attempt to describe all the apartment of this immense building but the magnificent rotunda in the center must not be leave unnoticed it be indeed a noble hall a hundred foot in diameter and of a impose loftiness light by a ample dome almost any picture -lrb- except the cartoon -rrb- would look paltry in this room from the immense height of the wall but the subject of the four picture which be place there be of such high historic interest that they should certainly have a place somewhere as national record one represent the signing of the declaration of independence another the resignation of the presidency by the great washington another the celebrated victory of general gate at saratoga and the fourthus do not well remember but i think it be some other martial scene commemorate a victory i rather think that of york town one other object in the capitol must be mention though it occur in so obscure a part of the building that one or two member to whom i mention it be not aware of its existence the lower part of the edifice a story below the rotunda & c have a variety of committee room court and other place of business in a hall lead to some of these room the ceiling be support by pillar the capital of which strike I as peculiarly beautiful they be compose of the ear and leaf of the indian corn beautifully arrange and form as graceful a outline as the acanthus itself this be the only instance i saw in which america have venture to attempt national originality the success be perfect a sense of fitness always enhance the effect of beauty i will not attempt a long essay on the subject but if america in she vastness she immense natural resource and she remote grandeur would be less imitative she would be infinitely more picturesque and interesting the president have regular evening party every other Wednesday which be call he _ levee _ the last syllable be pronounce by every one as long as possible be exactly the reverse of the french and english manner of pronounce the same word the effect of this from the very frequent repetition of the word in all company be very droll and for a long time i think people be quiz these public day the reception room be handsome particularly the grand saloon which be elegantly nay splendidly furnish this have be do since the visit of captain hall whose remark upon the former state of this room may have hasten its decoration but there be a few anomaly in some part of the entertainment which be not very courtly the company be about as select as that of a easter-day ball at the mansion-house the church at washington be not superb but the episcopalian and catholic be fill with elegantly dress woman i observe a greater proportion of gentleman at church at washington than any where else the presbyterian lady go to church three time in the day but the general appearance of washington on a Sunday be much less puritanical than that of most other american town the people walk about and there be no chain in the street as at philadelphium to prevent they ride or drive if they like it the lady dress well but not so splendidly as at baltimore i remark that it be not very unusual at washington for a lady to take the arm of a gentleman who be neither she husband she father nor she brother this remarkable relaxation of american decorum have be probably introduce by the foreign legation at about a mile from the town on the high terrace ground above describe be a very pretty place to which the proprietor have give the name kaleirama it be not large or in any way magnificent but the view from it be charming and it have a little wood behind cover about two hundred acre of broken ground that slope down to a dark cold little river so closely shut in by rock and evergreen that it might serve as a noon-day bath for diana and she nymph the whole of this wood be fill with wild flower but such as we cherish fondly in we garden a ferry at george town cross the potomac and about two mile from it on the virginian side be arlington the seat of mr custi who be the grandson of general washington 's wife it be a noble look place have a portico of stately white column which as the mansion stand high with a background of dark wood form a beautiful object in the landscape at george town be a nunnery where many young lady be educate and at a little distance from it a college of jesuit for the education of young man where as they advertisement state the humanities be teach we attend mass at the chapel of the nunnery where the female voice that perform the chant be very please the shadowy form of the veil abbess in she little sacred parlor see through a grating and a black curtain but render clearly visible by the light of a gothic window behind she draw a good deal of we attention every act of genuflection even the tell she bead be discernible but so mistily that it give she indeed the appearance of a be who have already quit this life and be hover on the confines of the world of shadow the convent have a considerable inclosure attach to it where i frequently see from the height above it dark figure in awfully thick black veil walk solemnly up and down the american lady who be the subject of one of prince hohenlohe 's celebrated miracle be point out to we at washington all the world declare that she recovery be marvellous there appear to be a great many foreigner at washington particularly french in paris i have often observe that it be a sort of fashion to speak of america as a new utopia especially among the young liberal who before the happy accession of philip fancy that a country without a king be the land of promise but i sometimes think that like many other fine thing it lose part of its brilliance when examine too nearly i overhear the follow question and answer pass between two young frenchman who appear to have meet for the first time eh bien monsieur comment trouvez-vous la liberte et l'egalite mises en action mai monsieur je vous avoue que ie beau ideal que nous autre nous avon concu de tout cela a paris avait quelque choose de plus poetique que ce que nous trouvon ici on another occasion i be excessively amuse by the tone in which one of these young man reply to a question put to he by another frenchman a pretty look woman but exceedingly deficient in _ tournure _ be stand alone at a little distance from they and close at they elbow stand a very awkward look gentleman quus est cette dame say the enquirer monsieur say my young _ fat _ with a indescribable grimace c'est la femelle de ce male indicate he neighbor by a expressive curl of he upper lip the theater be not open while we be in washington but we afterwards take advantage of we vicinity to the city to visit it the house be very small and most astonishingly dirty and void of decoration consider that it be the only place of public amusement that the city afford i have before mention the want of decorum at the cincinnatus theater but certainly that of the capital at least rival it in the freedom of action and attitude a freedom which seem to disdain the restraint of civilized manners one man in the pit be seize with a violent fit of vomit which appear not in the least to annoy or surprise he neighbor and the happy coincidence of a physician be at that moment personate on the stage be hail by many of the audience as a excellent joke of which the actor take advantage and elicit shout of applause by say i expect my service be wanted elsewhere the spit be incessant and not one in ten of the male part of the illustrious legislative audience sit accord to the usual custom of human being the leg be throw sometimes over the front of the box sometimes over the side of it here and there a senator stretch he entire length along a bench and in many instance the front rail be prefer as a seat i remark one young man whose handsome person and most elaborate toilet lead I to conclude he be a first-rate personage and so i doubt not he be nevertheless i see he take from the pocket of he silk waistcoat a lump of tobacco and daintily deposit it within he cheek i be incline to think this most vile and universal habit of chew tobacco be the cause of a remarkable peculiarity in the male physiognomy of american they lip be almost uniformly thin and compress at first i account for this upon lavater 's theory and attribute it to the arid temperament of the people but it be too universal to be explain whereas the habit above mention which pervade all class -lrb- except the literary -rrb- well account for it as the act of express the juice of this loathsome herb enforce exactly that position of the lip which give this remarkable peculiarity to the american countenance a member of congress die while we be at washington and i be surprise by the ceremony and dignity of he funeral it seem that whenever a senator or member of congress die during the session he be bury at the expense of the government -lrb- the ceremony not come under the head of internal improvement -rrb- and the arrangement for the funeral be not interfere with by he friend but become matter of state i transcribe the order of the procession as be rather grand and stately chaplain of both house physician who attend the deceased committee of arrangement the body -lrb- pall bear by six member -rrb- the relation of the decease with the senator and representative of the state to which he belong as mourner sergeant at arm of the house of representative the house of representative they speaker and clerk precede the senate of the united state the vice-president and secretary precede the president the procession be of considerable extent but not on foot and the majority of the carriage be hire for the occasion the body be inter in a open grave yard near the city i do not see the monument erect on this occasion but i presume it be in the same style as several other i have remark in the same burying-ground inscribe to the memory of member who have die at washington these be square block of masonry without any pretension to splendor chapter 21 stonington -- great fall of the potomac the greatest pleasure i have promise myself in visit washington be the see a very old friend who have leave england many year ago and marry in america she be now a widow and as i believe settle in washington i soon have the mortification of find that she be not in the city but ere long i learn that she residence be not more than ten mile from it we speedily meet and it be settle that we should pass the summer with she in maryland and after a month devote to washington we leave it for stonington we arrive there the beginning of may and the kindness of we reception the interest we feel in become acquaint with the family of my friend the extreme beauty of the surrounding country and the lovely season altogether make we stay there a period of great enjoyment i wonder not that the first settler in virginium with the bold captain smith of chivalrous memory at they head should have fight so stoutly to dispossess the valiant father of pocohanta of he fair domain for i certainly never see a more tempting territory stonington be about two mile from the most romantic point of the potomac river and virginium spread she wild but beautiful and most fertile paradise on the opposite shore the maryland side partake of the same character and perfectly astonished we by the profusion of she wild fruit and flower we have not be long within reach of the great fall of the potomac before a party be make for we to visit they the walk from stonington to these fall be through scenery that can hardly be call forest park or garden but which partake of all three a little english girl accompany we who have but lately leave she home she exclaim oh how many english lady would glory in such a garden as this and in truth they might cedar tulip-tree plane shumac juniper and oak of various kind most of they new to we shaded we path wild vine with they rich expansive leaf and they sweet blossom rival the mignionette in fragrance cluster round they branch strawberry in full bloom violet anemony heart 's - ease and wild pink with many other and still lovelier flower which my ignorance forbid I to name literally cover the ground the arbor judae the dog-wood in its fullest glory of star-like flower azalia and wild rose dazzle we eye whichever way we turn they it be the most flowery two mile i ever walk the sound of the fall be hear at stonington and the gradual increase of this sound be one of the agreeable feature of this delicious walk i know not why the rush of water be so delightful to the ear all other monotonous sound be weary and harass the spirit but i never meet any one who do not love to listen to a waterfall a rapid stream call the branch creek be to be cross ere we reach the spot where the fall be first visible this rumble turbid angry little rivulet flow through evergreen and flowering underwood and be cross _ a plusieure reprise _ by log throw from rock to rock the thundering noise of the still unseen fall suggest a idea of danger while cross these rude bridge which hardly belong to they have reach the other side of the creek we continue under the shelter of the evergreen for another quarter of a mile and then emerge upon a sight that draw a shout of wonder and delight from we all the rocky depths of a enormous river be open before we eye and so huge be the black crag that inclose it that the thunder torrent of water rush through over and among the rock of this awful chasm appear lose and swallow up in it the river or rather the bed of it be here of great width and most frightful depth line on all side with huge mass of black rock of every imaginable form the flood that roar through they be see only at interval here in a full heavy sheet of green transparent water fall straight and unbroken there dash along a narrow channel with a violence that make one dizzy to see and hear in one place a unfathomed pool show a mirror of inky blackness and as still as night in another the tortured twisted cataract tumble headlong in a dozen different torrent half hide by the cloud of spray they send high into the air despite this uproar the slenderest loveliest shrub peep forth from among these hideous rock like child smile in the midst of danger as we stand look at this tremendous scene one of we friend make we remark that the poison alder and the poison vine throw they graceful but perfidious branch over every rock and assure we also that innumerable tribe of snake find they dark dwelling among they to call this scene beautiful would be a strange abuse of term for it be altogether compose of sight and sound of terror the fall of the potomac be awfully sublime : the dark deep gulf which yawn before you the foam roaring cataract the eddy whirlpool and the giddy precipice all seem to threaten life and to appal the sens yet it be a great delight to sit upon a high and jut crag and look and listen i hear with pleasure that it be to the virginian side of the potomac that the felicity hunter of washington resort to see this fearful wonder for i never see a spot where i should less have like the annoying how d'ye of a casual rencontre one could not even give or receive the exciting be it not charming which rousseau talk of for if it be utter it could not be hear or if hear would fall most earthly dull on the spirit when rapt by the magic of such a scene a look or the silent pressure of the arm be all the interchange of feeling that such a scene allow and in the midst of my terror and my pleasure i wish for the arm and the eye of some few from the other side of the atlantic the return from such a scene be more soberly silent than the approach to it but the cool and quiet hour the mellow tint of some gay blossom and the closed bell of other the drowsy hum of the insect that survive the day and the moist freshness that forbid the foot to weary in its homeward path have all enjoyment in they and seem to harmonize with the half wearied half excited state of spirit that such a excursion be sure to produce : and then the enter the cool and moonlit portico the well-iced sangaree or still more refreshing coffee that wait you be all delightful and if to this be add the happiness of a easy sofa and a friend like my charming mr s -- to soothe you with a hour of mozart the most fastidious european might allow that such a day be worth wake for chapter 22 small land proprietor -- slavery i now for the first time since i cross the mountain find myself sufficiently at leisure to look deliberately round and mark the different aspect of man and thing in a region which though bear the same name and call itself the same land be in many respects as different from the one i have leave as amsterdam from st petersburg there every man be strain and struggle and strive for himself -lrb- heaven know -rrb- here every white man be wait upon more or less by a slave there the newly-cleared land rich with the vegetable manure accumulate for age demand the slightest labor to return the richest produce where the plough enter crop the most abundant follow but where it come not no spot of native verdure no native fruit no native flower cheer the eye all be close dark stifle forest here the soil have long ago yield its first fruit much that have be clear and cultivate for tobacco -lrb- the most exhausting of crop -rrb- by the english require careful and laborious husbandry to produce any return and much be leave as sheep-walk it be in these spot that the natural bounty of the soil and climate be display by the innumerable wild fruit and flower which make every dingle and bushy dell seem a garden on enter the cottage i find also a great difference in the manner of live here indeed there be few cottage without a slave but there be fewer still that have they beefsteak and onion for breakfast dinner and supper the herring of the bountiful potomac supply they place these be excellent relish as they call it when salt and if i mistake not be sell at a dollar and a half per thousand whiskey however flow every where at the same fatally cheap rate of twenty cent -lrb- about one shilling -rrb- the gallon and its hideous effect be visible on the countenance of every man you meet the class of people the most completely unlike any exist in england be those who farm they own freehold estate and often possess several slave yet live with as few of the refinement and i think i may say with as few of the comfort of life as the very poorest english peasant when in maryland i go into the house of several of these small proprietor and remain long enough and look and listen sufficiently to obtain a tolerably correct idea of they manner of live one of these family consist of a young man he wife two child a female slave and two young lad slave also the farm belong to the wife and i be tell consist of about three hundred acre of indifferent land but all clear the house be build of wood and look as if the three slave might have overturn it have they push hard against the gable end it contain one room of about twelve foot square and another adjoining it hardly larger than a closet this second chamber be the lodging-room of the white part of the family above these room be a loft without window where i be tell the stay company who visit they be lodge near this mansion be a shanty a black hole without any window which serve as kitchen and all other office and also as the lodging of the black we be invite to take tea with this family and readily consent to do so the furniture of the room be one heavy huge table and about six wooden chair when we arrive the lady be in rather a dusky dishabille but she vehemently urge we to be seat and then retire into the closet-chamber above mention whence she continue to address to we from behind the door all kind of genteel country visit talk and at length emerge upon we in a smart new dress she female slave set out the great table and place upon it cup of the very coarsest blue ware a little brown sugar in one and a tiny drop of milk in another no butter though the lady assure we she have a _ deary _ and two cow instead of butter she hope we would fix a little relish with we cracker in ancient english eat salt meat and dry biscuit such be the fare and for guest that certainly be intend to be honor i could not help recall the delicious repast which i remember to have enjoy at little dairy farm in england not _ possess _ but rent and at high rent too where the clean fresh-coloured bustling mistress herself skim the delicious cream herself spread the yellow butter on the delightful brown loaf and place she curd and she junket and all the delicate treasure other dairy before we and then with hospitable pride place herself at she board and add the more delicate relish of good tea and good cream i remember all this and do not think the difference atone for by the dignity of have my cup hand to I by a slave the lady i now visit however greatly surpass my quondam friend in the refinement of she conversation she amble through the whole time the visit last in a sort of elegantly mince familiar style of gossip which i think she be imitate from some novel for i be tell she be a great novel reader and leave all household occupation to be perform by she slave to say she address we in a tone of equality will give no adequate idea of she manner i be persuade that no misgiving on the subject ever enter she head she tell we that they estate be she divi - _ dend _ of she father 's property she have marry a first cousin who be as fine a gentleman as she be a lady and as idle prefer hunting -lrb- as they call shooting -rrb- to any other occupation the consequence be that but a very small portion of the dividend be cultivate and they poverty be extreme the slave particularly the lad be considerably more than half naked but the air of dignity with which in the midst of all this misery the lanky lady say to one of the young negro attend to you young master lycurgus must have be hear to be conceive in the full extent of its mock heroic another dwelling of one of these land proprietor be a hovel as wretched as the one above describe but there be more industry within it the gentleman indeed be himself one of the numerous tribe of regular whiskey drinker and be rarely capable of any work but he have a family of twelve child who with they skeleton mother work much harder than i ever see negro do they be accordingly much less elegant and much less poor than the heiress yet they live with no appearance of comfort and with i believe nothing beyond the necessaries of life one proof of this be that the worthless father would not suffer they to raise even by they own labor any garden vegetable and they live upon they fat pork salt fish and corn bread summer and winter without variation this i find be frequently the case among the farmer the luxury of whiskey be more appreciate by the man than all the green delicacy from the garden and if all the ready money go for that and they darling chew tobacco none can be spend by the wife for garden seed and as far as my observation extend i never see any american _ menage _ where the toast and no toast question would have be decide in favor of the lady there be some small farmer who hold they land as tenant but these be by no means numerous : they do not pay they rent in money but by make over a third of the produce to the owner a mode of pay rent considerably more advantageous to the tenant than the landlord but the difficulty of obtain _ money _ in payment except for mere retail article be very great in all american transaction i can pay in pro- _ duce _ be the offer which i be assure be constantly make on all occasion and if reject then i guess we can not deal be the usual rejoinder this statement do not of course include the great merchant of great city but refer to the mass of the people scatter over the country it have indeed be my object in speaking of the custom of the people to give a idea of what they be _ generally _ the effect produce upon english people by the sight of slavery in every direction be very new and not very agreeable and it be not the less painfully feel from hear upon every breeze the mock word all man be bear free and equal one must be in the heart of american slavery fully to appreciate that wonderfully fine passage in moore 's epistle to lord viscount forbe which describe perhaps more faithfully as well as more powerfully the political state of america than any thing that have ever be write upon it oh freedom freedom how i hate thy cant not eastern bombast nor the savage rant of purpled madman be they number all from roman nero down to russian paul could grate upon my ear so mean so base as the rank jargon of that factious race who poor of heart and prodigal of word bear to be slave and struggle to be lord but pant for licence while they spurn controul and shout for rights with rapine in they soul who can with patience for a moment see the medley mass of pride and misery of whip and charter manacle and rights of slave black and democratic whites of all the pyebald polity that reign in free confusion o'er columbium 's plain to think that man thou just and gentle god should stand before thee with a tyrant 's rod o'er creature like himself with soul from thee yet dare to boast of perfect liberty : away away i would rather hold my neck by doubtful tenure from a sultan 's beck in clime where liberty have scarce be name nor any right but that of ruling claim than thus to live where bastard freedom wave she fustian flag in mockery o'er slave where -lrb- motley law admit no degree betwixt the vilely slaved and madly free -rrb- alike the bondage and the licence suit the brute make ruler and the man make brute the condition of domestic slave however do not generally appear to be bad but the ugly feature be that should it be so they have no power to change it i have see much kind attention bestow upon the health of slave but it be on these occasion impossible to forget that do this attention fail a valuable piece of property would be endanger unhappily the slave too know this and the consequence be that real kindly feel very rarely can exist between the party it be say that slave bear in a family be attach to the child of it who have grow up with they this may be the case where the petty act of infant tyranny have not be sufficient to conquer the kindly feel naturally produce by long and early association and this sort of attachment may last as long as the slave can be keep in that state of profound ignorance which preclude reflection the law of virginium have take care of this the state legislator may truly be say to be wiser in they generation than the child of light and they ensure they safety by forbid light to enter among they by the law of virginium it be penal to teach any slave to read and it be penal to be aid and abet in the act of instruct they this law speak volume domestic slave be generally speak tolerably well feed and decently clothe and the mode in which they be lodge seem a matter of great indifference to they they be rarely expose to the lash and they be carefully nurse in sickness these be the favourable feature of they situation the sad one be that they may be send to the south and sell this be the dread of all the slave north of louisiana the sugar plantation and more than all the rice grounds of georgium and the carolina be the terror of american negro and well they may be for they open a early grave to thousand and to _ avoid loss _ it be needful to make they previous labor pay they value there be something in the system of breed and rear negro in the northern state for the express purpose of send they to be sell in the south that strike painfully against every feeling of justice mercy or common humanity during my residence in america i become perfectly persuade that the state of a domestic slave in a gentleman 's family be preferable to that of a hire american help both because they be more care for and value and because they condition be bear with they they spirit do not struggle against it with that pine discontent which seem the lot of all free servant in america but the case be widely different with such as in they own person or those of they child love in vain be expose to the dreadful traffic above mention in what be they condition better than that of the kidnap negro on the coast of africa of the horror in which this enforced migration be hold i have a strong proof during we stay in virginium the father of a young slave who belong to the lady with whom we board be destine to this fate and within a hour after it be make know to he he sharpen the hatchet with which he have be felling timber and with he right hand sever he leave from the wrist but this be a subject on which i do not mean to dilate it have be lately treat most judiciously by a far abler hand -lrb- see captain hall 's travels in america -rrb- its effect on the moral feeling and external manners of the people be all i wish to observe upon and these be unquestionably most injurious the same man who beard he wealthier and more educate neighbor with the bully boast i be as good as you turn to he slave and knock he down if the furrow he have plough or the log he have fell please not this stickler for equality there be a glaring falsehood on the very surface of such a man 's principle that be revolt it be not among the higher class that the possession of slave produce the worst effect among the poorer class of landholder who be often as profoundly ignorant as the negro they own the effect of this plenary power over male and female be most demoralising and the kind of coarse not to say brutal authority which be exercise furnish the most disgusting moral spectacle i ever witness in all rank however it appear to I that the greatest and best feeling of the human heart be paralyze by the relative position of slave and owner the character the heart of child be irretrievably injure by it in virginium we board for some time in a family consist of a widow and she four daughter and i there witness a scene strongly indicative of the effect i have mention a young female slave about eight year of age have find on the shelf of a cupboard a biscuit temptingly buttered of which she have eat a considerable portion before she be observe the butter have be copiously sprinkle with arsenic for the destruction of rat and have be thus most incautiously place by one of the young lady of the family as soon as the circumstance be know the lady of the house come to consult I as to what have best be do for the poor child i immediately mix a large cup of mustard and water -lrb- the most rapid of all emetic -rrb- and get the little girl to swallow it the desire effect be instantly produce but the poor child partly from nausea and partly from the terror of hear she death proclaim by half a dozen voice round she tremble so violently that i think she would fall i sit down in the court where we be stand and as a matter of course take the little sufferer in my lap i observe a general titter among the white member of the family while the black stand aloof and look stupify the youngest of the family a little girl about the age of the young slave after gaze at I for a few moment in utter astonishment exclaim my if mr trollope have not take she in she lap and wipe she nasty mouth why i would not have touch she mouth for two hundred dollar the little slave be lay on a bed and i return to my own apartment some time afterwards i send to enquire for she and learn that she be in great pain i immediately go myself to enquire farther when another young lady of the family the one by whose imprudence the accident have occur meet my anxious enquiry with ill-suppressed mirth -- tell I they have send for the doctor -- and then burst into uncontrollable laughter the idea of really sympathise in the suffering of a slave appear to they as absurd as weep over a calf that have be slaughter by the butcher the daughter of my hostess be as lovely as feature and complexion could make they but the neutralize effect of this total want of feeling upon youth and beauty must be witness to be conceive there seem in general a strong feeling throughout america that none of the negro race can be trust and as fear accord to they notion be the only principle by which a slave can be actuate it be not wonderful if the imputation be just but i be persuade that be a different mode of moral treatment pursue most important and beneficial consequence would result from it negro be very sensible to kindness and might i think be render more profitably obedient by the practice of it towards they than by any other mode of discipline whatever to emancipate they entirely throughout the union can not i conceive be think of consistently with the safety of the country but be the possibility of amelioration take into the consideration of the legislature with all the wisdom justice and mercy that could be bring to bear upon it the negro population of the union might cease to be a terror and they situation no longer be a subject either of indignation or of pity i observe every where throughout the slave state that all article which can be take and consume be constantly lock up and in large family where the extent of the establishment multiply the number of key these be deposit in a basket and consign to the care of a little negress who be constantly see follow she mistress 's step with this basket on she arm and this not only that the key may be always at hand but because should they be out of sight one moment that moment would infallibly be employ for purpose of plunder it seem to I in this instance as in many other that the close personal attendance of these sable shadow must be very annoying but whenever i mention it i be assure that no such feeling exist and that use render they almost unconscious of they presence i have indeed frequent opportunity of observe this habitual indifference to the presence of they slave they talk of they of they condition of they faculty of they conduct exactly as if they be incapable of hear i once see a young lady who when seat at table between a male and a female be induce by she modesty to intrude on the chair of she female neighbor to avoid the indelicacy of touch the elbow of a man i once see this very young lady lace she stay with the most perfect composure before a negro footman a virginian gentleman tell I that ever since he have marry he have be accustom to have a negro girl sleep in the same chamber with himself and he wife i ask for what purpose this nocturnal attendance be necessary good heaven be the reply if i want a glass of water during the night what would become of I chapter 23 fruit and flower of maryland and virginium -- copper-head snake -- insect -- election we summer in maryland -lrb- 1830 -rrb- be delightful the thermometer stand at 94 but the heat be by no means so oppressive as what we have feel in the west in no part of north america be the natural production of the soil more various or more beautiful strawberry of the richest flavor spring beneath we foot and when these past away every grove every lane every field look like a cherry orchard offer a inexhaustible profusion of fruit to all who would take the trouble to gather it then follow the peach every hedgerow be plant with they and though the fruit do not equal in size or flavor those ripen on we garden wall we often find they good enough to afford a delicious refreshment on we long ramble but it be the flower and the flowering shrub that beyond all else render this region the most beautiful i have ever see -lrb- the alleghany always except -rrb- no description can give a idea of the variety the profusion the luxuriance of they if i talk of wild rose the english reader will fancy i mean the pale ephemeral blossom of we bramble hedge but the wild rose of maryland and virginium might be the choicest favorite of the flower garden they be rarely very double but the brilliant eye atone for this they be of all shades from the deepest crimson to the tenderest pink the scent be rich and delicate in size they exceed any single rose i ever see often measure above four inch in diameter the leaf greatly resemble that of the china rise it be large dark firm and brilliant the sweetbrier grow wild and blossom abundantly both leaf and flower be considerably larger than with we the acacia or as it be there call the locust bloom with great richness and profusion i have gather a branch less than a foot long and count twelve full bunch of flower on it the scent be equal to the orange flower the dogwood be another of the splendid white blossom that adorn the wood its lateral branch be flat like a fan and dot all over with star-like blossom as large as those of the gum-cistus another pretty shrub of smaller size be the poison alder it be well that its noxious quality be very generally know for it be most tempting to the eye by its delicate fringe-like bunch of white flower even the touch of this shrub be poisonous and produce violent swell the arbor juda be abundant in every wood and its bright and delicate pink be the earliest harbinger of the american spring azalia white yellow and pink kalmia of every variety the too sweet magnolia and the stately rhododendron all grow in wild abundance there the plant know in england as the virginian creeper be often see climb to the top of the highest forest tree and bear a large trumpet - shaped blossom of a rich scarlet the sassafras be a beautiful shrub and i can not imagine why it have not be naturalized in england for it have every appearance of be extremely hardy the leaf grow in tuft and every tuft contain leaf of five or six different form the fruit be singularly beautiful it resemble in form a small acorn and be jet black the cup and stem look as if they be make of red coral the graceful and fantastic grapevine be a feature of great beauty and its wander festoon bear no more resemblance to we well-trained vine than we stunt azalia and tiny magnolia to they thriving american kindred there be another charm that haunt the summer wanderer in america and it be perhaps the only one find in greatest perfection in the west : but it be beautiful every where in a bright day during any of the summer month you walk be through a atmosphere of butterfly so gaudy in hue and so varied in form that i often think they look like flower on the wing some of they be very large measure three or four inch across the wing but many and i think the most beautiful be smaller than ours some have wing of the most dainty lavender color and body of black other be fawn and rise color and other again be orange and bright blue but pretty as they be it be they number even more than they beauty that delight the eye they gay and noiseless movement as they glance through the air cross each other in chequered maze be very beautiful the humming-bird be another pretty summer toy but they be not sufficiently numerous nor do they live enough on the wing to render they so important a feature in the transatlantic show as the rainbow-tinted butterfly the fire-fly be a far more brilliant novelty in moist situation or before a storm they be very numerous and in the dark sultry evening of a burning day when all employment be impossible i have often find it a pastime to watch they glancing light now here now there now see now go shooting past with the rapidity of lightning and look like a shower of fall star blow about in the breeze of evening in one of we excursion we encounter and slew a copperhead snake i escape tread on it by about three inch while we be contemplate we conquer foe and doubt in we ignorance if he be indeed the deadly copper-head we have so often hear describe a farmer join we who as soon as he cast he eye on we victim exclaim my if you have not get a copper that be right down well do they be darnation beast he tell we that he have once see a copper-head bite himself to death from be teaze by a stick while confine in a cage where he could find no other victim we often hear terrible account of the number of these desperate reptile to be find on the rock near the great fall of the potomac but not even the terror these story inspire could prevent we repeat visit to that sublime scene luckily we temerity be never punish by see any there lizard long large and most hideously like a miniature crocodile i frequently see glide from the fissure of the rock and dart again under shelter perhaps beneath the very stone i be seat upon but every one assure we they be harmless animal life be so infinitely abundant and in form so various and so novel to european eye that it be absolutely necessary to divest oneself of all the petty terror which the crawl creep hop and buzz tribe can inspire before take a american summer ramble it be i conceive quite impossible for any description to convey a idea of the sound which assail the ear from the time the short twilight begin until the rise sun scatter the rear of darkness and send the wink chorister to rest be where you will -lrb- except in the large city -rrb- the appalling note of the bull-frog will reach you loud deep and hoarse issue from a thousand throat in ceaseless continuity of croak the tree-frog add she chirping and almost human voice the kattiedid repeat she own name through the livelong night the whole tribe of locust chirp chirrup squeak whiz and whistle without allow one instant of interval to the weary ear and when to this the mosquito add she threatening hum it be wonderful that any degree of fatigue can obtain for the listener the relief of sleep in fact it be only in cease to listen that this blessing can be find i pass many feverish night during my first summer literally in listen to this most astounding mixture of noise and it be only when they become too familiar to excite attention that i recover my rest i know not by what whimsical link of association the recapitulation of this insect din suggest the recollection of other discord at least as harsh and much more troublesome even in the retirement in which we pass this summer we be not beyond reach of the election fever which be constantly rage through the land have america every attraction under heaven that nature and social enjoyment can offer this electioneering madness would make I fly it in disgust it engross every conversation it irritate every temper it substitute party spirit for personal esteem and in fact vitiate the whole system of society when a candidate for any office start he party endow he with every virtue and with all the talent they be all ready to peck out the eye of those who oppose he and in the warm and mettlesome south-western state do literally often perform this operation : but as soon as he succeed he virtue and he talent vanish and except those hold office under he appointment every man jonathan of they set off again full gallop to elect he successor when i first arrive in america mr john quincy adam be president and it be impossible to doubt even from the statement of he enemy that he be every way calculate to do honor to the office all i ever hear against he be that he be too much of a gentleman but a new candidate must be set up and mr adam be out-vote for no other reason that i could learn but because it be best to change jackson for ever be therefore scream from the majority of mouth both drunk and sober till he be elect but no sooner in he place than the same ceaseless operation go on again with clay for ever for its war-whoop i be one morning pay a visit when a party of gentleman arrive at the same house on horseback the one whose air proclaim he the chief of he party leave we not long in doubt as to he business for he say almost in enter mr p -- i come to ask for you vote who be you for sir be the reply clay for ever the rejoinder and the vote be promise this gentleman be candidate for a place in the state representation whose member have a vote in the presidential election i be introduce to he as a english woman : he address I with well madam you see we do these thing openly and above-board here you mince such matter more i expect after he departure he history and standing be discuss mr m be highly respectable and of very good standing there can be no doubt of he election if he be a thorough-going clay-man say my host i ask what he station be the lady of the house tell I that he father have be a merchant and when this future legislator be a young man he have be send by he to some port in the mediterranean as he super-cargo the youth be a free-born high-spirited youth appropriate the proceeds to he own use trade with great success upon the fund thus obtain and return after a absence of twelve year a gentleman of fortune and excellent standing i express some little disapprobation of this proceeding but be assure that mr m be consider by every one as a very honorable man be i to relate one-tenth part of the dishonest transaction recount to I by american of they fellow-citizen and friend i be confident that no english reader would give I credit for veracity it would therefore be very unwise to repeat they but i can not refrain from express the opinion that nearly four year of attentive observation impress on I namely that the moral sense be on every point blunter than with we make a american believe that he next-door neighbor be a very worthless fellow and i dare say -lrb- if he be quite sure he could make nothing by he -rrb- he would drop the acquaintance but as to what constitute a worthless fellow people differ on the opposite side of the atlantic almost by the whole decalogue there be as it appear to I a obtusity on all point of honorable feeling cervante laugh spain 's chivalry away but he do not laugh away that better part of chivalry so beautifully describe by burke as the unbought grace of life the cheap defense of nation that chastity of honor which feel a stain as a wound which ennoble whatever it touch and by which vice itself lose half its evil by lose all its grossness the better part of chivalry still mix with gentle blood in every part of europe nor be it less fondly guard than when sword and buckler aid its defense perhaps this unbought grace of life be not to be look for where chivalry have never be i certainly do not lament the decadence of knight errantry nor wish to exchange the protection of the law for that of the doughtiest champion who ever set lance in rest but i do in truth believe that this knightly sensitiveness of honorable feeling be the best antidote to the petty soul-degrading transaction of every day life and that the total want of it be one reason why this free-born race care so very little for the vulgar virtue call probity chapter 24 journey to philadelphium -- chesapeak and delaware canal -- city of philadelphium -- miss wright 's lecture in the latter part of August 1830 we pay a visit to philadelphium and notwithstanding the season we be so fortunate as to have both bright and temperate weather for the expedition the road from washington to baltimore which be we first day 's journey be interesting in summer from the variety of luxuriance of the foliage which border great part of it we pass the night at baltimore and embark next morning on board a steam-boat for philadelphium the scenery of the elk river upon which you enter soon after leave the port of baltimore be not beautiful we embark at six in the morning and at twelve reach the chesapeak and delaware canal we then quit the steam-boat and walk two or three hundred yard to the canal where we get on board a pretty little deck boat sheltered by a neat awning and draw by four horse this canal cut across the state of delaware and connect the chesapeak and delaware river : it have be a work of great expense though the distance be not more than thirteen mile for a considerable part of this distance the cutting have be very deep and the bank be in many part thatch to prevent they crumble at the point where the cutting be deepest a light bridge be throw across which from its great height form a striking object to the traveller pass below it every boat that pass this canal pay a toll of twenty dollar nothing can be less interesting than that part of the state of delaware through which this cut pass the mississippus hardly except at one we reach the delaware river at a point nearly opposite delaware fort which look recently build and be very handsome -lrb- this fort be destroy by fire a few month afterwards -rrb- here we again change we vessel and get on board another of they noble steam-boat both these change be make with the greatest regularity and dispatch there be nothing remarkable in the scenery of the delaware the stream be wide and the bank be flat a short distance before you reach philadelphium two large building of singular appearance strike the eye on enquiry i learn that they be erect for the purpose of shelter two ship of war they be handsomely finish with very neat roof and be ventilate by many window the expense of these building must have be considerable but as the construction of the vast machine they shelter be more so it may be good economy we reach philadelphium at four o'clock in the afternoon the approach to this city be not so striking as that to baltimore though much larger it do not now show itself so well it want dome and column : it be nevertheless a beautiful city nothing can exceed its neatness the street be well pave the foot-way as in all the old american city be of brick like the old pantile walk at tunbridge well this be almost entirely sheltered from the sun by the awning which in all the principal street be spread from the shop window to the edge of the pavement the city be build with extreme and almost wearisome regularity the street which run north and south be distinguish by number from one to -- i know not how many but i pay a visit in twelth street these be intersect at right angle by other which be know by the name of various tree mulberry -lrb- more commonly call arch-street -rrb- chesnut and walnut appear the most fashionable : in each of these there be a theater this mode of distinguish the street be commodious to stranger from the facility it give of find out whereabouts you be if you ask for the united state bank you be tell it be in chesnut between third and fourth and as the street be all divide from each other by equal distance of about three hundred foot you be sure of not miss you mark there be many handsome house but none that be very splendid they be generally of brick and those of the better order have white marble step and some few door frame of the same beautiful material but on the whole there be less display of it in the private dwelling than at baltimore the american all seem greatly to admire this city and to give it the preference in point of beauty to all other in the union but i do not agree with they there be some very handsome building but none of they so place as to produce a striking effect as be the case both with the capitol and the president 's house at washington notwithstanding these fine building one or more of which be to be find in all the principal street the _ coup d'oeil _ be every where the same there be no place de loui quinze or carrousel no regent street or green park to make one exclaim how beautiful all be even straight uniform and uninteresting there be one spot however about a mile from the town which present a lovely scene the water-works of philadelphium have not yet perhaps as wide extended fame as those of marley but they be not less deserving it at a most beautiful point of the schuylkill river the water have be force up into a magnificent reservoir ample and elevated enough to send it through the whole city the vast yet simple machinery by which this be achieve be open to the public who resort in such number to see it that several evening stage run from philadelphium to fair mount for they accommodation but interesting and curious as this machinery be fair mount would not be so attractive have it not something else to offer it be in truth one of the very prettiest spot the eye can look upon a broad weir be throw across the schuylkill which produce the sound and look of a cascade on the farther side of the river be a gentleman 's seat the beautiful lawn of which slope to the water 's edge and group of weeping-willow and other tree throw they shadow on the stream the work themselves be enclose in a simple but very handsome building of freestone which have a extended front opening upon a terrace which overhang the river : behind the building and divide from it only by a lawn rise a lofty wall of solid limestone rock which have at one or two point be cut into for the passage of the water into the noble reservoir above from the crevice of this rock the catalpa be every where push forth cover with its beautiful blossom beneath one of these tree a artificial opening in the rock give passage to a stream of water clear and bright as crystal which be receive in a stone basin of simple workmanship have a cup for the service of the thirsty traveller at another point a portion of the water in its upward way to the reservoir be permit to spring forth in a perpetual _ jet d'eau _ that return in a silver shower upon the head of a marble _ naiad _ of snowy whiteness the statue be not the work of phidia but its dark rocky background the flowery catalpa which shadow it and the bright shower through which it show itself altogether make the scene one of singular beauty add to which the evening on which i see it be very sultry and the contrast of this cool spot to all besides certainly enhance its attraction it be impossible not to envy the nymph she eternal shower-bath on return from this excursion we see handbill in all part of the city announce that miss wright be on that evening to deliver she parting address to the citizen of philadelphium at the arch street theater previous to she departure for europe i immediately determine to hear she and do so though not without some difficulty from the crowd who go thither with the same intention the house which be a very pretty one be fill in every part include the stage with a well dress and most attentive audience there be a larger proportion of lady present than i ever see on any other occasion in a american theater one reason for this might be perhaps that they be admit grati miss wright come on the stage surround by a body guard of quaker lady in the full costume of they sect she be as she always be startling in she theory but powerfully eloquent and on the whole be much applaud though one passage produce great emotion and some hissing she state broadly on the authority of jefferson furnish by he posthumous work that washington be not a christian one voice from the crowded pit exclaim in a accent of indignation washington be a christian but it be evident that the majority of the audience consider mr jefferson 's assertion as a compliment to the country 's idol for the hiss be soon triumphantly clap down general washington himself however give a somewhat different account of he own principle for in he admirable farewell address on decline a re-election to the presidency i find the following passage of all the disposition and habit which lead to political prosperity religion and morality be indispensable support in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who would labor to subvert these great pillar of human happiness these firmest prop of the destiny of man and citizen a volume could not trace all they connection with private and public felicity and let we with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintain without religion reason and experience both forbid we to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle whether mr jefferson or himself know best what he principle be i will not decide but at least it appear fair when repeat one statement to add the other also chapter 25 washington square -- american beauty -- gallery of fine art -- antique -- theater -- museum we morning be spend as all traveller ' morning must be in ask question and in see all that the answer tell we it be necessary to see perhaps this can be do in no city with more facility than in philadelphium you have nothing to do but to walk up one straight street and down another till all the parallelogram have be thread in do this you will see many thing worth look at the united state and pennsylvanium bank be the most striking building and be both extremely handsome being of white marble and build after grecian model the state house have nothing externally to recommend it but the room show as that in which the declaration of independence be sign and in which the estimable lafayette be receive half a century after he have shed he noble blood in aid to obtain it be a interesting spot at one end of this room be a statue in wood of general washington on its base be the follow inscription : - first in peace first in war and first in the heart of he countryman there be a very pretty enclosure before the walnut street entrance to the state house with good well-kept gravel walk and many of they beautiful flowering tree it be lay down in grass not in turf that indeed be a luxury i never see in america near this enclosure be another of much the same description call washington square here there be a excellent crop of clover but as the tree be numerous and highly beautiful and several commodious seat be place beneath they shade it be in spite of the long grass a very agreeable retreat from heat and dust it be rarely however that i see any of these seat occupy the american have either no leisure or no inclination for those moment of _ delassement _ that all other people i believe indulge in even they dram so universally take by rich and poor be swallow standing and excepting at church they never have the air of leisure or repose this pretty washington square be surround by house on three side but -lrb- lasso -rrb- have a prison on the fourth it be nevertheless the nearest approach to a london square that be to be find in philadelphium one evening while the rest of my party go to visit some object which i have before see i agree to await they return in this square and sit down under a magnificent catalpa which throw its fragrant blossom in all direction the other end of the bench be occupy by a young lady who be employ in watch the gambol of a little boy there be something in she manner of look at I and exchange a smile when she young charge perform some extraordinary feat of activity on the grass that persuade I she be not a american i do not remember who speak first but we be presently in a full flow of conversation she speak english with elegant correctness but she be a german and with a ardor of feeling which give she a decidedly foreign air in philadelphium she talk to I of she country of all she have leave and of all she have find or rather of all she have not find for thus run she lament : - they do not love music oh no and they never amuse themselves -- no and they heart be not warm at least they seem not so to stranger and they have no ease no forgetfulness of business and of care -- no not for a moment but i will not stay long i think for i should not live she tell I that she have a brother settle there as a merchant and that she have pass a year with he but she be hope soon to return to she father land i never so strongly feel the truth of the remark that expression be the soul of beauty as in look at and listen to this young german she be any thing but handsome it be true she have large eye full of gentle expression but every feature be irregular but oh the charm of that smile of that look of deep feeling which animated every feature when she speak of she own germany the tone of she voice the slight and graceful action which accompany she word all strike I as so attractive that the half hour i pass with she be continually recur to my memory i have often tax myself with feel something like prejudice against the beautiful american woman but this half hour set my conscience at rest it be not prejudice which cause one to feel that regularity of feature be insufficient to interest or even to please beyond the first glance i certainly believe the woman of america to be the handsomest in the world but as surely do i believe that they be the least attractive we visit the nineteenth annual exhibition of the pennsylvanian academy of the fine art 431 be the number of object exhibit which be so arrange as to fill three tolerably large room and one smaller call the director 's room there be among the number about thirty engraving and a much larger proportion of water-colour drawing about seventy have the pa -lrb- pensylvanian academician -rrb- annex to the name of the artist the principal historical composition be a large scripture piece by mr washington alston this gentleman be speak of as a artist of great merit and i be tell that he manner be much improve since this picture be paint -lrb- it bear date 1813 -rrb- i believe it be for this picture mr alston receive a prize at the british gallery there be a portrait of a lady which in the catalogue be designate as the white plume which have the reputation of be the most admire in the collection and the artist mr ingham be say to rank highest among the portrait-painter of america this picture be of very high finish particularly the drapery which be most elaborately work even to the pile of the velvet the management of the light be much in the manner of good but the drawing be very defective and the contour though the face be a lovely one hard and unfleshy from all the conversation on painting which i listen to in america i find that the finish of drapery be consider as the highest excellence and next to this the resemblance in a portrait i do not remember ever to have hear the word _ draw _ or _ composition _ use in any conversation on the subject one of the room of this academy have inscribe over its door antique statue gallery the door be open but just within it be a screen which prevent any object in the room be see from without upon my pause to read this inscription a old woman who appear to officiate as guardian of the gallery hustle up and address I with a air of much mystery say now ma'am now this be just the time for you -- nobody can see you -- make haste i stare at she with unfeigned surprise and disengage my arm which she have take apparently to hasten my movement i very gravely ask she meaning only ma'am that lady like to go into that room by themselves when there be no gentleman watch they on enter this mysterious apartment the first thing i remark be write paper deprecate the disgusting depravity which have lead some of the visitor to mark and deface the cast in a most indecent and shameless manner this abomination have unquestionably be occasion by the coarse-minded custom which send alternate group of male and female into the room be the antique gallery throw open to mixed party of lady and gentleman it would soon cease till america have reach the degree of refinement which permit of this the antique cast should not be exhibit to lady at all i never feel my delicacy shock at the louvre but i be strangely tempt to resent as a affront the hint i receive that i might steal a glance at what be deem indecent perhaps the arrangement for the exhibition of this room the feeling which have lead to they and the result they have produce furnish as good a specimen of the kind of delicacy on which the american pride themselves and of the peculiarity arise from it as can be find the room contain about fifty cast chiefly from the antique in the director 's room i be amuse at the means which a poet have hit upon for advertise he work or rather he work and not less at the elaborate notice of it he portrait be suspend there and attach to the frame be a paper inscribe thus : - ` portrait of the author of the fredoniad or independence preserve a political naval and military poem on the late war of 1812 in forty canto the whole compress in four volume each volume average more than 305 page by richard emmon md i go to the chesnut street theater to see mr booth formerly of drury lane in the character of lear and a mr duff in cordelium but i have see too many lear and cordelia to be easily pleased i think the whole performance very bad the theater be of excellently moderate dimension and prettily decorate it be not the fashionable season for the theater which i presume must account for the appearance of the company in the box which be any thing but elegant nor be there more decorum of demeanor than i have observe elsewhere i see one man in the lower tier of box deliberately take off he coat that he might enjoy the refreshing coolness of shirt sleeve all the gentleman wear they hat and the spit be uncease on another evening we go to the walnut street theater the chief attraction of the night be furnish by the performance of a young man who have be previously exhibit as a living skeleton he play the part of jeremiah thin and certainly look the part well and here i think must end my praise of the evening 's performance the great and most striking contrast between this city and those of europe be perceive after sunset scarcely a sound be hear hardly a voice or a wheel break the stillness the street be entirely dark except where a stray lamp mark a hotel or the like no shop be open but those of the apothecary and here and there a cook 's shop scarcely a step be hear and for a note of music or the sound of mirth i listen in vain in leave the theater which i always do before the afterpiece i see not a single carriage the night of miss wright 's lecture when i stay to the end i see one this darkness this stillness be so great that i almost feel it awful as we walk home one fine moonlight evening from the chestnut street house we stop a moment before the united state bank to look at its white marble column by the subdue light say to be so advantageous to they the building do indeed look beautiful the incongruous object around be hardly visible while the brilliant white of the building which by daylight be dazzling be mellow into fainter light and softer shadow while pause before this modern temple of theseus we remark that we alone seem alive in this great city it be ten o'clock and a most lovely cool evening after a burning day yet all be silence regent street bond street with they blaze of gas-light _ bijouterie _ and still more the italian boulevard of paris rise in strong contrast on the memory the light which outshine that of day -- the gay graceful laughing throng -- the elegant saloon of tortonus with all they variety of cool nectar -- be all remembered be it a european prejudice to deem that the solitary dram swallow by the gentleman on quit a american theater indicate a lower and more vicious state of manners than do the ice so sedulously offer to the lady on leave a french one the museum contain a good collection of object illustrative of natural history and some very interesting specimen of indian antiquity both here and at cincinnatus i see so many thing resemble egyptian relic that i should like to see the origin of the indian nation enquire into more accurately than have yet be do the shop of which there appear to I to be a unusually large proportion be very handsome many of they in a style of european elegance lottery office abound and that species of gambling be carry to a great extent i see fewer carriage in philadelphium than either at baltimore or washington but in the winter i be tell they be more numerous many of the best family have leave the city for different watering-place and other be daily follow long branch be a fashionable bathing place on the jersey shore to which many resort both from this place and from new york the description give of the manner of bathing appear to I rather extraordinary but the account be confirm by so many different people that i could not doubt its correctness the shore it seem be too bold to admit of bathing machine and the lady have therefore recourse to another mode of ensure the enjoyment of a sea-bath with safety the accommodation at long branch be almost entirely at large boarding-house where all the company live at a _ table d'hote _ it be customary for lady on arrive to look round among the married gentleman the first time they meet at table and to select the one she fancy lead she to prefer as a protector in she purpose visit to the realm of neptune she make she request which be always graciously receive that he would lead she to taste the briny wave but another fair one must select the same protector else the arrangement can not be complete as custom do not authorise _ tete a tete _ immersion chapter 26 quaker -- presbyterian -- itinerant methodist preacher -- market -- influence of female in society i have never chance among all my wanderings to enter a quaker meeting-house and as i think i could no where make my first visit better than at philadelphium i go under the protection of a quaker lady to the principal _ orthodox _ meeting of the city the building be large but perfectly without ornament the man and woman be separate by a rail which divide it into two equal part the meeting be very full on both side and the atmosphere almost intolerably hot as they glide in at they different door i spy many pretty face peep from the prim head gear of the female and as the broad-brimmed male sit down the welcome parney suppose prepare for they in heaven recur to I entre do et garde ton chapeau the little bonnet and the large hat be range in long row and they stillness be for a long time so unbroken that i could hardly persuade myself the figure they surmount be alive at length a grave square man arise lay aside he ample beaver and after another solemn interval of silence he give a deep groan and as it be by the same effort utter keep thy foot again he be silent for many minute and then he continue for more that a hour to put forth one word at a time but at such a interval from each other that i find it quite impossible to follow he meaning if indeed he have any my quaker friend tell I she know not who he be and that she much regret i have hear so poor a preacher after he have conclude a gentleman-like old man -lrb- a physician by profession -rrb- arise and deliver a few moral sentence in a agreeable manner soon after he have sit down the whole congregation rise i know not at what signal and make they exit it be a singular kind of worship if worship it may be call where all prayer be forbid yet it appear to I in its decent quietness infinitely preferable to what i have witness at the presbyterian and methodist meeting-house a great schism have lately take place among the quaker of philadelphium many object to the over-strict discipline of the orthodox among the seceder there be again various shades of difference i meet many who call themselves unitarian quaker other be hicksite and other again though still wear the quaker habit be say to be deist we visit many church and chapel in the city but none that would elsewhere be call handsome either internally or externally i go one evening not a Sunday with a party of lady to see a presbyterian minister induct the ceremony be woefully long and the charge to the young man awfully impossible to obey at least if he be a man like unto other man it be matter of astonishment to I to observe the deep attention and the unwearied patience with which some hundred of beautiful young girl who be assemble there -lrb- not to mention the old lady -rrb- listen to the whole of this tedious ceremony surely there be no country in the world where religion make so large a part of the amusement and occupation of the lady spain in its most catholic day could not exceed it : besides in spite of the gloomy horror of the inquisition gaiety and amusement be not there offer as a sacrifice by the young and lovely the religious severity of philadelphian manners be in nothing more conspicuous than in the number of chain throw across the street on a Sunday to prevent horse and carriage from pass surely the jew could not exceed this country in they external observance what the gentleman of philadelphium do with themselves on a Sunday i will not pretend to guess but the prodigious majority of female in the church be very remarkable although a large proportion of the population of this city be quaker the same extraordinary variety of faith exist here as every where else in the union and the priest have in some circle the same unbounded influence which have be mention elsewhere one history reach I which give a terrible picture of the effect this power may produce it be relate to I by my mantua-maker a young woman highly estimable as a wife and mother and on whose veracity i perfectly rely she tell I that she father be a widower and live with he family of three daughter at philadelphium a short time before she marry a itinerant preacher come to the city who contrived to obtain a intimate footing in many respectable family she father 's be one of these and he influence and authority be great with all the sister but particularly with the youngest the young girl 's feeling for he seem to have be a curious mixture of spiritual awe and earthly affection when she receive a hint from she sister that she ought not to give he too much encouragement till he speak out she show as much holy resentment as if they have tell she not to say she prayer too devoutly at length the father remark the sort of covert passion that gleam through the eye of he godly visitor and he see too the pallid anxious look which have settle on the young brow of he daughter either this or some rumor he have hear abroad or both together lead he to forbid this man he house the three girl be present when he do so and all utter a deprecate oh father but the old man add stoutly if you show yourself here again reverend sir i will not only teach you the way out of my house but out of the city also the preacher withdraw and be never hear of in philadelphium afterwards but when a few month have pass strange whisper begin to creep through the circle which have receive and honor he and in due course of time no less than seven unfortunate girl produce live proof of the wisdom of my informant 's worthy father in defense of this dreadful story i can only make the often repeat quotation i tell the tale as 'twa tell to I but in all sincerity i must add that i have no doubt of its truth i be particularly request to visit the market of philadelphium at the hour when it present the busiest scene i do so and think few city have any thing to show better worth look at it be indeed the very perfection of a market the _ beau ideal _ of a notable housewife who would confide to no deputy the important office of caterer the neatness freshness and entire absence of every thing disagreeable to sight or smell must be witness to be believe the stall be spread with snow-white napkin flower and fruit if not quite of pari or london perfection yet bright fresh and fragrant with excellent vegetable in the greatest variety and abundance be all so delightfully exhibit that object less pleasing be overlook and forget the dairy the poultry-yard the forest the river and the ocean all contribute they spoil in short for the first time in my life i think a market a beautiful object the price of most article be as nearly as i could calculate between dollar and franc about the same as at paris certainly much cheaper than in london but much dearer than at exeter my letter of introduction bring I acquaint with several amiable and interesting people there be something in the tone of manners at philadelphium that i like it appear to I that there be less affectation of ton there than elsewhere there be a quietness a composure in a philadelphium drawing-room that be quite characteristic of a city found by william penn the dress of the lady even those who be not quaker partake of this they be most elegantly neat and there be a delicacy and good taste in the dress of the young lady that might serve as a model to the whole union there can hardly be a stronger contrast in the style of dress between any two city than may be remark between baltimore and philadelphium both be costly but the former be distinguish by gaudy splendor the latter by elegant simplicity it be say that this city have many gentleman distinguish by they scientific pursuit i converse with several well inform and intelligent man but there be a cold dryness of manner and a apparent want of interest in the subject they discuss that to my mind rob conversation of all its charm on one occasion i hear the character and situation of a illustrious officer discuss who have serve with renown under napoleon and whose high character might have obtain he favor under the bourbon could he have abandon the principle which lead he to dislike they government this distinguished man have retreat to america after the death of he master and be endeavor to establish a sort of polytechnic academy at new york : in speaking of he i observe that he devotion to the cause of freedom must prove a strong recommendation in the united state not the least in the world madam answer a gentleman who rank deservedly high among the _ literati _ of the city it might avail he much in england perhaps but here we be perfectly indifferent as to what people 's principle may be this i believe to be exactly true though i never before hear it avowed as a national feature the want of warmth of interest of feeling upon all subject which do not immediately touch they own concern be universal and have a most paralysing effect upon conversation all the enthusiasm of america be concentrate to the one point of she own emancipation and independence on this point nothing can exceed the warmth of she feeling she may i think be compare to a young bride a sort of mr major waddle she independence be to she as a newly-won bridegroom for he alone she have eye ear or heart -- the honeymoon be not over yet -- when it be america will perhaps learn more coquetry and know better how to _ faire l'aimable _ to other nation i conceive that no place in the known world can furnish so striking a proof of the immense value of literary habit as the united state not only in enlarge the mind but what be of infinitely more importance in purify the manners during my abode in the country i not only never meet a literary man who be a tobacco chewer or a whiskey drinker but i never meet any who be not that have escape these degrading habit on the woman the influence be if possible still more important unfortunately the instance be rare but they be to be find one admirable example occur in the person of a young lady of cincinnatus : surround by a society totally incapable of appreciate or even of comprehend she she hold a place among it as simply and unaffectedly as if of the same species young beautiful and gifted by nature with a mind singularly acute and discriminate she have happily find such opportunity of cultivation as might distinguish she in any country it be indeed that best of all cultivation which be only to be find in domestic habit of literature and in that hourly education which the daughter of a man of letter receive when she be make the companion and friend of she father this young lady be the more admirable as she contrive to unite all the multifarious duty which usually devolve upon american lady with she intellectual pursuit the companion and efficient assistant of she father 's literary labor the active aid in all the household care of she mother the tender nurse of a delicate infant sister the skilful artificer of she own always elegant wardrobe ever at leisure and ever prepare to receive with the sweetest cheerfulness she numerous acquaintance the most animated in conversation the most indefatigable in occupation it be impossible to know she and study she character without feeling that such woman be the glory of all land and could the race be multiply would speedily become the reformer of all the grossness and ignorance that now degrade she own be it to be imagine that if fifty modification of this charming young woman be to be meet at a party the man would dare to enter it reek with whiskey they lip blacken with tobacco and convinced to the very center of they heart and soul that woman be make for no other purpose than to fabricate sweetmeat and gingerbread construct shirt darn stocking and become mother of possible president assuredly not should the woman of america ever discover what they power might be and compare it with what it be much improvement might be hope for while at philadelphium among the handsomest the wealthiest and the most distinguish of the land they comparative influence in society with that possess in europe by female hold the same station occur forcibly to my mind let I be permit to describe the day of a philadelphian lady of the first class and the inference i would draw from it will be better understand it may be say that the most important feature in a woman 's history be she maternity it be so but the object of the present observation be the social and not the domestic influence of woman this lady shall be the wife of a senator and a lawyer in the highest repute and practice she have a very handsome house with white marble step and door-post and a delicate silver knocker and door-handle she have very handsome drawing-room very handsomely furnish -lrb- there be a sideboard in one of they but it be very handsome and have very handsome decanter and cut glass water-jug upon it -rrb- she have a very handsome carriage and a very handsome free black coachman she be always very handsomely dress and moreover she be very handsome herself she rise and she first hour be spend in the scrupulously nice arrangement of she dress she descend to she parlor neat stiff and silent she breakfast be bring in by she free black footman she eat she fried ham and she salt fish and drink she coffee in silence while she husband read one newspaper and put another under he elbow and then perhaps she wash the cup and saucer she carriage be order at eleven till that hour she be employ in the pastry-room she snow-white apron protect she mouse-coloured silk twenty minute before she carriage should appear she retire to she chamber as she call it shake and fold up she still snow-white apron smooth she rich dress and with nice care set on she elegant bonnet and all the handsome _ et cetera _ then walk down stair just at the moment that she free black coachman announce to she free black footman that the carriage wait she step into it and give the word drive to the dorca society she footman stay at home to clean the knife but she coachman can trust he horse while he open the carriage door and he lady not be accustom to a hand or a arm get out very safely without though one of she own be occupy by a work-basket and the other by a large roll of all those indescribable matter which lady take as offering to dorca society she enter the parlor appropriate for the meeting and find seven other lady very like herself and take she place among they she present she contribution which be accept with a gentle circular smile and she paring of broad cloth she end of ribbon she gilt paper and she minikin pin be add to the paring of broad cloth the end of ribbon the gilt papers and the minikin pin with which the table be already cover she also produce from she basket three ready-made pincushion four ink-wiper seven paper match and a paste-board watch-case these be welcome with acclamation and the youngest lady present deposit they carefully on shelf amid a prodigious quantity of similar article she then produce she thimble and ask for work it be present to she and the eight lady all stitch together for some hour they talk be of priest and of mission of the profit of they last sale of they hope from the next of the doubt whether you mr this or young mr that should receive the fruit of it to fit he out for liberium of the very ugly bonnet see at church on sabbath morning of the very handsome preacher who perform on sabbath afternoon and of the very large collection make on sabbath evening this last till three when the carriage again appear and the lady and she basket return home she mount to she chamber carefully set aside she bonnet and its appurtenance put on she scolloped black silk apron walk into the kitchen to see that all be right then into the parlor where have cast a careful glance over the table prepare for dinner she sit down work in hand to await she spouse he come shake hand with she spit and dine the conversation be not much and ten minute suffice for the dinner fruit and toddy the newspaper and the work-bag succeed in the evening the gentleman be a savant go to the wister society and afterwards play a snug rubber at a neighbor 's the lady receive at tea a young missionary and three member of the dorca society -- and so end she day for some reason or other which english people be not very likely to understand a great number of young married person board by the year instead of go to housekeeping as they call have a establishment of they own of course this statement do not include person of large fortune but it do include very many whose rank in society would make such a mode of life quite impossible with we i can hardly imagine a contrivance more effectual for ensure the insignificance of a woman than marry she at seventeen and place she in a boarding-house nor can i easily imagine a life of more uniform dulness for the lady herself but this certainly be a matter of taste i have hear many lady declare that it be just quite the perfection of comfort to have nothing to fix for oneself yet despite these assurance i always experience a feeling which hover between pity and contempt when i contemplate they mode of existence how would a newly-married englishwoman endure it she head and she heart full of the one dear scheme -- well order home _ he _ dear delight to make she must rise exactly in time to reach the board table at the hour appoint for breakfast or she will get a stiff bow from the lady president cold coffee and no egg i have be sometimes greatly amuse upon these occasion by watch a little scene in which the bye-play have much more meaning than the word utter the fasting but tardy lady look round the table and have ascertain that there be no egg leave say distinctly i will take a egg if you please but as this be address to no one in particular no one in particular answer it unless it happen that she husband be at table before she and then he say there be no egg my dear whereupon the lady president evidently can not hear and the greedy culprit who have swallow two egg -lrb- for there be always as many egg as nose -rrb- look pretty considerably afraid of be find out the breakfast proceed in sombre silence save that sometimes a parrot and sometimes a canary bird venture to utter a timid note when it be finish the gentleman hurry to they occupation and the quiet lady mount the stair some to the first some to the second and some to the third story in a inverse proportion to the number of dollar pay and ensconce themselves in they respective chamber as to what they do there it be not very easy to say but i believe they clear-starch a little and iron a little and sit in a rocking-chair and sew a great deal i always observe that the lady who board wear more elaborately work collar and petticoat than any one else the plough be hardly a more bless instrument in america than the needle how could they live without it but time and the needle wear through the longest morning and happily the american morning be not very long even though they breakfast at eight it be generally about two o'clock that the board gentleman meet the board lady at dinner little be speak except a whisper between the married pair sometimes a sulky bottle of wine flank the plate of one or two individual but it add nothing to the mirth of the meeting and seldom more than one glass to the good cheer of the owner it be not then and it be not there that the gentleman of the union drink soon very soon the silent meal be do and then if you mount the stair after they you will find from the door of the more affectionate and indulgent wife a smell of cigar steam forth which plainly indicate the felicity of the couple within if the gentleman be a very polite husband he will as soon as he have do smoking and drink he toddy offer he arm to he wife as far as the corner of the street where he store or he office be situate and there he will leave she to turn which way she like as this be the hour for be full dress of course she turn the way she can be most see perhaps she pay a few visit perhaps she go to chapel or perhaps she enter some store where she husband deal and venture to order a few notion and then she go home again -- no not home -- i will not give that name to a boarding-house -- but she re-enter the cold heartless atmosphere in which she dwell where hospitality can never enter and where interest take the management instead of affection at tea they all meet again and a little trickery be perceptible to a nice observer in the manner of partake the pound-cake & c after this those who be happy enough to have engagement hasten to keep they those who have not either mount again to the solitude of they chamber or what appear to I much worse remain in the common sitting-room in a society cement by no tie endear by no connexion which choice do not bring together and which the slightest motive would break asunder i remark that the gentleman be generally oblige to go out every evening on business and i confess the arrangement do not surprise I it be not thus that the woman can obtain that influence in society which be allow to they in europe and to which both sage and man of the world have agree in ascribe such salutary effect it be in vain that collegiate institute be form for young lady or that academic degree be confer upon they it be after marriage and when these young attempt upon all the science be forget that the lamentable insignificance of the american woman appear and till this be remedy i venture to prophesy that the tone of they drawing-room will not improve whilst i be at philadelphium a great deal of attention be excite by the situation of two criminal who have be convict of rob the baltimore mail and be lie under sentence of death the rare occurrence of capital punishment in america make it always a event of great interest and the approach execution be repeatedly the subject of conversation at the board table one day a gentleman tell we he have that morning be assure that one of the criminal have declare to the visit clergyman that he be certain of be reprieve and that nothing the clergyman could say to the contrary make any impression upon he day after day this same story be repeat and comment upon at table and it appear that the report have be hear in so many quarter that not only be the statement receive as true but it begin to be conjecture that the criminal have some ground for he hope i learn from these daily conversation that one of the prisoner be a american and the other a irishman and it be the former who be so strongly persuade he should not be hang several of the gentleman at table in canvass the subject declare that if the one be hang and the other spare this hanging would be a murder and not a legal execution in discuss this point it be state that very nearly all the white man who have suffer death since the declaration of independence have be irishman what truth there may be in this general statement i have no means of ascertain all i know be that i hear it make on this occasion however the irishman be hang and the american be not chapter 27 return to stonington -- thunderstorm -- emigrant -- illness -- alexandrium a fortnight pass rapidly away in this great city and doubtless there be still much leave unseen when we quit it accord to previous arrangement to return to we friend in maryland we come back by a different route go by land from newcastle to french town instead of pass by the canal we reach baltimore in the middle of the night but finish we repose on board the steam-boat and start for washington at five o'clock the next morning we short abode amid the heat and closeness of a city make we enjoy more than ever the beautiful scenery around stonington the autumn which soon advance upon we again clothe the wood in color too vary and gaudy to be conceive by those who have never quit europe and the stately maize wave its flow tassel as the long droop blossom be call make every field look like a little forest a rainy spring have be follow by a summer of unusual heat and towards the autumn frequent thunderstorm of terrific violence clear the air but at the same time frighten we almost out of we wit on one occasion i be expose with my child to the full fury of one of these awful visitation we suffer considerable terror during this storm but when we be all again safe and comfortably sheltered we rejoice that the accident have occur as it give we the best possible opportunity of witness in all its glory a transatlantic thunderstorm it be however great imprudence that expose we to it for we quit the house and mount a hill at a considerable distance from it for the express purpose of watch to advantage the extraordinary aspect of the cloud when we reach the top of the hill half the heaven appear hung with a heavy curtain a sort of deep blue black seem to color the very air the blizzard scream as with heavy wing they seek the earth we ought in common prudence to have immediately retreat to the house but the scene be too beautiful to be leave for several minute after we reach we station the air appear perfectly without movement no flash break through the seven-fold cloud but a flickering light be visible dart to and fro behind it by degree the thunder roll onward nearer and nearer till the inky cloud burst asunder and cataract of light come pour from behind it from that moment there be no interval no pause the lightning do not flash there be no clap of thunder but the heaven blaze and bellow above and around we till stupor take the place of terror and we stand utterly confound but we be speedily arouse for suddenly as if from beneath we foot a gust arise which threaten to mix all the element in one torrent of water seem to bruise the earth by they violence eddy of thick dust rise up to meet they the fierce fire of heaven only blaze the brighter for the fall flood while the blast almost out-roar the thunder but the wind be leave at last the lord of all for after strike with wild force now here now there and bring world of cloud together in most hostile contact it finish by clear the wide heaven of all but a few soft straggle mass whence spring a glorious rainbow and then retire leave the earth to raise she half crushed forest and we poor pigmy to call back we frighted sens and recover breath as we might during this gust it would have be impossible for we to have keep we foot we crouch down under the shelter of a heap of stone and as we inform each other look most dismally pale many tree be bring to the earth before we eye some tear up by the root and some mighty stem snapt off several foot from the ground if the west indian hurricane exceed this they must be terrible indeed the situation of mr s -- 's house be consider as remarkably healthy and i believe justly so for on more than one occasion person who be suffer from fever and ague at the distance of a mile or two be perfectly restore by pass a week or fortnight at stonington but the neighborhood of it particularly on the side border the potomac be much otherwise and the mortality among the labourer on the canal be frightful i have elsewhere state my doubt if the labor poor of we country mend they condition by emigrate to the united state but it be not till the opportunity which a vicinity to the chesapeake and ohio canal give I of know what they situation be after make the change that i become fully aware how little it be to be desire for they of the white labourer on this canal the great majority be irishmen they wages be from ten to fifteen dollar a month with a miserable lodging and a large allowance of whiskey it be by means of this hateful poison that they be tempt and indeed enable for a time to stand the broiling heat of the sun in a most noxious climate : for through such close to the romantic but unwholesome potomac the line of the canal have hitherto run the situation of these poor stranger when they sink at last in _ the fever _ which sooner or later be sure to overtake they be dreadful there be a strong feeling against the irish in every part of the union but they will do twice as much work as a negro and therefore they be employ when they fall sick they may and must look with envy on the slave around they for they be care for they be watch and physic as a valuable horse be watch and physic : not so the irishman he be literally throw on one side and a new comer take he place detail of they suffering and unheeded death too painful to dwell upon often reach we on one occasion a farmer call at the house tell the family that a poor man apparently in a die condition be lie beside a little brook at the distance of a quarter of a mile the spot be immediately visit by some of the family and there in truth lay a poor creature who be already past the power of speak he be convey to the house and expire during the night by enquire at the canal it be find that he be a irish labourer who have fall sick and spend he last cent have leave the stifle shanty where he lay in the desperate attempt of find he way to washington with what hope i know not he do not appear above twenty and as i look on he pale young face which even in death express suffer i think that perhaps he have leave a mother and a home to seek wealth in america i see he bury under a group of locust tree he very name unknown to those who lay he there but the attendance of the whole family at the grave give a sort of decency to he funeral which rarely in that country honor the poor relic of british dust : but no clergyman attend no prayer be say no bell be toll these indeed be ceremony unthought of and in fact unattainable without much expense at such a distance from a town have the poor youth be a american he would have be lay in the earth in the same unceremonious manner but have this poor irish lad fall sick in equal poverty and destitution among he own people he would have find a blanket to wrap he shiver limb and a kindred hand to close he eye the poor of great britain whom distress or a spirit of enterprise tempt to try another land ought for many reason to repair to canada there they would meet co-operation and sympathy instead of malice hatred and all uncharitableness i frequently hear vehement complaint and constantly meet the same in the newspaper of a practice state to be very generally adopt in britain of send out cargo of parish pauper to the united state a baltimore paper head some such remark with the word infamous conduct and then tell we of a cargo of aged pauper just arrive from england add john bull have squeeze the orange and now insolently cast the skin in we face such be the feeling it will be readily believe that these unfortunate be not likely to meet much kindness or sympathy in sickness or in suffering of any kind if these american statement be correct and that different parish be induce from a excessive population to pay the voyage and outfit of some of they pauper across the atlantic why not send they to canada it be certain however that all the enquiry i could make fail to substantiate these american statement all i could ascertain be that many english and irish poor arrive yearly in the united state with no other resource than what they labor furnish this though very different from the newspaper story be quite enough to direct attention to the subject it be generally acknowledge that the suffering among we labor class arise from the excess of we population and it be impossible to see such a country as canada its extent its fertility its fine climate and know that it be british ground without feel equal sorrow and astonishment that it be not make the means of relief how earnestly it be to be wish that some part of that excellent feeling which be for ever at work in england to help the distressed could be direct systematically to the object of emigration to the canada large sum be annually raise for charitable purpose by weekly subscription of one penny be only a part of the money so obtain to be devote to this object hundred of family might yearly be send to people we own land the religious feeling which so naturally mix with every charitable purpose would there find the best field for its exertion where could a missionary whether protestant or catholic find a holier mission than that which send he to comfort and instruct he countryman in the wilderness or where could he reap a higher reward in this world than see that wilderness grow into fertile field under the hand of he flock i never see so many autumn flower as grow in the wood and sheep-walk of maryland a second spring seem to clothe the field but with grief and shame i confess that of these precious blossom i scarcely know a single name i think the michaelma daisy in wonderful variety of form and color and the prickly pear be almost my only acquaintance : let no one visit america without have first study botany it be a amusement as a clever friend of mine once tell I that help one wonderfully up and down hill and must be superlatively valuable in america both from the plentiful lack of other amusement and the plentiful material for enjoyment in this besides if one be die to know the name of any of these lovely stranger it be a thousand to one against he find any one who can tell it the prettiest eclipse of the moon i ever see be that of September of this year -lrb- 1830 -rrb- we have be pass some hour amid the solemn scenery of the potomac fall and just as we be prepare to quit it the full moon arise above the black pine with half we shadow throw across she the effect of she rise thus eclipse be more strange more striking by far than watch the gradual obscuration and as i turn to look at the black chasm behind I and see the deadly alder and the poison-vine wave darkly on the rock around i think the scene want nothing but the figure of a palsied crone pluck the fatal branch to concoct some charm of mischief whether some such maga dog my step i know not but many hour have not elapse ere i again feel the noxious influence of a american autumn this fever build in th ' eclipse speedily bring I very low and though it last not so long as that of the preceding year i feel persuade i should never recover from it though my foreboding be not verify by the event it be declare that change of air be necessary and it be arrange for I -lrb- for i be perfectly incapable of settle any thing for myself -rrb- that i should go to alexandria a pretty town at the distance of about fifteen mile which have the reputation of possess a skilful physician it be not without regret that we quit we friend at stonington but the prescription prove in a great degree efficacious a few week ' residence in alexandrium restore my strength sufficiently to enable I to walk to a beautiful little grassy terrace perfectly out of the town but very near it from whence we could watch the various craft that people the potomac between alexandrium and washington but though gradually regain strength i be still far from well all plan for winter gaiety be abandon and find ourselves very well accommodate we decide upon pass the winter where we be it prove unusually severe the potomac be so completely freeze as to permit considerable traffic to be carry on by cart cross on the ice from maryland this have not occur before for thirty year the distance be a mile and a quarter and we venture to brave the cold and walk across this bright and slippery mirror to make a visit on the opposite shore the fatigue of keep we foot be by no means inconsiderable but we be reward by see as noble a winter landscape around we as the eye could look upon when at length the frost give way the melting snow produce fresh so violent as to carry away the long bridge at washington large fragment of it with the railing still erect come float down amidst vast block of ice during many successive day and it be curious to see the intrepidity with which the young sailor of alexandrium perile they life to make spoil of the timber the solar eclipse of the 12th of February 1831 be nearer total than any i ever see or ever shall see it be completely annular at alexandrium and the bright ring which surround the moon 's shadow though only 81  in breadth give light sufficient to read the smallest print the darkness be considerably lessen by the snow which as the day be perfectly unclouded reflect brightly all the light that be leave we notwithstanding the extreme cold we pass the whole time in the open air on a rise ground near the river in this position many beautiful effect be perceptible the rapid approach and change of shadow the dusky hue of the broad potomac that seem to drink in the feeble light which its snow-covered bank give back to the air the gradual change of every object from the coloring of bright sunshine to one sad universal tint of dingy purple the melancholy lowing of the cattle and the short but remarkable suspension of all labor give something of mystery and awe to the scene that we shall long remember during the follow month i occupy myself partly in revise my note and arrange these page and partly in make myself acquaint as much as possible with the literature of the country while reading and transcribe my note i undergo a strict self-examination i pass in review all i have see all i have feel and scrupulously challenge every expression of disapprobation the result be that i omit in transcription much that i have write as contain unnecessary detail of thing which have displeased I yet as i do so i feel strongly that there be no exaggeration in they but such detail though true might be ill-natured and i retain no more than be necessary to convey the general impression receive while thus review my note i discover that many point which all scribble traveller be expect to notice have be omit but a few page of miscellaneous observation will i think supply all that can be expect from so idle a pen chapter 28 american cooking -- evening party -- dress -- sleighing -- money-getting habit -- tax-gatherer 's notice -- indian summer -- anecdote of the duke of saxe-weimar in relate all i know of america i surely must not omit so important a feature as the cooking there be sundry anomaly in the mode of serve even a first-rate table but as these be altogether matter of custom they by no means indicate either indifference or neglect in this important business and whether castor be place on the table or on the sideboard whether soup fish patty and salad be eat in orthodox order or not signify but little i be hardly capable i fear of give a very erudite critique on the subject general observation therefore must suffice the ordinary mode of living be abundant but not delicate they consume a extraordinary quantity of bacon ham and beaf-steak appear morning noon and night in eat they mix thing together with the strangest incongruity imaginable i have see egg and oyster eat together : the sempiternal ham with apple-sauce beefsteak with stewed peach and salt fish with onion the bread be everywhere excellent but they rarely enjoy it themselves as they insist upon eat horrible half-baked hot roll both morning and evening the butter be tolerable but they have seldom such cream as every little dairy produce in england in fact the cow be very roughly keep compare with we 's common vegetable be abundant and very fine i never see sea-cale or cauliflower and either from the want of summer rain or the want of care the harvest of green vegetable be much sooner over than with we they eat the indian corn in a great variety of form sometimes it be dress green and eat like pea sometimes it be break to piece when dry boil plain and bring to table like rice this dish be call hominy the flour of it be make into at least a dozen different sort of cake but in my opinion all bad this flour mix in the proportion of one-third with fine wheat make by far the best bread i ever taste i never see turbot salmon or fresh cod but the rock and shad be excellent there be a great want of skill in the composition of sauce not only with fish but with every thing they use very few make dish and i never see any that would be approve by we savant they have a excellent wild duck call the canvass back which if delicately serve would surpass the black cock but the game be very inferior to we 's they have no hare and i never see a pheasant they seldom indulge in second course with all they ingenious temptation to the eat a second dinner but almost every table have its dessert -lrb- invariably pronounced desart -rrb- which be place on the table before the cloth be remove and consist of pastry preserved fruit and cream they be extravagantly fond to use they own phrase of pudding pie and all kind of sweet particularly the lady but be by no means such connoisseur in soup and ragout as the gastronome of europe almost every one drink water at table and by a strange contradiction in the country where hard drinking be more prevalent than in any other there be less wine take at dinner lady rarely exceed one glass and the great majority of female never take any in fact the hard drinking so universally acknowledge do not take place at jovial dinner but to speak plain english in solitary dram-drinking coffee be not serve immediately after dinner but make part of the serious matter of tea-drinking which come some hour later mixed dinner party of lady and gentleman be very rare and unless several foreigner be present but little conversation pass at table it certainly do not in my opinion add to the well order a dinner table to set the gentleman at one end of it and the lady at the other but it be very rarely that you find it otherwise they large evening party be supremely dull the man sometimes play card by themselves but if a lady play it must not be for money no ecarte no chess very little music and that little lamentably bad among the black i hear some good voice singing in tune but i scarcely ever hear a white american male or female go through a air without be out of tune before the end of it nor do i ever meet any trace of science in the singing i hear in society to eat inconceivable quantity of cake ice and pickle oyster -- and to show half they revenue in silk and satin seem to be the chief object they have in these party the most agreeable meeting i be assure by all the young people be those to which no married woman be admit of the truth of this statement i have not the least doubt these exclusive meeting occur frequently and often last to a late hour on these occasion i believe they generally dance at regular ball marry lady be admit but seldom take much part in the amusement the refreshment be always profuse and costly but take in a most uncomfortable manner i have know many private ball where every thing be on the most liberal scale of expense where the gentleman sit down to supper in one room while the lady take theirs standing in another what we call picnic be very rare and when attempt do not often succeed well the two sex can hardly mix for the greater part of a day without great restraint and ennui it be quite contrary to they general habit the favorite indulgence of the gentleman -lrb- smoking cigar and drinking spirit -rrb- can neither be indulge in with decency nor resign with complacency the lady have strange way of add to they charm they powder themselves immoderately face neck and arm with pulverise starch the effect be indescribably disagreeable by daylight and not very favourable at any time they be also most unhappily partial to false hair which they wear in surprising quantity this be the more to be lament as they generally have very fine hair of they own i suspect this fashion to arise from a indolent mode of make they toilet and from accomplished lady ' maid not be very abundant it be less trouble to append a bunch of wave curl here there and every where than to keep they native tress in perfect order though the expense of the lady ' dress greatly exceed in proportion to they general style of live that of the lady of europe it be very far -lrb- except in philadelphium -rrb- from be in good taste they do not consult the season in the color or in the style of they costume i have often shiver at see a young beauty pick she way through the snow with a pale rose-coloured bonnet set on the very top of she head : i know one young lady whose pretty little ear be actually frostbitten from be thus expose they never wear muff or boot and appear extremely shock at the sight of comfortable walking shoe and cotton stocking even when they have to step to they sleigh over ice and snow they walk in the middle of winter with they poor little toe pinch into a miniature slipper incapable of exclude as much moisture as might bedew a primrose i must say in they excuse however that they have almost universally extremely pretty foot they do not walk well nor in fact do they ever appear to advantage when in movement i know not why this should be for they have abundance of french dancing-master among they but somehow or other it be the fact i fancied i could often trace a mixture of affectation and of shyness in they little mincing unsteady step and the ever change position of the hand they do not dance well perhaps i should rather say they do not look well when dance lovely as they face be they can not in a position that exhibit the whole person atone for the want of _ tournure _ and for the universal defect in the formation of the bust which be rarely full or gracefully form i never see a american man walk or stand well notwithstanding they frequent militia drilling they be nearly all hollow chest and round shoulder : perhaps this be occasion by no officer daring to say to a brother free-born hold up you head whatever the cause the effect be very remarkable to a stranger in stature and in physiognomy a great majority of the population both male and female be strikingly handsome but they know not how to do they own honor half as much comeliness elsewhere would produce ten time as much effect nothing can exceed they activity and perseverance in all kind of speculation handicraft and enterprise which promise a profitable pecuniary result i hear a englishman who have be long resident in america declare that in follow in meeting or in overtake in the street on the road or in the field at the theater the coffee-house or at home he have never overhear american converse without the word dollar be pronounced between they such unity of purpose such sympathy of feeling can i believe be find nowhere else except perhaps in a ant ' nest the result be exactly what might be anticipate this sordid object for ever before they eye must inevitably produce a sordid tone of mind and worse still it produce a seared and blunt conscience on all question of probity i know not a more striking evidence of the low tone of morality which be generate by this universal pursuit of money than the manner in which the new england state be describe by american all agree in say that they present a spectacle of industry and prosperity delightful to behold and this be the district and the population most constantly quote as the finest specimen of they admirable country yet i never meet a single individual in any part of the union who do not paint these new englander as sly grind selfish and trick the yankee -lrb- as the new englander be call -rrb- will avow these quality themselves with a complacent smile and boast that no people on the earth can match they at over reach in a bargain i have hear they unblushingly relate story of they crony and friend which if believe among we would banish the hero from the fellowship of honest man for ever and all this be utter with a simplicity which sometimes lead I to doubt if the speaker know what honor and honesty mean yet the american declare that they be the most moral people upon earth again and again i have hear this assert not only in conversation and by they writings but even from the pulpit such broad assumption of superior virtue demand examination and after four year of attentive and earnest observation and enquiry my honest conviction be that the standard of moral character in the united state be very greatly lower than in europe of they religion as it appear outwardly i have have occasion to speak frequently i pretend not to judge the heart but without any uncharitable presumption i must take permission to say that both protestant england and catholic france show a infinitely superior religious and moral aspect to mortal observation both as to reverend decency of external observance and as to the inward fruit of honest deal between man and man in other respects i think no one will be disappoint who visit the country expect to find no more than common sense might teach he to look for namely a vast continent by far the greater part of which be still in the state in which nature leave it and a busy bustling industrious population hacking and hew they way through it what greatly increase the interest of this spectacle be the wonderful facility for internal commerce furnish by the river lake and canal which thread the country in every direction produce a rapidity of progress in all commercial and agricultural speculation altogether unequalled this remarkable feature be perceptible in every part of the union into which the fast spread population have hitherto find its way and form i think the most remarkable and interesting peculiarity of the country i hardly remember a single town where vessel of some description or other may not constantly be see in full activity they carriage of every kind be very unlike ours those belong to private individual seem all construct with a view to summer use for which they be extremely well calculate but they be by no means comfortable in winter the waggon and car be build with great strength which be indeed necessary from the road they often have to encounter the stagecoach be heavier and much less comfortable than those of france to those of england they can bear no comparison i never see any harness that i could call handsome nor any equipage which as to horse carriage harness and servant could be consider as complete the sleigh be delightful and construct at so little expense that i wonder we have not all get they in england lie by in wait for the snow which often remain with we long enough to permit they use sleighing be much more generally enjoy by night than by day for what reason i could never discover unless it be that no gentleman be to be find disengage from business in the morning nothing certainly can be more agreeable than the glide smoothly and rapidly along deep sink in soft fur the moon shine with almost midday splendor the air of crystal brightness and the snow sparkling on every side as if it be sprinkle with diamond and then the noiseless movement of the horse so mysterious and unwonted and the gentle tinkling of the bell you meet and carry all help at once to soothe and excite the spirit : in short i have not the least objection to sleighing by night i only wish to sleigh by day also almost every resident in the country have a carriage they call a carryall which name i suspect to be a corruption of the cariole so often mention in the pretty canadian story of emily montagu it be clumsy enough certainly but extremely convenient and admirably calculate with its thick roof and moveable drapery for every kind of summer excursion they steam-boat be the social arrangement somewhat improve would be delightful as a mode of travel but they be very seldom employ for excursion of mere amusement : nor do i remember see pleasure-boat properly so call at any of the numerous place where they might be use with so much safety and enjoyment how often do we homely adage recur to I all work and no play would make jack a dull boy jonathan be a very dull boy we be by no means so gay as we lively neighbor on the other side the channel but compare with american we be whirligig and tetotum every day be a holyday and every night a festival perhaps if the lady have quite they own way a little more relaxation would be permit but there be one remarkable peculiarity in they manners which preclude the possibility of any dangerous outbreaking of the kind : few lady have any command of ready money entrust to they i have be a hundred time present when bill for a few dollar perhaps for one have be bring for payment to lady live in perfectly easy circumstance who have declare themselves without money and refer the claimant to they husband for payment on every occasion where immediate disbursement be require it be the same even in shopping for ready cash they say send a bill home with the thing and my husband will give you a draft i think that it be during my stay at washington that i be inform of a government regulation which appear to I curious i therefore record it here every deputy post-master be require to insert in he return the title of every newspaper receive at he office for distribution this return be lay before the secretary of state who perfectly know the political character of each newspaper be thus enable to feel the pulse of every limb of the monster mob this be a well imagine device for get a peep at the politics of a country where newspaper make part of the daily food but be it quite consistent with they entire freedom i do not believe we have any such trick to regulate the disposal of office and appointment i believe it be in indiana that mr t meet with a print notice relative to the payment of tax which i preserve as a curious sample of the manner in which the free citizen be coax and reason into obey the law look out delinquent those indebted to I for tax fee note and account be specially request to call and pay the same on or before the 1st day of December 1828 as no longer indulgence will be give i have call time and again by advertisement and otherwise to little effect but now the time have come when my situation require immediate payment from all indebted to I it be impossible for I to pay off the amount of the duplicate of tax and my other debt without recover the same of those from whom it be due i be at a loss to know the reason why those charge with tax neglect to pay from the negligence of many it would seem that they think the money be mine or i have fund to discharge the tax due to the state and that i can wait with they until it suit they convenience to pay the money be not mine neither have i the fund to settle amount of the duplicate my only resort be to collect in do so i should be sorry to have to resort to the authority give I by law for the recovery of the same it should be the first object of every good citizen to pay he tax for it be in that way government be support why be tax assess unless they be collect depend upon it i shall proceed to collect agreeably to law so govern yourselve accordingly john spencer sh ` ff and collector dc nov 20 1828 nb on Thursday the 27th inst a st clair and geo h dunn esqr depart for indianopoli i wish as many as can pay to do so to enable I to forward as much as possible to save the twenty-one per cent that will be charge against I after the 8th of December next j the first autumn i pass in america i be surprise to find a great and very oppressive return of heat accompany with a heavy mistiness in the air long after the summer heat be over when this state of the atmosphere come on they say we have get to the indian summer on desire to have this phrase explain i be tell that the phenomenon describe as the _ indian summer _ be occasion by the indian set fire to the wood which spread heat and smoke to a great distance but i afterwards meet with the follow explanation which appear to I much more reasonable the indian summer be so call because at the particular period of the year in which it obtain the indian break up they village community and go to the interior to prepare for they winter hunting this season seem to mark a divide line between the heat of summer and the cold of winter and be from its mildness suit to these migration the cause of this heat be the slow combustion of the leaf and other vegetable matter of the boundless and interminable forest those who at this season of the year have penetrate these forest know all about it to the foot the heat be quite sensible whilst the ascend vapor warm every thing it embrace and spread out into the wide atmosphere fill the circuit of the heaven with its peculiar heat and smokiness this unnatural heat sufficiently account for the sickliness of the american autumn the effect of it be extremely distressing to the nerve even when the general health continue good to I it be infinitely more disagreeable than the glowing heat of the dog-day a short time before we arrive in america the duke of saxe-weimar make a tour of the united state i hear many person speak of he unaffected and amiable manners yet he could not escape the dislike which every trace of gentlemanly feeling be sure to create among the ordinary class of american as a amusing instance of this i make the follow extract from a newspaper a correspondent of the charlestown gazette tell a anecdote connect with the duke of saxe-weimar 's recent journey through we country which we do not recollect to have hear before although some such story be tell of the veritable capt basil hall the scene occur on the route between augusta and milledgeville it seem that the sagacious duke engage three or four or more seat in the regular stage for the accommodation of himself and suite and think by this that he have secure the monopoly of the vehicle not so however a traveller come along and enter he name upon the book and secure he seat by payment of the customary charge to the duke 's great surprise on enter the stage he find we traveller comfortably house in one of the most eligible seat wrapt up in he fear-nought and snore like a buffalo the duke greatly irritated call for the question of consideration he demand in broken english the cause of the gross intrusion and insist in a very princely manner though not it seem in very princely language upon the incumbent vacate the seat in which he have make himself so impudently at home but the duke have yet to learn he first lesson of republicanism the driver be one of those sturdy southron who can always and at a moment 's warning whip he weight in wild cat : and he as resolutely tell the duke that the traveller be as good if not a better man than himself and that no alteration of the exist arrangement could be permit saxe-weimar become violent at this opposition so unlike any to which he education hitherto have ever subject he and threaten john with the application of the bamboo this be one of those threat which in georgium dialect would subject a man to a rowing up salt river and accordingly down leap we driver from he box and peel himself for the combat he leap about the vehicle in the most wild-boar style call upon the prince of a five acre patch to put he threat in execution but he of the star refuse to make up issue in the way suggest content himself with assure the enraged southron of a complaint to he excellency the governor on arrive at the seat of government this threat be almost as unlucky as the former for it work the individual for whom it be intend into that species of fury which through discriminate in its madness be nevertheless without much limit in its violence and he swear that the governor might go to -- and for he part he would just as leave lick the governor as the duke he would like no better fun than to give both duke and governor a dress in the same breath could do it he have little doubt & c & c and instigate one fist to diverge into the face of the marvelling and panic-stricken nobleman with the other he thrust he down into a seat alongside the traveller whose presence have be originally of such sore discomfort to he excellency and bidding the attendant jump in with they discomfited master he mount he box in triumph and go on he journey i fully believe that this brutal history would be as distasteful to the travel and polish few who be to be find scatter through the union as it be to I : but if they do not deem the _ possibility _ of such a scene to be a national degradation i differ from they the american people -lrb- speaking of the great mass -rrb- have no more idea of what constitute the difference between this prince of a five acre patch and themselves than a dray-horse have of estimate the point of the elegant victor of the race-course could the dray-horse speak when expect to yield the daintiest stall to he graceful rival he would say a horse be a horse and be it not with the same logic that the transatlantic houynnhnm put down all superiority with a man be a man this story justify the reply of talleyrand when ask by napoleon what he think of the american sire ce sont des fier cochon et des cochon fier chapter 29 literature -- extract -- fine art -- education the character of the american literature be generally speak pretty justly appreciate in europe the immense exhalation of periodical trash which penetrate into every cot and corner of the country and which be greedily suck in by all rank be unquestionably one great cause of its inferiority where newspaper be the principal vehicle of the wit and wisdom of a people the higher grace of composition can hardly be look for that there be many among they who can write well be most certain but it be at least equally so that they have little encouragement to exercise the power in any manner more dignified than become the editor of a newspaper or a magazine as far as i could judge they best writer be far from be the most popular the general taste be decidedly bad this be obvious not only from the mass of slip-slop pour forth by the daily and weekly press but from the inflated tone of eulogy in which they insect author be laud to a american writer i should think it must be a flattering distinction to escape the admiration of the newspaper few person of taste i imagine would like such notice as the follow which i copy from a new york paper where it follow the advertisement of a partnership volume of poem by a mr and mr brook but of such be they literary notice chiefly compose the lover of impassioned and classical number may promise themselves much gratification from the muse of brook while the many-stringed harp of he lady the norna of the courier harp which none but she can touch have a chord for every heart another obvious cause of inferiority in the national literature be the very slight acquaintance with the best model of composition which be think necessary for person call well educate there may be reason for deprecate the lavish expense of time bestow in england on the acquirement of latin and greek and it may be doubtful whether the power of compose in these language with correctness and facility be worth all the labor it cost but as long as letter shall be leave on the earth the utility of a perfect familiarity with the exquisite model of antiquity can not be doubt i think i run no risk of contradiction when i say that a extremely small proportion of the higher class in america possess this familiar acquaintance with the classic it be vain to suppose that translation may suffice noble as be the thought the ancient have leave we they power of expression be infinitely more important as a study to modern writer and this no translation can furnish nor do it appear to I that they intimacy with modern literature be such as to assist they much in the formation of style what they class as modern literature seem to include little beyond the english publication of the day to speak of chaucer or even spenser as a modern appear to they inexpressibly ridiculous and all the rich and vary eloquence of italy from dante to montus be about as much know to they as the welsh effusion of urien and modr to we rousseau voltaire diderot & c be read by the old federalist but now they seem know more as naughty word than as great name i be much mistaken if a hundred untravelled american could be find who have read boileau or le fontaine still fewer be acquaint with that delightful host of french female writer whose memoirs and letter sparkle in every page with unequalled felicity of style the literature of spain and portugal be no better know and as for the wit of queen anne 's day they be lay _ en masse _ upon a shelf in some score of very old-fashioned house together with sherlock and taylor as much too antiquated to suit the immensely rapid progress of mind which distinguish america the most perfect example of english write either of we own or of any former day have assuredly not be produce by the imitation of any particular style but the fairy queen would hardly have be write if the orlando have not nor would milton have be the perfect poet he be have virgil and tasso be unknown to he it be not that the scholar mimic in write the phrase he have read but that he can neither think feel nor express himself as he might have do have he mental companionship be of a lower order they be great novel reader but the market be chiefly furnish by england they have however a few very good native novel mr flint 's franci berrian be delightful there be a vigor and freshness in he write that be exactly in accordance with what one look for in the literature of a new country and yet strange to say it be exactly what be most want in that of america it appear to I that the style of they imaginative composition be almost always affect and inflate even in treat they great national subject of romance the indians they be seldom either powerful or original a few well known general feature moral and physical be present over and over again in all they indian story till in read they you lose all sense of individual character mr flint 's history of the mississippus valley be a work of great interest and information and will i hope in time find its way to england where i think it be much more likely to be appreciate than in america dr channing be a writer too well know in england to require my testimony to he great ability as a preacher he have perhaps hardly a rival any where this gentleman be a unitarian and i be inform by several person well acquaint with the literary character of the country that nearly all they distinguish man be of this persuasion mr pierpoint be a very eloquent preacher and a sweet poet he work be not so well know among we as they ought to be mr everett have write some beautiful line and if i may judge from the specimen of he speech as preserve in the volume intitle eloquence of the united state i should say that he shine more as a poet than a orator but american fame have decide otherwise mr m flint of louisiana have publish a volume of poem which ought to be naturalise here mr hallock of new york have much facility of versification and be greatly in fashion as a drawing-room poet but i think he have somewhat too much respect for himself and too little for he reader it be i think mr bryant who rank highest as the poet of the union this be too lofty a eminence for I to attack besides i be of another parish and therefore perhaps no very fair judge from miscellaneous poetry i make a great many extract but upon return to they for transcription i think that ill-nature and dulness -lrb- ` oh ill-matched pair ' -rrb- would be more serve by they insertion than wholesome criticism the massive fredoniad of dr emmon in forty canto i never read but as i do not meet a single native who have i hope this want of poetical enterprise will be excuse they have very few native tragedy not more than half a dozen i believe and those of very recent date it would be ungenerous to fall heavily upon these the attempt alone nearly the most arduous a poet can make be of itself honorable : and the success at least equal to that in any other department of literature mr paulding be a popular writer of novel some of he production have be recently republish in england miss sedgwick be also well know among we she hope leslie be a beautiful story mr washington irving and mr cooper have so decidedly choose another field whereon to reap they laurel that it be hardly necessary to name they here i be not of course competent to form any opinion of they scientific work but some papers which i read almost accidentally appear to I to be write with great clearness and neatness of definition it appear extraordinary that a people who loudly declare they respect for science should be entirely without observatory neither at they seat of learn nor in they city do any thing of the kind exist nor do i in any direction hear of individual give to the study of astronomy i have not the pleasure of make any acquaintance with mr bowditch of boston but i know that this gentleman rank very high as a mathematician in the estimation of the scientific world of europe jefferson 's posthumous work be very generally circulate whilst i be in america they be a mighty mass of mischief he write with more perspicuity than he think and he hot-headed democracy have do a fearful injury to he country hollow and unsound as he doctrine be they be but too palatable to a people each individual of whom would rather derive he importance from believe that none be above he than from the consciousness that in he station he make part of a noble whole the social system of mr jefferson if carry into effect would make of mankind a unamalgamated mass of grate atom where the darling i be as good as you would soon take place of the law and the gospel as it be he principle though happily not fully put in action have yet produce most lamentable result the assumption of equality however empty be sufficient to tincture the manners of the poor with brutal insolence and subject the rich to the paltry expediency of sanction the falsehood however deep they conviction that it be such it can not i think be deny that the great man of america attain to power and to fame by eternally utter what they know to be untrue american citizen be not equal do washington feel they to be so when he word outweigh -lrb- so happily for they -rrb- the vote of thousand do franklin think that all be equal when he shoulder he way from the printing press to the cabinet true he look back in high good humor and with he kindest smile tell the poor devil whom he leave behind that they be all he equal but franklin do not speak the truth and he know it the great the immortal jefferson himself he who when past the three score year and ten still

interest than for any purpose of literary criticism mr hancock -lrb- one of those venerate man who sign the act of independence -rrb- in speaking of england thus express himself : but if i be possess of the gift of prophecy i dare not -lrb- except by divine command -rrb- unfold the leaf on which the destiny of that once powerful kingdom be inscribe it be impossible not to regret that mr hancock should thus have let i dare not wait upon i would it would have be exceedingly edifying to have know beforehand all the terrible thing the republic be about to do for we this prophetic orator speak the modest yet awful word above quote nearly sixty year ago in these latter day man be become bolder for in a modern 4th of July oration mr rush without wait i think for divine command give the follow amiable portrait of the british character in look at britain we see a harshness of individual character in the general view of it which be perceive and acknowledge by all europe a spirit of unbecome censure as regard all custom and institution not they own a ferocity in some of they characteristic of national manners pervade they very pastime which no other modern people be endue with the blunt sensibility to bear a universal self-assumed superiority not innocently manifest itself in speculative sentiment among themselves but unamiably indulge when with foreigner of whatever description in they own country or when they themselves be the temporary sojourner in a foreign country a code of criminal law that forget to feel for human frailty that sport with human misfortune that have shed more blood in deliberate judicial severity for two century past constantly increase too in its sanguinary hue than have ever be sanction by the jurisprudence of any ancient or modern nation civilized and refine like herself the merciless whipping in she army peculiar to herself alone the conspicuous commission and freest acknowledgment of vice in the upper class the overweening distinction show to opulence and birth so destructive of a sound moral sentiment in the nation so baffling to virtue these be some of the trait that rise up to a contemplation of the inhabitant of this isle where be the alchymy that can extract from captain hall 's work one thousandth part of the ill-will contain in this one passage yet america have resound from shore to shore with execration against he barbarous calumny but now we will listen to another tone let we see how american can praise mr everett in a recent 4th of July oration speak thus : -- we be authorise to assert that the era of we independence date the establishment of the only perfect organization of government again we government be in its theory perfect and in its operation it be perfect also thus we have solve the great problem in human affair and again a frame of government perfect in its principle have be bring down from the airy region of utopia and have find a local habitation and a name in we country among my miscellaneous reading i get hold of a american publication give a detailed and indeed a official account of the capture of washington by the british in 1814 a event so long past and of so little ultimate importance be perhaps hardly worth allude to but there be some passage in the official document which i think very amusing at the very moment of receive the attack of the british on the height of bladensburgh there seem to have be a most curious puzzle among the american general as to where they be to be station and what they be to do it be state that the british throw themselves forward in open order advance singly the american general -lrb- winden -rrb- go on in he narrative to describe what follow thus : we advanced rifleman now begin to fire and continue it for half a dozen round when i observe they to run back to a orchard they halt there and seem for a moment about return to they original position but in a few moment entirely break and retire to the left of stansburg 's line the advanced artillery immediately follow the rifleman the first three or four rocket fire by the enemy be much above the head of stansburg 's line but the rocket have take a more horizontal direction a universal flight of the center and left of this brigade be the consequence the 5th regiment and the artillery still remain and i hope would prevent the enemy 's approach but they advance singly they fire annoy the 5th considerably when i order it to retire to put it out of the reach of the enemy this order be however immediately countermand from a aversion to retire before the necessity become stronger and from a hope that the enemy would issue in a body and enable we to act upon he on term of equality but the enemy 's fire begin to annoy the 5th still more by wound several of they and a strong column pass up the road and deploy on its left i order they to retire they retreat become a flight of absolute and total disorder of beall 's regiment the general give the follow succinct account -- it give one or two ineffectual fire and flee in another place he say piteously -- the cavalry would do any thing but charge general armstrong 's gentle and metaphysical account of the business be that -- without all doubt the determine cause of we disaster be to be find in the love of life this affair at washington which in its result be certainly advantageous to america inasmuch as it cause the present beautiful capitol to be build in the place of the one we burn be nevertheless consider as a national calamity at the time in a volume of miscellaneous poem i meet with one write with the patriotic purpose of cheer the country under it one triplet strike I as rather alarming for we however soothing to america suppose george 's house at kew be burn as we intend to do would that be burn england too i think i have before mention that no work of mere pleasantry have hitherto be find to answer but a recent attempt of the kind as be make with what success can not as yet be decide the editor be comedian belong to the boston company and it be entitle the american comic annual it be accompany by etching somewhat in the manner but by no means with the spirit of cruikshank 's among the pleasantry of this lively volume be some bite attack upon we particularly upon we utter incapacity of speak english we really must engage a few american professor or we shall lose all trace of classic purity in we language as a specimen and rather a favourable one of the work i transcribe a extract from a little piece entitle saying and doings a fragment of a farce one of the personage of this farce be a english gentleman a captain mandaville and among many speech of the same kind i select the follow collin 's ode be the subject of conversation a -- r a -- a -- a it stroik I that that you manetion he the hode about hangger and ope and orror and revenge you know i have eard mr sitdown hencore in it at common garden and doory lane in the ight of she poplarity you know by the boye hall the hactin in amareka be werry orrid you be honely in the hinfancy of the istoryonic hart you know you performer never haspirate the haitch in sich vord for instance as hink and hoat and leave out the _ w _ in wice wanity you know and make nothink of homittin the _ k _ in somethink there be much more in the same style but perhaps this may suffice i have give this passage chiefly because it afford a example of the manner in which the generality of american be accustom to speak of english pronunciation and phraseology it must be remembered however here and every where that this phrase the american do not include the instruct and travel portion of the community it would be absurd to swell my little volume with extract in proof of the veracity of they contents but have speak of the taste of they lighter work and also of the general tone of manners i can not forbear insert a page from a american annual -lrb- the token -rrb- which purport to give a scene from fashionable life it be part of a dialogue between a young lady of the highest standing and she tutor who be moreover she lover though not yet acknowledge and so you will ` nt tell I say she what have come over you and why you look as grave and sensible as a dictionary when by general consent even mine ` motley be the only wear ' ` be i so grave miss blair ` be you so grave miss blair one would think i have not get my lesson today pray sir have the black ox trod upon you toe since we part ` philip try to laugh but he do not succeed he bite he lip and be silent ' i be under order to entertain you mr blondel and if my poor brain

i know whether miss blair be a fever or a ague how do you catch it sir ` really miss blair -- ` nay i see you do not like doctoring i give over and now i 'll be sensible it be a fine day mr blondel ` very ' a pleasant lane this to walk in if one 's company be agreeable ` do mr skefton stay long ask philip abruptly ` no one know ` indeed be you so ignorant ` and why do you wisdom ask that question ' in no society in the world can the advantage of travel be so conspicuous as in america in other country a tone of unpretending simplicity can more than compensate for the absence of enlarged view or accurate observation but this tone be not to be find in america or if it be it be only among those who have look at that insignificant portion of the world not include in the union have learn to know how much be still unknown within the mighty part which be for the rest they all declare and do in truth believe that they only among the son of man have wit and wisdom and that one of they exclusive privilege be that of speak english _ elegantly _ there be two reason for this latter persuasion the one be that the great majority have never hear any english but they own except from the very lowest of the irish and the other that those who have chance to find themselves in the society of the few educate english who have visit america have discover that there be a marked difference between they phrase and accent and those to which they have be accustomed whereupon they have of course decide that no englishman can speak english the review of america contain some good clear-headed article but i seek in vain for the playful vivacity and the keenly-cutting satire whose sharp edge however painful to the patient be of such high utility in lop off the excrescence of bad taste and levelling to its native clay the heavy growth of dulness still less could i find any trace of that graceful familiarity of learn allusion and general knowledge which mark the best european review and which make one feel in such perfectly good company while peruse they but this be a tone not to be find either in the writings or conversation of american as distant from pedantry as from ignorance it be not learn itself but the effect of it and so pervading and subtle be its influence that it may be trace in the festive hall and gay drawing-room of europe as certainly as in the cloistered library or student 's closet it be perhaps the last finish of highly-finished society a late american quarterly have a article on a work of dr von schmidt phiseldek from which i make a extract as a curious sample of the dream they love to batten on dr von phiseldek -lrb- not fiddlestick -rrb- who be not only a doctor of philosophy but a knight of dannebrog to boot have never be in america but he have write a prophecy show that the united state must and will govern the whole world because they be so very big and have so much uncultivated territory he prophesy that a union will take place between north and south america which will give a death-blow to europe at no distant period though he modestly add that he do not pretend to designate the precise period at which this will take place this danish prophecy as may be imagine enchant the reviewer he exhort all people to read dr phiseldek 's book because nothing but good can come of such contemplation of the future and because it be eminently calculate to awaken the most lofty anticipation of the destiny which await they and will serve to impress upon the nation the necessity of be prepare for such high destiny in another place the reviewer burst out america young as she be have become already the beacon the patriarch of the struggle nation of the world and afterwards add it would be depart from the natural order of thing and the ordinary operation of the great scheme of providence it would be shut we ear to the voice of experience and we eye to the inevitable connexion of cause and they effect be we to reject the extreme probability not to say _ moral certainty _ that the old world be destine to receive its influence in future from the new there be twenty page of this article but i will only give one passage more it be a instance of the sort of reasoning by which american citizen persuade themselves that the glory of europe be in reality she reproach wrap up in a sense of he superiority the european recline at home shine in he borrow plume derive from the product of every corner of the earth and the industry of every portion of its inhabitant with which he own natural resource would never have invest he he continue revel in enjoyment which nature have deny he the american quarterly deservedly hold the highest place in they periodical literature and therefore may be fairly quote as strike the keynote for the chorus of public opinion surely it be nationality rather than patriotism which lead it thus to speak in scorn of the successful effort of enlighten nation to win from every corner of the earth the riches which nature have scatter over it the incorrectness of the press be very great they make strange work in the reprint of french and italian and the latin i suspect do not fare much better : i believe they do not often meddle with greek with regard to the fine art they painting i think be quite as good or rather better than might be expect from the patronage they receive the wonder be that any man can be find with courage enough to devote himself to a profession in which he have so little chance of find a maintenance the trade of a carpenter open a infinitely better prospect and this be so well know that nothing but a genuine passion for the art could beguile any one to pursue it the entire absence of every means of improvement and effectual study be unquestionably the cause why those who manifest this devotion can not advance farther i hear of one young artist whose circumstance do not permit he go to europe but who be nevertheless determine that he study should as nearly as possible resemble those of the european academy be about to commence draw the human figure for which purpose he have provide himself with a thin silk dress in which to clothe he model as no one of any station he say could be find who would submit to sit as a model without clothing it be at alexandrium that i see what i consider as the best picture by a american artist that i meet with the subject be hagar and ishmael it have recently arrive from rome where the painter a young man of the name of chapman have be study for three year he mother tell I that he be twenty-two year of age and passionately devote to the art should he on return to he country receive sufficient encouragement to keep he ardor and he industry alive i think i shall hear of he again much be say about the universal diffusion of education in america and a vast deal of genuine admiration be feel and express at the progress of mind throughout the union they believe themselves in all sincerity to have surpass to be surpass and to be about to surpass the whole earth in the intellectual race i be aware that not a single word can be say hint a different opinion which will not bring down a transatlantic anathema on my head yet the subject be too interesting to be omit before i leave england i remember listen with much admiration to a eloquent friend who deprecate we system of public education as confine the various and excursive faculty of we child to one beaten path pay little or no attention to the peculiar power of the individual this objection be extremely plausible but doubt of its intrinsic value must i think occur to every one who have mark the result of a different system throughout the united state from every enquiry i could make and i take much pain to obtain accurate information it appear that much be attempt but very little beyond read writing and bookkeeping be thoroughly acquire be we to read a prospectus of the system pursue in any of we public school and that of a first-rate seminary in america we should be strike by the confine scholastic routine of the former when compare to the varied and expansive scope of the latter but let the examination go a little farther and i believe it will be find that the old fashion school discipline of england have produce something higher and deeper too than that which roar so loud and thunder in the index they will not afford to let they young man study till two or three and twenty and it be therefore declare _ ex cathedra americana _ to be unnecessary at sixteen often much earlier education end and money-making begin the idea that more learning be necessary than can be acquire by that time be generally ridicule as obsolete monkish bigotry add to which if the senior will a more prolonged discipline the junior would refuse submission when the money-getting begin leisure cease and all of lore which can be acquire afterwards be pick up from novel magazine and newspaper at what time can the taste be form how can a correct and polished style even of speak be acquire or when can the fruit of the two thousand year of past thinking be add to the native growth of american intellect these be the tool if i may so express myself which we elaborate system of school discipline put into the hand of we scholar possess of these they may use they in whatever direction they please afterwards they can never be a incumbrance no people appear more anxious to excite admiration and receive applause than the american yet none take so little trouble or make so few sacrifice to obtain it this may answer among themselves but it will not with the rest of the world individual sacrifice must be make and national economy enlarged before america can compete with the old world in taste learning and liberality the reception of general lafayette be the one single instance in which the national pride have overcome the national thrift and this be clearly referrible to the one single feeling of enthusiasm of which they appear capable namely the triumph of they successful struggle for national independence but though this feeling will be universally acknowledge as a worthy and lawful source of triumph and of pride it will not serve to trade upon for ever as a fund of glory and high station among the nation they father be colonist they fight stoutly and become a independent people success and admiration even the admiration of those whose yoke they have break cheer they while live still shed a glory round they remote and untitled sepulchre and will illumine the page of they history for ever they child inherit the independence they inherit too the honor of be the son of brave father but this will not give they the reputation at which they aim of be scholar and gentleman nor will it enable they to sit down for evermore to talk of they glory while they drink mint julap and chew tobacco swearing by the beard of jupiter -lrb- or some other oath -rrb- that they be very graceful and agreeable and moreover abuse every body who do not cry out aman to doubt that talent and mental power of every kind exist in america would be absurd why should it not but in taste and learn they be woefully deficient and it be this which render they incapable of graduate a scale by which to measure themselves hence arise that over ween complacency and self-esteem both national and individual which at once render they so extremely obnoxious to ridicule and so peculiarly restive under it if they will scorn the process by which other nation have become what they avowedly intend to be they must rest satisfied with the praise and admiration they receive from each other and turn a deaf ear to the criticism of the old world consent to be they own prodigious great reward alexandrium have its church chapel and conventicle as abundantly in proportion to its size as any city in the union i visit most of they and in the episcopal and catholic hear the service perform quietly and reverently the best sermon however that i listen to be in a methodist church from the mouth of a piquot indian it be impossible not be touch by the simple sincerity of this poor man he give a picture frightfully eloquent of the decay of he people under the united influence of the avarice and intemperance of the white man he describe the effect of the religious feeling which have recently find its way among they as most salutary the purity of he moral feeling and the sincerity of he sympathy with he forest brethren make it unquestionable that he must be the most valuable priest who could officiate for they he english be very correct and he pronunciation but slightly tincture by native accent while we be still in the neighborhood of washington a most violent and unprecedented schism occur in the cabinet the four secretary of state all resign leave general jackson to manage the queer little state barge alone innumerable contradictory statement appear upon this occasion in the papers and many a cigar be throw aside ere half consume that the disinterested politician might give breath to he cogitation on this extraordinary event but not all the eloquence of all the smoker nor even the ultradiplomatic exposition which appear from the secede secretary themselves could throw any light on the mysterious business it produce however the only tolerable caricature i ever see in the country it represent the president seat alone in he cabinet wear a look of much discomfiture and make great exertion to detain one of four rat who be run off by place he foot on the tail the rat ' head bear a very sufficient resemblance to the four ex-minister general jackson it seem have request mr van buren the secretary of state to remain in office till he place be supply this give occasion to a _ bon mot _ from he son who be ask when he father would be in new york reply when the president take off he foot chapter 30 journey to new york -- delaware river -- stagecoach -- city of new york -- collegiate institute for young lady -- theater -- public garden -- church -- morris canal -- fashion -- carriage at length in spite of the linger pace necessarily attend consultation and arrangement across the atlantic we plan be finally settle the come spring be to show we new york and niagara and the early summer be to convey we home no sooner do the letter arrive which decide this than we begin we preparation for departure we take we last voyage on the potomac we bid a last farewell to virginium and give a last day to some of we kind friend near washington the spring though slow and backward be sufficiently advance to render the journey pleasant and though the road from washington to baltimore be less brilliant in foliage than when i have see it before it still have much of beauty the azalia be in full bloom and the delicate yellow blossom of the sassafras almost rival its fruit in beauty at baltimore we again embark on a gigantic steam-boat and reach philadelphium in the middle of the night here we change we boat and find time before start in the morning to take a last look at the doric and corinthian portico of the two celebrated temple dedicate to mammon the delaware river above philadelphium still flow through a landscape too level for beauty but it be render interesting by a succession of gentleman 's seat which if less elaborately finish in architecture and garden grounds than the lovely villa on the thame be still beautiful object to gaze upon as you float rapidly past on the broad silvery stream that wash they lawn they present a picture of wealth and enjoyment that accord well with the noble city to which they be a appendage one mansion arrest we attention not only from its be more than usually large and splendid but from its have the monument which mark the family resting-place rear itself in all the gloomy grandeur of black and white marble exactly opposite the door of entrance in virginium and maryland we have remark that almost every family mansion have its little grave yard sheltered by locust and cypress tree but this decorate dwelling of the dead seem rather a melancholy ornament in the grounds we have for a considerable distance a view of the dwelling of joseph bonaparte which be situate on the new jersey shore in the midst of a extensive tract of land of which he be the proprietor here the ex-monarch have build several house which be occupy by french tenant the country be very flat but a terrace of two side have be raise command a fine reach of the delaware river at the point where this terrace form a right angle a lofty chapel have be erect which look very much like a observatory i admire the ingenuity with which the catholic prince have unite he religion and he love of a fine terrestrial prospect the highest part of the building present in every direction the appearance of a immense cross the transept if i may so express it be form by the projection of a ample balcony which surround a tower a quaker gentleman from philadelphium exclaim as he gaze on the mansion there we see a monument of fall royalty strange that dethrone king should seek and find they best strong-hold in a republic there be more of philosophy than of scorn in he accent and he countenance be the symbol of gentleness and benevolence but i overheard many unquakerlike joke from other as to the comfortable assurance a would-be king must feel of a faithful alliance between he head and shoulder at trenton the capital of new jersey we leave we smoothly-gliding comfortable boat for the most detestable stage-coach that ever christian build to dislocate the joint of he fellow man ten of these torture machine be cram full of the passenger who leave the boat with we the change in we movement be not more remarkable than that which take place in the temper and countenance of we fellow-traveller gentleman who have lounge on sofa and balanced themselves in chair all the way from philadelphium with all the conscious fascination of stiff stay and neck-cloth which while do to death the rash beauty who venture to gaze seem but a whalebone panoply to guard the wearer these pretty youth so guard from without so sweetly at peace within now crushed beneath they armor look more like victim on the wheel than dandy arm for conquest they whalebone seem to enter into they soul and every face grow grim and scowl the pretty lady too with they expansive bonnet any one of which might handsomely have fill the space allot to three -- how sad the change i almost fancy they must have be of the race of undine and that it be only when they hear the splashing of water that they could smile as i look into the altered eye of my companion i be tempt to ask look i as cross as you indeed i believe that if possible i look crosser still for the road and the vehicle together be quite too much for my philosophy at length however we find ourselves alive on board the boat which be to convey we down the raraton river to new york we fully intend to have go to bed to heal we bone on enter the steam-boat but the sight of a table neatly spread determine we to go to dinner instead sin and shame would it have be indeed to have close we eye upon the scene which soon open before we i have never see the bay of naple i can therefore make no comparison but my imagination be incapable of conceive any thing of the kind more beautiful than the harbor of new york various and lovely be the object which meet the eye on every side but the name they would only be to give a list of word without convey the faintest idea of the scene i doubt if ever the pencil of turner could do it justice bright and glorious as it rise upon we we seem to enter the harbor of new york upon wave of liquid gold and as we dart past the green isle which rise from its bosom like guardian centinel of the fair city the setting sun stretch he horizontal beam farther and farther at each moment as if to point out to we some new glory in the landscape new york indeed appear to we even when we see it by a soberer light a lovely and a noble city to we who have be so long travel through half-cleared forest and sojourning among a i be - as-good-as-you population it seem perhaps more beautiful more splendid and more refined than it might have do have we arrive there directly from london but make every allowance for this i must still declare that i think new york one of the finest city i ever see and as much superior to every other in the union -lrb- philadelphium not except -rrb- as london to liverpool or pari to rouen its advantage of position be perhaps unequalled any where situate on a island which i think it will one day cover it rise like venice from the sea and like that fairest of city in the day of she glory receive into its lap tribute of all the riches of the earth the southern point of manhatten island divide the water of the harbor into the north and east river on this point stand the city of new york extend from river to river and run northward to the extent of three or four mile i think it cover nearly as much ground as pari but be much less thickly people the extreme point be fortify towards the sea by a battery and form a admirable point of defense i should suppose no city could boast from hence commence the splendid broadway as the fine avenue be call which run through the whole city this noble street may vie with any i ever see for its length and breadth its handsome shop neat awning excellent _ trottoir _ and well-dressed pedestrian it have not the crowded glitter of bond street equipage nor the gorgeous fronted palace of regent street but it be magnificent in its extent and ornament by several handsome building some of they surround by grass and tree the park in which stand the noble city-hall be a very fine area i never find that the most graphic description of a city could give I any feeling of be there and even if other have the power i be very sure i have not of set church and square and long draw street before the mind 's eye i will not therefore attempt a detailed description of this great metropolis of the new world but will only say that during the seven week we stay there we always find something new to see and to admire and be it not so very far from all the old-world thing which cling about the heart of a european i should say that i never see a city more desirable as a residence the dwelling house of the higher class be extremely handsome and very richly furnished silk or satin furniture be as often or oftener see than chintz the mirror be as handsome as in london the cheffonier slab and marble table as elegant and in addition they have all the pretty tasteful decoration of french porcelaine and or-molu in much greater abundance because at a much cheaper rate every part of they house be well carpeted and the exterior finish such as step railing and door-frame be very superior almost every house have handsome green blind on the outside balcony be not very general nor do the house display externally so many flower as those of pari and london but i see many room decorate within exactly like those of a european _ petite maitresse _ little table look and smell like flower bed portfolio nick-nacks bronze bust cameo and alabaster vase illustrate copy of ladylike rhyme bind in silk and in short all the pretty coxcomality of the drawing-room scatter about with the same profuse and study negligence as with we hudson square and its neighborhood be i believe the most fashionable part of the town the square be beautiful excellently well plant with a great variety of tree and only want we frequent and careful mowing to make it equal to any square in london the iron railing which surround this enclosure be as high and as handsome as that of the tuillery and it will give some idea of the care bestow on its decoration to know that the gravel for the walk be convey by barge from boston not as ballast but as freight the great defect in the house be they extreme uniformity when you have see one you have see all neither do i quite like the arrangement of the room in nearly all the house the dining and draw room be on the same floor with ample folding door between they when throw together they certainly make a very noble apartment but no door can be barrier sufficient between dining and drawing-room mixed dinner party of lady and gentleman however be very rare which be a great defect in the society not only as deprive they of the most social and hospitable manner of meeting but as lead to frequent dinner party of gentleman without lady which certainly do not conduce to refinement the evening party except such as be expressly for young people be chiefly conversational we be too late in the season for large party but we see enough to convince we that there be society to be meet with in new york which would be deem delightful any where card be very seldom use and music from they have very little professional aid at they party be seldom i believe as good as what be hear at private concert in london the american have certainly not the same _ besoin _ of be amuse as other people they may be the wiser for this perhaps but it make they less agreeable to a looker-on there be three theater at new york all of which we visit the park theater be the only one license by fashion but the bowery be infinitely superior in beauty it be indeed as pretty a theater as i ever enter perfect as to size and proportion elegantly decorate and the scenery and machinery equal to any in london but it be not the fashion the chatham be so utterly condemn by _ bon ton _ that it require some courage to decide upon go there nor do i think my curiosity would have penetrate so far have i not see miss mitford 's rienzus advertise there it be the first opportunity i have have of see it play and spite of very indifferent act i be delighted the interest must have be great for till the curtain fall i see not one quarter of the queer thing around I : then i observe in the front row of a dress-box a lady perform the most maternal office possible several gentleman without they coat and a general air of contempt for the decency of life certainly more than usually revolt at the park theater i again see the american roscius mr forrest he play the part of damon and roar i think very unlike a nightingale i can not admire this celebrated performer another night we see cinderellum there mr austin be the prima donna and much admire the piece be extremely well get up and on this occasion we see the park theater to advantage for it be fill with well-dressed company but still we see many yet unrazored lip polluted with the grim tinge of the hateful tobacco and hear without cease the spit which of course be its consequence if they theater have the orchestra of the feydeau and a choir of angel to boot i could find but little pleasure so long as they be follow by this run accompaniment of _ thorough base _ whilst at new york the prospectus of a fashionable boarding-school be present to I i make some extract from it as a specimen of the enlarged scale of instruction propose for young

the catholic cathedral at baltimore be the only church in america which have at new york as every where else they show within during the time of service like bed of tulip so gay so bright so beautiful be the long row of french bonnet and pretty face row but rarely break by the unribboned head of the male population the proportion be about the same as i have remark elsewhere except at new york i never see the other side of the picture but there i do on the opposite side of the north river about three mile higher up be a place call hoboken a gentleman who possess a handsome mansion and grounds there also possess the right of ferry and to render this productive he have restrict he pleasure grounds to a few beautiful acre lay out the remainder simply and tastefully as a public walk it be hardly possible to imagine one of greater attraction a broad belt of light underwood and flowering shrub stud at interval with lofty forest tree run for two mile along a cliff which overhang the matchless hudson sometimes it feather the rock down to its very margin and at other leave a pebbly shore just rude enough to break the gentle wave and make a music which mimic softly the loud chorus of the ocean through this beautiful little wood a broad well gravelled terrace be lead by every point which can exhibit the scenery to advantage narrower and wilder path diverge at interval some into the deeper shadow of the wood and some shelve gradually to the pretty cove below the price of entrance to this little eden be the six cent you pay at the ferry we go there on a bright Sunday afternoon expressly to see the humor of the place many thousand person be scatter through the grounds of these we ascertain by repeatedly count that nineteen-twentieth be man the lady be at church often as the subject have press upon my mind i think i never so strongly feel the conviction that the sabbath-day the holy day the day on which alone the great majority of the christian world can spend they hour as they please be ill pass -lrb- if pass entirely -rrb- within brick wall listen to a earth-born preacher charm he never so wisely oh how can they renounce the boundless store of charm which nature to she vot ` rie yield the warble woodland the resounding shore the pomp of grove and garniture of field all that the genial ray of morning gild and all that echo to the song of even all that the mountain 's shelter bosom yield and all the dread magnificence of heaven oh how can they renounce and hope to be forgive how be it that the man of america who be reckon good husband and good father while they themselves enjoy sufficient freedom of spirit to permit they walk forth into the temple of the living god can leave those they love best on earth bind in the iron chain of a most tyrannical fanaticism how can they breathe the balmy air and not think of the tainted atmosphere so heavily weigh upon breast still dearer than they own how can they gaze upon the blossom of the spring and not remember the fairer cheek of they young daughter wax pale as they sit for long sultry hour immure with hundred of fellow victim listen to the roar vanity of a preacher canonize by a college of old woman they can not think it needful to salvationor they would not withdraw themselves wherefore be it do they fear these self-elected self-ordained priest and offer up they wife and daughter to propitiate they or do they deem they hebdomadal freedom more complete because they wife and daughter be shut up four or five time in the day at church or chapel it be true that at hoboken as every where else there be _ reposoire _ which as you pass they blast the sense for a moment by reek forth the fume of whiskey and tobacco and it may be that these can not be enter with a wife or daughter the proprietor of the grounds however have contrived with great taste to render these abomination not unplease to the eye there be one in particular which have quite the air of a grecian temple and do they drink wine instead of whiskey it might be inscribe to bacchus but in this particular as in many other the ancient and modern republic differ it be impossible not to feel after pass one Sunday in the church and chapel of new york and the next in the garden of hoboken that the thousand of well-dressed man you see enjoy themselves at the latter have make over the thousand of well-dressed woman you see exhibit at the former into the hand of the priest at least for the day the american people arrogate to themselves a character of superior morality and religion but this division of they hour of leisure do not give I a favourable idea of either i visit all the exhibition in new york the medicus of the republic must exert themselves a little more before these can become even respectable the worst of the business be that with the exception of about half a dozen individual the good citizen be more than contented they be delighted the newspaper lung of the republic breathe forth praise and triumph may almost pant with extacy in speaking of they native _ chef d'oeuvre _ i should be hardly believe be i to relate the instance which fall in my way of the utter ignorance respect picture to be find among person of the _ first stand _ in society often where a liberal spirit exist and a wish to patronise the fine art be express it be join to a profundity of ignorance on the subject almost inconceivable a doubt as to the excellence of they artist be very nervously receive and one gentleman with much civility tell I that at the present era all the world be aware that competition be pretty well at a end between we two nation and that a little envy might naturally be expect to mix with the surprise with which the mother country behold the distance at which she colony be leave she behind they i must however do the few artist with whom i become acquaint the justice to say that they own pretension be much more modest than those of they patron for they i have hear several confess and deplore they ignorance of draw and have repeatedly remark a sensibility to the merit of european artist though perhaps only know by engraving and a deference to they authority which show a genuine feeling for the art in fact i think that there be a very considerable degree of natural talent for painting in america but it have to make its way through darkness and thick night when a academy be found they first care be to hang the wall of its exhibition room with all the unutterable trash that be offer to they no living model be seek for no discipline as to the manner of study be enforce boy who know no more of human form than they do of the eye nose and mouth in the moon begin paint portrait if some of they would only throw away they palette for a year and learn to draw if they would attend anatomical lecture and take note not in word but in form of joint and muscle they exhibition would soon cease to be so utterly below criticism the most interesting exhibition open when i be there be decidedly colonel trumbold 's and how the patriot of america can permit this truly national collection to remain a profitless burden on the hand of the artist it be difficult to understand many of the sketch be masterly but like he illustrious countryman west he sketch be he _ chef d'oeuvre _ i can imagine nothing more perfect than the interior of the public institution of new york there be a practical good sense in all they arrangement that must strike foreigner very forcibly the asylum for the destitute offer a hint worth take it be dedicate to the reformation of youthful offender of both sex and it be as admirable in the detail of its management as in its object every part of the institution be deeply interesting but there be a difference very remarkable between the boy and the girl the boy be i think the finest set of lad i ever see bring together bright look gay active and full of intelligence the girl be exactly in reverse heavy listless indifferent and melancholy in converse with the gentleman who be the general superintendant of the establishment i make the remark to he and he tell I that the reality correspond with the appearance all of they have be detect in some act of dishonesty but the boy when remove from the evil influence which have lead they so to use they ingenuity rise like a spring when a pressure be withdraw and feeling themselves once more safe from danger and from shame hope and cheerfulness animated every countenance but the pour girl on the contrary can hardly look up again they be as different as a oak and a lily after a storm the one when the fresh breeze blow over it shake the raindrop from its crest and only look the brighter the other its silken leaf once soil shrink from the eye and be level to the earth for ever we spend a delightful day in new jersey in visit with a most agreeable party the inclined plane which be use instead of lock on the morris canal this be a very interesting work it be one among a thousand which prove the people of america to be the most enterprising in the world i be inform that this important canal which connect the water of the hudson and the delaware be a hundred mile long and in this distance overcome a variation of level amounting to sixteen hundred foot of this fourteen hundred be achieve by inclined plane the plane average about sixty foot of perpendicular lift each and be to support about forty ton the time consume in pass they be twelve minute for one hundred foot of perpendicular rise the expense be less than a third of what lock would be for surmount the same rise if we set about any more canal this may be worth attend to this morri canal be certainly a extraordinary work it not only vary its level sixteen hundred foot but at one point run along the side of a mountain at thirty foot above the top of the highest building in the town of paterson below at another it cross the fall of the passaic in a stone aqueduct sixty foot above the water in the river this noble work in a great degree owe its existence to the patriotic and scientific energy of mr cadwallader colden there be no point in the national character of the american which command so much respect as the boldness and energy with which public work be undertake and carry through nothing stop they if a profitable result can be fairly hope for it be this which have make city spring up amidst the forest with such inconceivable rapidity and could they once be thoroughly persuade that any point of the ocean have a hoard of dollar beneath it i have not the slightest doubt that in about eighteen month we should see a snug covered rail-road lead direct to the spot i be tell at new york that in many part of the state it be usual to pay the service of the presbyterian minister in the follow manner once a year a day be fix on which some member of every family in a congregation meet at they minister 's house in the afternoon they each bring a offering -lrb- accord to they means -rrb- of article necessary for housekeeping the poorer member leave they contribution in a large basket place for the purpose close to the door of entrance those of more importance and more calculate to do honor to the piety of the donor be carry into the room where the company be assemble sugar coffee tea cheese barrel of flour piece of irish linen set of china and of glass be among the article mention to I as usually make part of these offering after the party be assemble and the business of give and receive be dispatch tea coffee and cake be hand round but these be not furnish at any expense either of trouble or money to the minster for select lady of the congregation take the whole arrangement upon themselves these meeting be call spin visit another new york custom which do not seem to have so reasonable a cause be the change house once a year on the 1st of may the city of new york have the appearance of send off a population fly from the plague or of a town which have surrender on condition of carry away all they goods and chattel rich furniture and ragged furniture cart waggon and dray rope canvas and straw packer porter and drayman white yellow and black occupy the street from east to west from north to south on this day every one i speak to on the subject complain of this custom as most annoying but all assure I it be unavoidable if you inhabit a rent house more than one of my new york friend have build or buy house solely to avoid this annual inconvenience there be a great number of negro in new york all free they emancipation have be complete in 1827 not even in philadelphium where the anti-slavery opinion have be the most active and violent do the black appear to wear a air of so much consequence as they do at new york they have several chapel in which negro minister officiate and a theater in which none but negro perform at this theater a gallery be appropriate to such whites as choose to visit it and here only be they permit to sit follow in this with nice etiquette and equal justice the arrangement of the white theater in all of which be a gallery appropriate solely to the use of the black i have often particularly on a Sunday meet group of negro elegantly dress and have be sometimes amuse by observe the very superior air of gallantry assume by the man when in attendance on they _ belle _ to that of the whites in similar circumstance on one occasion we meet in broadway a young negress in the extreme of the fashion and accompany by a black beau whose toilet be equally study eye-glass guard-chain nothing be omit he walk beside he sable goddess uncovered and with a air of the most tender devotion at the window of a handsome house which they be pass stand a very pretty white girl with two gentleman beside she but alas both of they have they hat on and one be smoking if it be not for the peculiar manner of walk which distinguish all american woman broadway might be take for a french street where it be the fashion for very smart lady to promenade the dress be entirely french not a article -lrb- except perhaps the cotton stocking -rrb- must be english on pain of be stigmatize as out of the fashion every thing english be decidedly _ mauvai ton _ english material english fashion english accent english manner be all term of reproach and to say that a unfortunate look like a english woman be the cruellest satire which can be utter i remember visit france almost immediately after we have make the most offensive invasion of she territory that can well be imagine yet despite the feeling which lengthen year of war must have engender it be the fashion to admire every thing english i suppose family quarrel be most difficult to adjust for fifteen year of peace have not be enough to calm the angry feeling of brother jonathan towards the land of he father the which he hateth pass well it be hardly needful to say the most courteous amenity of manner distinguish the reception give to foreigner by the patrician class of american _ gentleman _ in the old world sense of the term be the same every where and a american gentleman and he family know how to do the honor of they country to stranger of every nation as well as any people on earth but this class though it decidedly exist be a very small one and can not in justice be represent as afford a specimen of the whole most of the house in new york be paint on the outside but in a manner carefully to avoid disfigure the material which it preserve : on the contrary nothing can be neater they be now use a great deal of a beautiful stone call jersey freestone it be of a warm rich brown and extremely ornamental to the city wherever it have be employ they have also a gray granite of great beauty the trottoir paving in most of the street be extremely good being of large flag stone very superior to the brick of philadelphium at night the shop which be open till very late be brilliantly illuminate with gas and all the population seem as much alive as in london or pari this make the solemn stillness of the evening hour in philadelphium still more remarkable there be a few tree in different part of the city and i observe young one plant and guard with much care be they more abundant it would be extremely agreeable for the reflect light of they fierce summer shed intolerable day ice be in profuse abundance i do not imagine that there be a house in the city without the luxury of a piece of ice to cool the water and harden the butter the hackney coach be the best in the world but abominably dear and it be necessary to be on the _ qui vive _ in make you bargain with the driver if you do not he have the power of charge immoderately on my first experiment i neglect this and be ask two dollar and a half for a excursion of twenty minute when i refer to the waiter of the hotel he ask if i have make a bargain no then i expect -lrb- with the usual look of triumph -rrb- that the yankee have be too smart for you the private carriage of new york be infinitely handsomer and better appoint than any i see elsewhere the want of smart livery destroy much of the gay effect but on the whole a new york summer equipage with the pretty woman and beautiful child it contain look extremely well in broadway and would not be much amiss anywhere the luxury of the new york aristocracy be not confine to the city hardly a acre of manhatten island but show some pretty villa or stately mansion the most choose of these be on the north and east river to whose margin they lawn descend among these perhaps the loveliest be one situate in the beautiful village of bloomingdale here within the space of sixteen acre almost every variety of garden scenery may be find to describe all its diversity of hill and dale of wood and lawn of rock and river would be in vain nor can i convey a idea of it by comparison for i never see anything like it how far the elegant hospitality which reign there may influence my impression i know not but assuredly no spot i have ever see dwell more freshly on my memory nor do i ever find myself in a circle more calculate to give delight in meeting and regret at parting than that of woodlawn chapter 31 reception of captain basil hall 's book in the united state have now arrive nearly at the end of we travels i be induce ere i conclude again to mention what i consider as one of the most remarkable trait in the national character of the american namely they exquisite sensitiveness and soreness respect everything say or write concern they of this perhaps the most remarkable example i can give be the effect produce on nearly every class of reader by the appearance of captain basil hall 's travels in north america in fact it be a sort of moral earthquake and the vibration it occasion through the nerve of the republic from one corner of the union to the other be by no means over when i leave the country in July 1831 a couple of year after the shock i be in cincinnatus when these volume come out but it be not till July 1830 that i procure a copy of they one bookseller to whom i apply tell I that he have have a few copy before he understand the nature of the work but that after become acquaint with it nothing should induce he to sell another other person of he profession must however have be less scrupulous for the book be read in city town village and hamlet steam-boat and stage-coach and a sort of war-whoop be send forth perfectly unprecedented in my recollection upon any occasion whatever it be fortunate for I that i do not procure these volume till i have hear they very generally speak of for the curiosity i feel to know the contents of a work so violently anathematise lead I to make enquiry which elicit a great deal of curious feel a ardent desire for approbation and delicate sensitiveness under censure have always i believe be consider as amiable trait of character but the condition into which the appearance of capt hall 's work throw the republic show plainly that these feeling if carry to excess produce a weakness which amount to imbecility it be perfectly astonishing to hear man who on other subject be sane of judgment utter they opinion upon this i never hear of any instance in which the common sense generally find in national criticism be so overthrow by passion i do not speak of the want of justice and of fair and liberal interpretation : these perhaps be hardly to be expect other nation have be call thin-skinned but the citizen of the union have apparently no skin at all they wince if a breeze blow over they unless it be temper with adulation it be not therefore very surprising that the acute and forcible observation of a traveller they know would be listen to should be receive testily the extraordinary feature of the business be first the excess of the rage into which they lash themselves and secondly the puerility of the invention by which they attempt to account for the severity with which they fancy they have be treat not content with declare that the volume contain no word of truth from begin to end -lrb- which be a assertion i hear make very nearly as often as they be mention -rrb- the whole country set to work to discover the cause why capt hall have visit the united state and why he have publish he book i have hear it say with as much precision and gravity as if the statement have be convey by a official report that capt hall have be send out by the british government expressly for the purpose of check the grow admiration of england for the government of the united state that it be by a commission from the treasury he have come and that it be only in obedience to order that he have find anything to object to i do not give this as the gossip of a coterie i be persuade that it be the belief of a very considerable portion of the country so deep be the conviction of this singular people that they can not be see without be admire that they will not admit the possibility that anyone should honestly and sincerely find aught to disapprove in they or they country at philadelphium i meet with a little anonymous book write to show that capt basil hall be in no way to be depend on for that he not only slander the american but be himself in other respects a person of very equivocal moral one proof of this be give by a quotation of the follow playful account of the distress occasion by the want of a bell the commentator call it a instance of shocking coarseness one day i be rather late for breakfast and as there be no water in my jug i set off post haste half shave half dress and more than half vex in quest of water like a seaman on short allowance hunting for rivulet on some unknown coast i go up stair and down stair and in the course of my research into half a dozen different apartment might have stumble on some lady 's chamber as the song say which consider the plight i be in would have be awkward enough another indication of this moral coarseness be point out in the passage where capt hall say he never see a flirtation all the time he be in the union the charge of ingratitude also be echo from mouth to mouth that he should himself bear testimony to the unvarying kindness of the reception he meet with and yet find fault with the country be declare on all hand to be a proof of the most abominable ingratitude that it ever enter into the heart of man to conceive i once venture before about a dozen people to ask whether more blame would not attach to a author if he suffer himself to be bribe by individual kindness to falsify fact than if despite all personal consideration he state they truly fact cry the whole circle at once fact i tell you there be not a word of fact in it from begin to end the american review be many of they i believe well know in england i need not therefore quote they here but i sometimes wonder that they none of they ever think of translate obadiah 's curse into classic american if they have do so only place -lrb- he basil hall -rrb- between bracket instead of -lrb- he obadiah -rrb- it would have save they a world of trouble i can hardly describe the curiosity with which i sit down at length to pursue these tremendous volume still less can i do justice to my surprise at they contents to say that i find not one exaggerate statement throughout the work be by no means say enough it be impossible for any one who know the country not to see that captain hall earnestly seek out thing to admire and commend when he praise it be with evident pleasure and when he find fault it be with evident reluctance and restraint excepting where motive purely patriotic urge he to state roundly what it be for the benefit of he country should be know in fact captain hall see the country to the greatest possible advantage furnish of course with letter of introduction to the most distinguished individual and with the still more influential recommendation of he own reputation he be receive in full drawing-room style and state from one end of the union to the other he see the country in full dress and have little or no opportunity of judge of it unhouselled disappointed unannealed with all its imperfection on its head as i and my family too often have captain hall have certainly excellent opportunity of make himself acquaint with the form of the government and the law and of receive moreover the best oral commentary upon they in conversation with the most distinguished citizen of these opportunity he make excellent use nothing important meet he eye which do not receive that sort of analytical attention which a experienced and philosophical traveller alone can give this have make he volume highly interesting and valuable but i be deeply persuade that be a man of equal penetration to visit the united state with no other means of become acquaint with the national character than the ordinary working-day intercourse of life he would conceive a infinitely lower idea of the moral atmosphere of the country than captain hall appear to have do and the internal conviction on my mind be strong that if captain hall have not place a firm restraint on himself he must have give expression to far deeper indignation than any he have utter against many point in the american character with which he show from other circumstance that he be well acquaint he rule appear to have be to state just so much of the truth as would leave on the mind of he reader a correct impression at the least cost of pain to the sensitive folk he be write about he state he own opinion and feeling and leave it to be infer that he have good grounds for adopt they but he spare the american the bitterness which a detail of the circumstance would have produce if any one choose to say that some wicked antipathy to twelve million of stranger be the origin of my opinion i must bear it and be the question one of mere idle speculation i certainly would not court the abuse i must meet for state it but it be not so i know that among the best the most pious the most benevolent of my countryman there be hundred nay i fear thousand who conscientiously believe that a greater degree of political and religious liberty -lrb- such as be possess in america -rrb- would be beneficial for we how often have i wish during my abode in the united state that one of these conscientious but mistaken reasoner fully possess of he country 's confidence could pass a few year in the united state sufficiently among the mass of the citizen to know they and sufficiently at leisure to trace effect to they cause then might we look for a statement which would teach these mistaken philanthropist to tremble at every symptom of democratic power among we a statement which would make even we sectarian shudder at the thought of hew down the establish church for they would be teach by fearful example to know that it be the bulwark which protect we from the gloomy horror of fanatic superstition on one side and the still more dreadful inroad of infidelity on the other and more than all such a man would see as clear as light that where every class be occupy in get money and no class in spend it there will neither be leisure for worship the theory of honesty nor motive strong enough to put its restrictive doctrine in practice where every man be engage in drive hard bargain with he fellow where be the honor class to be find into which gentleman-like feeling principle and practice be necessary as a introduction that there be man of powerful intellect benevolent heart and high moral feeling in america i know : and i could if challenge to do so name individual surpass by none of any country in these quality but they be excellent despite they institution not in consequence of they it be not by such that captain hall 's statement be call slander nor be it from such that i shall meet the abuse which i well know these page will inevitably draw upon I and i only trust i may be able to muster as much self-denial as my predecessor who assert in he recently publish fragment that he have read none of the american criticism on he book he do wisely if he wish to retain a atom of he kindly feel toward america and he have assuredly lose but little on the score of information for these criticism generally speak consist of mere downright personal abuse or querulous complaint of he ingratitude and ill usage of they complaint which it be quite astonishing that any person of spirit could indulge in the follow good-humoured paragraph from the fragment must i think rather puzzle the american possibly they may think that captain hall be quiz they when he say he have read none of they criticism but i think there be in these passage internal evidence that he have not see they for if he have read one-fiftieth part of the vituperation of he travels which it have be my misfortune to peruse he could hardly have bring himself to write what follow if the american still refuse to shake the hand proffer to they in the true old john bull spirit they be worse folk than even i take they for captain hall after describe the hospitable reception he formerly meet with at a boarding-house in new york go on thus : -- if we hostess be still alive i hope she will not repent of have bestow she obliging attention on one who so many year afterwards make himself he fear less popular in she land than he could wish to be amongst a people to whom he owe so much and for whom he really feel so much kindness he still anxiously hope however they will believe he when he declare that have say in he recent publication no more than what he conceive be due to strict truth and to the integrity of history as far as he observation and opinion go he still feel as he always have and ever must continue to feel towards america the heartiest good-will the american be perpetually repeat that the foundation-stone of they liberty be fix on the doctrine that every man be free to form he own opinion and to promulgate they in candor and in moderation be it mean that a foreigner be exclude from these privilege if not may i ask in what respect have i pass these limitation the american have surely no fair right to be offend because my view differ from they 's and yet i be tell i have be rudely handle by the press of that country if my motive be distrust i can only say i be sorely belie if i be mistaken regret at my political blindness be surely more dignified than anger on the part of those with whom i differ and if it shall chance that i be in the right the best confirmation of the correctness of my view in the opinion of indifferent person will perhaps be find in the soreness of those who wince when the truth be speak yet after all few thing would give I more real pleasure than to know that my friend across the water would consent to take I at my word and consider what i have say about they as so much public matter which it truly be agree to reckon I in my absence and they always do when i be amongst they and i be sure they would count I if i go back again as a private friend i differ with they in politics and i differ with they now as much as ever but i sincerely wish they happiness individually and as a nation i shall rejoice if they prosper as the persian write what can i say more and i only hope these few word may help to make my peace with people who justly pride themselves on bear no malice as for myself i have no peace to make for i have studiously avoid read any of the american criticism on my book in order that the kindly feeling i have ever entertain towards that country should not be ruffle by this abstinence i may have lose some information and perhaps miss many opportunity of correct erroneous impression but i set so much store by the please recollection of the journey itself and of the hospitality with which my family be every where receive that whether it be right or whether it be wrong i can not bring myself to read anything which might disturb these agreeable association so let we part in peace or rather let we meet again in cordial communication and if this little work shall find its way across the atlantic i hope it will be read there without reference to anything that have pass between we or at all event with reference only to those part of we former intercourse which be satisfactory to all party -- _ hall 's fragment _ vol1p200 i really think it be impossible to read not only this passage but many other in these delightful little volume without feeling that they author be as little likely to deserve the imputation of harshness and ill-will as any man that ever live in read capt hall 's volume on america the observation which i think strike I the most forcibly and which certainly come the most completely home to my own feeling be the follow in all my travels both amongst heathen and amongst christian i have never encounter any people by whom i find it nearly so difficult to make myself understand as by the american i have converse in london and in pari with foreigner of many nation and often through the misty medium of a idiom imperfectly understand but i remember no instance in which i find the same difficulty in convey my sentiment my impression and my opinion to those around I as i do in america whatever faith may be give to my assertion no one who have not visit the country can possibly conceive to what extent it be true it be less necessary i imagine for the mutual understanding of person converse together that the language should be the same than that they ordinary mode of thinking and habit of life should in some degree assimilate whereas in point of fact there be hardly a single point of sympathy between the american and we but whatever the cause the fact be certainly as i have state it and herein i think rest the only apology for the preposterous and undignified anger feel and express against capt hall 's work they really can not even if they wish it enter into any of he view or comprehend he most ordinary feeling and therefore they can not believe in the sincerity of the impression he describe the candor which he express and evidently feel they mistake for irony or totally distrust he unwillingness to give pain to person from whom he have receive kindness they scornfully reject as affectation and although they must know right well in they own secret heart how infinitely more they lay at he mercy than he have choose to betray they pretend even to themselves that he have exaggerate the bad point of they character and institution whereas the truth be that he have let they off with a degree of tenderness which may be quite suitable for he to exercise however little merit while at the same time he have most industriously magnify they merit whenever he could possibly find anything favourable one can perfectly well understand why capt hall 's avowed tory principle should be disapprove of in the united state especially as -lrb- with a questionable policy in a bookselling point of view in these reform time -rrb- he volunteer a profession of political faith in which to use the kentucky phrase he go the whole hog and bluntly avow in he conclude chapter that he not only hold stoutly to church and state but that he conceive the english house of common to be if not quite perfect at least as much so for all the require purpose of representation as it can by possibility be make in practice such a downright thorough-going tory and anti-reformer pretend to judge of the workings of the american democratical system be naturally hold to be a monstrous abomination and it have be visit accordingly both in america and as i understand with we also the experience which capt hall have acquire in visit to every part of the world during twenty or thirty year go for nothing with the radical on either side the atlantic : on the contrary precisely in proportion to the value of that authority which be the result of actual observation be they irritated to find its weight cast into the opposite scale have not capt hall be convert by what he see in north america from the whig faith he exhibit in he description of south america he book would have be far more popular in england during the last two year of public excitement it may perhaps be long before any justice be do to capt hall 's book in the united state but a less time will probably suffice to establish its claim to attention at home chapter 32 journey to niagara -- hudson -- west point -- hyde park -- albany -- yankee -- trenton fall -- rochester -- genesee fall -- lockport how quickly week glide away in such a city as new york especially when you reckon among you friend some of the most agreeable people in either hemisphere but we have still a long journey before we and one of the wonder of the world be to be see on the 30th of may we set off for niagara i have hear so much of the surpass beauty of the north river that i expect to be disappointed and to find reality flat after description but it be not in the power of man to paint with a strength exceed that of nature in such scene as the hudson present every mile show some new and startling effect of the combination of rock tree and water there be no interval of flat or insipid scenery from the moment you enter upon the river at new york to that of quit it at albany a distance of 180 mile for the first twenty mile the shore of new jersey on the left offer almost a continue wall of trap rock which from its perpendicular form and lineal fissure be call the palisado this wall sometimes rise to the height of a hundred and fifty foot and sometimes sink down to twenty here and there a watercourse break its uniformity and every where the brightest foliage in all the splendor of the climate and the season fringe and chequer the dark barrier on the opposite shore manhatten island with its leafy coronet gemm with villa form a lovely contrast to these rocky height after pass manhatten island the eastern shore gradually assume a wild and rocky character but ever vary wood lawn pasture and tower cliff all meet the eye in quick succession as the giant steam-boat cleave its swift passage up the stream for several mile the voyage be one of great interest independent of its beauty for it pass many point where important event of the revolutionary war take place it be not without a pang that i look on the spot where poor andre be take and another where he be execute several fort generally place in most commanding situation still show by they batter ruin where the struggle be strongest and i feel no lack of that moral interest so entirely want in the new state and without which no journey can i think continue long without weary the spirit about forty mile from new york you enter upon the highland as a series of mountain which then flank the river on both side be call the beauty of this scenery can only be conceive when it be see one might fancy that these capricious mass with all they countless variety of light and shade be throw together to show how pass lovely rock and wood and water could be sometimes a lofty peak shoot suddenly up into the heaven show in bold relief against the sky and then a deep ravine sink in solemn shadow and draw the imagination into its leafy recess for several mile the river appear to form a succession of lake you be often enclose on all side by rock rise directly from the very edge of the stream and then you turn a point the river widen and again wood lawn and village be reflect on its bosom the state prison of sing sing be upon the edge of the water and have no picturesque effect to atone for the painful image it suggest the sleepy hollow of washington irve just above it restore the imagination to a better tone west point the military academy of the united state be fifty mile from new york the scenery around it be magnificent and though the building of the establishment be construct with the handsome and unpicturesque regularity which mark the work of government they be so nobly place and so embosomed in wood that they look beautiful the lengthen note of a french horn which i presume be attend some of they military maneuver sound with deep and solemn sweetness as we pass about thirty mile further be hyde park the magnificent seat of dr hosack here the misty summit of the distant kaatskill begin to form the outline of the landscape it be hardly possible to imagine anything more beautiful than this place we pass a day there with great enjoyment and the follow morning set forward again in one of those grand float hotel call steamboat either on this day or the one before we have two hundred cabin passenger on board and they all sit down together to a table spread abundantly and with considerable elegance a continual succession of gentleman 's seat many of they extremely handsome border the river to albany we arrive there late in the evening but have no difficulty in find excellent accommodation albany be the state capital of new york and have some very handsome public building there be also some curious relic of the old dutch inhabitant the first sixteen mile from albany we travel in a stage to avoid a multitude of lock at the entrance of the erie canal but at scenectedy we get on board one of the canal packet-boat for utica with a very delightful party of one 's own choose fine temperate weather and a strong breeze to chase the mosquito this mode of travel might be very agreeable but i can hardly imagine any motive of convenience powerful enough to induce I again to imprison myself in a canal boat under ordinary circumstance the accommodation be greatly restricted every body from the moment of enter the boat act upon a system of unshrinking egotism the library of a dozen book the backgammon board the tiny berth the shady side of the cabin be all jostle for in a manner to make one greatly envy the power of the snail at the moment i would willingly have give up some of my human dignity for the privilege of creep into a shell of my own to any one who have be accustom in travel to be address with do sit here you will find it more comfortable the you must go there i make for this place first sound very unmusical there be a great quietness about the woman of america -lrb- i speak of the exterior manner of person casually meet -rrb- but somehow or other i should never call it gentleness in such try moment as that of _ fix _ themselves on board a packet-boat the man be prompt determine and will compromise any body 's convenience except they own the woman be doggedly stedfast in they will and till matter be settle look like hedgehog with every quill raise and firmly set as if to forbid the approach of any one who might wish to rub they down in circumstance where a english woman would look proud and a french woman _ nonchalante _ a american lady look grim even the youngest and the prettiest can set they lip and knit they brow and look as hard and unsocial as they grandmother though not in the yankee or new england country we be border upon it sufficiently to meet in the stage and boat many delightful specimen of this most peculiar race i like they extremely well but i would not wish to have any business transaction with they if i could avoid it lest to use they own phrase they should be too smart for I it be by no means rare to meet elsewhere in this working-day world of we 's people who push acuteness to the verge of honesty and sometimes perhaps a little bit beyond but i believe the yankee be the only one who will be find to boast of do so it be by no means easy to give a clear and just idea of a yankee if you hear he character from a virginian you will believe he a devil : if you listen to it from himself you might fancy he a god -- though a tricky one mercury turn righteous and notable matthew do very well as far as i expect i calculate and i guess but this be only the shell there be a immense deal within both of sweet and bitter in acuteness cautiousness industry and perseverance he resemble the scotch in habit of frugal neatness he resemble the dutch in love of lucre he doth greatly resemble the son of abraham but in frank admission and superlative admiration of all he own peculiarity he be like nothing on earth but himself the quaker have be celebrate for the pertinacity with which they avoid give a direct answer but what quaker could ever vie with a yankee in this sort of fencing nothing in fact can equal they skill in evade a question except that with which they set about ask one i be afraid that in repeat a conversation which i overheard on board the erie canal boat i shall spoil it by forget some of the little delicate doubling which delight I -- yet i write it down immediately both party be yankee but stranger to each other one of they have by gentle degree make himself pretty well acquanint with the point from which every one on board have start and that for which he be bind at last attack he brother reynard thus : - well now which way may you be travel i expect this canal run pretty nearly west be you go far with it well now i do not rightly know how many mile it may be i expect you 'll be from new york sure enough i have be at new york often and often i calculate then ` tis not there as you stop business must be mind in stop and in stir you may say that well i look then you 'll be make for the spring folk say as all the world be make for the spring and i except a good sight of they be do you calculate upon stop long when you get to you journey 's end ` tis my business must settle that i expect i guess that be true too but you 'll be for make pleasure a business for once i calculate my business do not often lie in that line then may be it be not the spring as take you this line the spring be a right elegant place i reckon it be you health i calculate as make you break you good rule my health do not trouble I much i guess no why that be well how be the market sir be bread stuff up i a ` nt just capable to say a deal of money 's make by just look after the article at the fountain 's head you may say that do you look to be make great dealings in produce up the country why that i expect be difficult to know i calculate you 'll find the market changeable these time no market be not very often without change why that be right down true what may be you biggest article of produce i calculate generally that be the biggest as i make most by you may say that but what do you chiefly call you most particular branch why that be what i can not justly say and so they go on without advance or give a inch 'till i be weary of listen but i leave they still at it when i step out to resume my station on a trunk at the bow of the boat where i scribble in my note-book this specimen of yankee conversation the erie canal have cut through much solid rock and we often pass between magnificent cliff the little fall of the mohawk form a lovely scene the rock over which the river run be most fantastic in form the fall continue nearly a mile and a beautiful village call the little fall overhang it as many lock occur at this point we quit the boat that we might the better enjoy the scenery which be of the widest description several other passenger do so likewise and i be much amuse by one of we yankee who very civilly accompany we party point out to I the wild state of the country and apologize for it by say that the property all round thereabout have be own by a englishman and you 'll excuse I ma'am but when the english get a spot of wild ground like this here they have no notion about it like we but the englishman have sell it and if you be to see it five year hence you would not know it again i 'll engage there will be by that half a score elegant factory -- ` tis a true shame to let such a privilege of water lie idle we reach utica at twelve o'clock the follow day pretty well fag by the sun by day and a crowded cabin by night lemon-juice and iced-water -lrb- without sugar -rrb- keep we alive but for this delightful recipe feather fan and eau de cologne i think we should have fail altogether the thermometer stand at 90 degree at two we set off in a very pleasant airy carriage for trenton fall a delightful drive of fourteen mile these fall have become within the last few year only second in fame to niagara the west canada creek which in the map show but as a paltry stream have find its way through three mile of rock which at many point be 150 foot high a forest of enormous cedar be on they summit and many of that beautiful species of white cedar which droop its branch like the weeping-willow grow in the cleft of the rock and in some place almost dip they dark foliage in the torrent the rock be of a dark gray limestone and often present a wall of unbroken surface near the hotel a flight of very alarming step lead down to the bed of the stream and on reach it you find yourself enclose in a deep abyss of solid rock with no visible opening but that above you head the torrent dash by with inconceivable rapidity its color be black as night and the dark ledge of rock on which you stand be so treacherously level with it that nothing warn you of danger within the last three year two young people though surround by they friend have step a inch too far and disappear from among they as if by magic never to revisit earth again this broad flat ledge reach but a short distance and then the perpendicular wall appear to stop you farther progress but there be a spirit of defiance in the mind of man he will not be stay either by rock or wave by the aid of gunpowder a sufficient quantity of the rock have be remove to afford a fearful footing round a point which when double disclose a world of cataract all leap forward together in most magnificent confusion i suffer considerably before i reach the spot where this grand scene be visible a chain firmly fasten to the rock serve to hang by as you creep along the giddy verge and this enable I to proceed so far but here the chain fail and my courage with it though the rest of the party continue for some way farther and report largely of still increase sublimity but my knee totter and my head swim so while the rest creep onward i sit down to wait they return on the floor of rock which have receive we on quit the step a hundred and fifty foot of bare black rock on one side a equal height cover with solemn cedar on the other a unfathomed torrent roar between they the fresh remembrance of the ghastly legend belong to the spot and the idea of my child cling to the dizzy path i have leave be altogether sombre enough but i have not sit long before a tremendous burst of thunder shake the air the deep chasm answer from either side again again and again i think the rock i sit upon tremble : but the whole effect be so exceedingly grand that i have no longer leisure to think of fear my child immediately return and we enjoy together the darkening shadow cast over the abyss the rival clamor of the torrent and the storm and that delightful exaltation of the spirit which set danger at defiance a few heavy rain drop alarmed we more than all the terror of the spot or rather they recall we sens and we retreat by the fearful step reach we hotel unwetted and unharmed the next morning we be again early a foot the last night 's storm have refresh the air and renew we strength we now take a different route and instead of descend as before walk through the dark forest along the cliff sufficiently near its edge to catch fearful glimpse of the scene below after some time the patch begin to descend and at length bring we to the shantee commemorate in miss sedgwick 's clarence this be by far the finest point of the fall there be a little balcony in front of the shantee literally hang over the tremendous whirlpool though frail it make one fancy oneself in safety and remind I of the feeling with which i have stand on one side a high gate watch a roar bull on the other the wall of this shantee be literally cover with autograph and i be incline to join the laugh against the egotistical trifling when one of the party discover trollope england amidst the innumerable scrawl the well know character be hail with such delight that i think i shall never again laugh at any one for leave they name where it be possible a friend may find it we return to utica to dinner and find that we must either wait till the next day for the rochester coach or again submit to the packet-boat we impatience induce we to prefer the latter not very wisely i think for every annoyance seem to increase upon we the oneida and the genesee country be both extremely beautiful but have we not return by another route we should have know little about it from the canal nothing be see to advantage and very little be see at all my chief amusement i think be derive from name one town consist of a whiskey store and a warehouse be call port byron at rome the first name i see over a store be remus do infinite honor i think to the classic lore of he godfather and godmother but it would be endless to record all the drollery of this kind which we meet with we arrive at rochester a distance of a hundred and forty mile on the second morning after leave utica fully determine never to enter a canal boat again at least not in america rochester be one of the most famous of the city build on the jack and bean-stalk principle there be many splendid edifice in wood and certainly more house warehouse factory and steam-engine than ever be collect together in the same space of time but i be tell by a fellow-traveller that the stump of the forest be still to be find firmly root in the cellar the fall of the genesee be close to the town and in the course of a few month will perhaps be in the middle of it it be a noble sheet of water of a hundred and sixty foot perpendicular fall but i look at it through the window of a factory and as i do not like that i be obligingly hand to the door-way of a sawing-mill in short the great water privilege have be so ingeniously take advantage of that no point can be find where its voice and its movement be not mixed and confound with those of the admirable machinery of this flourishing city the genesee fall be renown as be the last and fatal leap of the adventurous madman sam patch he have leap it once before and rise to the surface of the river in perfect safety but the last time he be see to falter as he take the leap and be never hear of more it seem that he have some misgiving of he fate for a pet bear which he have always take with he on he former break-neck adventure and which have constantly leap after he without injury he on this occasion leave behind in the care of a friend to whom he bequeath he in case of he not return we see the bear which be keep at the principal hotel he be a noble creature and more completely tame than i ever see any animal of the species we journey now become wilder every step the unbroken forest often skirt the road for mile and the sight of a log-hut be a event yet the road be for the greater part of the day good run along a natural ridge just wide enough for it this ridge be a very singular elevation and by all the enquiry i could make the favorite theory concern it be that it be formerly the boundary of lake ontario near which it pass when this ridge cease the road cease too and for the rest of the way to lockport we be most painfully jumbled and jolt over log and through bog till every joint be nearly dislocate lockport be beyond all comparison the strangest look place i ever behold as fast as half a dozen tree be cut down a _ factory _ be raise up stump still contest the ground with pillar and portico be see to struggle with rock it look as if the demon of machinery have invade the peaceful realm of nature have fix on lockport as the battle-ground on which they should strive for mastery the fiend insist that the stream should go one way though the gentle mother have ever lead they dancing step another nay the very rock must fall before he and take what form he will the battle be lose and win nature be fairly route and drive from the field and the rattle crackling hiss spit demon have take possession of lockport for ever we sleep there dismally enough i never feel more out of humor at what the american call improvement it be in truth as it now stand a most hideous place and gladly do i leave it behind I we next stage be to lewiston for some mile before we reach it we be within sight of the british frontier and we make we salaam the monument of the brave general brock stand on a elevated point near queenstown and be visible at a great distance we breakfast at lewiston but feel every cup of coffee as a sin so impatient be we as we approach the end of we long pilgrimage to reach the shrine which nature seem to have place at such a distance from she worshipper on purpose to try the strength of they devotion a few mile more would bring we to the high altar but first we have to cross the ferry for we be determine upon take we first view from british ground the niagara river be very lovely here the bank be bold rugged and richly color both by rock and wood and the stream itself be bright clear and unspeakably green in cross the ferry a fellow-passenger make many enquiry of the young boatman respect the battle of queenstown he be but a lad and could remember little about it but he be a british lad and he answer smack strongly of he loyal british feeling among other thing the questioner ask if many american citizen have not be throw from the height into the river why yes there be a good many of they but it be right to show they there be water between we and you know it might help to keep the rest of they from come to trouble we on we own ground this phrase we own ground give interest to every mile or i believe i should have shut my eye and try to sleep that i might annihilate what remain of time and space between I and niagara but i be delighted to see british oak and british roof and british boy and girl these latter as if to impress upon we that they be not citizen make bow and courtsey as we pass and this little touch of long unknown civility produce great effect see these dear child mamma do they not look english how i love they be the exclamation it produce chapter 33 niagara -- arrival at forsythe -- first sight of the fall -- goat island -- the rapid -- buffalo -- lake erie -- canandaigna -- stage-coach adventure at length we reach niagara it be the brightest day that June could give and almost any day would have seem bright that bring I to the object which for year i have languish to look upon we do not hear the sound of the fall till very near the hotel which overhang they as you enter the door you see behind the hall a open space surround by gallery one above another and in a instant you feel that from thence the wonder be visible i tremble like a fool and my girl cling to I tremble too i believe but with face beam with delight we encounter a waiter who have a sympathy of some sort with we for he would not let we run through the hall to the first gallery but usher we up stair and another instant place we where at one glance i see all i have wish for hope for dream of it be not for I to attempt a description of niagara i feel i have no power for it after one long stedfast gaze we quit the gallery that we might approach still nearer and in leave the house have the good fortune to meet a english gentleman -lrb- the accomplish author of cyril thornton -rrb- who have be introduce to we at new york he have precede we by a few day and know exactly how and where to lead we if any man living can describe the scene we look upon it be himself and i trust he will do it as for myself i can only say that wonder terror and delight completely overwhelm I i weep with a strange mixture of pleasure and of pain and certainly be for some time too violently affect in the _ physique _ to be capable of much pleasure but when this emotion of the sens subside and i have recover some degree of composure my enjoyment be very great indeed to say that i be not disappointed be but a weak expression to convey the surprise and astonishment which this long dream of scene produce it have to I something beyond its vastness there be a shadowy mystery hang about it which neither the eye nor even the imagination can penetrate but i dare not dwell on this it be a dangerous subject and any attempt to describe the sensation produce must lead direct to nonsense exactly at the fall it be the fall and nothing else you have to look upon there be not as at trenton mighty rock and tower forest there be only the waterfall but it be the fall of a ocean and be pelion pile on os on either side of it we could not look at they the noise be greatly less than i expect one can hear with perfect distinctness everything say in a ordinary tone when quite close to the cataract the cause of this i imagine to be that it do not fall immediately among rock like the far noisier potomac but direct and unbroken save by its own rebound the color of the water before this rebound hide it in foam and mist be of the brightest and most delicate green the violence of the impulse send it far over the precipice before it fall and the effect of the ever vary light through its transparency be i think the loveliest thing i ever look upon we descend to the edge of the gulf which receive the torrent and thence look at the horse-shoe fall in profile it seem like awful daring to stand close beside it and raise one 's eye to its immensity i think the point the most utterly inconceivable to those who have not see it be the center of the horse-shoe the force of the torrent converge there and as the heavy mass pour in twisted wreathe and curl together it give a idea of irresistible power such as no other object ever convey to I the follow anecdote which i have from good authority may give some notion of this mighty power after the last american war three of we ship station on lake erie be declare unfit for service and condemn some of they officer obtain permission to send they over niagara fall the first be tear to shiver by the rapid and go over in fragment the second fill with water before she reach the fall but the third which be in better condition take the leap gallantly and retain she form till it be hide in the cloud of mist below a reward of ten dollar be offer for the largest fragment of wood that should be find from either wreck five for the second and so on one morsel only be ever see and that about a foot in length be mash as by a vice and its edge notch like the tooth of a saw what have become of the immense quantity of wood which have be precipitate what unknown whirlpool have engulph it so that contrary to the very law of nature no vestige of the float material could find its way to the surface beyond the horse-shoe be goat island and beyond goat island the american fall bold straight and chafe to snowy whiteness by the rock which meet it but it do not approach in sublimity or awful beauty to the wondrous crescent on the other shore there the form of the mighty cauldron into which the deluge poor the hundred silvery torrent congregate round its verge the smooth and solemn movement with which it roll its massive volume over the rock the liquid emerald of its long unbroken water the fantastic wreath which spring to meet it and then the shadowy mist that veil the horror of its crash below constitute a scene almost too enormous in its feature for man to look upon angel might tremble as they gaze and i should deem the nerve obtuse rather than strong which do not quail at the first sight of this stupendous cataract minute local particulars can be of no interest to those who have not feel they influence for pleasure or for pain i will not tell of giddy stair which scale the very edge of the torrent nor of beetle slab of table rock break and break on which shudder as you may you must take you stand or lose you reputation as a tourist all these feat be perform again and again even on the first day of we arrival and most earthly weary be i when the day be do though i would not lose the remembrance of it to purchase the addition of many soft and silken one to my existence by four o'clock the next morning i be again at the little shantee close to the horse-shoe fall which seem rear in water rather than in air and take a early shower-bath of spray much be conceal at this early hour by the heavy vapor but there be a charm in the very obscurity and every moment as the light increase cloud after cloud roll off till the vast wonder be again before I it be in the afternoon that the rainbow be visible from the british side and it be a lovely feature in the mighty landscape the gay arch spring from fall to fall a fairy bridge after breakfast we cross to the american side and explore goat island the passage across the niagara directly in face of the fall be one of the most delightful little voyage imaginable the boat cross marvellously near they and within reach of a light shower of spray real safety and apparent danger have each they share in the pleasure feel the river be here two hundred foot deep the passage up the rock bring you close upon the american cataract it be a vast sheet and have all the sublimity that height and width and uproar can give but it have none of the magic of its rival about it goat island have at all point a fine view of the rapid the furious velocity with which they rush onward to the abyss be terrific and the throw a bridge across they be a work of noble daring below the fall the river run between lofty rock crown with unbroken forest this scene form a striking contrast to the level shore above the cataract it appear as if the level of the river have be break up by some volcanic force the niagara flow out of lake erie a broad deep river but for several mile its course be tranquil and its shore perfectly level by degree its bed begin to sink and the glassy smoothness be disturb by a slight ripple the inverted tree that before lay so softly still upon its bosom become twisted and tortured till they lose they form and seem madly to mix in the tumult that destroy they the current become more rapid at every step till rock after rock have chafe the stream to fury make the green one white this last for a mile and then down sink the rock at once one hundred and fifty foot and the enormous flood fall after they god say let there be a cataract and it be so when the river have reach its new level the precipice on either side show a terrific chasm of solid rock some beautiful plant be cling to its side and oak ash and cedar in many place clothe they terror with rich foliage this violent transition from level shore to a deep ravine seem to indicate some great convulsion as its cause and when i hear of a burning spring close by i fancy the volcanic power still at work and that the wonder of the region might yet increase we pass four delightful day of excitement and fatigue we drench ourselves in spray we cut we foot on the rock we blister we face in the sun we look up the cataract and down the cataract we perch ourselves on every pinnacle we could find we dip we finger in the flood at a few yard ' distance from its thundering fall in short we strive to fill as many niche of memory with niagara as possible and i think the image will be within the power of recall for ever we meet many group of tourist in we walk chiefly american but they be or we fancy they be but little observant of the wonder around they one day we be seat on a point of the cliff near the ferry which command a view of both the fall this by the way be consider as the finest general view of the scene one of we party be employ in attempt to sketch what however i believe it be impossible for any pencil to convey a idea of to those who have not see it we have borrow two or three chair from a neighbouring cottage and amongst we have gather a quantity of bough which with the aid of shawl and parasol we have contrived to weave into a shelter from the midday sun so that altogether i have no doubt we look very cool and comfortable a large party who have cross from the american side wound up the steep ascent from the place where the boat have leave they in do so they back be turn to the cataract and as they approach the summit we party be the principal object before they they all stand perfectly still to look at we this first examination be perform at the distance of about a dozen yard from the spot we occupy and last about five minute by which time they have recover breath and acquire courage they then advance in a body and one or two of they begin to examine -lrb- wrong side upward -rrb- the work of the sketcher in do which they stand precisely between he and he object but of this i think it be very probable they be not aware some among they next begin to question we as to how long we have be at the fall whether there be much company if we be not from the old country and the like in return we learn that they be just arrive yet not one of they -lrb- there be eight -rrb- ever turn the head even for a moment to look at the most stupendous spectacle that nature have to show the company at the hotel change almost every day many party arrive in the morning walk to the fall return to the hotel to dinner and depart by the coach immediately after it many group be indescribably whimsical both in appearance and manner now and then a first-rate dandy shot in among we like a fall star on one occasion when we be in the beautiful gallery at the back of the hotel which overlook the horse-shoe fall we see the boot leg of one of this graceful race protrude from the window which command the view while he person be throw back in he chair and he head envelop in a cloud of tobacco smoke i have repeatedly remark when it have happen to I to meet any ultra fine man among the wilder and more impose scene of we own land that they throw off in a great degree they air and they townliness as some one cleverly call these _ simagree _ as if ashamed to play they fantastic trick before the god of nature when so forcibly remind of he presence and more than once on these occasion i have be surprise to find how much intellect lurk behind the inane mask of fashion but in america the effect of fine scenery upon this class of person be different for it be exactly when amongst it that the most strenuous effort at elegant _ nonchalance _ be perceptible among the young exquisite of the western world it be true that they have little leisure for the display of grace in the daily routine of commercial activity in which they life be pass and this certainly offer a satisfactory explanation of the fact above state fortunately for we enjoyment the solemn character of the scene be but little broken in upon by these gentry every one who come to forsythe 's hotel -lrb- except mr bogle corbet -rrb- walk to the shantee write they name in a book which be keep there and for the most part descend by the spiral staircase which lead from the little platform before it to the rock below here they find another shantee but a few yard from the entrance of that wondrous cavern which be form by the fall flood on one side and by the mighty rock over which it pour on the other to this frail shelter from the wild uproar and the blinding spray nearly all the tour gentleman and even many of the pretty lady find they way but here i often see they noble daring fail and have watch they drip and draggle turn again to the shelter stair leave we in full possession of the awful scene we so dearly love to gaze upon how utterly futile must every attempt be to describe the spot how vain every effort to convey a idea of the sensation it produce why be it so exquisite a pleasure to stand for hour drench in spray stun by the ceaseless roar tremble from the concussion that shake the very rock you cling to and breathing painfully in the moist atmosphere that seem to have less of air than water in it yet pleasure it be and i almost think the greatest i ever enjoy we more than once approach the entrance to this appalling cavern but i never fairly enter it though two or three of my party do i lose my breath entirely and the pain at my chest be so severe that not all my curiosity could enable I to endure it what be that cavern of the wind of which we hear of old compare to this a mightier spirit than aeolus reign here nor be this spot of dread and danger the only one in which we find ourselves alone the path take by the company to the shantee which contain the book of name be always the same this wound down the steep bank from the gate of the hotel garden and be render tolerably easy by its repeat doubling but it be by no mean the best calculate to manage to advantage the pleasure of the stranger in he approach to the spot all other however seem leave for we alone during we stay we see the commencement of another staircase intend to rival in attraction that at present in use it be but a few yard from it and can in no way i think contribute to the convenience of the descent the erection of the central shaft of this spiral stair be a most tremendous operation and make I sick and giddy as i watch it after it have be make fast at the bottom the carpenter swing themselves off the rock by the means of rope to the beam which traverse it and as they sit across they in the midst of the spray and the uproar i think i have never see life perile so wantonly but the work proceed without accident and be nearly finish before we leave the hotel it be a sort of pang to take what we know must be we last look at niagara but we have to do it as the american say and leave it on the 10th June for buffalo the drive along the river above the fall be as beautiful as a clear stream of a mile in width can make it and the road continue close to it till you reach the ferry at black rock we welcome almost with a shout the british color which we see for the first time on commodore barrie 's pretty sloop the _ bull dog _ which we pass as it be tow up the river to lake erie the commodore be about to make a tour of the lake at black rock we cross again into the united state and a few mile of horrible jolting bring we to buffalo of all the thousand and one town i saw in america i think buffalo be the queerest look it be not quite so wild as lockport but all the building have the appearance of have be run up in a hurry though every thing have a air of great pretension there be portico column dome and colonnade but all in wood every body tell you there as in all they other new-born town and every body believe that they improvement and they progression be more rapid more wonderful than the earth ever before witness while to I the only wonder be how so many thousand nay million of person can be find in the nineteenth century who can be content so to live surely this country may be say to spread rather than to rise the eagle hotel a immense wooden fabric have all the pretension of a splendid establishment but its monstrous corridor low ceiling and intricate chamber give I the feeling of a catacomb rather than a house we arrive after the _ table d'hote _ tea-drinking be over and sup comfortably enough with a gentleman who accompany we from the fall : but the next morning we breakfast in a long low narrow room with a hundred person and any thing less like comfort can hardly be imagine what can induce so many intellectual citizen to prefer these long silent table scantily cover with morsel of fried ham salt fish and liver to a comfortable loaf of bread with they wife and child at home how greatly should i prefer eat my daily meal with my family in a indian wig-wam to board at a _ table d'hote _ in these capacious hotel the custom however seem universal through the country at least we have meet it without a shadow of variation as to its general feature from new orlean to buffalo lake erie have no beauty to my eye it be not the sea and it be not the river nor have it the beautiful scenery generally find round smaller lake the only interest its unmeaning expanse give I arise from remember that its water there so tame and tranquil be destine to leap the gulf of niagara a dreadful road through forest only begin to be fell bring we to avon it be a straggle ugly little place and not any of they rome carthage ithaca or athen ever provoke I by they name so much this avon flow sweetly with nothing but whiskey and tobacco juice the next day 's journey be much more interesting for it show we the lake of canandaigua it be about eighteen mile long but narrow enough to bring the opposite shore clothe with rich foliage near to the eye the back-ground be a ridge of mountain perhaps the state of the atmosphere lend a unusual charm to the scene one of those sudden thunderstorm so rapid in approach and so sombre in color that they change the whole aspect of thing in a moment rise over the mountain and pass across the lake while we look upon it another feature in the scene give a living but most sad interest to it a glare wooden hotel as fine as paint and portico can make it overhang the lake beside it stand a shed for cattle to this shed and close by the white man 's mushroom palace two indian have creep to seek a shelter from the storm the one be a aged man whose venerable head in attitude and expression indicate the profoundest melancholy : the other be a youth and in he deep-set eye there be a quiet sadness more touch still there they stand the native rightful lord of the fair land look out upon the lovely lake which yet bear the name they father have give it watch the threatening storm that brood there a more fearful one have already burst over they though i have mention the lake first the little town of canandaigua precede it in return from the west it be as pretty a village as ever man contrived to build every house be surround by a ample garden and at that flowery season they be half bury in rose it be true these house be of wood but they be so neatly paint in such perfect repair and show so well within they leafy set that it be impossible not to admire they forty-six mile farther be geneva beautifully situate on seneca lake this too be a lovely sheet of water and i think the town may rival its european namesake in beauty we sleep at auburn celebrate for its prison where the highly-approved system of american discipline originate in this part of the country there be no want of church every little village have its wooden temple and many of they too that the methodist and presbyterian may not clash we pass through a indian reserve and the untouched forest again hang close upon the road repeat group of indian pass we and we remark that they be much cleaner and better dress than those we have meet wander far from they home the blanket which they use so gracefully as mantle be as white as snow we take advantage of the loss of a horse 's shoe to leave the coach and approach a large party of they consist of man woman and child who be regale themselves with i know not what but milk make a part of the repast they could not talk to we but they receive we with smile and seem to understand when we ask if they have mocassin to sell for they shake they sable lock and answer no a beautiful grove of butternut tree be point out to we as the spot where the chief of the six nation use to hold they senate we informer tell I that he have be present at several of they meeting and though he know but little of they language the power of they eloquence be evident from the great effect it produce among themselves towards the end of this day we encounter a adventure which revive we doubt whether the invade white man in chase the poor indian from they forest have do much towards civilize the land for myself i almost prefer the indigenous manner to the exotic the coach stop to take in a lady at vernon she enter and completely fill the last vacant inch of we vehicle for we be eight before but no sooner be she seat than she _ beau _ come forward with a most enormous wooden best-bonnet box he pause for a while to meditate the possibility -- raise it as if to place it on we lap -- sink it as if to put it beneath we foot both alike appear impossible when in true yankee style he address one of we party with if you 'll just step out a minute i guess i 'll find room for it perhaps so but how shall i find room for myself afterwards this be utter in european accent and in a instant half a dozen whiskey drinker step from before the whiskey store and take the part of the _ beau _ that be because you 'll be english traveller i expect but we have travel in better country than europe -- we have travel in america -- and the box will go i calculate we remonstrate on the evident injustice of the proceeding and i venture to say that as we have none of we any luggage in the carriage because the space be so very small i think a chance passenger could have no right so greatly to incommode we right -- there they go -- that be just they way -- that will do in europe may be it sound just like english tyranny now do not it but it will not do here and thereupon he begin thrust in the wooden box against we leg with all he strength no law sir can permit such conduct as this law exclaim a gentleman very particularly drunk we make we own law and govern we own self law echo another gentleman of vernon this be a free country _ we have no law here _ and we do not want no foreign power to tyrannize over we 295 i give the word exactly it be however but fair to state that the party have evidently be drink more than a usual portion of whiskey but perhaps in whiskey as in wine truth may come to light at any rate the people of the western paradise follow the gentile in this that they be a law unto themselves during the contest the coachman sit upon the box without say a word but seem greatly to enjoy the joke the question of the box however be finally decide in we favor by the nature of the human material which can not be compress beyond a certain degree for the great part of this day we have the good fortune to have a gentleman and he daughter for we fellow-traveller who be extremely intelligent and agreeable but i nearly get myself into a scrape by venture to remark upon a phrase use by the gentleman and which have meet I at every corner from the time i first enter the country we have be talk of picture and i have endeavor to adhere to the rule i have lay down for myself of say very little where i could say nothing agreeable at length he name a american artist with whose work i be very familiar and after have declare he equal to lawrence -lrb- judge by he portrait of west now at new york -rrb- he add and what be more madam he be perfectly _ self-taught _ i prudently take a few moment before i answer for the equal we immortal lawrence to a most vile dauber stick in my throat i could not say aman so for some time i say nothing but at last i remark on the frequency with which i have hear this phrase of _ self-taught _ use not as a apology but as positive praise well madam can there be a higher praise certainly not if speak of the individual merit of a person without the means of instruction but i do not understand it when apply as praise to he work not understand it madam be it not attribute genius to the author and what be teach compare to that 296 i do not wish to repeat all my own _ bon mots _ in praise of study and on the disadvantage of profound ignorance but i would willingly if i could give a idea of the mixed indignation and contempt express by we companion at the idea that study be necessary to the formation of taste and to the development of genius at last however he close the discussion thus -- there be no use in dispute a point that be already settle madam the best judge declare that mr h -- g 's portrait be equal to that of lawrence who be it who have pass this judgement sir the man of taste of america madam i then ask he if he think it be go to rain the stage do not appear to have any regular station at which to stop for breakfast dinner and supper these necessary interlude therefore be generally _ impromptu _ be abominably bad we be amuse by the patient manner in which we american fellow-traveller eat whatever be set before they without utter a word of complaint or make any effort to improve it but no sooner reseat in the stage than they begin they complaint -- twa a shame -- twa a robbery -- twa poisoning folk -- and the like i at last ask the reason of this and why they do not remonstrate because madam no american gentleman or lady that keep a inn will not bear to be find fault with we reach utica very late and very weary but the delight of a good hotel and perfect civility send we in good humor to bed and we arise sufficiently refresh to enjoy a day 's journey through some of the loveliest scenery in the world who be it that say america be not picturesque i forget but surely he never travel from utica to albany i really can not conceive that any country can furnish a drive of ninety-six mile more beautiful or more varied in its beauty the road follow the mohawk river which flow through scene change from field wave with plenty to rock and wood gentle slope cover with cattle be divide from each other by precipice 500 foot high around the little fall there be a character of beauty as singular as it be striking here as i observe of many other american river the stream appear to run in a much narrower channel than it once occupy and the space which it seem formerly to have fill be now cover with bright green herbage save that at interval large mass of rock rise abruptly from the level turf these be crown with all such tree as love the scanty diet which a rock afford dwarf oak cedar and the mountain ash be group in a hundred different way among they each clump you look upon be lovelier than its neighbor i never see so sweetly wild a spot i be surprise to hear a fellow-traveller say as we pass a point of peculiar beauty all this neighborhood belong or do belong to mr edward ellice a english member of parliament but he have sell a deal of it and now madam you may see as it begin to improve and he point to a great wooden edifice where on the white paint cash for rag in letter three foot high might be see i then remember that it be near this spot that my yankee friend have make he complaint against english indifference to water privilege he do not name mr edward ellice but doubtless he be the english as never think of improvement i have often confess my conscious incapacity for description but i must repeat it here to apologize for my pass so dully through this matchless valley of the mohawk i would that some british artist strong in youthful daring would take my word for it and pass over for a summer pilgrimage through the state of new york in very earnest he would wisely for i question if the world could furnish within the same space and with equal facility of access so many subject for he pencil mountain forest rock lake river cataract all in perfection but he must be bold as a lion in color or he will make nothing of it there be a clearness of atmosphere a strength of _ chiaro oscuro _ a massiveness in the foliage and a brilliance of contrast that must make a colourist of any one who have a eye he must have courage to dip he pencil in shadow black as night and light that might blind a eagle as i presume my young artist to be a enthusiast he must first go direct to niagara or even in the mohawk valley he pinioned wing may droop if he fever run very high he may slake he thirst at trenton and while there he will not dream of any thing beyond it should my advice be take i will ask the young adventurer on he return -lrb- when he shall have make a prodigious quantity of money by my hint -rrb- to reward I by two sketch one shall be the lake of canandaigua the other the indian ' senate grove of butternut during we journey i forget on which day of it a particular spot in the forest at some distance from the road be point out to we as the scene of a true but very romantic story during the great and the terrible french revolution -lrb- 1792 -rrb- a young nobleman escape from the scene of horror have with difficulty save he head and without the possibility of save any thing else he arrive at new york nearly destitute and after pass he life not only in splendor but in the splendor of the court of france he find himself jostle by the busy population of the new world without a dollar between he and starvation in such a situation one might almost sigh for the guillotine the young noble strove to labor but who would purchase the tremble effort of he white hand while the sturdy strength of many a black hercule be in the market he abandon the vain attempt to sustain himself by the aid of he fellow-men and determine to seek a refuge in the forest a few shilling only remain to he he purchase a axe and reach the oneida territory he fell a few of the slenderest tree and make himself a shelter that robinson crusoe would have laugh at for it do not keep out the rain want of food exposure to the weather and unwonted toil produce the natural result the unfortunate young man fall sick and stretch upon the reek earth stifle rather than sheltered by the withering bough which hang over he he lay parch with thirst and shiver in ague with the one last earthly hope that each heavy moment would prove the last near to the spot which he have choose for he miserable rest but totally conceal from it by the thick forest be the last straggling wigwam of a indian village it be not know how many day the unhappy man have lie without food but he be quite insensible when a young squaw whom chance have bring from this wigwam to he hut enter and find he alive but totally insensible the heart of woman be i believe pretty much the same every where the young girl pause not to think whether he be white or red but she fleet foot rest not till she have bring milk rum and blanket and when the sufferer recover he sens he head be support on she lap while with the gentle tenderness of a mother she find mean to make he swallow the restorative she have bring no black eye in the world be they of france italy or even of spain can speak more plainly of kindness than the large deep-set orb of a squaw this be a language that all nation can understand and the poor frenchman read most clearly in the anxious glance of he gentle nurse that he should not die forsake so far the story be romantic enough and what follow be hardly less so the squaw find means to introduce she white friend to she tribe he be adopt as they brother speedily acquire they language and assume they dress and manner of life he gratitude to he preserver soon ripen into love and if the chronicle speak true the french noble and the american savage be more than pass happy as man and wife and it be not till he see himself the father of many thriving child that the exile begin to feel a wish of rise again from savage to civilized existence my historian do not explain what he project be in visit new york but he do so in the habit of a indian and learn enough of the restore tranquillity of he country to give he hope that some of the broad land he have leave there might be restore to he i have make my story already too long and must not linger upon it farther than to say that he hope be fulfil and that of a large and flourishing family some be settle in france and some remain in america -lrb- one of these i understand be a lawyer at new york -rrb- while the hero and the heroine of the tale continue to inhabit the oneida country not in a wigwam however but in a good house in a beautiful situation with all the comfort of civilized life around they such be the narrative we listen to from a stage coach companion and it appear to I sufficiently interesting to repeat though i have no better authority to quote for its truth than the assertion of this unknown traveller chapter 34 return to new york -- conclusion the comfortable adelphi hotel again receive we at albany on the 14th of June and we decide upon pass the follow day there both to see the place and to recruit we strength which we begin to feel we have tax severely by a very fatiguing journey in most oppressively hot weather it would have be difficult to find a better station for repose the room be large and airy and ice be furnish in most profuse abundance but notwithstanding the manifold advantage of this excellent hotel i be surprise at the un-english arrangement communicate to I by two lady with whom we make a speaking acquaintance by which it appear that they make it they permanent home these lady be a mother and daughter the daughter be a extremely pretty young married woman with two little child where the husband be or whether they be dead or alive i know not but they tell I they have be _ board _ there above a year they breakfast dine and sup at the _ table d'hote _ with from twenty to a hundred people as accident might decide dress very smart play on the piano in the public sitting-room and assure I they be particularly comfortable and well accommodate what a life some part of the town be very handsome the town hall the chamber of representative and some other public building stand well on a hill that overlook the hudson with ample enclosure of grass and tree around they many of the shop be large and showily set out i be amuse by a national trait which meet I at one of they i enter it to purchase some _ eau de cologne _ but find what be offer to I extremely bad and very cheap i ask if they have none at a higher price and better you be a stranger i guess be the answer the yankee want low price that be all they do not stand so much for goodness as the english nothing could be more beautiful than we passage down the hudson on the follow day as i thought of some of my friend in england dear lover of the picturesque i could not but exclaim que je vous plain que je vous plain vous ne la verrez pas not even a move panoramic view glide before they eye for a hour together in all the scenic splendor of drury lane or covent garden could give they a idea of it they could only see one side at a time the change the contrast the ceaseless variety of beauty as you skim from side to side the liquid smoothness of the broad mirror that reflect the scene and most of all the clear bright air through which you look at it all this can only be see and believe by cross the atlantic as we approach new york the burning heat of the day relax and the long shadow of evening fall coolly on the beautiful villa we pass i really can conceive nothing more exquisitely lovely than this approach to the city the magnificent boldness of the jersey shore on the one side and the luxurious softness of the shady lawn on the other with the vast silvery stream that flow between they altogether form a picture which may well excuse a traveller for say once and again that the hudson river can be surpass in beauty by none on the outside of paradise it be nearly dark when we reach the city and it be with great satisfaction that we find we comfortable apartment in hudson street unoccupied and we pretty kind -lrb- irish -rrb- hostess willing to receive we again we pass another fortnight there and again we enjoy the elegant hospitality of new york though now it be offer from beneath the shade of they beautiful villa in truth be all america like this fair city and all no only a small proportion of its population like the friend we leave there i should say that the land be the fairest in the world but the time be come to bid it adieu the important business of secure we homeward passage be to be perform one must know what it be to cross the ocean before the immense importance of all the little detail of accommodation can be understand the anxious first look : into the face of the captain to ascertain if he be gentle or rough another scarcely less important in that of the steward generally a sable one but not the less expressive the accurate but rapid glance of measurement throw round the little state-rooms another at the good or bad arrangement of the stair-case by which you be to stumble up and stumble down from cabin to deck and from deck to cabin all this they only can understand who have feel it at length however this interesting affair be settle and most happily the appearance promise well and the performance better it we hasten to pack up we trumpery as captain mirven unkindly call the paraphernalia of the lady and among the rest my six hundred page of griffonage there be enough of it yet i must add a few more line i suspect that what i have write will make it evident that i do not like america now as it happen that i meet with individual there whom i love and admire far beyond the love and admiration of ordinary acquaintance and as i declare the country to be fair to the eye and most richly teem with the gift of plenty i be lead to ask myself why it be that i do not like it i would willingly know myself and confess to other why it be that neither its beauty nor its abundance can suffice to neutralize or greatly soften the distaste which the aggregate of my recollection have leave upon my mind i remember hear it say many year ago when the advantage and disadvantage of a particular residence be be discuss that it be the who and not the where that make the difference between the pleasant or unpleasant residence the truth of the observation strike I forcibly when i hear it and it have be recall to my mind since by the constantly recur evidence of its justness in apply this to america i speak not of my friend nor of my friend ' friend the small patrician band be a race apart they live with each other and for each other mix wondrously little with the high matter of state which they seem to leave rather supinely to they tailor and tinker and be no more to be take as a sample of the american people than the head of lord byron as a sample of the head of the british peerage i speak not of these but of the population generally as see in town and country among the rich and the poor in the slave state and the free state i do not like they i do not like they principle i do not like they manners i do not like they opinion both as a woman and as a stranger it might be unseemly for I to say that i do not like they government and therefore i will not say so that it be one which please themselves be most certain and this be considerably more important than please all the travel old lady in the world i enter the country at new orlean remain for more than two year west of the alleghany and pass another year among the atlantic city and the country around they i converse during this time with citizen of all order and degree and i never hear from any one a single disparage word against they government it be not therefore surprising that when the people of that country hear stranger question the wisdom of they institution and express disapprobation at some of they effect they should set it down either to a incapacity of judge or a malicious feeling of envy and ill-will how can any one in they sens doubt the excellence of a a government which we have try for half a century and love the better the longer we have know it such be the natural enquiry of every american when the excellence of they government be doubt and i be incline to answer that no one in they sens who have visit the country and know the people can doubt its fitness for they such as they now be or its utter unfitness for any other people whether the government have make the people what they be or whether the people have make the government what it be to suit themselves i know not but if the latter they have show a consummation of wisdom which the assemble world may look upon and admire it be a matter of historical notoriety that the original stock of the white population now inhabit the united state be person who have banish themselves or be banish from the mother country the land they find be favourable to they increase and prosperity the colony grow and flourish year roll on and the child the grand-child and the great grand-child of the first settler replenish the land and find it flow with milk and honey that they should wish to keep this milk and honey to themselves be not very surprising what do the mother country do for they she send they out gay and gallant officer to guard they frontier the which they think they could guard as well themselves and then she tax they tea now this be disagreeable and to atone for it the distant colony have no great share in she mother 's grace and glory it be not from among they that she high and mighty be choose the ray which emanate from that bright sun of honor the british throne reach they but feebly they know not they care not for she king nor she hero they thriftiest trader be they noblest man the holy seat of learning be but the cradle of superstition the splendor of the aristocracy but a leech that draw they golden blood the wealth the learn the glory of britain be to they nothing the have they own way every thing can any blame they wish to obtain it can any lament that they succeed and now the day be they own what should they do next they elder draw together and say let we make a government that shall suit we all let it be rude and rough and noisy let it not affect either dignity glory or splendor let it interfere with no man 's will nor meddle with any man 's business let we have neither tithe nor tax game law nor poor law let every man have a hand in make the law and no man be trouble about keep they let not we magistrate wear purple nor we judge ermine if a man grow rich let we take care that he grandson be poor and then we shall all keep equal let every man take care of himself and if england should come to bother we again why then we will fight altogether could any thing be better imagine than such a government for a people so circumstanced or be it strange that they be contented with it still less be it strange that those who have live in the repose of order and feel secure that they country could go on very well and its business proceed without they bawling and squalling scratch and scramble to help it should bless the god that they be not republican so far all be well that they should prefer a constitution which suit they so admirably to one which would not suit they at all be surely no cause of quarrel on we part nor should it be such on theirs if we feel no inclination to exchange the institution which have make we what we be for any other on the face of the earth but when a native of europe visit america a most extraordinary species of tyranny be set in action against he and as far as my reading and experience have enable I to judge it be such as no other country have ever exercise against stranger the frenchman visit england he be _ abime d'ennuus _ at we stately dinner shrug he shoulder at we _ corps de ballet _ and laugh _ a gorge deployee _ at we passion for drive and we partial affection for roast beef and plum pudding the englishman return the visit and the first thing he do on arrive at paris be to hasten to _ le theater des varietes _ that he may see _ les anglaises pour rire _ and if among the crowd of laughter you hear a note of more cordial mirth than the rest seek out the person from whom it proceed and you will find the englishman the italian come to we green island and groan at we climate he vow that the air which destroy a statue can not be wholesome for man he sigh for orange tree and maccaronus and smile at the pretension of a nation to poetry while no epic be chaunt through she street yet we welcome the sensitive southern with all kindness listen to he complaint with interest cultivate we little orange tree and teach we child to lisp tasso in the hope of become more agreeable yet we be not at all superior to the rest of europe in we endurance of censure nor be this wish to profit by it all peculiar to the english we laugh at and find fault with we neighbor quite as freely as they do with we and they join the laugh and adopt we fashion and we custom these mutual pleasantry produce no shadow of unkindly feeling and as long as the government be at peace with each other the individual of every nation in europe make it a matter of pride as well as of pleasure to meet each other frequently to discuss compare and reason upon they national variety and to vote it a mark of fashion and good taste to imitate each other in all the external embellishment of life the consequence of this be most pleasantly perceptible at the present time in every capital of europe the long peace have give time for each to catch from each what be best in custom and manners and the rapid advance of refinement and general information have be the result to those who have be accustom to this state of thing the contrast upon cross to the new world be inconceivably annoying and it can not be doubt that this be one great cause of the general feeling of irksomeness and fatigue of spirit which hang upon the memory while recall the hour pass in american society a single word indicative of doubt that any thing or every thing in that country be not the very best in the world produce a effect which must be see and feel to be understand if the citizen of the united state be indeed the devoted patriot they call themselves they would surely not thus encrust themselves in the hard dry stubborn persuasion that they be the first and best of the human race that nothing be to be learn but what they be able to teach and that nothing be worth have which they do not possess the art of man could hardly discover a more effectual antidote to improvement than this persuasion and yet i never listen to any public oration or read any work professedly address to the country in which they do not labor to impress it on the mind of the people to hint to the generality of american that the silent current of event may change they beloved government be not the way to please they but in truth they need be torment with no such fear as long as by common consent they can keep down the pre-eminence which nature have assign to great power as long as they can prevent human respect and human honor from rest upon high talent gracious manners and exalted station so long may they be sure of go on as they be i have be tell however that there be some among they who would gladly see a change some who with the wisdom of philosopher and the fair candor of gentleman shrink from a profession of equality which they feel to be untrue and believe to be impossible i can well believe that such there be though to I no such opinion be communicate and most truly should i rejoice to see power pass into such hand if this ever happen if refinement once creep in among they if they once learn to cling to the grace the honor the chivalry of life then we shall say farewell to american equality and welcome to european fellowship one of the finest country on the earth the end end of the project gutenberg ebook of domestic manners of the american by fanny trollope
